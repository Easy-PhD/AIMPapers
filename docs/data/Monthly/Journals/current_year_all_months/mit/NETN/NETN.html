  abstract     = {Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major cause of disability leading to multiple sequelae in cognitive, sensory, and physical domains, including posttraumatic epilepsy. Despite extensive research, our understanding of its impact on macroscopic brain circuitry remains incomplete. We analyzed electrophysiological functional connectomes in the gamma band from an animal model of blast-induced TBI over multiple time points after injury. We revealed differences in small-world propensity and rich-club structure compared with age-matched controls, indicating functional reorganization following injury. We further investigated cost-efficiency trade-offs, propose a computationally efficient normalization procedure for quantifying the cost of spatially embedded networks that controls for connectivity strength differences, and observed dynamic changes across the injury timeline. To explore potential links between altered network topology and epileptic activity, we employed a brain-wide computational model of seizure dynamics and attribute brain reorganization to a homeostatic mechanism of activity regulation with the potential unintended consequence of driving generalized seizures. Finally, we demonstrated post-injury hyperexcitability that manifests as an increase in sound-evoked response amplitudes at the cortical level. Our work characterizes, for the first time, gamma-band functional network reorganization in a model of brain injury and proposes potential causes of these changes, thus identifying targets for future therapeutic interventions. Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a prevalent neurological disorder caused by factors such as accidents, contact sports, or military conflict. While animal studies have provided detailed insights into the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying TBI, and clinical research has revealed its effects on large-scale brain network organization, these findings often lack integration. Our research seeks to address this gap by examining large-scale brain activity in an animal model of TBI. By analyzing brain network structures, we identify reorganization, highlighting novel connections to weight gain and posttraumatic epilepsy. Further exploration using this model may deepen our understanding of cross-scale mechanisms and inform the development of therapeutic interventions.},

  abstract     = {Neuroendocrinology has received little attention in human neuroscience research, resulting in a dearth of knowledge surrounding potent and dynamic modulators of cognition and behavior, as well as brain structure and function. This work addresses one such phenomenon by studying functional connectomics related to ovarian hormone fluctuations throughout the adult menstrual cycle. To do so, we used fMRI and hormone assessments from two dense, longitudinal datasets to assess variations in functional connectivity with respect to endogenous and exogenous endocrine factors throughout the menstrual cycle. First, we replicated prior findings that common, group-level, and individual-specific factors have similar relative contributions to functional brain network organization. Second, we found widespread connectivity related to hormonal contraceptive (HC) use, in addition to sparser estradiol- and progesterone-related connectivity. Differential generalizability of these connectivity patterns suggests progestin-specific impacts on functional brain organization in HC users. These results provide novel insight into within-individual changes in brain organization across the menstrual cycle and the extent to which these changes are shared between individuals, illuminating understudied phenomena in reproductive health and important information for all neuroimaging studies that include participants who menstruate. Endocrine modulation of brain function across the menstrual cycle is poorly understood. Human neuroimaging research on the menstrual cycle has long relied on group differences and/or coarse, within-individual cycle stage differences, overlooking considerable individual differences in brain organization, the menstrual cycle, and hormone concentrations. Here, we take a multidataset approach to identify the idiosyncratic contraceptive- and hormone-related functional connectivity from within-individual neuroendocrine dynamics and then test the generalizability of this connectivity to other individuals. In doing so, we identified idiosyncratic hormone-responsive functional connectivity that is somewhat generalizable to other individuals, although this generalizability is complicated by hormonal contraceptive use, potentially reflecting differential connectivity between contraceptive formulations. Thus, this work illuminates individual similarities and differences in neuroendocrine dynamics across the menstrual cycle.},

  abstract     = {Functional MRI (fMRI) and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) help explore correlations between structural connectivity (SC) and functional connectivity (FC; SC–FC coupling). Studies on mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer’s disease (AD) observed coupling disruptions, co-occurring with cognitive decline. Advanced “fixel-based” analyses improved DWI’s accuracy in assessing microstructural and macrostructural features of white matter (WM), but previous aging coupling studies commonly defined SC via tensor-based tractography and streamline counts, thereby missing fiber-specific information. We investigated different types of fixel-FC coupling and their relation to cognition in 392 participants (Age mean = 73; 207 females) from the ADNI. Two hundred twenty-five controls, 142 MCI, and 25 AD with diffusion-weighted and resting-state fMRI scans were analyzed. Structural connectomes were constructed using average fixel metrics (fiber density (FD), fiber-bundle cross-section log, and combined [FDC]) as edges. SC–FC coupling for each SC metric was calculated at overall network, edge, and node levels. Overall DMN, node- and edge-specific coupling differences were found across SC measures and groups. DMN nodal coupling significantly predicted Mini-Mental Status Examination score and verbal memory. In conclusion, different types of fixel-based coupling alterations can be observed across the neurocognitive aging spectrum, in particular, FD–FC and FDC–FC coupling between DMN regions are associated with cognitive functioning. Structure–function coupling is the correlation between white matter structures connecting pairs of brain regions (structural connectivity) and their concomitant brain activity (functional connectivity). “fixel-based” diffusion-weighted imaging techniques improve the accuracy of white matter structure estimation and provide information on microstructural and macrostructural changes to brain networks. Using structural connectomes based on fixel-based weights, coupling was found to be altered in Alzheimer’s disease and mild cognitive impairment, especially in the default mode network. Default mode network coupling may be relevant to verbal memory and cognitive decline across aging, particularly for coupling driven by microstructural features of white matter.},

  abstract     = {The dynamics of the human cortex are highly metastable, driving the spontaneous exploration of network states. This metastability depends on circuit-level edge-of-bifurcation dynamics, which emerge from firing-rate control through multiple mechanisms of excitatory–inhibitory (E–I) homeostasis. However, it is unclear how these contribute to the metastability of cortical networks. We propose that individual mechanisms of the E–I homeostasis contribute uniquely to the emergence of resting-state dynamics and test this hypothesis in a large-scale model of the human cortex. We show that empirical connectivity and dynamics can only be reproduced when accounting for multiple mechanisms of the E–I homeostasis. More specifically, while the homeostasis of excitation and inhibition enhances metastability, the regulation of intrinsic excitability ensures moderate synchrony, maximizing functional complexity. Furthermore, the modulation bifurcation modulation by the homeostasis of excitation and intrinsic excitability compensates for strong input fluctuations in connector hubs. Importantly, this only occurs in models accounting for local gamma oscillations, suggesting a relationship between E–I balance, gamma rhythms, and metastable dynamics. Altogether, our results show that cortical networks self-organize toward maximal metastability through the multifactor homeostasis of E–I balance. Therefore, the benefits of combining multiple homeostatic mechanisms transcend the circuit level, supporting the metastable dynamics of large-scale cortical networks. Experimental studies have consistently shown that cortical circuits maintain a precise homeostasis of excitatory–inhibitory (E–I) balance, thereby optimizing local dynamics. While it is well established that multiple homeostatic mechanisms are involved in this local regulation, it remains unclear how each contributes to the large-scale dynamics of cortical networks. This study presents evidence that, through the E–I homeostasis, the cortex can self-organize toward a regime of highly complex and metastable spontaneous dynamics. Crucially, we demonstrate that this results from the synergistic action of multiple homeostatic mechanisms. Our findings advance our understanding of the E–I homeostasis as a process of self-organization, demonstrating its key role in the maintenance of metastable dynamics in large-scale cortical networks.},

  abstract     = {Single-subject morphological brain networks derived from cross-feature correlation of macroscopic MRI-derived morphological measures provide an important means for studying the brain connectome. However, the validity of this approach remains to be confirmed at the microscopic level. Here, we constructed morphological brain networks at the single-cell level by extending features from macroscopic morphological measures to microscopic descriptions of neuronal morphology. We demonstrated the feasibility and generalizability of the method using neurons in the somatosensory cortex of a rat, neurons over the whole brain of a mouse, and neurons in the middle temporal gyrus (MTG) of a human. We found that interneuron morphological similarity was higher for intra- than interclass connections, depended on cytoarchitectonic, chemoarchitectonic, and laminar classification of neurons (rat), differed between regions with different evolutionary timelines (mouse), and correlated with neuronal axonal projections (mouse). Furthermore, highly connected hub neurons were disproportionately from superficial layers (rat), inhibitory neurons (rat), and subcortical regions (mouse), and exhibited unique morphology. Finally, we demonstrated a more segregated, less integrated, and economic network architecture with worse resistance to targeted attacks for neurons in human MTG than neurons in a mouse’s primary visual cortex. Overall, our method provides an alternative avenue to study neuronal wiring diagrams in brains. The brain is a highly complex network spanning multiple spatial scales, yet the organization of brain networks at the single-cell level remains poorly understood. Here, we constructed microscopic morphological brain networks by assessing interneuron similarity based on neuronal morphology for different species. We found that interneuron morphological similarity was correlated with neuronal axonal projections, dependent on neuronal affiliation with respect to cellular and molecular architecture, laminar positioning, and brain area location, and capable of uncovering cross-species differences. Our method complements existing methodology aimed at mapping wiring diagrams in brains at the microscopic level.},

  abstract     = {In fMRI research, graphical models are used to uncover complex patterns of relationships between brain regions. Connectivity-based fMRI studies typically analyze nested data; raw observations, for example, BOLD responses, are nested within participants, which are nested within populations, for example, healthy controls. Often, studies ignore the nested structure and analyze participants either individually or in aggregate. This overlooks the distinction between within-participant and between-participant variance, which can lead to poor generalizability of results because group-level effects do not necessarily reflect effects for each member of the group and, at worst, risk paradoxical results where group-level effects are opposite to individual-level effects (e.g., Kievit, Frankenhuis, Waldorp, & Borsboom, 2013 ; Robinson, 2009 ; Simpson, 1951 ). To address these concerns, we propose a multilevel approach to model the fMRI networks, using a Gaussian graphical model at the individual level and a Curie-Weiss graphical model at the group level. Simulations show that our method outperforms individual or aggregate analysis in edge retrieval. We apply the proposed multilevel approach to resting-state fMRI data of 724 healthy participants, examining both their commonalities and individual differences. We not only recover the seven previously found resting-state networks at the group level but also observe considerable heterogeneity in the individual-level networks. Finally, we discuss the necessity of a multilevel approach, additional challenges, and possible future extensions.},

Findings revealed a geometric principle, the exponential distance rule (EDR) showing that the number of neurons decreases exponentially with the length of their axons. This neuron-level information was used to build a region-level EDR network model that was able to explain various characteristics of interareal cortical networks in macaques, mice, and rats. The complete connectome of the Drosophila has recently been mapped providing information also about the network of neuropils (projectome). A recent study demonstrated the presence of the EDR in the Drosophila . In our study, we first revisit the EDR itself and precisely measure the characteristic decay rate. Next, we demonstrate that the EDR model effectively accounts for numerous binary and weighted properties of the projectome. Our study illustrates that the EDR model is a suitable null model for analyzing networks of brain regions, as it captures properties of region-level networks in very different species. The importance of the null model lies in its ability to facilitate the identification of functionally significant features not caused by inevitable geometric constraints, as we illustrate with the pronounced asymmetry of connection weights important for functional hierarchy.

  abstract     = {Current techniques to estimate directed functional connectivity from magnetoencephalography (MEG) signals involve two sequential steps: (a) estimation of the sources and their amplitude time series from the MEG data and (b) estimation of directed interactions between the source time series. However, such a sequential approach is not optimal as it leads to spurious connectivity due to spatial leakage. Here, we present an algorithm to jointly estimate the source and connectivity parameters using Bayesian filtering. We refer to this new algorithm as JEDI-MEG (Joint Estimation of source Dynamics and Interactions from MEG data). By formulating a state-space model for the locations and amplitudes of a given number of sources, we show that estimation of their connections can be reduced to a system identification problem. Using simulated MEG data, we show that the joint approach provides a more accurate reconstruction of connectivity parameters than the conventional two-step approach. Using real MEG responses to visually presented faces in 16 subjects, we also demonstrate that our method gives source and connectivity estimates that are both physiologically plausible and largely consistent across subjects. In conclusion, the proposed joint estimation approach outperforms the traditional two-step approach in determining functional connectivity in MEG data. Functional connectivity is currently estimated from electromagnetic brain signals such as magnetoencephalography (MEG) in two consecutive steps: First, the inverse problem is solved to estimate the locations and temporal dynamics of brain sources. Second, connectivity metrics are computed between these estimated sources. This approach suffers from the limitation that the information provided by the connectivity structure is not exploited in the estimation of source activity and vice versa. Here, we present a novel algorithm, utilizing Bayesian filtering, to jointly estimate the source and connectivity parameters to overcome this limitation. Compared with state-of-the-art two-step approaches, our method provides a more accurate reconstruction of the connectivity parameters, which we demonstrate using a standard connectivity benchmark simulation and an electrocorticography-based simulation of MEG data. We also applied our method to real MEG responses (open-access dataset) to visually presented faces in 16 subjects, and the results show that our approach provides source and connectivity estimates that are both physiologically plausible and largely consistent across subjects. Overall, this work contributes to methodological advances in estimating functional connectivity from MEG data.},

In this longitudinal magnetoencephalography (MEG) study, we investigated changes in brain network topology of ALSci/bi over time as compared with ALS-pure motor and bvFTD patients. Resting-state MEG was recorded in ALS-pure motor ( n = 9), ALSci/bi ( n = 16), and bvFTD ( n = 16) at baseline and 5-month follow-up, projected to source space. The corrected version of the amplitude envelope correlation was applied to compute frequency-band-specific functional connectivity between brain regions, from which the backbone of the functional networks was constructed using the minimum spanning tree (MST) approach. Reference MSTs were computed based on the functional connectivity matrices for ALS-pure motor and bvFTD, against which the networks of ALSci/bi were compared. We showed that, at baseline, networks in the theta band of ALSci/bi patients were more similar to ALS-pure motor than bvFTD. At follow-up, ALSci/bi patients’ beta-band network similarity had moved away from ALS-pure motor and resembled bvFTD. In conclusion, our findings suggest that brain networks of ALSci/bi patients move along the ALS-bvFTD spectrum over time, from ALS-pure motor to bvFTD-like topology. In this longitudinal magnetoencephalography (MEG) study, we explored changes in brain network topology in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) patients with cognitive/behavioral impairment (ALSci/bi), compared with the two extreme ends of the ALS behavioral variant of frontotemporal dementia (ALS-bvFTD) spectrum (ALS with only motor impairment and bvFTD patients without ALS). We recorded resting-state MEG at baseline and 5-month follow-up, analyzing frequency-band-specific functional connectivity and constructing the networks’ backbone using the minimum spanning tree (MST). Our findings indicate that at baseline, ALSci/bi networks were more similar to ALS-pure motor than bvFTD in the theta band. At follow-up, ALSci/bi networks shifted toward bvFTD-like topology in the beta band. This suggests that ALSci/bi patients’ brain networks evolve along the ALS-bvFTD spectrum, highlighting potential implications for disease progression.},

  abstract     = {Epilepsy affects over 50 million people worldwide, with approximately 30% experiencing drug-resistant forms that may require surgical intervention. Accurate localisation of the epileptogenic zone (EZ) is crucial for effective treatment, but how best to use intracranial EEG data to delineate the EZ remains unclear. Previous studies have used the directionality of neural activities across the brain to investigate seizure dynamics and localise the EZ. However, the different connectivity measures used across studies have often provided inconsistent insights about the direction and the localisation power of signal flow as a biomarker for EZ localisation. In a data-driven approach, this study employs a large set of 13 distinct directed connectivity measures to evaluate neural activity flow in and out the seizure onset zone (SOZ) during interictal and ictal periods. These measures test the hypotheses of “sink SOZ” (SOZ dominantly receiving neural activities during interictal periods) and “source SOZ” (SOZ dominantly transmitting activities during ictal periods). While the results were different across connectivity measures, several measures consistently supported higher connectivity directed towards the SOZ in interictal periods and higher connectivity directed away during ictal periods. Comparing six distinct metrics of node behaviour in the network, we found that SOZ separates itself from the rest of the network, allowing for the metric of “ eccentricity ” to localise the SOZ more accurately than any other metrics including “ in strength ” and “ out strength .” This introduced a novel biomarker for localising the SOZ, leveraging the discriminative power of directed connectivity measures in an explainable machine learning pipeline. By using a comprehensive, objective, and data-driven approach, this study addresses previously unresolved questions on the direction of neural activities in seizure organisation and sheds light on dynamics of interictal and ictal activity in focal epilepsy. This study investigates how brain signals flow in patients with drug-resistant epilepsy. By analysing brain activity recordings, we found that the seizure origin (the epileptogenic zone or EZ) changes its role before and during seizures. Before a seizure, the EZ primarily receives signals, while during a seizure, it becomes a source, actively sending signals to other brain areas. To resolve the discrepancy in the literature, we tested a wide range of directed connectivity methods for tracking these signal flows and found that the metric of node “eccentricity” most accurately pinpoints the EZ. This research has the potential to improve surgical outcomes for people with epilepsy by providing a more precise way to locate the seizure origin.},

  abstract     = {The intricate link between brain functional connectivity (FC) and structural connectivity (SC) is explored through models performing diffusion on SC to derive FC, using varied methodologies from single to multiple graph diffusion kernels . However, existing studies have not correlated diffusion scales with specific brain regions of interest (RoIs), limiting the applicability of graph diffusion. We propose a novel approach using graph diffusion wavelets to learn the appropriate diffusion scale for each RoI to accurately estimate the SC-FC mapping. Using the open Human Connectome Project dataset, we achieve an average Pearson’s correlation value of 0.833, surpassing the state-of-the-art methods for the prediction of FC. It is important to note that the proposed architecture is entirely linear, computationally efficient, and notably demonstrates the power-law distribution of diffusion scales. Our results show that the bilateral frontal pole, by virtue of it having large diffusion scale, forms a large community structure. The finding is in line with the current literature on the role of the frontal pole in resting-state networks. Overall, the results underscore the potential of graph diffusion wavelet framework for understanding how the brain structure leads to FC. In the network diffusion paradigm for brain structure-to-function mapping, we noticed limitations such as manually decided diffusion scales and the absence of region of interest–level analysis. We addressed this problem by independently developing the graph diffusion wavelets having multiscale and multiresolution property. Each brain region is associated with a diffusion scale that defines the extent of spatial communication. Using graph diffusion wavelets, we are able to predict the functional connectome with state-of-the-art results. We observe that the diffusion scales follow a power-law degree distribution, which is indicative of a scale-free process in the brain. The frontal pole is a dominant member of the various resting-state networks , and our model is able to associate higher diffusion scales to this region. The graph diffusion wavelet model is a novel method that not only excels in downstream task but also provides insights into the structure-function relation.},

  abstract     = {Recent studies show that functional resting-state dynamics may be modeled by lattice models near criticality, such as the 2D Ising model. The Ising temperature, which is the control parameter dictating the phase transitions of the model, can provide insight into the large-scale dynamics and is being used to better understand different brain states and neurodevelopment. This period is categorized by intricate changes in the microcircuits to consolidate networks. These changes influence the macroscopic brain dynamics and also its functional relations, which can be observed in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Therefore, this work investigates neurodevelopment through a novel method to estimate the Ising temperature of the brain from fMRI data using functional connectivity and graph neural networks trained on Ising model networks. The main finding indicates a statistically significant negative correlation between age and temperature for typically developing children ( r = −0.48, p < 0.0001) and also children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder ( r = −0.49, p < 0.0001). This study suggests that the brain gets distant from criticality as age increases, leading to a more ordered state. In this study, we employed graph neural networks to investigate the functional connectivity patterns of resting-state fMRI data using the 2D Ising model as a theoretical framework to access critical dynamics. Our key finding is the significant decrease in Ising temperature with age in both typically developing children and those with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, indicating a developmental transition from a high-entropy, disordered state to a more ordered state, decreasing the availability of dynamical states that the system can occupy and transit in different conditions. Moreover, this decrease in temperature is crucial as it implies that the brain is moving away from criticality, leading the system to a more subcritical regime. The correlation coefficients across the groups showed no significant differences, indicating the same developmental trajectory.},

  abstract     = {The brain operates through networks of interconnected regions, which can be disrupted by glial tumors and their treatment. This study investigates associations between this altered functional network topology and cognition in gliomas. We studied 50 adult glioma survivors (>1-year posttherapy) and 50 healthy controls. Participants underwent cognitive assessments across six domains and an 8-min resting-state functional MRI. Based on the BOLD signal, partial correlations were computed among 78 brain regions. From their absolute values, whole-brain and nodal graph metrics were derived and normalized to random graphs. Group differences in whole-brain and nodal graph metrics were assessed with Mann–Whitney U tests and mixed-design analyses of variance, respectively. Metrics exhibiting significant intergroup differences were correlated with cognitive scores, with p bonf < 0.050 indicating significance. Among controls, 8 of 78 nodes were identified as hubs. Patients exhibited significantly higher whole-brain clustering, correlating with intelligence ( r (98) = −0.409, p bonf < 0.001) and executive functioning ( r (98) = 0.300, p bonf = 0.014). Lower centrality, higher nodal clustering, and assortativity were also observed in patients, particularly in hubs, correlating with language and executive functioning, respectively (all r (98) > 0.300, p bonf < 0.050). Glioma patients commonly experience cognitive deficits alongside posttreatment alterations in functional network topology. Alterations in clustering, assortativity, and centrality may specifically act as compensatory mechanisms, significantly influencing cognitive functioning. Cross-disease research has highlighted the importance of functional networks in cognitive functioning. Given that these networks can be disrupted by glial tumors and their treatment, our study examines the relationship between cognitive performance and altered functional network topology using resting-state fMRI in a sizable prospective cohort of 50 glioma survivors and 50 matched healthy controls. With this study, we reveal significant alterations in functional network topology and its hubs in glioma survivors, of which specific graph measures appeared to be specifically valuable in predicting executive functioning and language outcomes. These insights underscore the importance of network-based approaches in future research to better understand and address these deficits, certainly given that functional networks and their hubs are understudied in this population.},

This research goes beyond that shift and proposes investigating how human cognition is shaped by the interactions between whole-brain networks embedded in a low-dimensional manifold space. To achieve this, a combination of deep variational autoencoders with computational modelling is used to construct a dynamic model of brain networks, fitted to whole-brain dynamics measured with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The results show that during cognitive tasks, highly flexible reconfigurations of task-driven network interaction patterns occur, and these patterns, in turn, can be used to accurately classify different cognitive tasks. Importantly, using this low-dimensional whole-brain network model provides significantly better results than working in the conventional brain space.},

This study employed an innovative multiplex connectomics approach, integrating cortical thickness (CTH) and fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) in a dual-layer model to investigate network alterations in FTD subtypes across two geographically distinct sites. The cohort included groups of behavioral variant FTD (bvFTD), primary progressive aphasia (PPA), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and cognitively normal (CN) individuals who were analyzed from two separate sites. Site 1 included 28 bvFTD, 20 PPA, and 27 MCI participants, whereas Site 2 included 26 bvFTD, 43 PPA, and 43 CN individuals, respectively. Utilizing CTH and FDG-PET data after standard preprocessing, a multiplex network pipeline in BRAPH2 toolbox was used to derive multiplex participation coefficient (MPC) between the groups. The analysis revealed an increase in global MPC as an indicator of disease in PPA at both sites. Additionally, nodal MPC alterations in the anterior cingulate, frontal, and temporal lobes in PPA were compared with bvFTD. Comparisons with the CN showed that nodal MPC alterations were more extensive in PPA when compared with bvFTD. These findings underscore the potential utility of multiplex connectomes for identifying network disruptions in neurodegenerative disorders, offering promising implications for future research and clinical applications. This study uses multiplex connectomics, a method combining cortical thickness and glucose metabolism data, to investigate frontotemporal dementia (FTD) across two sites. Behavioral variant FTD (bvFTD) and primary progressive aphasia showed global and nodal brain network alterations. PPA exhibited more widespread disruptions in the anterior cingulate, frontal, and temporal lobes than bvFTD, suggesting greater network changes. bvFTD showed distinct alterations in the left caudal anterior cingulate and temporal pole compared with mild cognitive impairment and more extensive changes compared with cognitively normal individuals.

We investigated this by predicting individual reaction time (RT) performance in the stimulus-response compatibility task and age, using intrinsic EC (I-EC; calculated at baseline) and task-modulated EC (M-EC; induced by experimental conditions) with dynamic causal modeling (DCM) across various data processing conditions, including different general linear model (GLM) designs, Bayesian model reduction, and different cross-validation schemes and prediction models. We report evident differences in predicting RT and age between I-EC and M-EC, as well as between event-related and block-based GLM and DCM designs. M-EC outperformed both I-EC and task-evoked FC in RT prediction, while all types of connectivity performed similarly for age. Event-related GLM and DCM designs performed better than block-based designs. Our findings suggest that task-evoked I-EC and M-EC may capture different phenotypic attributes, with performance influenced by data processing and modeling choices, particularly the GLM-DCM design. This evaluation of methods for behavior prediction from brain EC may contribute to a meta-scientific understanding of how data processing and modeling frameworks influence neuroimaging-based predictions, offering insights for improving their robustness and efficacy. We investigated how brain task-evoked effective connectivity (EC) can predict individual differences in behavior and age. We examined two types of EC: intrinsic EC (calculated at baseline) and task-modulated EC (induced by experimental conditions) calculated by dynamic causal modeling across various data processing conditions. We found that the task-modulated EC outperformed intrinsic EC in predicting reaction time measured during a stimulus-response task, while both EC types performed similarly in age prediction. Our findings may suggest that different EC types could capture distinct phenotypic traits, with performance influenced by data processing and modeling choices.

However, the underlying neural mechanisms of this behavioral change remain unclear. Given that the DLPFC is a key node of the executive control network (ECN) and that creativity is a two-stage process in which the ECN is primarily involved in the final idea selection stage, application of tRNS to this region shall not only result in an increase of originality and flexibility but also in a modulation of EEG activity. To test these assumptions, we collected 256-channel EEG of 40 participants before and after tRNS/sham applied to the DLPFC, during which participants performed two verbal creativity tasks. To assess stimulation-induced connectivity changes and to capture large-scale cortical communication, a source space alpha (8–12 Hz) imaginary coherence was calculated. We found that the tRNS-induced improvements in originality and flexibility were associated with bilateral DLPFC alpha coherence changes. From a large-scale networks perspective, these results suggest that tRNS-induced ECN activity is associated with increased originality and flexibility, potentially by enhancing selectivity in the idea evaluation phase. This study, for the first time, indicates a link between neurophysiological activity and tRNS-induced changes in verbal creativity. This study investigates the impact of transcranial random noise stimulation (tRNS) on alpha coherence and the link between neurophysiological and tRNS-induced effects on creativity. Given the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex’s (DLPFC) role in creativity’s final idea selection stage, 40 participants underwent 256-channel EEG recordings immediately before and after tRNS applied to the DLPFC. Using a within-subject design with active and sham tRNS sessions, we found that the tRNS-induced changes in originality and flexibility were linked to changes in alpha coherence in both left and right DLPFCs, analyzed in source space. These results suggest a network-level impact of tRNS on creativity, potentially enhancing executive control network activity for improved idea evaluation and indicate that the effect of tRNS is explained by task-related brain activity.},

Quantifying the distance between FCs is important for understanding the relation between behavior, disorders, disease, and changes in connectivity. Recently, tangent space projections, which account for the curvature of the mathematical space of FCs, have been proposed for calculating FC distances. We compare the efficacy of this approach relative to the traditional method in the context of subject identification using the Midnight Scan Club dataset in order to study resting-state and task-based subject discriminability. The tangent space method is found to universally outperform the traditional method. We also focus on the subject identification efficacy of subnetworks. Certain subnetworks are found to outperform others, a dichotomy that largely follows the “control” and “processing” categorization of resting-state networks, and relates subnetwork flexibility with subject discriminability. Identification efficacy is also modulated by tasks, though certain subnetworks appear task independent. The uniquely long recordings of the dataset also allow for explorations of resource requirements for effective subject identification. The tangent space method is found to universally require less data, making it well suited when only short recordings are available. Functional connectomes, which describe the similarity between the recorded activity of different brain regions, are ubiquitous for researchers trying to understand brain dynamics on short and long time scales in the presence and absence of neurophysiological diseases. This work applies a tangent space approach, a novel method to calculate the distance between functional connectomes, to a unique high-quality dataset (the Midnight Scan Club) in order to better understand the variability and uniqueness of connectomes across subjects, and how subject identification (also called “fingerprinting”) compares across tasks. We also show that not only does the tangent space method offer greater sensitivity to changes, but it does so with significantly fewer resources, and in some scenarios, reveals qualitatively different interpretations than the traditional method.},

  abstract     = {Functional connectivity (FC) reflects brain-wide communication essential for cognition, yet the role of underlying biophysical factors in shaping FC remains unclear. We quantify the influence of physical factors—structural connectivity (SC) and Euclidean distance (DC), which capture anatomical wiring and regional distance—and molecular factors—gene expression similarity (GC), and neuroreceptor congruence (RC), representing neurobiological similarity—on resting-state FC. We assess how these factors impact graph-theoretic and gradient features, capturing pairwise and higher-order interactions. By generating remnant functional networks after selectively removing connections tied to specific factors, we show that molecular factors, particularly RC, dominate graph-theoretic features, while gradient features are shaped by a mix of molecular and physical factors, especially GC and DC. SC has a surprisingly minor role. We also link FC alterations to biophysical factors in schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), with physical factors differentiating these groups. These insights are key for understanding FC across various applications, including task performance, development, and clinical conditions. We introduce and utilize a remnant functional networks-based framework to investigate how the brain’s functional connectivity (FC), representative of the brain-wide communication network essential for cognition, is shaped by various biophysical —physical and molecular—factors, including structural connectivity, physical distance, and neuroreceptor similarities. Our findings reveal that molecular factors, particularly neuroreceptor congruence, play a dominant role in shaping FC network features, while structural connectivity has a surprisingly minor influence. Applying this framework, we identify distinct biophysical drivers of FC alterations in schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and ADHD, offering insights into the unique characteristics of these disorders. This study emphasizes the significance of molecular factors in shaping FC and provides a tool for exploring these associations across various contexts, including task performance, development, and clinical conditions.},

This study introduces a distinctive approach that merges knowledge-informed and data-driven methodologies, offering a nuanced way to more effectively understand these changes. Utilizing graph network analysis, along with existing neurobiological knowledge of domain-specific brain network systems, we uncover a deeper understanding of brain network interaction and integration. As a proof of concept, we applied our approach to the language domain, a well-known large-scale network system as a representative model system, using functional imaging datasets with specific language tasks for validation of our proposed approach. Our results revealed a double dissociation between motor and sensory language modules during word generation and comprehension tasks. Furthermore, by introducing a hierarchical nature of brain networks and introducing local and global metrics, we demonstrated that hierarchical levels of networks exhibit distinct ways of integration of language brain networks. This innovative approach facilitates a differentiated and thorough interpretation of brain network function in local and global manners, marking a significant advancement in our ability to investigate adaptive changes in brain network integration in health and disease.

  abstract     = {In graph theory, “multilayer networks” represent systems involving several interconnected topological levels. One example in neuroscience is the stratification of connections between different cortical depths or “laminae,” which is becoming noninvasively accessible in humans using ultrahigh-resolution functional MRI (fMRI). Here, we applied multilayer graph theory to examine functional connectivity across different cortical depths in humans, using 7-T fMRI (1-mm 3 voxels; 30 participants). Blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signals were derived from five depths between the white matter and pial surface. We compared networks where the interregional connections were limited to a single cortical depth only (“layer-by-layer matrices”) with those considering all possible connections between areas and cortical depths (“multilayer matrix”). We utilized global and local graph theory features that quantitatively characterize network attributes including network composition, nodal centrality, path-based measures, and hub segregation. Detecting functional differences between cortical depths was improved using multilayer connectomics compared with the layer-by-layer versions. Superficial depths of the cortex dominated information transfer, and deeper depths drove clustering. These differences were largest in frontotemporal and limbic regions. fMRI functional connectivity across different cortical depths may contain neurophysiologically relevant information; thus, multilayer connectomics could provide a methodological framework for studies on how information flows across this stratification. With the advent of ultrahigh-resolution functional MRI (fMRI), increased noninvasive accessibility of the human cortical laminae has enabled more advanced study of the human cortex. One potential methodological approach to studying cortical laminae is through multilayer connectomics, whereby the human cortex is represented by several interconnected networks. We applied a multilayer graph theory to examine functional connectivity across different cortical depths in humans, using 7-T fMRI. We utilized global and local graph theory features that quantitatively characterize network attributes including network composition, nodal centrality, path-based measures, and hub segregation. We detected global and local functional differences between cortical depths that were augmented using multilayer connectomics compared with the layer-by-layer versions.

  abstract     = {In recurrent networks of leaky integrate-and-fire neurons, the mean-field theory has been instrumental in capturing the statistical properties of neuronal activity, like firing rate distributions. This theory has been applied to networks with either homogeneous synaptic weights and heterogeneous connections per neuron or vice versa. Our work expands mean-field models to include networks with both types of structural heterogeneity simultaneously, particularly focusing on those with synapses that undergo plastic changes. The model introduces a spike trace for each neuron, a variable that rises with neuron spikes and decays without activity, influenced by a degradation rate r p and the neuron’s firing rate ν . When the ratio α = ν / r p is significantly high, this trace effectively estimates the neuron’s firing rate, allowing synaptic weights at equilibrium to be determined by the firing rates of connected neurons. This relationship is incorporated into our mean-field formalism, providing exact solutions for firing rate and synaptic weight distributions at equilibrium in the high α regime. However, the model remains accurate within a practical range of degradation rates, as demonstrated through simulations with networks of excitatory and inhibitory neurons. This approach sheds light on how plasticity modulates both activity and structure within neuronal networks, offering insights into their complex behavior. Networks of spiking neurons are complex systems where the structure of connections and the activity patterns generated are deeply intertwined, a relationship often studied using mathematical approaches like the mean-field theory. However, previous studies have primarily focused on networks with limited structural variability, where either the connection strength is nearly identical across the network or the number of connections varies little from one neuron to another. This work takes a step forward by combining both types of structural variability and allowing connection strengths to adapt over time, thereby providing an extended mean-field theory. We derive exact solutions for the distribution of spiking rates and connection strengths at equilibrium and demonstrate their accuracy through numerical simulations, even beyond the defining parameter ranges, offering a more comprehensive and realistic perspective on the interplay between activity and structure in neuronal networks.},

  abstract     = {Magnetoencephalography (MEG) is widely used for studying resting-state brain connectivity. However, MEG source imaging is ill posed and has limited spatial resolution. This introduces source-leakage issues, making it challenging to interpret MEG-derived connectivity in resting states. To address this, we validated MEG-derived connectivity from 45 healthy participants using a normative intracranial EEG (iEEG) atlas. The MEG inverse problem was solved using the wavelet-maximum entropy on the mean method. We computed four connectivity metrics: amplitude envelope correlation (AEC), orthogonalized AEC (OAEC), phase locking value (PLV), and weighted-phase lag index (wPLI). We compared spatial correlation between MEG and iEEG connectomes across standard canonical frequency bands. We found moderate spatial correlations between MEG and iEEG connectomes for AEC and PLV. However, when considering metrics that correct/remove zero-lag connectivity (OAEC/wPLI), the spatial correlation between MEG and iEEG connectomes decreased. MEG exhibited higher zero-lag connectivity compared with iEEG. The correlations between MEG and iEEG connectomes suggest that relevant connectivity patterns can be recovered from MEG. However, since these correlations are moderate/low, MEG connectivity results should be interpreted with caution. Metrics that correct for zero-lag connectivity show decreased correlations, highlighting a trade-off; while MEG may capture more connectivity due to source-leakage, removing zero-lag connectivity can eliminate true connections. The ill-posed nature and low spatial resolution of EEG/magnetoencephalography (MEG) source imaging affects functional connectivity estimates, which become more complicated in the resting state due to the low signal-to-noise ratio. Several connectivity metrics have been proposed to address source leakage by removing zero-lag connectivity, although this can eliminate true neuronal zero-lag connections. Intracranial EEG (iEEG) is the gold standard for validating noninvasive measurements. In this study, we validated MEG-estimated connectivity for healthy subjects using the iEEG atlas of normal brain activity ( Frauscher et al., 2018 ) as ground truth at a group level. We employed two amplitude-based metrics and two phase-based metrics. Our findings highlight how MEG connectivity compares with the iEEG atlas and provide valuable insights for resting-state EEG/MEG connectomic studies, particularly in the choice of connectivity metrics.},

  abstract     = {Despite significant research, discovering causal relationships from fMRI remains a challenge. Popular methods such as Granger causality and dynamic causal modeling fall short in handling contemporaneous effects and latent common causes. Methods from causal structure learning literature can address these limitations but often scale poorly with network size and need acyclicity. In this study, we first provide a taxonomy of existing methods and compare their accuracy and efficiency on simulated fMRI from simple topologies. This analysis demonstrates a pressing need for more accurate and scalable methods, motivating the design of Causal discovery for Large-scale Low-resolution Time-series with Feedback (CaLLTiF). CaLLTiF is a constraint-based method that uses conditional independence between contemporaneous and lagged variables to extract causal relationships. On simulated fMRI from the macaque connectome, CaLLTiF achieves significantly higher accuracy and scalability than all tested alternatives. From resting-state human fMRI, CaLLTiF learns causal connectomes that are highly consistent across individuals, show clear top-down flow of causal effect from attention and default mode to sensorimotor networks, exhibit Euclidean distance dependence in causal interactions, and are highly dominated by contemporaneous effects. Overall, this work takes a major step in enhancing causal discovery from whole-brain fMRI and defines a new standard for future investigations. Discovering causal relationships from fMRI data is challenging due to contemporaneous effects and latent causes. Popular methods like Granger causality and dynamic causal modeling struggle with these issues, especially in large networks. To address this, we introduce Causal discovery for Large-scale Low-resolution Time-series with Feedback (CaLLTiF), a scalable method that uses both lagged and contemporaneous variables to identify causal relationships. CaLLTiF outperforms various existing techniques in accuracy and scalability on simulated fMRI data. When applied to human resting-state fMRI, it reveals consistent and biologically plausible patterns across individuals, with a clear top-down causal flow from attention and default mode networks to sensorimotor areas. Overall, this work advances the field of causal discovery in large-scale fMRI studies.},

Results showed an integrated and a segregated brain state with high intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) values of the states between sessions (0.67 ≥ ICC ≥ 0.99). The most reliable dFC parameter was state prevalence with an ICC ≈ 0.5 for ∼15 min of uncentered data, while other parameters, such as mean dwell time, were much less reliable. While shorter scans and within-subject data centering further reduce reliability, the atlas choice had no effects. Spearman’s correlations among dFC parameters strongly depend on data centering. The effect of global signal regression and a higher number of states is discussed. In conclusion, we recommend formulating hypotheses on cross-sectional differences and correlations between dFC measures of brain integration and other subject-specific measures in terms of state prevalence, especially in small-scale studies. We investigated the reliability of popular parameters characterizing dynamic brain states in two datasets. We found high reliability of clustering results with a two-state model but only medium to low reliability of the parameters, of which state prevalence across different strategies was the most reliable.},

  abstract     = {The functional and cognitive effects of traumatic brain injury (TBI) are poorly understood, as even mild injuries (concussion) can lead to long-lasting, untreatable symptoms. Simplified brain dynamics models may help researchers better understand the relationship between brain injury patterns and functional outcomes. Properly developed, these computational models provide an approach to investigate the effects of both computational and in vivo injury on simulated dynamics and cognitive function, respectively, for model organisms. In this study, we apply the Kuramoto model and an existing mesoscale mouse brain structural network to develop a simplified computational model of mouse brain dynamics. We explore how to optimize our initial model to predict existing mouse brain functional connectivity collected from mice under various anesthetic protocols. Finally, to determine how strongly the changes in our optimized models’ dynamics can predict the extent of a brain injury, we investigate how our simulations respond to varying levels of structural network damage. Results predict a mixture of hypo- and hyperconnectivity after experimental TBI, similar to results in TBI survivors, and also suggest a compensatory remodeling of connections that may have an impact on functional outcomes after TBI. Recent research has investigated the consequences of traumatic brain injuries by combining computational models of human brain activity and structural models of the whole human brain or cortex. As experimental injury research can only be conducted using animal models, we apply a simplified computational model of whole-brain dynamics, the Kuramoto model, to a mouse brain structural network. We tune our model to best predict measurements of functional connectivity recorded from 58 fMRI scans of mice and lesion the network model to explore the effects of injury. Our findings predict that functional connectivity may increase or decrease in various regions of the brain, even at a high injury level, which may aid in future predictions of cognitive impairments after brain injury.},

  abstract     = {Sustained attention is essential for daily life and can be directed to information from different perceptual modalities, including audition and vision. Recently, cognitive neuroscience has aimed to identify neural predictors of behavior that generalize across datasets. Prior work has shown strong generalization of models trained to predict individual differences in sustained attention performance from patterns of fMRI functional connectivity. However, it is an open question whether predictions of sustained attention are specific to the perceptual modality in which they are trained. In the current study, we test whether connectome-based models predict performance on attention tasks performed in different modalities. We show first that a predefined network trained to predict adults’ visual sustained attention performance generalizes to predict auditory sustained attention performance in three independent datasets ( N 1 = 29, N 2 = 60, N 3 = 17). Next, we train new network models to predict performance on visual and auditory attention tasks separately. We find that functional networks are largely modality general, with both model-unique and shared model features predicting sustained attention performance in independent datasets regardless of task modality. Results support the supposition that visual and auditory sustained attention rely on shared neural mechanisms and demonstrate robust generalizability of whole-brain functional network models of sustained attention. While previous work has demonstrated external validity of functional connectivity-based networks for the prediction of cognitive and attentional performance, testing generalization across visual and auditory perceptual modalities has been limited. The current study demonstrates robust prediction of sustained attention performance, regardless of perceptual modality models are trained or tested in. Results demonstrate that connectivity-based models may generalize broadly, capturing variance in sustained attention performance that is agnostic to the perceptual modality of model training.},

  abstract     = {Brain tumors can induce pathological changes in neuronal dynamics that are reflected in functional connectivity measures. Here, we use a whole-brain modeling approach to investigate pathological alterations to neuronal activity in glioma patients. By fitting a Hopf whole-brain model to empirical functional connectivity, we investigate glioma-induced changes in optimal model parameters. We observe considerable differences in neuronal dynamics between glioma patients and healthy controls, both on an individual and population-based level. In particular, model parameter estimation suggests that local tumor pathology causes changes in brain dynamics by increasing the influence of interregional interactions on global neuronal activity. Our approach demonstrates that whole-brain models provide valuable insights for understanding glioma-associated alterations in functional connectivity. This study investigates how gliomas affect neuronal activity and connectivity using a whole-brain computational model. By fitting this model to empirical data, we compare glioma patients with healthy individuals to uncover significant differences in brain dynamics. Our findings indicate that local tumor pathology enhances the influence of interregional interactions on overall neuronal activity. This approach underscores the utility of whole-brain computational models in revealing the complex alterations in functional connectivity associated with gliomas, advancing our understanding of their impact on brain function.},

  abstract     = {Amyloid- β (A β ) plaques in conjunction with hyperphosphorylated tau proteins in the form of neurofibrillary tangles are the two neuropathological hallmarks of Alzheimer’s disease. It is well-known that the identification of individuals with A β positivity could enable early diagnosis. In this work, we aim at capturing the A β positivity status in an unbalanced cohort enclosing subjects at different disease stages, exploiting the underlying structural and connectivity disease-induced modulations as revealed by structural, functional, and diffusion MRI. Of note, due to the unbalanced cohort, the outcomes may be guided by those factors rather than amyloid accumulation. The partial views provided by each modality are integrated in the model, allowing to take full advantage of their complementarity in encoding the effects of the A β accumulation, leading to an accuracy of 0.762 ± 0.04. The specificity of the information brought by each modality is assessed by post hoc explainability analysis (guided backpropagation), highlighting the underlying structural and functional changes. Noteworthy, well-established biomarker key regions related to A β deposition could be identified by all modalities, including the hippocampus, thalamus, precuneus, and cingulate gyrus, witnessing in favor of the reliability of the method as well as its potential in shedding light on modality-specific possibly unknown A β deposition signatures. In this work, we employed a multimodal MRI-based deep learning framework for the classification of unbalanced cohorts relying on the amyloid- β status in the Alzheimer’s disease continuum. To this end, structural, functional, and diffusion MRI data were used to feed a 3D-convolutional neural network and two different graph neural networks, respectively, reaching an accuracy of 0.762 ± 0.04. Post hoc explainability analysis was performed to extract the most relevant regions that led to the outcome, highlighting the involvement of different cortical and subcortical regions. This work provides evidence of the added value brought by exploiting different imaging modalities in decrypting the nature and extent of brain alterations in the amyloid-guided classification outcome.},

  abstract     = {Generative models of brain activity have been instrumental in testing hypothesized mechanisms underlying brain dynamics against experimental datasets. Beyond capturing the key mechanisms underlying spontaneous brain dynamics, these models hold an exciting potential for understanding the mechanisms underlying the dynamics evoked by targeted brain stimulation techniques. This paper delves into this emerging application, using concepts from dynamical systems theory to argue that the stimulus-evoked dynamics in such experiments may be shaped by new types of mechanisms distinct from those that dominate spontaneous dynamics. We review and discuss (a) the targeted experimental techniques across spatial scales that can both perturb the brain to novel states and resolve its relaxation trajectory back to spontaneous dynamics and (b) how we can understand these dynamics in terms of mechanisms using physiological, phenomenological, and data-driven models. A tight integration of targeted stimulation experiments with generative quantitative modeling provides an important opportunity to uncover novel mechanisms of brain dynamics that are difficult to detect in spontaneous settings. Generative models are important tools for testing hypothesized mechanisms of brain dynamics against experimental data. This review highlights an application of generative models in analyzing a form of brain activity evoked by emerging targeted stimulation techniques. We argue that analyzing targeted stimulation dynamics can uncover mechanisms that are hidden during commonly analyzed spontaneous dynamics and explore how integrating diverse targeted stimulation experiments with existing generative models offer a significant opportunity to uncover these novel mechanisms and thereby expand our mechanistic understanding of brain dynamics.},

  abstract     = {Synaptic connectivity at the neuronal level is characterized by highly nonrandom features. Hypotheses about their role can be developed by correlating structural metrics to functional features. But, to prove causation, manipulations of connectivity would have to be studied. However, the fine-grained scale at which nonrandom trends are expressed makes this approach challenging to pursue experimentally. Simulations of neuronal networks provide an alternative route to study arbitrarily complex manipulations in morphologically and biophysically detailed models. Here, we present Connectome-Manipulator, a Python framework for rapid connectome manipulations of large-scale network models in Scalable Open Network Architecture TemplAte (SONATA) format. In addition to creating or manipulating the connectome of a model, it provides tools to fit parameters of stochastic connectivity models against existing connectomes. This enables rapid replacement of any existing connectome with equivalent connectomes at different levels of complexity, or transplantation of connectivity features from one connectome to another, for systematic study. We employed the framework in the detailed model of the rat somatosensory cortex in two exemplary use cases: transplanting interneuron connectivity trends from electron microscopy data and creating simplified connectomes of excitatory connectivity. We ran a series of network simulations and found diverse shifts in the activity of individual neuron populations causally linked to these manipulations.},

  abstract     = {Volumetric brain reconstructions provide an unprecedented opportunity to gain insights into the complex connectivity patterns of neurons in an increasing number of organisms. Here, we model and quantify the complexity of the resulting neural connectomes in the fruit fly, mouse, and human and unveil a simple set of shared organizing principles across these organisms. To put the connectomes in a physical context, we also construct contactomes, the network of neurons in physical contact in each organism. With these, we establish that physical constraints—either given by pairwise distances or the contactome—play a crucial role in shaping the network structure. For example, neuron positions are highly optimal in terms of distance from their neighbors. Yet, spatial constraints alone cannot capture the network topology, including the broad degree distribution. Conversely, the degree sequence alone is insufficient to recover the spatial structure. We resolve this apparent mismatch by formulating scalable maximum entropy models, incorporating both types of constraints. The resulting generative models have predictive power beyond the input data, as they capture several additional biological and network characteristics, like synaptic weights and graphlet statistics. We investigate the interplay of the spatial and topological structure of millimeter-scale neural connectomes in fly, mouse, and human. As a spatial observation, we demonstrate that the probability of synaptic connection decays exponentially with distance. Additionally, we show that the wiring length in neural connectomes is highly optimal. To quantify the physical constraints on synapse formation, we construct the physical contact network for each organism and demonstrate that contact edge probability follows the same exponential functional form as the connectome. At the same time, we show that spatial constraints are necessary but not sufficient to reconstruct the connectome topology. We present maximum-entropy models capturing key spatial and topological aspects of the connectomes and demonstrate their predictive power beyond the input data.},

To gain a deeper understanding of this network architecture, it is essential to extract simple rules from its intricate structure. This study aimed to compress and simplify the architecture, with a particular focus on interpreting patterns of functional connectivity in 2.5 hr of electrical activity from a vast number of neurons in acutely sliced mouse brains. Here, we combined two distinct methods together: automatic compression and network analysis. Firstly, for automatic compression, we trained an artificial neural network named NNE (neural network embedding). This allowed us to reduce the connectivity to features, be represented only by 13% of the original neuron count. Secondly, to decipher the topology, we concentrated on the variability among the compressed features and compared them with 15 distinct network metrics. Specifically, we introduced new metrics that had not previously existed, termed as indirect-adjacent degree and neighbor hub ratio. Our results conclusively demonstrated that these new metrics could better explain approximately 40%–45% of the features. This finding highlighted the critical role of NNE in facilitating the development of innovative metrics, because some of the features extracted by NNE were not captured by the currently existed network metrics. Neural network embedding can compress large connectivity and has led to new metrics like indirect-adjacency degree and neighbor hub ratio.},

  abstract     = {Understanding the complex neural mechanisms underlying speech and music perception remains a multifaceted challenge. In this study, we investigated neural dynamics using human intracranial recordings. Employing a novel approach based on low-dimensional reduction techniques, the Manifold Density Flow (MDF), we quantified the complexity of brain dynamics during naturalistic speech and music listening and during resting state. Our results reveal higher complexity in patterns of interdependence between different brain regions during speech and music listening compared with rest, suggesting that the cognitive demands of speech and music listening drive the brain dynamics toward states not observed during rest. Moreover, speech listening has more complexity than music, highlighting the nuanced differences in cognitive demands between these two auditory domains. Additionally, we validated the efficacy of the MDF method through experimentation on a toy model and compared its effectiveness in capturing the complexity of brain dynamics induced by cognitive tasks with another established technique in the literature. Overall, our findings provide a new method to quantify the complexity of brain activity by studying its temporal evolution on a low-dimensional manifold, suggesting insights that are invisible to traditional methodologies in the contexts of speech and music perception. Understanding how the human brain processes speech and music is a fascinating and complex challenge. Our study explores how brain activity changes when people listen to naturalistic speech compared to when they listen to music or when they are at rest. We found that both speech and music engage the brain in more complex patterns of activity than rest, with speech leading to even greater complexity. To achieve this, we used a novel method to study the brain's activity in a simplified, low-dimensional space, representing the dynamical evolution of brain activity across different regions. This approach highlights the demands placed on brain function during the perception of speech and music, providing new insights into how we process these auditory experiences.},

  abstract     = {Advanced meditation consists of states and stages of practice that unfold with mastery and time. Dynamic functional connectivity (DFC) analysis of fMRI could identify brain states underlying advanced meditation. We conducted an intensive DFC case study of a meditator who completed 27 runs of jhāna advanced absorptive concentration meditation (ACAM-J), concurrently with 7-T fMRI and phenomenological reporting. We identified three brain states that marked differences between ACAM-J and nonmeditative control conditions. These states were characterized as a DMN-anticorrelated brain state, a hyperconnected brain state, and a sparsely connected brain state. Our analyses indicate higher prevalence of the DMN-anticorrelated brain state during ACAM-J than control states, and the prevalence increased significantly with deeper ACAM-J states. The hyperconnected brain state was also more common during ACAM-J and was characterized by elevated thalamocortical connectivity and somatomotor network connectivity. The hyperconnected brain state significantly decreased over the course of ACAM-J, associating with self-reports of wider attention and diminished physical sensations. This brain state may be related to sensory awareness. Advanced meditators have developed well-honed abilities to move in and out of different altered states of consciousness, and this study provides initial evidence that functional neuroimaging can objectively track their dynamics. Advanced meditation research investigates states and stages of practice that unfold with increasing mastery and time, which may include altered states of consciousness such as a diminished sense of self. In the current study, we examined a 7-T fMRI case study of jhāna , an advanced concentrative absorptive meditation (ACAM-J). Specifically, we examined the temporal properties of dynamic connectivity brain states that could reflect mental states and phenomena during ACAM-J. We identified two brain states that were more prevalent during ACAM-J than control conditions. One state, involving default-mode network anticorrelations with the rest of the brain, increased across ACAM-J. Another state, involving hyperconnectivity across many cortical networks, was correlated with reports of narrow attention and greater sensory awareness, as well as diminished across ACAM-J.},

  abstract     = {Distinct inhibitory cell types participate in cognitively relevant nested brain rhythms, and particular changes in such rhythms are known to occur in disease states. Specifically, the coexpression of theta and gamma rhythms in the hippocampus is believed to represent a general coding scheme, but cellular-based generation mechanisms for these coupled rhythms are currently unclear. We develop a population rate model of the CA1 hippocampus that encompasses circuits of three inhibitory cell types (bistratified cells and parvalbumin [PV]-expressing and cholecystokinin [CCK]-expressing basket cells) and pyramidal cells to examine this. We constrain parameters and perform numerical and theoretical analyses. The theory, in combination with the numerical explorations, predicts circuit motifs and specific cell-type mechanisms that are essential for the coexistence of theta and gamma oscillations. We find that CCK-expressing basket cells initiate the coupled rhythms and regularize theta, and PV-expressing basket cells enhance both theta and gamma rhythms. Pyramidal and bistratified cells govern the generation of theta rhythms, and PV-expressing basket and pyramidal cells play dominant roles in controlling theta frequencies. Our circuit motifs for the theta-gamma coupled rhythm generation could be applicable to other brain regions. There are many different types of inhibitory cells in our brains that are differentially affected in disease. Concomitantly, coupled rhythms change in particular ways with disease. To help understand cell-type-specific changes in coupled rhythms, we develop a mathematical network model that is both respective of the cell type and also amenable to analyses. We focus on theta-gamma coupled rhythms in the hippocampus and include three different inhibitory cell types in our model circuits. By combining a theoretical analysis and numerical explorations, we find distinct contributions of these inhibitory cell types to coupled rhythms and predict motifs that are essential for the expression of theta-gamma coupled rhythms. Moving forward, we can leverage our model insights to help unravel cell-type contributions in disease states.},

  abstract     = {The human brain is a complex system with high metabolic demands and extensive connectivity that requires control to balance energy consumption and functional efficiency over time. How this control is manifested on a whole-brain scale is largely unexplored, particularly what the associated costs are. Using the network control theory, here, we introduce a novel concept, time-averaged control energy (TCE), to quantify the cost of controlling human brain dynamics at rest, as measured from functional and diffusion MRI. Importantly, TCE spatially correlates with oxygen metabolism measures from the positron emission tomography, providing insight into the bioenergetic footing of resting-state control. Examining the temporal dimension of control costs, we find that brain state transitions along a hierarchical axis from sensory to association areas are more efficient in terms of control costs and more frequent within hierarchical groups than between. This inverse correlation between temporal control costs and state visits suggests a mechanism for maintaining functional diversity while minimizing energy expenditure. By unpacking the temporal dimension of control costs, we contribute to the neuroscientific understanding of how the brain governs its functionality while managing energy expenses. Understanding how the brain balances functional efficiency with energy conservation is a central question in neuroscience. The network control theory (NCT) views this question from a network perspective where the brain manages signal propagations along its structural connections to transition across desired activity states. Our study thus presents a novel framework based on the NCT to analyze the costs associated with transitioning across resting states, revealing that regions with high control costs on average are also metabolically demanding in terms of oxygen use. Our findings further show that transitions between sensory and association states are infrequent due to high control costs, while transitions within these states are more common. This suggests that the brain employs a mechanism to preserve functional diversity while minimizing energy costs.},

  abstract     = {Brain function can be modeled as dynamic interactions between functional sources at different spatial scales, and each spatial scale can contain its functional sources with unique information, thus using a single scale may provide an incomplete view of brain function. This paper introduces a novel approach, termed “telescopic independent component analysis (TICA),” designed to construct spatial functional hierarchies and estimate functional sources across multiple spatial scales using fMRI data. The method employs a recursive independent component analysis (ICA) strategy, leveraging information from a larger network to guide the extraction of information about smaller networks. We apply our model to the default mode network (DMN), visual network (VN), and right frontoparietal network (RFPN). We investigate further on the DMN by evaluating the difference between healthy people and individuals with schizophrenia. We show that the TICA approach can detect the spatial hierarchy of the DMN, VN, and RFPN. In addition, the TICA revealed DMN-associated group differences between cohorts that may not be captured if we focus on a single-scale ICA. In sum, our proposed approach represents a promising new tool for studying functional sources.},

  abstract     = {Human brain function dynamically adjusts to ever-changing stimuli from the external environment. Studies characterizing brain functional reconfiguration are, nevertheless, scarce. Here, we present a principled mathematical framework to quantify brain functional reconfiguration when engaging and disengaging from a stop signal task (SST). We apply tangent space projection (a Riemannian geometry mapping technique) to transform the functional connectomes (FCs) of 54 participants and quantify functional reconfiguration using the correlation distance of the resulting tangent-FCs. Our goal was to compare functional reconfigurations in individuals at risk for alcohol use disorder (AUD). We hypothesized that functional reconfigurations when transitioning to/from a task would be influenced by family history of AUD (FHA) and other AUD risk factors. Multilinear regression models showed that engaging and disengaging functional reconfiguration were associated with FHA and recent drinking. When engaging in the SST after a rest condition, functional reconfiguration was negatively associated with recent drinking, while functional reconfiguration when disengaging from the SST was negatively associated with FHA. In both models, several other factors contributed to the functional reconfiguration. This study demonstrates that tangent-FCs can characterize task-induced functional reconfiguration and that it is related to AUD risk. Human brain function constantly adapts to the external environment stimuli and transitions between cognitive states, which can be hindered by alcohol misuse and family history of alcohol use disorder (AUD). In this work, we used a novel methodology that applies Riemannian geometry concepts to functional connectivity to quantify functional reconfiguration of rest-to-task (engaging) and task-to-rest (disengaging) transitions. We ultimately aimed to determine the relationship between AUD risk factors and functional reconfiguration. Our findings showed that engaging functional reconfiguration was diminished in participants with a family history of AUD, whereas disengaging functional reconfiguration was diminished with greater recent drinking behavior. This study suggests that analysis of functional reconfiguration using Riemannian geometry is a promising avenue to better understand rest-to-task and task-to-rest brain transitions.},

  abstract     = {Computational modeling is a key tool for elucidating the neuronal mechanisms underlying epileptic activity. Despite considerable progress, existing models often lack realistic accuracy in representing electrophysiological epileptic activity. In this study, we used a comprehensive human brain model based on a neural mass model, which is tailored to the layered structure of the neocortex and incorporates patient-specific imaging data. This approach allowed the simulation of scalp EEGs in an epileptic patient suffering from type 2 focal cortical dysplasia (FCD). The simulation specifically addressed epileptic activity induced by FCD, faithfully reproducing intracranial interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs) recorded with electrocorticography. For constructing the patient-specific scalp EEG, we carefully defined a clear delineation of the epileptogenic zone by numerical simulations to ensure fidelity to the topography, polarity, and diffusion characteristics of IEDs. This nuanced approach improves the accuracy of the simulated EEG signal, provides a more accurate representation of epileptic activity, and enhances our understanding of the mechanism behind the epileptogenic networks. The accuracy of the model was confirmed by a postoperative reevaluation with a secondary EEG simulation that was consistent with the lesion’s removal. Ultimately, this personalized approach may prove instrumental in optimizing and tailoring epilepsy treatment strategies. This study aimed to create a neurophysiologically grounded computer model of focal epilepsy. This is a feature frequently lacking to simulations in this domain, making the translation from in silico to in vivo results questionable and difficult to understand for clinical electrophysiologists. We adapted a whole-brain neuronal mass model for EEG generation in various conscious states to replicate the EEG patterns of a type 2 focal cortical dysplasia (FCD), a condition associated with epilepsy. Our model successfully simulated both intracranial and scalp EEGs of a complex patient with type 2 FCD, who was later cured through surgery. Importantly, the simulated lesion location matched the patient’s epileptogenic zone, and removing this area in the model eliminated epileptic activity in the EEG, demonstrating the model’s accuracy.},

  abstract     = {Aberrant thalamocortical connectivity occurs together with visual hallucinations in various pathologies and drug-induced states, highlighting the need to better understand how thalamocortical interactions may contribute to hallucinatory phenomena. Flicker light stimulation (FLS) at 10-Hz reliably and selectively induces transient visual hallucinations in healthy participants. Arrhythmic flicker elicits fewer hallucinatory effects while delivering equal amounts of visual stimulation, together facilitating a well-controlled experimental setup to investigate the neural correlates of visual hallucinations driven by flicker rhythmicity. Using rhythmic and arrhythmic FLS during fMRI scanning, we found that rhythmic FLS elicited stronger activation in higher order visual cortices compared with arrhythmic control. Consistently, we found that rhythmic flicker selectively increased connectivity between ventroanterior thalamic nuclei and higher order visual cortices, which was also positively associated with the subjective intensity of visual hallucinatory effects. As these thalamic and cortical areas do not receive primary visual inputs, it suggests that the thalamocortical connectivity changes relate to a higher order function of the thalamus, such as in the coordination of cortical activity. In sum, we present novel evidence for the role of specific thalamocortical interactions with ventroanterior nuclei within visual hallucinatory experiences. Importantly, this can inform future clinical research into the mechanistic underpinnings of pathologic hallucinations. Flicker light stimulation induces an intense transient experience of elementary visual hallucinations, such as colored geometric patterns, that has phenomenal similarities to the visual experience induced by psychedelic drugs or during psychopathology. During fMRI scanning, we found that increased connectivity between ventroanterior thalamic nuclei and higher order visual cortices was associated with the reported intensity of the flicker-induced visual effects. Our results suggest that the role of thalamocortical hyperconnectivity during hallucinatory experiences may relate to a higher order function of the thalamus, such as the regulation of cortical activity. This novel finding results from a highly controlled experimental setup, which can be extended to inform the mechanistic underpinnings of hallucinatory experiences during psychopathology.},
