  abstract     = {With the recent Nobel Prize awarded for radical advances in protein discovery, foundation models (FMs) for exploring large combinatorial spaces promise to revolutionize many scientific fields. Artificial Life (ALife) has not yet integrated FMs, thus presenting a major opportunity for the field to alleviate the historical burden of relying chiefly on manual design and trial and error to discover the configurations of lifelike simulations. This article presents, for the first time, a successful realization of this opportunity using vision-language FMs. The proposed approach, called automated search for Artificial Life (ASAL), (a) finds simulations that produce target phenomena, (b) discovers simulations that generate temporally open-ended novelty, and (c) illuminates an entire space of interestingly diverse simulations. Because of the generality of FMs, ASAL works effectively across a diverse range of ALife substrates, including Boids, Particle Life, the Game of Life, Lenia, and neural cellular automata. A major result highlighting the potential of this technique is the discovery of previously unseen Lenia and Boids life-forms, as well as cellular automata that are open-ended like Conway’s Game of Life. Additionally, the use of FMs allows for the quantification of previously qualitative phenomena in a human-aligned way. This new paradigm promises to accelerate ALife research beyond what is possible through human ingenuity alone.},

  abstract     = {An analysis of the language we use in scientific practice is critical to developing more rigorous and sound methodologies. This article argues that how certain methods of description are commonly employed in cognitive science risks obscuring important features of an agent’s cognition. We propose to make explicit a method of description whereby the concept of cognitive distinctions is the core principle. A model of referential communication is developed and analyzed as a platform to compare methods of description. We demonstrate that cognitive distinctions, realized in a graph theoretic formalism, better describe the behavior and perspective of a simple model agent than other, less systematic or natural language–dependent methods. We then consider how different descriptions relate to one another in the broader methodological framework of minimally cognitive behavior. Finally, we explore the consequences of, and challenges for, cognitive distinctions as a useful concept and method in the tool kit of cognitive scientists.},

  abstract     = {Robot controllers are often optimized for a single robot in a single environment. This approach proves brittle, as such a controller will often fail to produce sensible behavior for a new morphology or environment. In comparison, animal gaits are robust and versatile. By observing animals, and attempting to extract general principles of locomotion from their movement, we aim to design a single, decentralized controller applicable to diverse morphologies and environments. The controller implements the three components of (a) undulation, (b) peristalsis, and (c) leg motion, which we believe are the essential elements in most animal gaits. This work is a first step toward a general controller. Accordingly, the controller has been evaluated on a limited range of simulated centipede-like robot morphologies. The centipede is chosen as inspiration because it moves using both body contractions and legged locomotion. For a controller to work in qualitatively different settings, it must also be able to exhibit qualitatively different behaviors. We find that six different modes of locomotion emerge from our controller in response to environmental and morphological changes. We also find that different parts of the centipede model can exhibit different modes of locomotion, simultaneously, based on local morphological features. This controller can potentially aid in the design or evolution of robots, by quickly testing the potential of a morphology, or be used to get insights about underlying locomotion principles in the centipede.},

Technically, the authors create an underwater virtual ecosystem consisting of a seaweed swarm and symbiotic fungi, created using procedural content generation via machine learning and rule-based methods. Moreover, the work features a unique cybernetic loop structure, incorporating audience observation and game token interactions. This virtual system is also symbolically influenced in real time by indoor carbon dioxide measurements, serving as an artistic metaphor for the broader impacts of climate change. This integration with the physical game machine underscores the fragile relationship between human activities and the environment under severe global climate change and immerses the audience in the challenging balance between sustainability and profit seeking in this context.},

Although their origins trace back to the 1940s birth of cybernetics, they were able to develop properly only as modern information technology became available. In this perspective, I offer a personal (and thus biased) account of the expectations and limitations of these fields, some of which have their roots in the limits of formal systems. I use interactions, self-organization, emergence, and balance to compare different aspects of complexity, ALife, and AI.

The generated structures have a level of complexity (in terms of the number of cells) comparable to multicellular biological organisms. In this article, we investigate the evolvability of the development of a complex structure inspired by the “French flag” problem: an “Italian Anubis” (a three-dimensional, doglike figure patterned in three colors). Genes during development are triggered in ET at specific developmental stages, and the fitness of individuals during simulated evolution is calculated after a certain stage. When this evaluation stage was allowed to evolve, genes that were triggered at later stages of development tended to be incorporated into the genome later during evolutionary runs. This suggests the emergence of the property of terminal addition in this system. When the principle of terminal addition was explicitly incorporated into ET, and was the sole mechanism for introducing morphological innovation, evolvability improved markedly, leading to the development of structures much more closely approximating the target at a much lower computational cost.},

However, the model is static, and genomes are typically small, allowing observations over only a short adaptive period. Here we introduce an extension to the model that allows the experimenter to set the velocity at which the landscape changes independently from other parameters, such as the ruggedness or the mutation rate. We find that, similar to the previously observed complexity catastrophe, where evolution comes to a halt when environments become too complex due to overly high degrees of epistasis, here the same phenomenon occurs when changes happen too rapidly. Our expanded model also preserves essential properties of the static NK landscape, allowing for proper comparisons between static and dynamic landscapes.},

The NK model reappears in the article “Continuous Evolution in the NK Treadmill Model,” in which Mehra and Hintze extend the originally static model to allow it to change in a parameterized manner and investigate how evolution behaves at different rates of change. In “Evolvability in Artificial Development of Large Complex Structures and the Principle of Terminal Addition,” Fontana and Wróbel examine evo-devo processes and the emergence of modification to the later stages of a developmental process.In a historical and philosophical perspective, Gershenson offers a personal account that compares various aspects of, and raises questions about, the closely related topics of “Complexity, Artificial Life, and Artificial Intelligence.”Games are an interesting subtopic in ALife, useful both for understanding complex systems and for outreach. In “Benefit Game 2.0: Alien Seaweed Swarms—Exploring the Interplay of Human Activity and Environmental Sustainability,” Fei, Wu, and Zhang present their immersive seaweed ecosystem simulation game that responds not only to audience input but also to the real-world environmental state. Moving from plant to animal behavior, in “Behaviour Diversity in a Walking and Climbing Centipede-Like Virtual Creature,” Norstein et al. take inspiration from arthropod multilegged locomotion to help develop robotic controllers robust to morphological and environmental variation.In their methodological article “Cognitive Distinctions as a Language for Cognitive Science: Comparing Methods of Description in a Model of Referential Communication,” Gaul and Izquierdo examine the effect of choices of language and terminology on theoretical frameworks in cognitive science and use a model to expose the consequences. In another methodological work, “Automating the Search for Artificial Life With Foundation Models,” Kumar et al. exploit concepts of artificial intelligence’s foundation models to develop a new approach to searching for lifelike behaviors, applied to a range of ALife simulations.We thank all the authors for the time and care they took to perform their research and present their work.

  abstract     = {The evolution of living beings with continuous and consistent progress toward adaptation and ways to model evolution along principles as close as possible to Darwin’s are important areas of focus in Artificial Life. Though genetic algorithms and evolutionary strategies are good methods for modeling selection, crossover, and mutation, biological systems are undeniably spatially distributed processes in which living organisms interact with locally available individuals rather than with the entire population at once. This work presents a model for the survival of organisms during a change in the environment to a less favorable one, putting them at risk of extinction, such as many organisms experience today under climate change or local habitat loss or fragmentation. Local spatial structure of resources and environmental quality also impacts the capacity of an evolving population to adapt. The problem is considered on a probabilistic cellular automaton with update rules based on the principles of genetic algorithms. To carry out simulations according to the described model, the Darwinian cellular automata are introduced, and the software has been designed with the code available open source. An experimental evaluation of the behavioral characteristics of the model was carried out, completed by a critical evaluation of the results obtained, parametrically describing conditions and thresholds under which extinction or survival of the population may occur.},

  abstract     = {We have discovered a novel transition rule for binary cellular automata (CAs) that yields self-replicating structures across two spatial and temporal scales from sparse random initial conditions. Lower-level, shape-shifting clusters frequently follow a transient attractor trajectory, generating new clusters, some of which periodically self-duplicate. When the initial distribution of live cells is sufficiently sparse, these clusters coalesce into larger formations that also self-replicate. These formations may further form the boundaries of an expanding complex on an even larger scale. This rule, dubbed “Outlier,” is rotationally symmetric and applies to 2-D Moore neighborhoods. It was evolved through genetic programming during an extensive search for rules that foster open-ended evolution in CAs. While self-replicating structures, both crafted and emergent, have been created in CAs with state sets intentionally designed for this purpose, the Outlier may be the first known rule to facilitate nontrivial emergent self-replication across two spatial scales in binary CAs.},

Over the last few decades, this line of Artificial Life research has since undergone several important developments. Although it experienced a relative dormancy of activity for a while, the recent rise of interest in open-ended evolution and the success of continuous cellular automata models have brought researchers’ attention back to how to make spatiotemporal patterns self-reproduce and evolve within spatially distributed computational media. This article provides a review of the relevant literature on this topic over the past 25 years and highlights the major accomplishments made so far, the challenges being faced, and promising future research directions.},

In this work, we study the dynamics of interacting random Boolean networks, focusing on attractor properties and response to perturbations. We observe that the properties of isolated critical Boolean networks are substantially maintained also in interaction settings, while interactions bias the dynamics of chaotic and ordered networks toward that of critical cells. The increase in attractors observed in multicellular scenarios, compared to single cells, allows us to hypothesize that biological processes, such as ontogeny and cell differentiation, leverage interactions to modulate individual and collective cell responses.},

  abstract     = {Distributed dynamical systems like cellular automata (CAs) and random boolean networks (RBNs) (and everything in between) have long been used as models to understand computation and self-replication in biology, morphogenesis, gene regulation, life-as-it-could-be, and the Universe.Such complex system models have been extensively studied mathematically and experimentally in all their different variations, such as synchronous and asynchronous updates and dynamic automata networks that can grow and change their structure, including components and interconnection topology, as well as their robustness.Wuensche (1994) investigated the basins of attraction of CAs and RBNs and even suggested that they are the “ghost in the machine.”Recent advances in such models, including continuous CAs, such as Lenia (Chan, 2019), and neural-based CAs (Mordvintsev et al., 2020), have been proposed as substrates to study the emergence of a more general intelligence (Gregor &amp; Besse, 2021; Hamon et al., 2022), thanks to their propensity to support properties like self-organization, emergence, and open-endedness.But what can we learn from CAs and distributed dynamical system models about intelligence? And how can CAs and distributed dynamical system models be used to study the emergence of intelligence?To address such questions, we organized a workshop at the 2023 Artificial Life conference in Sapporo, Japan, that aimed to bridge the gap between the ALife community working with CAs and distributed dynamical systems and the broader artificial intelligence (AI) community interested in exploring concepts from complex systems, self-organization, and Artificial Life for AI research and machine learning.The workshop was named “The Distributed Ghost,” inspired by the Artificial Life conference theme “Ghost in the Machine.” The workshop program (Nichele et al., 2023) consisted of two invited keynotes, by Bert Chan and Andrea Roli, and a set of 10 abstract-based presentations. After the workshop, four high-quality contributions were extended as full papers and have been collected in this special issue.In “Cell-Cell Interactions: How Coupled Boolean Networks Tend to Criticality,” Braccini and coauthors investigate interacting RBNs as a theoretical model of multicellular biological systems with cell–cell interactions. They find not only that the interacting versions of RBNs show the same general trends of dynamical properties as their individual counterparts but also that the networks in ordered or chaotic regimes tend toward a critical regime when turned into interacting networks (while individually critical networks remain critical). This result suggests the importance of the interconnected nature of a distributed multicellular system for its system-level criticality (and thus biological functioning) as a whole.In “Emergence of Self-Replicating Hierarchical Structures in a Binary Cellular Automaton,” using genetic programming to explore the vast space of binary CAs (with Moore neighborhood and rotationally symmetric rule sets in two dimensions) for open-ended temporal evolution, Yang reports on the discovery of a novel CA rule, the “Outlier.” Most strikingly, this CA and therefore also its distinct chiral twin (obtained by mirroring the rule table) are unique among known models of self-replication in that structures exhibit replication across two different nested spatiotemporal scales. Moreover, the self-replicating structures appear from sparse random initial conditions and follow characteristic attractor trajectories involving such multiscale self-replication.In “Survival and Evolutionary Adaptation of Populations Under Disruptive Habitat Change: A Study With Darwinian Cellular Automata,” Derets and Nehaniv focus on the evolution of living beings, emphasizing continuous adaptation akin to Darwinian principles within the domain of Artificial Life. The introduced model addresses the survival of organisms amid environmental changes, particularly during transitions to less favorable conditions (modeled using percolation theory). A probabilistic CA is employed based on update rules derived from genetic algorithm principles. Finally, an experimental investigation of the model’s behavioral features is presented, analyzing parameters and thresholds governing population survival or extinction outcomes.In “Self-Reproduction and Evolution in Cellular Automata: 25 Years After Evoloops,” Sayama and Nehaniv offer a comprehensive review of advancements in CAs subjected to Darwinian evolution. The contribution marks the 25th anniversary of the seminal work on evoloops (Sayama, 1999). The review highlights significant developments, ongoing challenges, and prospective research avenues in Artificial Life, focusing on self-reproducing and evolving patterns in distributed computational environments.We are continuing the tradition of the “distributed series” in 2024 by organizing a special session named “The Distributed Viking” at the Artificial Life conference in Copenhagen, Denmark.

  abstract     = {Reproduction, development, and individual interactions are vital yet complex natural processes. Tierra (an ALife model proposed by Thomas Ray) and cellular automata, which can manage these aspects in a complex manner, are significantly limited in their ability to express morphology and behavior. In contrast, the virtual creatures proposed by Karl Sims have a considerably higher degree of freedom in terms of morphology and behavior. However, they also exhibit a limited capacity for processes like reproduction, development, and individual interactions. In addition, they employ genetic algorithms, which can result in a loss of biological diversity, as their implementation necessitates predefining a fitness function. Contrarily, the evolution of natural life is determined by mutation and natural selection, rather than by a human-defined fitness function. This study carefully extracts the characteristics of these models to propose a new Artificial Life model that can simulate reproduction, development, and individual interactions while exhibiting a high expressive power for morphology and behavior. The model is based on the concept of incorporating Tierra and cellular automata mechanisms into a cell that moves freely in 3-D space. In this model, no predefined fitness function or form that qualifies as a living creature exists. In other words, this approach can be rephrased as searching for persistent patterns, which is similar to the approach of Conway’s Game of Life. The primary objective of this study was to conduct a proof-of-concept demonstration to showcase the capabilities of this model. Guideless simulation by the proposed model using mutation and natural selection resulted in the formation of two types of creatures—dumbbell shaped and reticulated. These creatures exhibit intriguing features, exploiting the degrees of freedom inherent to the proposed model. Particularly noteworthy is their unique method of reproduction, which bears a striking resemblance to that of real organisms. These results reinforce the potential of this approach in modeling intricate processes observed in actual organisms and its ability to generate virtual creatures with intriguing ecologies.},

  abstract     = {It is very important to model the behavior of protocells as basic lifelike artificial organisms more and more accurately from the level of genomes to the level of populations. A better understanding of basic protocell communities may help us in describing more complex ecological systems accurately. In this article, we propose a new comprehensive, bilevel mathematical model of a community of three protocell species (one generalist and two specialists ). The aim is to achieve a model that is as basic/fundamental as possible while already displaying mutation, selection, and complex population dynamics phenomena (like competitive exclusion and keystone species). At the microlevel of genetic codes, the protocells and their mutations are modeled with Turing machines (TMs). The specialists arise from the generalist by means of mutation. Then the species are put into a common habitat, where, at the macrolevel of populations, they have to compete for the available nutrients, a part of which they themselves can produce. Because of different kinds of mutations, the running times of the species as TMs (algorithms) are different. This feature is passed on to the macrolevel as different reproduction times. At the macrolevel, a discrete-time dynamic model describes the competition. The model displays complex lifelike behavior known from population ecology, including the so-called competitive exclusion principle and the effect of keystone species. In future works, the bilevel model will have a good chance of serving as a simple and useful tool for studying more lifelike phenomena (like evolution) in their pure/abstract form.},

Two preceding standard research articles neatly align with the special issue in that they also consider the dynamics of interacting biological systems using traditional computational approaches (cellular automata, Tierra-like assembly languages, feed-forward neural networks, and Turing machines) for modeling activities, from a behavioral rather than an intelligential perspective. Tackling central themes of ALife, they study the emergence of persistent morphologies and the behaviors of mutant specialists and generalists competing for resources in a well-mixed environment.
