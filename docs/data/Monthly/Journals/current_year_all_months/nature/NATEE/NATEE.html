Methods have been proposed to infer ancestral gene order, but they lack scalability, limiting the depth to which gene neighbourhood evolution can be traced back. Here we introduce edgeHOG, a tool designed for accurate ancestral gene order inference with linear time complexity. We validated edgeHOG on various benchmarks and applied it to the entire OMA orthology database, encompassing 2,845 extant genomes across all domains of life. We reconstructed ancestral gene order for 1,133 ancestral genomes, including ancestral contigs for the last common ancestor of eukaryotes, dating back around 1.8 billion years, and observed significant functional association among neighbouring genes. EdgeHOG also dates gene adjacencies, allowing the detection of both conserved gene clusters and chromosomal rearrangements. A new method to reconstruct ancestral genomes is used to estimate contigs of the last common ancestor of eukaryotes and to infer features such as the age of gene adjacencies and chromosome rearrangements.},

  abstract     = {The partitioning of ecological niches is a fundamental component of species diversification in adaptive radiations. However, it is currently unknown if and how such bursts of organismal diversity are influenced by temporal niche partitioning, wherein species avoid competition by being active or sleeping during different time windows. Here we address this question through profiling temporal activity patterns in the exceptionally diverse fauna of cichlid fishes from the African Lake Tanganyika. By integrating week-long longitudinal behavioural recordings of over 500 individuals from 60 species with eco-morphological and genomic information, we provide two lines of evidence that temporal niche partitioning occurs in this massive adaptive radiation. First, Tanganyikan cichlids exhibit all known circadian temporal activity patterns (diurnal, nocturnal, crepuscular and cathemeral) and display substantial interspecific variation in daily amounts of locomotion. Second, many species with similar habitat and diet niches occupy distinct temporal niches. Moreover, our results suggest that shifts between diurnal and nocturnal activity patterns are facilitated by a crepuscular intermediate state. Genome-wide association studies indicate that the genetics underlying activity patterns is complex, with different clades associated with different combinations of variants. The identified variants were not associated with core circadian clock genes but with genes implicated in synapse function. These observations indicate that temporal niche partitioning may have contributed to adaptive radiation in cichlids and that many genes are associated with the diversity and evolution of temporal activity patterns. An analysis of behavioural, eco-morphological and genomic data in 60 species of Lake Tanganyika cichlids reveals a remarkable diversity of temporal activity patterns across species, suggesting that temporal niche partitioning may have played a role in the adaptive diversification of this group.},

  abstract     = {Deleterious mutations are ubiquitous in natural populations and, when expressed, reduce fitness. However, the specific nature of these mutations and the ways in which they impact fitness remain poorly understood. We exploited recent advances in genomics to predict deleterious mutations in the black grouse (Lyrurus tetrix), an iconic lekking species. Analysis of 190 whole genomes alongside comprehensive life-history data including repeated measures of behavioural, ornamental and fitness traits revealed that deleterious mutations identified through evolutionary conservation and functional prediction are associated with reduced male lifetime mating success. Both homozygous and heterozygous deleterious mutations reduce fitness, indicating that fully and partially recessive mutations contribute towards an individual’s realized mutation load. Notably, deleterious mutations in promotors have disproportionally negative fitness effects, suggesting that they impair an individual’s ability to dynamically adjust gene expression to meet context-dependent functional demands. Finally, deleterious mutations impact male mating success by reducing lek attendance rather than by altering the expression of ornamental traits, suggesting that behaviour serves as an honest indicator of genetic quality. These findings offer insights into the genetic architecture of male fitness and illuminate the complex interplay between genetic variation and phenotypic expression. Analysis of whole genomes and life-history data of male black grouse shows that deleterious mutations, especially those in promotors, reduce lifetime reproductive success.},

Here we present a spatial description of the global, bathymetric and taxonomic extent of the benthic marine class Asteroidea using a compiled dataset of ~200,000 species-level occurrence records. We used these data to produce comparisons of sea-floor richness between hemispheres and oceans. We show that species richness is significantly correlated with temperature and nutrient flux despite markedly different distributional patterns across oceans and latitudes that suggest further influence from a combination of additional geographic, taxonomic and environmental factors. The relative importance of temperature and nutrient levels also varies greatly with depth. Species richness peaks in the shallow-water tropics, closely matching sea-floor temperature variation, but at bathyal and abyssal depths it is higher at temperate latitudes, where nutrient flux levels are of greater importance. We show that richness in the deep benthos is restricted below ~1.5 °C, with this strong thermal threshold consistent among oceans irrespective of other factors. Global trends in species richness in the deep sea are poorly explored. This study uses occurrence records of Asteroidea to show that species richness in the deep benthos is restricted below ~1.5 °C but correlated with temperature and nutrient flux, despite different patterns across oceans and latitudes.},

Here we quantify the impact of climate change on bird populations from across the world by combining models of their response to environmental conditions with a climate attribution framework. We identify a dominant role of intensified heat extremes compared to changes in average temperature and precipitation. Increased interannual exposure to hot extremes reduces annual abundance growth rates most strongly in lower-latitude tropical regions, with effects robust when controlling for changing human industrial pressure and other long-term drivers. Compared to a counterfactual without human-driven climate change, the historical intensification of heat extremes has caused a 25–38% reduction in the level of abundance of tropical birds, which has accumulated from 1950 to 2020. Across observed tropical bird populations, impacts of climate change have typically been larger than direct human pressure, the opposite across sub-tropical regions. Overall, these results showcase how human-driven climate change is already reshaping biodiversity globally and may explain reported declines of birds in undisturbed tropical habitats. Climate change poses a growing threat to biodiversity, but disentangling its overall impact from other anthropogenic stressors is challenging. Here the authors use a data-driven climate attribution framework to identify a key role of heat extremes in causing changes in bird populations globally.},

The vast size and remote location of the continent introduce substantial uncertainty in understanding and predicting these threats.

We identified ten emerging conservation challenges across six thematic categories. Key issues included extreme precipitation, emerging animal pathogens, human pandemics, security threats, reduced cooperation among Antarctic Treaty parties and potential agricultural expansion. Several of these challenges stem from persistent underlying drivers, revealing how longstanding processes are giving rise to new and increasingly acute conservation concerns. Others, driven by global disruptions, have no historical precedent in the region but increasingly constrain decision-making and international coordination. This horizon scan reveals substantial limitations in the ability of the Antarctic Treaty system to address these challenges, underscoring the need to reassess existing governance mechanisms to protect the unique ecosystems of Antarctica and its vital role in the global climate system. A horizon scan of international respondents identifies and discusses ten developing challenges in Antarctic conservation, revealing an increased emphasis on challenges related to governance, geopolitics and economics compared to a similar scan from 2012.},

  abstract     = {Detecting the imprints of global environmental change on biological communities is a paramount task for ecological research. But a lack of standardized long-term biomonitoring data prevents a deeper understanding of biodiversity change in the Anthropocene. Novel sources of data for analysing biodiversity change across time and space are urgently needed. By metabarcoding highly standardized biota samples from a long-term pollution monitoring archive in Germany, we here analyse four decades of community diversity for tens of thousands of species across the tree of life. The archived samples—tree leaves, marine macroalgae, and marine and limnic mussels—represent natural community DNA samplers, preserving a taxonomically diverse imprint of their associated biodiversity at the time of collection. We find no evidence for universal diversity declines at the local scale. Instead, a gradual compositional turnover emerges as a universal pattern of temporal biodiversity change in Germany’s terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. This turnover results in biotic homogenization in most terrestrial and marine communities. Limnic communities, in contrast, rather differentiate across space, probably due to the immigration of different invasive species into different sites. Our study highlights the immense promise of alternative sample sources to provide standardized time series data of biodiversity change in the Anthropocene. This study explores four decades of biodiversity change across the tree of life in Germany’s terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems by sequencing standardized biota samples from a long-term pollution monitoring archive.},

  abstract     = {Terrestrial carbon (C) sink has long been recognized as trending upwards, yet its recent slowdown raises concerns about accelerating climate change. Variations in wetland C sequestration are hypothesized to play a key role in this shift. Here we mapped annual water levels in global wetlands from 2000 to 2020 using 2,295 field-based measurements and predicted the spatiotemporal pattern of wetland net ecosystem production (NEP) in conjunction with other environmental factors. By compiling 934 in situ observations, we estimated a global mean wetland NEP of 56.4 (44.0‒68.8) gC m−2 yr−1. Integrating the NEP dataset with environmental datasets and machine-learning models, we estimated the mean annual global wetland C sequestration between 2000 and 2020 to be 1,004 (961‒1,047) TgC, 70% of which originated from tropical wetlands. We observed a decline in global wetland C sinks until 2005, followed by an increase thereafter. Overall, wetland C sequestration was roughly stable during 2000‒2020, as gains in northern mid-to-high latitudes were fully overwhelmed by declines in the tropics and southern mid-to-high latitudes. Our findings highlight hydrological change as a dominant driver of increasing regional variability in wetland C sinks, while intensifying hydrological extremes under climate change may undermine the resilience of wetland C sinks and the ecosystem services they support. Here the authors identify hotspots for wetland carbon uptake and regions where wetland carbon sinks are most susceptible to hydrological shifts. They show that two decades of improved carbon sinks in northern mid- to high-latitude wetlands are offset by declining efficiencies elsewhere.},

Here we analyse global forest age dynamics from 2010 to 2020 using the Global Age Mapping Integration v2.0 dataset, alongside satellite-derived aboveground carbon (AGC) and atmospheric inversion-derived net CO2 flux data. We reveal widespread declines in forest age across the Amazon, Congo Basin, Southeast Asia and parts of Siberia, primarily driven by stand-replacing disturbances such as fire and harvest, leading to the replacement of older forests by younger stands. Meanwhile, forests in China, Europe and North America experienced net ageing. Globally, stand replacement resulted in substantial AGC losses, with old forests (&gt;200 years, ~98.0 MgC ha−1) transitioning to younger, carbon-poor stands (&lt;20 years, ~43.5 MgC ha−1), leading to a net AGC loss of ~0.14 PgC per year. Despite this, regions with high rates of young stands replacing old forests exhibited a temporary strengthening of the carbon sink, driven by the rapid regrowth of these young stands. Crucially, these young forests do not compensate for the long-term carbon storage of old forests. Our findings underscore the importance of protecting old forests while optimizing forest management strategies to maximize carbon gains and enhance climate mitigation. A global analysis reveals regional trends of net forest ageing but also that widespread stand-replacing disturbances, such as fire and harvest, are driving declining forest age in many areas, often accompanied by substantial losses in aboveground carbon stocks and shifts in carbon sink dynamics.},

  abstract     = {Although numerous studies have demonstrated a positive relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem stability, that is low temporal variability in ecosystem functions, the role of interspecific interactions in driving this relationship remains elusive. Here we develop a partitioning framework to disentangle the effects of interspecific interactions on ecosystem variability from those of interaction-independent processes. Applying this framework to competition models and biodiversity experiments in European and North American grasslands, we find that species-specific dynamics observable in monocultures (for example, environmental responses or demographic stochasticity), rather than interspecific interactions observable only in mixtures, explain much of the stabilizing effects of biodiversity on ecosystems. The weak net effect of interspecific interactions results from two counter-balancing effects: an interaction-driven increase in average species variability and an interaction-driven decrease in average species synchrony. We also find that interspecific interactions contributing to higher ecosystem functioning tend to reduce ecosystem variability. Our study provides a systematic empirical assessment of the role of interspecific interactions in shaping grassland ecosystem stability, challenging traditional assumptions about their importance and highlighting species-specific dynamics as the primary mechanism underlying the pervasive biodiversity–stability relationship. The role of interspecific interactions in biodiversity–ecosystem stability relationships is unclear.

  abstract     = {Understanding how plants adjust their hydraulic system to the environment is essential to predict how these organisms will respond to global change. Here we compiled a dataset and performed meta-analysis on 223 studies on plastic and evolutionary adjustments of hydraulic traits to air temperature, CO2 concentration, irradiance, soil nutrient and water availability. On average, species plastically increased embolism resistance and sapwood area per leaf area under drier conditions, with a decrease in stem-specific hydraulic conductivity and water potential at the turgor loss point, which are consistent with adaptive responses. However, the average increased embolism resistance was not sufficient to compensate the reduction in the minimum water potential, implying a lower safety margin from lethal hydraulic failure under drought. These results point towards a general critical increase in the risk of hydraulic failure in future drier environments. Plastic responses to increased soil nutrient content and irradiance did not always align with those to drought, highlighting the potential for changes in light and nutrient conditions to modify plant hydraulic responses to climate-change-driven droughts. Plants across many ecosystems are increasingly exposed to dryness stress. Using meta-analysis, the authors show that plants can adjust their hydraulic traits in response to drought and other global change factors, but not equally across traits and not enough to prevent lethal hydraulic failure.},

  abstract     = {Tree diversity often increases stand-level growth, but whether neighbourhood diversity effects on individual tree growth change with climatic conditions remains unclear. Here, using 852,170 records of 113,701 individuals from 129 species in 15 tree diversity experiments across four biomes, we address this knowledge gap with a synthesis of tree growth data spanning a broad climate gradient. We examine how neighbourhood-scale (defined as a focal tree and the adjacent trees) taxonomic and functional diversity effects on tree growth vary with climate, both spatially (across sites) and temporally (within sites). Increasing species richness and trait dissimilarity from monospecific to high-diversity neighbourhoods enhanced individual tree growth by 7–13% on average. The positive diversity effect increased from dry to wet climates, contrasting with most prior studies, but was unaffected by interannual climatic variation within sites. Given that tree–tree interactions are ubiquitous and likely to interact with climate in both young and old forests, our findings suggest incorporating neighbourhood diversity as a management tool to enhance forest productivity, while considering underlying mechanisms and interactions with climate, thereby facilitating targeted and site-specific climate and biodiversity benefits. How tree diversity effects on ecosystem functioning vary along climatic gradients is unclear. Here, analysing data from 15 experimental forest sites, the authors show that tree growth responses to neighbourhood species diversity are stronger in wetter climates but are unaffected by interannual climatic variation within sites.},

  abstract     = {Precipitation effects on plant carbon uptake extend beyond immediate timeframes, reflecting temporal lags between rainfall and plant growth. Mechanisms and relative importance of such lagged effects are expected to vary across ecosystems. Here we draw on an extensive collections of productivity proxies from long-term ground measurements, satellite observations and model simulations to show that preceding-year precipitation exerts a comparable influence on plant productivity to current-year precipitation. Statistically supported lagged precipitation effects are detected in 13.4%–19.7% of the grids depending on the data source. In these sites, preceding-year precipitation positively controls current-year plant productivity in water-limited areas, while negative effects occur in some wet regions, such as tropical forests. While aridity emerges as the main driver of this spatial variability, machine learning-based spatial attribution also indicates interactions among plant traits, climatic conditions and soil properties. We also show that soil water dynamics, plant phenology and foliar structure might mediate lagged precipitation effects across time. Our findings highlight the role of preceding-year precipitation in global plant productivity. Precipitation is a key driver of plant growth. Here the authors integrate ground-based observations, remote sensing and process-based models to disentangle the relative contribution of preceding-year and current-year precipitation on plant productivity and identify its predictors across biomes.},

  abstract     = {Vegetation responses to soil moisture limitation play a key role in land–atmosphere interactions and are a major source of uncertainty in future projections of the global water and carbon cycles. Vegetation water-use strategies—that is, how plants regulate transpiration rates as the soil dries—are highly dynamic across space and time, presenting a major challenge to inferring ecosystem responses to water limitation. Here we show that, when aggregated globally, water-use strategies derived from point-based soil moisture observations exhibit emergent patterns across and within climates and vegetation types along a spectrum of aggressive to conservative responses to water limitation. Water use becomes more conservative, declining more rapidly as the soil dries, as mean annual precipitation increases and as woody cover increases from grasslands to savannahs to forests. We embed this empirical synthesis within an ecohydrological framework to show that key ecological (leaf area) and hydroclimatic (aridity) factors driving demand for water explain up to 77% of the variance in water-use strategies within ecosystem types. All biomes respond to ecological and hydroclimatic demand by shifting towards more aggressive water-use strategies. However, woodlands reach a threshold beyond which water use becomes increasingly conservative, probably reflecting the greater hydraulic risk and cost of tissue damage associated with sustaining high transpiration rates under water limitation for trees than grasses. These findings highlight the importance of characterizing the dynamic nature of vegetation water-use strategies to improve predictions of ecosystem responses to climate change. Vegetation responses to water limitation are difficult to predict due to large variation across space and time. A new analysis of global soil moisture dynamics reveals that water-use strategies vary systematically by vegetation type in response to ecological and climatic conditions.},

  abstract     = {Few high-latitude archaeological contexts are older than marine isotope stage (MIS) 15 and even fewer provide evidence of early human occupation during a glacial period. New discoveries at Old Park, Canterbury (UK), provide evidence of both the oldest accessible artefact-bearing sediment in northern Europe and cold-stage adaptation. Radiometric and palaeomagnetic dating places the earliest suggested occupation of this site between 773 thousand years ago (ka) and 607 ka, with hominin presence inferred during MIS 17–16. Two additional artefact-bearing stratigraphic units, dated to around 542 ka and 437 ka, strongly align with the MIS 14 and 12 cold stages, respectively. The latter unit contains convincing evidence of glacial-stage occupation by Acheulean hominins; fresh, unabraded flakes (including biface-thinning) between clearly defined glacial-aged sediments displaying mixed grassland palaeoenvironmental evidence. An historically collected assemblage of more than 330 handaxes is argued to be derived from both the MIS 17–16 and MIS 12 sediments, providing evidence of the earliest known Acheulean bifaces in northern Europe, and re-occupation by Acheulean populations 200,000 years later. Together, Old Park provides evidence for Lower Palaeolithic hominins reoccupying a location over several mid-Pleistocene MIS cycles, early human presence above 51° latitude during a glacial stage and handaxe production in northern Europe from MIS 17 to 16. The authors report Acheulean hominin occupation of eastern Britain during glacial marine isotope stages 17–16 and again in glacial marine isotope stage 12 via stone tools in sediments dated to 712,000 to 424,000 years ago.},

  abstract     = {All plants and animals are host to a community of microorganisms, their microbiotas, which have crucial influences on the life history and performance of their hosts. Despite the importance of such host–microbiota relationships, relatively little is known about the role microbiotas have in mediating evolution of the host and entire host–microbe assemblages. This knowledge gap is partly due to the lack of theoretical frameworks that generate testable predictions on the evolutionary dynamics of host–microbiota systems. In this Perspective, we argue that the foundation for such frameworks exists in evolutionary theory. We highlight four examples of theoretical models—niche construction, indirect genetic effects, maternal effects and multilevel selection—that capture important aspects of host–microbiome evolution. We outline how each of these frameworks can provide key insights into the evolution of host–microbiota systems while also suggesting expansions of current theory to incorporate processes unique to host–microbe assemblages; for instance, focusing on nuances in microbiota transmission and ecological microbial community dynamics. Expanding evolutionary theory to accommodate host–microbiota associations is key for a more integrative understanding of evolution, and the approach outlined here can guide future empirical research on the function and evolution of these ubiquitous interactions. This Perspective discusses how well-established theoretical models of evolution can be adapted to study and generate testable predictions about the evolutionary dynamics of host–microbiota associations.},

  abstract     = {More than 10 years following the onset of the sea star wasting disease (SSWD) epidemic, affecting over 20 asteroid species from Mexico to Alaska, the causative agent has been elusive. SSWD killed billions of the most susceptible species, sunflower sea stars (Pycnopodia helianthoides), initiating a trophic cascade involving unchecked urchin population growth and the widespread loss of kelp forests. Identifying the causative agent underpins the development of recovery strategies. Here we induced disease and subsequent mortality in exposure experiments using tissue extracts, coelomic fluid and effluent water from wasting sunflower sea stars, with no mortality in controls. Deep sequencing of diseased sea star coelomic fluid samples from experiments and field outbreaks revealed a dominant proportion of reads assigned to the bacterium Vibrio pectenicida. Fulfilling Koch’s postulates, V. pectenicida strain FHCF-3, cultured from the coelomic fluid of a diseased sunflower sea star, caused disease and mortality in exposed sunflower sea stars, demonstrating that it is a causative agent of SSWD. This discovery will enable recovery efforts for sea stars and the ecosystems affected by their decline by facilitating culture-based experimental research and broad-scale screening for pathogen presence and abundance in the laboratory and field. The causative agent of sea star wasting disease has been elusive. This study used genetic datasets and experimental exposures to demonstrate that a strain of the bacterium Vibrio pectenicida caused disease and mortality in sea stars.},

  abstract     = {Radiogenic strontium isotopes (87Sr/86Sr) and the alkaline earth ratios (AERs) Sr/Ca and Ba/Ca in fossil dental enamel can inform the habitat, residence and life histories of early hominins recovered from the Pleistocene cradle-of-humankind sites of Gauteng, South Africa. Key questions, which may be addressed with these indices, are the relative exploitation of wet versus dry botanic regimes and whether early hominins dispersed in a manner similar to that of chimpanzees (characterized by male philopatry and female dispersal at puberty) or to that of humans (who are not so characterized). Here we developed 28 new dental chronologies in 20 Paranthropus robustus teeth from Swartkrans and Kromdraai. Resulting geochemical time series demonstrate that, while maternal 87Sr/86Sr in earlier-forming teeth varies widely, third molar 87Sr/86Sr, derived from postweaning solid foods, progressively converges to 0.7306 ± 0.0035 (± 2 s.d.), which we express as the local isotopically delineated exploitation area (LIDEA). The spatial resolution of LIDEA is determined using a bioavailable 87Sr/86Sr isoscape. In this environmental context, we interpret LIDEA as a quantifiable signal indicating eurytopy (generalization), with some 30% of Sr deriving from riparian woodland habitats. With regard to residence, many individuals arrived at the site after second molar mineralization, while some matured locally, demonstrating both male and female dispersal as well as lifelong local residence. Analysis of both 87Sr/86Sr and the AERs further highlights concomitant patterns, as well as numerous periodicities that may be related to resource depletion, seasonality or lunar cycles. Strontium analysis of Paranthropus robustus teeth from two South African sites reveals that the Pleistocene hominin probably exploited both savanna and riparian woodland habitats, had a home-range size compatible with that of present-day hunter-gatherers and had periodic ranging patterns. While some individuals lived their lives in the same place, others dispersed during their lifetime.},

  abstract     = {Most faunas from the Mesozoic era were dominated by sauropod dinosaurs, the largest terrestrial animals to ever exist. These megaherbivores were remarkably diverse and widely distributed. Here we study three Late Jurassic faunas from the USA, Portugal and Tanzania, each approximately 150 million years old, which are known for their extreme sauropod diversity. Whereas general taxonomic composition was similar in these three faunas, the major clades differed in relative abundance. Moreover, their depositional strata record distinct climatic regimes. Using dental microwear texture analysis, we investigated the impact of these climate regimes and the resulting food availability on the different sauropod taxa. Wear patterns in camarasaurid macronarians show minimal variation across different climate regimes, supporting previous studies suggesting that these animals migrated to follow their preferred climate niche and food source. North American camarasaurids show similar wear patterns to those of Portuguese turiasaurs, another broad-crowned taxon, which did not exist in the Jurassic of North America. By contrast, where camarasaurids and turiasaurs co-occurred in Portugal, their microwear patterns are distinct, suggesting niche differentiation to avoid ecological competition between these two clades. Flagellicaudatan diplodocoids display highly variable wear patterns, indicating limited migration (and therefore seasonal variation in diet), which aligns with observed biogeography patterns in the USA. Early-branching titanosauriforms show highly distinct wear patterns between different climate regimes, which can probably be attributed to different abrasive loads in the respective habitats. Our results demonstrate that dental microwear texture analysis not only records dietary preferences but also reveals behaviour such as competition and migration related to dietary niches in past ecosystems. The authors compare tooth wear patterns from three Late Jurassic sauropod faunas in North America, Portugal and Tanzania and find that different regions and climate regimes seem to have had distinctive impacts on dental wear of megaherbivores in these areas, revealing habitat and ecological niche information.},

  abstract     = {An enlarged sternum with a prominent keel is a central feature of the flight apparatus of modern birds. However, sterna of near-bird dinosaurs (Pennaraptora) and early avialans are either substantially different from those of living birds or absent altogether, raising questions about how specialized sternal structures evolved in birds and how they are related to function. This remains poorly understood because of the fragmentary nature of the fossil record, and the challenges in inferring form and function from crushed fossils. We use ancestral character estimations to trace sternal trait acquisition through the bird stem group, and multivariate phylogenetic regressions to analyse relationships between sternum morphology, body mass and flight capabilities. We find that sternum evolution was episodic: basal members of Pennaraptora had proportionally small sterna, which became larger and more craniocaudally elongated in Avialae. This enlargement precedes the appearance of a midline ridge, a possible precursor of the sternal keel, in Pygostylia. Sternum size increased again in crownward Ornithuromorpha, alongside a fully formed sternal keel and enlarged caudal projections, both critical areas of flight muscle attachment. Sternal experimentation in relation to flight characteristics occurs several times throughout Pennaraptora, including within Paraves and Enantiornithes, indicating that powered flight may have evolved several times before proliferating in crown-group birds. The extant avian sternum is highly adapted to powered flight, but understanding of its early evolution is hindered by patchy fossil representation and the fact that where preserved, sterna in near-bird dinosaurs and early avialans are substantially different. To overcome this, the authors use ancestral character estimations and find that sternum evolution was episodic and experimental in relation to flight characteristics.},

However, the role of plasmids in supporting the evolution of encoded genes remains underexplored due to challenges in experimentally manipulating key parameters such as plasmid copy number and mutation rate. Here we developed a strategy for controlling copy number in the plasmid-based Saccharomyces cerevisiae continuous evolution system, OrthoRep, and used our resulting capabilities to investigate the evolution of a conditionally essential gene under varying copy number and mutation rate conditions. Our results show that low copy number facilitated the faster enrichment of beneficial alleles whereas high copy number promoted robustness through the maintenance of allelic diversity. High copy number also slowed the removal of deleterious mutations and increased the fraction of non-functional alleles that could hitchhike during evolution. This study highlights the nuanced relationships between plasmid copy number, mutation rate and evolutionary outcomes, providing insights into the adaptive dynamics of genes encoded on multicopy plasmids and nominating OrthoRep as a versatile tool for studying plasmid evolution. In an experimental multicopy plasmid evolution system that allows manipulation of mutation rate and copy number, low copy number promoted enrichment of beneficial alleles whereas high copy number maintained allelic diversity.},

Detection of this infection has been limited to a small number of individuals, leaving much to be learned about its global distribution and transmissibility. Its discovery in wild rodent populations in the United Kingdom and Ireland also raises questions about its zoonotic potential. Here, we raise further awareness of this disease via analyses of two exceptionally well preserved M. lepromatosis genomes obtained from 4,000-year-old human remains of two adult males from the archaeological sites of El Cerrito and La Herradura in Northern Chile. This formed the basis of genomic comparisons between ancient and modern forms of the pathogen. We demonstrate an unexpected long history of M. lepromatosis in the Americas, which contrasts with the more recent Eurasian history of the closely related Mycobacterium leprae. We offer relevant perspectives on its evolution while providing an incentive for further disease monitoring in both humans and other potential reservoir species in the Americas and elsewhere. Recovery of ancient Mycobacterium lepromatosis genomes in 4,000-year-old human remains from Chile demonstrates that this causal agent of Hansen’s disease has a long history in the Americas, predating the colonial period by millennia.},

  abstract     = {The relationship between landscape fragmentation and vegetation resilience is uncertain. Here we use multiple satellite-based tree cover data and vegetation indices to quantify the apparent effects of fragmentation on global forest resilience and potential mechanisms thereof. We measure fragmentation as edge density, patch density and mean patch area of tree cover patches, and measure resilience as one-lag temporal autocorrelation of vegetation indices. We find a statistically significant (P &lt; 0.05) fragmentation–resilience relationship in about 77% of fragmented forests, but the direction varies across biomes. In tropical and temperate forests, fragmentation is linked to increased local temperature and atmospheric dryness, resulting in a negative fragmentation–resilience relationship. Conversely, in boreal forests, fragmentation is associated with decreased atmospheric dryness and enhanced light resource, thereby increasing forest resilience. Our results reconcile competing hypotheses and highlight the importance of accounting for fragmentation when predicting shifts in ecosystem resilience under disturbances. These findings also suggest the necessity of biome-targeted forest management strategies for climate change mitigation and adaptation. Human-driven forest fragmentation could have major impacts on ecosystem functioning. This global analysis shows that the relationship between fragmentation and vegetation resilience in forests may differ depending on bioclimatic region and local environmental conditions.},

There are two major challenges: it is difficult to separate the effect of the genotype–phenotype (GP) map from that of natural selection when analysing natural diversity, and most extant phenotypes evolved long ago in species whose GP maps cannot be recovered. Here, using two reconstructed ancestral transcription factors that are closely related but differ in function, we created libraries containing all possible amino acid combinations at historically variable sites in the proteins’ DNA binding interface (the genotypes) and measured their capacity to specifically bind DNA elements containing all possible combinations of nucleotides at historically variable sites (the phenotypes). The ancestral GP maps were strongly anisotropic (the distribution of phenotypes encoded by genotypes is highly non-uniform) and heterogeneous (the phenotypes accessible around each genotype vary greatly among genotypes), but the extent and direction of these properties differed substantially between the maps. In both cases, these properties steered evolution towards the lineage-specific phenotypes that evolved during history. Our findings establish that ancient properties of the GP relationship were causal factors in the evolutionary process that produced present-day patterns of functional conservation and diversity. A combination of ancestral reconstruction and deep mutational scanning to examine the genotype–phenotype maps of steroid receptors shows that the properties of ancestral genotype–phenotype maps determine the lineage-specific evolution of DNA specificity.},

Using a field dataset of 971 bird species sampled in forest and cattle pasture across 13 biogeographic regions of Colombia, we quantify biodiversity losses from local to near-national scales. Losses are on average 60% worse at the pan-Colombian scale than in individual regions, with underestimation remaining until six to seven biogeographic regions are sampled. Regional losses greatly exceed local losses when beta-diversity is high due to reduced species turnover in pasture across geographic space and elevation. Extrapolation from local-scale studies causes major underestimation of biodiversity loss, emphasizing the need to incorporate spatial structure into measures of change. Analysis of data on 971 bird species in natural habitat and cattle pasture in Colombia finds that near-national-scale losses of bird diversity greatly exceed losses recorded at the local scale, suggesting that extrapolations from local studies will severely underestimate biodiversity losses.},

  abstract     = {Bats are the only mammals capable of self-powered flight, an evolutionary innovation based on the transformation of forelimbs into wings. The bat wing is characterized by an extreme elongation of the second to fifth digits with a wing membrane called the chiropatagium connecting them. Here we investigated the developmental and cellular origin of this structure by comparing bat and mouse limbs using omics tools and single-cell analyses. Despite the substantial morphological differences between the species, we observed an overall conservation of cell populations and gene expression patterns including interdigital apoptosis. Single-cell analyses of micro-dissected embryonic chiropatagium identified a specific fibroblast population, independent of apoptosis-associated interdigital cells, as the origin of this tissue. These distal cells express a conserved gene programme including the transcription factors MEIS2 and TBX3, which are commonly known to specify and pattern the early proximal limb. Transgenic ectopic expression of MEIS2 and TBX3 in mouse distal limb cells resulted in the activation of genes expressed during wing development and phenotypic changes related to wing morphology, such as the fusion of digits. Our results elucidate fundamental molecular mechanisms of bat wing development and illustrate how drastic morphological changes can be achieved through repurposing of existing developmental programmes during evolution. Single-cell comparison of developing bat and mouse limbs reveals conservation of cell populations and gene expression patterns, and suggests repurposing of genes involved in proximal limb development for wing evolution.},

  abstract     = {The extraordinary variation in male guppy (Poecilia reticulata) colouration is a powerful model for studying the interplay of natural and sexual selection. However, the complexity of this variation has hampered the high-resolution characterization and determination of the genetic architecture underlying male guppy colour and clouded our understanding of how this exceptional level of diversity is maintained. Here we identify the heritability and genetic basis of male colour variation using convolutional neural networks for high-resolution phenotyping coupled with selection experiments, controlled pedigrees and whole-genome resequencing for a genome-wide association study of colour traits. Our phenotypic and genomic results converge to show that colour patterning in guppies is a combination of many heritable features, each with a largely independent genetic architecture spanning the entire genome. Autosomally inherited ornaments are polygenic, with significant contributions from loci involved in neural crest cell migration. Unusually, the results of our genome-wide association study suggest that gene duplicates from the autosomes to the Y chromosome are responsible for much of the sex-linked variation in colour in guppies, providing a potential mechanism for the maintenance of variation of this classic model trait. Guppy colouration is a very diverse trait under natural and sexual selection. Using a combination of high-resolution phenotyping and genomic analysis, the authors reveal the genetic architecture of this complex trait.},

  abstract     = {Deadwood is a major carbon source in forests, and yet the fate of this carbon remains a gap in our understanding of global carbon cycling. Lignin, the most recalcitrant biopolymer in wood, is mainly decayed through extracellular enzymatic and chemical processes initiated by white-rot fungi. However, the intracellular conversion of lignin decay products has been overlooked in the fungal kingdom. Here we integrate comparative genomic and phylogenetic analyses to understand the distribution and evolution of enzymes responsible for modifying lignin-related aromatic compounds—such as decarboxylases, hydroxylases, dioxygenases and other downstream ring-cleavage enzymes—that funnel carbon to central metabolism across the bacterial and the fungal kingdoms. We demonstrate that specific fungal lineages conserve these enzyme families, and that the abilities to enzymatically depolymerize lignin and catabolize lignin-related aromatic compounds are not necessarily coupled. Our analyses also reveal an expanded substrate specificity of aromatic ring-cleavage enzymes during fungal evolution, as well as a clade of extracellular enzymes among them, broadening the spatial range of these biochemical capabilities. Together, our results highlight a large diversity of fungal enzymes and hosts that warrant further investigation for inclusion into carbon cycling models and biotechnological applications for the conversion of aromatic compounds. This study uses comparative genomics and phylogenetics to analyse the distribution and evolution of key enzymes involved in the catabolism of lignin-related aromatic compounds in the bacterial and fungal kingdoms.},

  abstract     = {Across the world, human (anthropophonic) sounds add to sounds of biological (biophonic) and geophysical (geophonic) origin, with human contributions including both speech and technophony (sounds of technological devices). To characterize society’s contribution to the global soundscapes, we used passive acoustic recorders at 139 sites across 6 continents, sampling both urban green spaces and nearby pristine sites continuously for 3 years in a paired design. Recordings were characterized by bird species richness and by 14 complementary acoustic indices. By relating each index to seasonal, diurnal, climatic and anthropogenic factors, we show here that latitude, time of day and day of year each predict a substantial proportion of variation in key metrics of biophony—whereas anthropophony (speech and traffic) show less predictable patterns. Compared to pristine sites, the soundscape of urban green spaces is more dominated by technophony and less diverse in terms of acoustic energy across frequencies and time steps, with less instances of quiet. We conclude that the global soundscape is formed from a highly predictable rhythm in biophony, with added noise from geophony and anthropophony. At urban sites, animals experience an increasingly noisy background of sound, which poses challenges to efficient communication. Analysis of soundscape data from 139 globally distributed sites reveals that sounds of biological origin exhibit predictable rhythms depending on location and season, whereas sounds of anthropogenic origin are less predictable. Comparisons between paired urban–rural sites show that urban green spaces are noisier and dominated by sounds of technological origin.},

  abstract     = {Numerous leaf-level experiments suggest that plant intrinsic water-use efficiency (iWUE) increases under elevated CO2 because of reduced stomatal conductance and enhanced photosynthesis. However, it remains elusive whether this response can be extrapolated to the ecosystem scale, because confounding factors and compensating feedbacks are often involved in ecosystem iWUE variations. Here we develop a machine learning-based framework to disentangle the ecosystem-scale CO2 effects on iWUE and its two components, canopy conductance (Gc) and gross primary productivity (GPP), based on global networks of long-term eddy covariance observations. Our results show widespread CO2-induced enhancement of iWUE across diverse ecosystems, driven predominantly by Gc reduction rather than GPP stimulation. Moreover, three divergent response types are identified across the studied ecosystems, based on the strength and significance of CO2-driven Gc reduction and GPP enhancement, indicating spatially non-uniform responses to rising CO2. Nutrient supply, water availability and biome types are found to be critical factors regulating this spatial heterogeneity. Overall, our study provides observational insights into ecosystem-scale CO2 fertilization effects. Such understandings are essential to inform terrestrial biosphere models for better projections of carbon and water cycles given the intensified changing climate in a CO2-rich future. A machine learning approach using long-term observations of eddy covariance finds that the increase in plant intrinsic water-use efficiency under higher CO2 levels, across diverse ecosystems, is driven primarily by reduction in canopy conductance, rather than by stimulation of gross primary productivity.},

We recommend key steps to resolve the disconnect between empirical research and simulation models accounting for well-established plankton processes with an aim to increase the utility of such models for applied uses. A central challenge is characterizing the complexity of plankton diversity and activity in ways that are amenable to model incorporation. We argue that experts in empirical science are best placed to advise the development of next-generation models to address these challenges, and we propose a series of actions to achieve that engagement, including involvement of these experts in the design and exploitation of plankton digital twins. Plankton models have crucial applications in ecosystem management and climate change projections.

However, there is currently a lack of large-scale, systematic underpinning data needed to examine this issue. Here, using an integrative approach that combines field experiments, extensive global metagenomic data and microbial culturing, we show that warming enriches bacteria with ARGs and VFGs, increases metabolic complexity and adaptability in bacteria, and accelerates genetic alterations related to ARG and VFGs development. Our validation experiments confirm that the warming effect is more pronounced in colder regions. Machine learning predictions further suggest that warming will increase the soil ARG abundance, especially in some areas that rely heavily on fossil fuels. These results suggest another major negative consequence of global warming, highlighting the importance of developing and implementing sustainability policies that simultaneously combat climate change and antibiotic resistance. A combination of metagenomic data from experimental and natural warming with microbial culturing experiments shows that warming increases the potential of evolution of antibiotic resistance in soil bacteria.},

  abstract     = {Ambitious international commitments have been made to preserve biodiversity, with the goal of preventing extinctions and maintaining ecosystem resilience, yet the efficacy of large-scale protection for preventing near-term extinctions remains unclear. Here, we used a trait-based approach to show that global actions—such as the immediate abatement of all threats across at least half of species ranges for ~10,000 bird species—will only prevent half of the projected species extinctions and functional diversity loss attributable to current and future threats in the next 100 years. Nonetheless, targeted recovery programmes prioritizing the protection of the 100 most functionally unique threatened birds could avoid 68% of projected functional diversity loss. Actions targeting ‘habitat loss and degradation’ will prevent the greatest number of species extinctions and proportion of functional diversity loss relative to other drivers of extinction, whereas control of ‘hunting and collection’ and ‘disturbance and accidental mortality’ would save fewer species but disproportionately boost functional richness. These findings show that conservation of avian diversity requires action partitioned across all drivers of decline and highlight the importance of understanding and mitigating the ecological impacts of species extinctions that are predicted to occur even under optimistic levels of conservation action. Projections of extinctions of bird species and losses of functional diversity over the next 100 years suggest that even immediate and widespread threat abatement would be insufficient to prevent losses, and targeted recovery programmes must also be implemented to conserve avian diversity.},

  abstract     = {The regulation of gene expression is crucial for the functional integration of evolutionarily young genes, particularly those that emerge de novo. However, the regulatory programmes governing the expression of de novo genes remain unknown. To address this, we applied computational methods to single-cell RNA sequencing data, identifying key transcription factors probably instrumental in regulating de novo genes. We found that transcription factors do not have the same propensity for regulating de novo genes; some transcription factors regulate more de novo genes than others. Leveraging genetic and genomic tools in Drosophila, we further examined the role of two key transcription factors, achintya and vismay, and the regulatory architecture of new genes. Our findings identify key transcription factors associated with the expression of de novo genes and highlight how transcription factors, and possibly their duplications, are linked to the expressional regulation of de novo genes. A combination of computational methods applied to single-cell RNA sequencing data and genetic experiments shows that a small number of transcription factors are involved in the regulation of many de novo genes in Drosophila melanogaster.},

  abstract     = {How fetal and maternal cell types have co-evolved to enable mammalian placentation poses a unique evolutionary puzzle. Here we integrate and compare single-cell transcriptomes from six species bracketing therian mammal diversity: opossum (a marsupial), Malagasy common tenrec (an afrotherian), mouse and guinea pig (rodents), and macaque and human (primates). We identify a conserved transcriptomic signature of invasive trophoblast across eutherians, probably representing a cell type family that radiated with the evolution of haemochorial placentation. In the maternal stroma, comparative analysis reveals that the endocrine decidual cell evolved from an immunomodulatory predecidual cell type retained in Tenrec and resembling early human decidua. Fetal and maternal cell signalling shows a pronounced tendency towards disambiguation—the exclusive expression of ligands by only one partner—although few ligand–receptor pairs follow an escalatory arms race dynamic. Finally, we reconstruct the uteroplacental cell–cell communication networks of extinct mammalian ancestors, identifying signalling innovations and widespread integration of fetal trophoblast and maternal decidual cells into signalling networks. Together, these results reveal a dynamic history of cell type innovation and co-evolution at the fetal–maternal interface. Single-cell transcriptomes from the fetal–maternal interface of six species of mammals reveal a conserved gene expression signature of invasive trophoblast, stepwise evolution of decidual stromal cell types and co-evolutionary patterns in cell–cell signalling.},

  abstract     = {Environmental stressors have exacerbated the collapse of marine ecosystems during mass extinctions. However, the survival strategies of marine species during mass extinctions remain unclear. Here, we investigated morphological evolution of brachiopods across the Permian–Triassic mass extinction (PTME) using a database of 3,225 specimens representing 1,061 species and foraminifera across the PTME and early Toarcian oceanic anoxic event (T-OAE) using a database of 757 specimens representing 12 species. We found a significant reduction in the number and proportion (plicae length/shell length) of shell plicae of brachiopods (36.4% and 60.0%, respectively) across the PTME and a significant decrease in the shell thickness of foraminifera (18.9% and 42.4% across the PTME and 36.9–61.8% across the T-OAE). We calculated that these adaptive strategies could reduce the energetic costs of calcification by more than half for brachiopods across the PTME, and by ~20–62% for foraminifera across the PTME and T-OAE, to compensate for the elevated cost of calcification due to environmental and ecological pressures. We propose that simplification of morphological features, such as reduced shell ornamentation and shell thinning, serves as a potential economic strategy for calcifying organisms to cope with extinction events by reducing energy demands, but further studies with a broader range of taxa and extinction events are needed to confirm the generality of this bioenergetic strategy. The authors assess shell thickness and ornamentation in brachiopods during the Permian–Triassic mass extinction (PTME) and in foraminifera during both the PTME and early Toarcian oceanic anoxic event, finding that both groups reduced their morphological complexity and thus possibly saved on energetic costs during these stressful events.},

  abstract     = {The role of rapid adaptation during species invasions has historically been minimized with the assumption that introductions consist of few colonists and limited genetic diversity. While overwhelming evidence suggests that rapid adaptation is more prevalent than originally assumed, the demographic and adaptive processes underlying successful invasions remain unresolved. Here we leverage a large whole-genome sequence dataset to investigate the relative roles of colonization history and adaptation during the worldwide invasion of the forage crop, Trifolium repens (Fabaceae). We show that introduced populations encompass high levels of genetic variation with little evidence of bottlenecks. Independent colonization histories on different continents are evident from genome-wide population structure. Five haploblocks—large haplotypes with limited recombination—on three chromosomes exist as standing genetic variation within the native and introduced ranges and exhibit strong signatures of parallel climate-associated adaptation across continents. Field experiments in the native and introduced ranges demonstrate that three of the haploblocks strongly affect fitness and exhibit patterns of selection consistent with local adaptation across each range. Our results provide strong evidence that large-effect structural variants contribute substantially to rapid and parallel adaptation of an introduced species throughout the world. Whole-genome sequences and field experiments focusing on the global invasive forage crop, Trifolium repens, show high levels of genetic variation across continents and parallel signatures of selection in five haploblocks.},

  abstract     = {Species identification using DNA barcodes has revolutionized biodiversity sciences. However, conventional barcoding methods may lack power and universal applicability across the tree of life. Alternative methods based on whole genome sequencing are hard to scale due to large data requirements. Here we develop a novel DNA-based identification method, varKoding, using exceptionally low-coverage genome skim data to create two-dimensional images representing the genomic signature of a species. Using these representations, we train neural networks for taxonomic identification. Applying a taxonomically verified novel genomic dataset of Malpighiales plant accessions, we optimize training hyperparameters and find the highest performance by combining a transformer architecture with a new modified chaos game representation. Greater than 91% precision is achieved despite minimal input data, exceeding alternative methods tested. We illustrate the broad utility of varKoding across several focal clades of eukaryotes and prokaryotes. We also train a model capable of identifying all species in the Sequence Read Archive of the National Center for Biotechnology Information using less than 10 Mbp sequencing data with 96% precision and 95% recall and robust to sequencing platforms. The varKoding approach offers enhanced computational efficiency and scalability, minimal data inputs robust to sequencing details and modularity for further development in biodiversity science. This study develops a barcoding method that uses machine learning models and low-coverage genome sequences for species identification across all domains of life.},

  abstract     = {Terrestrial ecosystems have been serving as a strong carbon sink that offsets one-quarter of anthropogenic CO2 emissions. Carbon use efficiency (CUE), the percentage of photosynthesized carbon that is available for biomass production and other secondary carbon products, is one factor determining the carbon sink size. The global variation in CUE remains unclear, however, as recent reports disagree over the responses of CUE to temperature, dryness, forest types and stand age, and there are limited direct observations to constrain the related uncertainty. Here, we propose to infer CUE from spatially distributed observations of land–atmosphere CO2 exchange from global eddy covariance sites based on the degree of ecosystem respiration–photosynthesis coupling. Across 2,737 site-years, CUE derived from eddy covariance observations is 0.43 ± 0.12, consistent with previous inventory-based estimates (0.47 ± 0.12, n = 301) but with a better representation of spatial–temporal variation in CUE. We find that CUE consistently decreases with temperature, precipitation, light availability and stand age, with a substantial difference in the baseline CUE among biomes. Importantly, CUE of deciduous forests is typically 15% higher than that of evergreen forests, suggesting that over the long-term deciduous forests are more efficient in using photosynthate. Our study advances the understanding of the global variation in CUE and provides insights to guide best practices of forest conservation, management and restoration for carbon sequestration. The efficiency with which plants use carbon assimilated through photosynthesis has a key role in determining natureʼs capacity to offset carbon dioxide emissions. This study leverages global eddy covariance observations and ecological theory to reveal the patterns of vegetation carbon use efficiency worldwide.},

  abstract     = {The degree of synchronous versus compensatory dynamics among species is crucial for determining the stability of ecological communities. Although robust quantification of species synchrony requires long-term observations, empirical studies are often based on short time series. Here we explore the effects of time series length on species synchrony by combining spectral analysis, dynamical community models and empirical plant community data. Our theoretical analyses show that competition contributes to decreasing species synchrony over long timescales but causes increases in synchrony over short timescales. As a result, species synchrony tends to decrease with time series length. In model communities, species synchrony calculated from long time series decreases with species diversity and competition, whereas that calculated from short time series increases with diversity and competition. Empirical analyses of &gt;2,000 time series of plant communities support these theoretical predictions. Our analyses demonstrate that both species synchrony itself and its relationship with species richness can exhibit opposite patterns, depending on the length of time series, challenging the implicit assumption in ecological studies that observational length should not qualitatively alter patterns of interest. Our findings help reconcile results from theoretical and empirical studies on synchrony and have implications for sampling design. Species synchrony is considered a major mechanism of biodiversity–ecosystem stability relationships. Here, by combining theory, modelling and empirical work, the authors show that with time series length species synchrony decreases and its relationship with diversity switches from positive to negative.},

  abstract     = {Two distinct molecular machineries, T4SS and T6SS, have been found within the order Xanthomonadales to be involved in outcompeting other bacterial species through the secretion of toxic effector proteins. However, the ecological and evolutionary basis leading xanthomonads to evolve two secretion systems with such similar functions remain unclear. Here we show that Xanthomonas translucens (Xt) lineages have switched from an X-T4SS-mediated to T6SS-i4-mediated bacterial killing strategy. T6SS-i4 was only found in Xt strains lacking X-T4SS and vice versa, resulting in a patchy distribution of the two nanoweapons along the Xt phylogeny. Using genetic and fluorescence-based methods, we demonstrated that X-T4SS and T6SS-i4 are crucial for interbacterial competition in Xt, but not Xt T6SS-i3. Combined comparative genetic and phylogenetic analyses further revealed that the X-T4SS gene clusters have been subject to degradation and had several loss events, while T6SS-i4 was inserted through independent gain events. Overall, this research supports the ancestral state of X-T4SS and provides new insights into the mechanisms promoting Xt survival within their ecological niches. The bacterial plant pathogen genus Xanthomonas uses two distinct secretion systems for antibacterial competition. Here the authors show that some Xanthomonas lineages have switched from the ancestral X-T4SS state to T6SS-i4 despite the functional similarity of the systems, with X-T4SS gene clusters subject to degradation and loss and T6SS-i4-encoding sequences inserted through independent gains.},

  abstract     = {Biodiversity declines are accelerating globally, impacting ecosystem functioning, with consequences for human health. Interactions with biodiversity can be associated with human well-being benefits at the individual level, leading to substantial gains for society when scaled up across populations. However, existing research has not accounted for the species within ecological communities and their effect traits (for example, colours, sounds) that can elicit well-being responses. Many species’ effect traits are seasonal, and spatial variation in exposure to ecosystems by different sectors of society can lead to unequal opportunities to gain well-being. Here we use an interdisciplinary analytical approach to explore how the association between forest biodiversity and well-being fluctuates: (1) temporally, between different seasons and (2) spatially, across socio-economic deprivation gradients at a national scale (England and Wales). Species’ effect traits and participant well-being were derived through a series of seasonal participatory workshops and questionnaires that incorporated BIO-WELL (a biodiversity–well-being psychometric scale). By generating spatially explicit data, we could examine variability in forest biodiversity associated with human well-being across socio-economic deprivation gradients. Forest species’ effect trait richness was spatially heterogeneous, particularly in autumn, spring and summer. Broadleaf forests had greater species’ effect trait richness than other categories of forest. Forests with higher species’ effect trait richness and forests that were associated with higher self-reported participant well-being were in areas with the least socio-economic deprivation. Forest creation/restoration and nature–health interventions must recognize this ecological and social diversity to ensure initiatives are equitable and socially just. Applying a combined social science and trait-based ecology approach, the authors identify ecological traits in forests eliciting positive or negative well-being among human participants in England and Wales and find that forests with higher species’ effect trait richness, and those associated with higher participant well-being, are in areas with the least socio-economic deprivation.},

  abstract     = {Plant–plant facilitation is key to supporting species persistence within communities. However, as beneficiary species mature and compete with their benefactors, competition appears to dominate, suggesting that facilitation has a limited role in long-term community structuring. Here, we propose that facilitation can consistently enhance diversity when it occurs reciprocally between interacting species. Leveraging spatial associations between recruits and canopy species to infer recruiting interactions, we analyse a global dataset of 96 plant community recruitment networks, encompassing 2,403 non-transient populations across 23 countries. We show that ~90% of facilitation events were reciprocated, primarily mediated by intermediary species that transmit benefits through indirect facilitation loops, ultimately returning these benefits to the original benefactors. We find stronger positive effects within longer facilitation loops coupled with fewer negative interactions, which are essential conditions for benefactors to receive increased returns and, consequently, for the long-term persistence of indirect reciprocal facilitation. A positive empirical relationship between indirect reciprocity and species richness, substantiated by numerical simulations, indicates that these conditions also foster species coexistence. Our findings highlight the underappreciated role of indirect reciprocal facilitation in maintaining biodiversity. The relative importance of facilitative and competitive interactions in long-term community dynamics is debated. Here, the authors show that indirect reciprocal facilitation during recruitment in woody plant communities is widespread and linked with species richness, and explore its role in the coexistence of species.},

Although both groups coexisted during the Late Triassic, their limited sympatry is currently unexplained, indicating that ecological partitioning, potentially linked to palaeoclimate, influenced their early evolution. Here we analysed pterosauromorph (pterosaur + lagerpetid) palaeobiogeography using phylogeny-based probabilistic methods and integrating fossil occurrences with palaeoclimate data. Our results reveal distinct climatic preferences and dispersal histories: lagerpetids tolerated a broader range of conditions, including arid belts, enabling a widespread distribution from the Middle to early Late Triassic. Conversely, pterosaurs preferred wetter environments, resulting in a patchier geographical distribution that expanded only as humidity increased in the Late Triassic, probably following the Carnian Pluvial Event. This major environmental disturbance, potentially driven by changes in CO2-related thermal constraints and/or palaeogeography, appears to have had a key role in shaping early pterosauromorph evolution by promoting spatial segregation and distinct climatic niche occupation. The authors combine fossil occurrence data, phylogenies and climatic niche modelling to explore the palaeobiogeography of early pterosaurs and their non-flying close relatives, the lagerpetids.},

  abstract     = {Thousands of species are threatened by overexploitation, often driven by a complex interplay of local and global demand for various products—a dynamic frequently overlooked in wildlife trade policies. African pangolins, regarded as the world’s most trafficked wild mammals, are a heavily exploited group for different reasons across geographic scales. However, it remains unclear how far the burgeoning trafficking of their scales to Asia for medicine drives their exploitation compared with local meat demand. Here, using data collected from questionnaires distributed to 809 hunters and meat vendors in Nigeria, the world’s biggest hub for pangolin trafficking, we show that targeted pangolin hunts are uncommon in the country’s largest pangolin stronghold. Instead, 97% of pangolins are captured opportunistically or during general hunting, with 98% of these caught for meat and mostly either eaten by hunters (71%) or traded locally (27%), potentially due to the meat’s exceptionally high palatability. Meanwhile, around 70% of scales are discarded, with less than 30% sold. In addition, local meat prices are three to four times higher than those for scales. Our findings highlight the need to consider entire wildlife trade chains in international policies. Data from questionnaires distributed to hunters and wild meat vendors in Nigeria suggest that most captured pangolins are not specifically targeted and that the animals are primarily captured for their meat, which is mostly consumed by hunters’ households, rather than for their scales.},

  abstract     = {Coral reefs provide crucial ecosystem services to over 1 billion people globally and this intense pressure is causing their decline. Despite substantial investments in coral restoration and gradual advancements in coral propagation techniques, efforts focused on these ecosystem engineers are not yet fully restoring the ecological functions necessary for thriving reefs. This Perspective provides a road map for how to apply control theory to coral reef restoration, leveraging the framework’s proven effectiveness for optimizing the growth of crops and expanding it to a complex ecosystem. An in situ mesocosm called Coral Reef Arks is used as a platform to test control interventions and refine the approach. Four field experiments using Coral Reef Arks show how control interventions are used to alter ecological and environmental conditions and guide reef state factors towards desired targets. The results from these tests identify control interventions and parameter relationships that are integrated into predictive models to determine the scale at which to intervene on natural reefs. By using real-time ecological feedback, this control-based framework offers a path to identify precise, adaptable interventions that go beyond static conservation methods, providing a dynamic approach to maintain and enhance reef function in the face of ongoing environmental changes. Control theory provides a practical framework for managing system states and targeting interventions, such as in agriculture or forestry. This Perspective discusses the application of control theory to coral reef restoration and showcases the approach using mesocosm experiments.},

  abstract     = {The Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework (GBF) is the most ambitious multilateral agreement on biodiversity to date. It calls for a whole-of-government and whole-of-society approach to halt and reverse biodiversity loss worldwide. The GBF’s monitoring framework lays out how Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity are expected to report on their progress. An expert group convened by the Convention on Biological Diversity, the Ad Hoc Technical Expert Group (AHTEG) on Indicators, provided guidance on its implementation, including a gap analysis to identify the strengths and limitations of the indicators in the monitoring framework. We present the results of the AHTEG gap analysis and provide recommendations on implementing and improving monitoring of the GBF. We compare three implementation scenarios, from worst-case to best-case: (1) Parties only report on required headline and binary indicators; (2) Parties also report on all headline indicator disaggregations and (3) Parties additionally report on all optional component and complementary indicators. In each case, the monitoring framework covers (1) between 19–40%, (2) 22–41% and (3) 29–47% of the elements in the GBF’s goals and targets. Even in the best-case scenario (3), no indicators are available for 12% of the GBF’s elements. In practice, the coverage and thus effectiveness of the monitoring framework will depend on which indicators (required and optional) and disaggregations countries apply. Substantial investment is required to collect the necessary data to compute indicators, infer change and effectively monitor progress. We highlight important next steps to progressively improve the efficacy of the monitoring framework. This paper presents the outcomes of the gap analysis performed by the Ad Hoc Technical Expert Group on Indicators to assess current indicators in the monitoring framework of the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework and provides recommendations for how Parties can implement monitoring.},

  abstract     = {The genomic basis of cladogenesis and adaptive evolutionary change has intrigued biologists for decades. Here we show that the tectonics of genome evolution in clitellates, a clade composed of most freshwater and all terrestrial species of the phylum Annelida, is characterized by extensive genome-wide scrambling that resulted in a massive loss of macrosynteny between marine annelids and clitellates. These massive rearrangements included the formation of putative neocentromeres with newly acquired transposable elements and preceded a further period of genome-wide reshaping events, potentially triggered by the loss of genes involved in genome stability and homoeostasis of cell division. Notably, whereas these rearrangements broke short-range interactions observed between Hox genes in marine annelids, they were reformed as long-range interactions in clitellates. Our findings reveal extensive genomic reshaping in clitellates at both the linear (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) levels, suggesting that unlike in other animal lineages where synteny conservation constrains structural evolution, clitellates exhibit a remarkable tolerance for chromosomal rearrangements. Our study thus suggests that the genomic landscape of Clitellata resulted from a rare burst of genomic changes that ended a long period of stability that persists across large phylogenetic distances. An analysis of annelid genomes reveals massive reshuffling of chromosomes in the ancestral lineage leading to clitellates, a clade composed of non-marine annelids, with potential implications for the adaptation of clitellates to freshwater and terrestrial environments.},

  abstract     = {The cephalopod and vertebrate visual systems are a textbook example of convergent evolution with unknown molecular underpinnings. Here we characterize 98,537 single-cell transcriptomes in the bobtail squid Euprymna berryi to understand how the cephalopod retina and optic lobes relate to the vertebrate retina. We confirm the overall relative simplicity of the cephalopod retina but identify two related photoreceptor cell subtypes expressing distinct r-opsins. By contrast, the adult optic lobe contains a diverse repertoire of neuronal and glial cell types, with a predominance of dopaminergic neurons. We show that cephalopod-specific gene duplicates probably contributed to this cell type diversification. Comparing neuronal cell population in the optic lobes of hatchlings and adults, we reveal a switch towards dopaminergic neurotransmitter usage with age, indicative of a maturation process. We further identify an FMRF-amide-based retrograde signal from the optic lobe towards the retina that supports the functional analogy of the cephalopod optic lobe cortex and the vertebrate inner retina in visual signal processing from a molecular standpoint. Finally, comparative analyses with vertebrate and arthropod cells suggest a scenario in which two photoreceptor types and two neuronal populations may have already been present in the eye of the bilaterian ancestor. An analysis of single-cell transcriptomes from the retina and optic lobe of the bobtail squid characterizes the cellular basis of the complex visual system of this cephalopod and provides insights into the convergent evolution of the neurons in the vertebrate neuroretina and cephalopod optic lobe.},

While such geographic redistributions have been extensively reported, an assessment of species’ success in limiting their exposure to novel conditions is missing. Here we report on a method to account for biases in tens of millions of species observations and evaluate how 406 bird species native to the United States and Canada have mitigated their environmental niche loss using geographical redistribution. We find that most redistributions have only been partially effective at mitigating exposure to climate change. Over 20 years, species, on average, have redistributed their summertime ranges by ~0.64° north, averting their expected exposure to warming by ~1.28 °C, which is roughly half the warming they would have experienced if they had remained stationary. Meanwhile, species have only mitigated ~0.47 °C (11% of expected warming) in winter, and nearly all have experienced warming of &gt;2 °C. Species moving the farthest north and possessing traits associated with dispersal have succeeded most in limiting their niche loss. Species’ historical niches are becoming increasingly mismatched with contemporary climates, even in a highly mobile taxon, raising concerns about the ability of other wildlife to persist in a warmer world. It is unclear whether shifts in the geographic range of species can keep pace with ongoing climate change. This analysis of 406 species of North American birds reveals that mismatches between species’ niches and modern climates are increasing even for highly mobile species.},

Here we assess how the functional structure, diversity and temporal stability of 150 agricultural grasslands responded to large variations in land use intensification, namely, different intensities of fertilization, grazing and mowing. Using multi-site time series (2008–2020) of plant trait distributions, we identify two thresholds where the functional structure, diversity and stability of grasslands changed dramatically. The first threshold occurred between unfertilized and fertilized grasslands, with maximization of trait evenness indicating the persistence of plant species with diverse resource-use strategies in extensively managed grasslands. The second threshold occurred when fertilization exceeded 80 kg N ha−1 yr−1 or when grazing exceeded 500 livestock units days ha−1 yr−1, beyond which the most intensively managed grasslands were functionally poor, highly unstable and vulnerable to extreme weather events. These findings allow us to quantify the level of perturbation beyond which grasslands depart from a high biodiversity state and show that highly intensive management pushes the system to a more unstable state. The identified thresholds may provide targets for sustainable management and fertilization practices. Land use intensification is a major driver of biodiversity change and ecosystem functioning. Here the authors identify thresholds of grassland plant community structure and stability in response to land use intensification.},

  abstract     = {Predicting species interactions (links) within ecological networks is crucial for advancing our understanding of ecosystem functioning and responses of communities to environmental changes. Transductive link prediction models are often used but are constrained by sparse, incomplete data and are limited to single networks. We addressed these issues using an inductive link prediction (ILP) approach to predict interactions within and between ecological networks by pooling data across communities and applying transfer learning. We evaluated the performance of our ILP model on 538 networks across four community types: plant–seed disperser, plant–pollinator, host–parasite and plant–herbivore, and found that it achieved higher precision and F1 scores than transductive models. However, cross-community prediction efficacy varied, with better performance when plant–seed disperser and host–parasite networks were used as training and test sets, compared with when plant–pollinator and plant–herbivore networks were used. Finally, leveraging the generalizability of ILP, we developed a pretrained model that ecologists could readily use to make instant predictions for their networks. This Article highlights the potential of ILP to improve prediction of ecological interactions, enabling generalization across diverse ecological contexts and bridging critical data gaps. Data limitations pose a pervasive challenge to ecological network studies. Here the authors combine inductive link prediction with transfer learning to enable cross-network link estimation and offer a generalizable framework for predicting missing ecological interactions.},

Protecting older regenerating forests that already hold substantial carbon and biodiversity value, while promoting natural regeneration in young secondary forests in regions where forests are likely to persist long term, is vital for effective forest restoration. Key questions therefore include understanding the age distribution of naturally regenerating forests pan-tropically and which environmental or socio-economic conditions predict increased longevity in regenerating forests. Here, using a time series of forest cover data (1990–2023) to map the age of regenerating tropical moist forests, we identify 51 Mha of regenerating tropical moist forest, of which &gt;50% is ≤5 years old and under high deforestation pressure, whereas only 6% (3 Mha) is ≥20 years old and located predominantly in the tropical Americas. Location and forest characteristics in the surrounding landscape best predict the age of regenerating forests, with older forests located in areas with high forest integrity and extent, and low forest loss. Realizing the environmental and social values of naturally regenerating forests requires urgent financial, political and societal mechanisms to facilitate the long-term persistence of restoration. Natural forest regeneration is key to biodiversity conservation and climate change mitigation. Here the authors present a high-resolution time-series map of the age of regenerating tropical moist forests and find that most are ≤5 years old, with forest characteristics and geography explaining patterns better than climate or human pressure.},

Their regional species pools have experienced distinct historical and eco-evolutionary pressures, leading to an expected context-dependent organization of biodiversity. Here we identify a general spatial organization within biogeographical regions of terrestrial and marine vertebrates, invertebrates and plants (more than 30,000 species). We detect seven types of areas in these biogeographical regions that reflect unique combinations of four fundamental aspects of biodiversity (species richness, range size, endemicity and biogeographical transitions). These areas form ordered layers from the core to the transition zones of the biogeographical regions, reflecting gradients in the biodiversity aspects, experiencing distinct environmental conditions, and exhibiting taxonomic dissimilarities due to nestedness. These findings suggest this ubiquitous organization is mainly driven by the action of two complementary environmental filters, one acting on species from regional hotspots and the other on species from permeable biogeographical boundaries. The influence of these regional filters extends across spatial scales and shapes global patterns of species richness. Regional biodiversity follows a universal core-to-transition organization governed by general forces operating across the tree of life and space. Ecological assemblages may be spatially organized by both context dependency and general processes.

However, our understanding of these human/climate relationships is limited because robust tests of these linkages require region-specific quantified palaeoclimatic data with sufficient chronological precision to permit comparisons to the archaeological record. Here we present new high-resolution palaeoclimatic data and combine these with radiocarbon inventories of archaeological and faunal material, to test the relationship between abrupt warming and the ability of humans to rapidly repopulate the northwest margins of Europe (&gt;50° N and encompassing the area of Britain, Ireland, the surrounding islands and the North Sea basin) after regional abandonment during the Last Glacial Maximum. We address the timing of this process and the relevance of the abrupt climate changes recorded in the Greenland ice cores. We use the IntCal20 radiocarbon calibration curve to show that the earliest human repopulation in this region occurred up to 500 years before the climate of Greenland warmed. However, our analyses show that parts of the northwest European margin had already experienced substantial summer warming by this time, probably driven by changes of sea-ice area in the eastern North Atlantic. The associated warming influenced the distribution of key hunter-gatherer prey species such as reindeer, which were a key resource for humans. Accordingly, this study highlights asynchrony in seasonal warming across the North Atlantic region during the last deglaciation and shows that this asynchrony permitted human exploitation of northwest European margin paraglacial landscapes by ~15,200 years before the present. The authors use the latest radiocarbon calibration curve and new local palaeoclimatic and palaeoenvironmental records from Britain to show that humans repopulated the northwest European margin between 15,500 and 15,000 years ago, supported by local summer warmth occurring earlier than previously thought.},

The neotropical anachronism hypothesis, proposed by Janzen and Martin, suggests that large fruits evolved in response to past selective pressures from now-extinct megafauna. While this explains many key adaptations of ‘megafaunal fruit’ plants, it lacks robust palaeoecological evidence. Here we use a multiproxy approach that provides evidence of frugivory by the extinct South American proboscidean Notiomastodon platensis. Using a machine learning model that reveals the extinction effects of these megafaunal dispersers in modern ecosystems, we show how losing seed dispersal interactions increased the extinction risk of megafaunal fruit plants in regions across South America lacking smaller surrogate dispersers. Our results imply that current ecosystems may undergo further functional changes under continuing anthropogenic pressures. Using a multiproxy dietary analysis combining stable isotopes, tooth microwear and dental calculus of the extinct South American proboscidean Notiomastodon platensis, the authors confirm that it consumed fruits and may have acted as a seed disperser. They assess evidence that its extinction has had cascading consequences for the plants whose seeds it used to disperse.},

  abstract     = {The Tibetan Plateau supports the largest alpine meadow ecosystem globally. It is considered extremely vulnerable to global warming. Knowledge of past vegetation dynamics under similarly warm climates could shed insights into where the tipping point for regime shifts may lie. We report a continuous multicentennial-resolved pollen record for the last 3.5 Myr from a lake sediment core retrieved from the Zoige Basin (~3,350–3,450 m above sea level) on the eastern Tibetan Plateau. It reveals a detailed picture of the vegetation dynamics across several timescales using the approaches of biomization, numerical analysis, statistical modelling and vegetation simulations. These lines of evidence show that vegetation underwent transformation from stable forest in the mid-late Pliocene Period (3.5–2.73 million years ago (Ma)) to codominance of forest and steppe in the early Quaternary Period (2.73–1.54 Ma) and to a meadow-dominated ecosystem after ~1.54 Ma, along with glacial–interglacial and millennial-scale grassland–forest shifts. These vegetational changes were largely controlled by temperature change. A global warming of ~2–3 °C is the most important threshold for the forest expansion and meadow resilience loss on the Tibetan Plateau. By analogy to the past, we suggest that, without major reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, the current Tibetan Plateau meadow is at risk of major transformation. The authors present a 3.5-million-year-long pollen record from the Zoige Basin of the eastern Tibetan Plateau, 3,442 m above sea level. The ~5,000 pollen assemblages retrieved from the core reveal many ecosystem transitions during this time and, when correlated with climatic curves, indicate what effects future warming may have on regional vegetation.},

  abstract     = {Spatial incompleteness in the fossil record severely diminishes the observed ecological and geographic ranges of clades. The biological processes shaping species distributions and richness through time, however, also operate across geographic space and so clade biogeographic histories can indicate where their lineages must have successfully dispersed through these sampling gaps. Consequently, these histories are powerful, yet untapped tools for quantifying their unobserved ecographic diversity. Here, we couple phylogeographic modelling with a landscape connectivity approach to reconstruct the origins and dispersal of Permian–Triassic archosauromorph reptiles. We recover substantial ecographic diversity from the gaps in their fossil record, illuminating the cryptic first 20 million years of their evolutionary history, a peak in climatic disparity in the earliest Triassic period, and dispersals through the Pangaean tropical dead zone which contradict its perception as a hard barrier to vertebrate movement. This remarkable tolerance of climatic adversity was probably integral to their later evolutionary success. Using a newly developed spatiotemporal phylogeographic path analysis method combined with phylogenetic niche modelling, the authors estimate clade-wide dispersal maps spanning the early Permian to end-Triassic periods for archosauromorph reptiles.},

  abstract     = {Programmed phenotypic transition is prevalent throughout the tree of life, yet the concrete mechanisms that underpin this phenomenon are poorly understood. The orchid mantis (Hymenopus coronatus, Mantodea) is a model study system for programmed body colour transitions that displays a prominent black-red body colour in first-instar nymphs, then switches to a flowery white body colour in later-instar nymphs. Here we reveal that this body colour transition is achieved by the simultaneous excretion of decarboxylated-xanthommatin (red pigment) and the accumulation of uric acid (white pigment) in the epidermis during the first moult. This change in pigmentation is associated with a novel subtype of ABCG pigment transporter that we call ‘Redboy’ in Polyneoptera, which is upregulated by insect steroid hormone (ecdysone) during the first moult of orchid mantises. RNAi assay and pigment analyses show that Redboy functions together with the co-transporter White, exporting red pigments from and concurrently importing white pigments into the epidermal cells. Spectral reflectance analyses and predation experiments reveal that Redboy-conferred programmed body colour transition enhances predator avoidance during the first instar, and both prey attraction and predator avoidance in later instars. Our findings clarify how gene family evolution and hormone regulation coordinate programmed phenotypic transition and promote ecological adaptation in orchid mantises. First-instar orchid mantis nymphs avoid predators by mimicking black-red assassin bugs, whereas those in later instars avoid predators and attract prey by camouflaging themselves as lighter-coloured flowers. Here the authors use developmental transcriptomics, evolutionary genomics and predation experiments to reveal that this ontogenetic colour change is regulated by a pigment transporter called Redboy that emerged in Polyneoptera 284–197 million years ago.},

Although complex multitrophic networks can, in theory, buffer environmental stress, the effects of anthropogenic chemicals on soil food webs under climate change remain poorly understood. Here we propose that the effects of chemical pollution on soil communities have been largely underestimated, particularly for climate change-affected ecosystems. We explore the interactive effects of environmental stressors on soil food webs and the importance of integrating chemical pollution impacts into assessing soil food web stability. We also discuss a conceptual framework involving microbiome manipulation, community compensatory dynamics and interaction modulation to mitigate the combined effects of chemical pollution and climate change on soil food webs. The joint effects of chemical pollution and climate change on soil food webs remain underexplored. This Progress discusses the impacts of these stressors on soil food web structure along with a potential framework to mitigate the adverse effects on soil functions.},

  abstract     = {Addressing the coupled threats of catastrophic climate change and biodiversity loss requires implementation of conservation and restoration actions globally. However, on-the-ground action is hindered by context dependency: the ubiquitous challenge that implementation outcomes vary from place to place due to complex dependencies among social and ecological drivers. Policymakers and practitioners recognize the need to tailor solutions to contexts, and target actions to places where they will work effectively. To provide information for decision-making, applied ecologists can learn from medicine and marketing, which aim to provide healthcare tailored to individual patients, and advertisements targeting individual tastes. These disciplines exploit big data and rapidly developing computational advances to predict treatment effects for individual units. Here we argue why and how ecological disciplines can begin to capitalize on these rich advances, to equip ecologists with a potentially powerful toolkit for applying big data to site-specific interventions, allowing effective conservation over large extents. We review approaches that hold promise for applied ecology, identify hurdles that must be overcome and propose a roadmap for establishing the conditions that will permit adoption of precision ecology. The fields of medicine and marketing use large data volumes and computational power to target individuals. This Perspective argues that applied ecologists should draw on such approaches to provide decision-makers with specific, site-level intervention strategies.},

  abstract     = {Climate warming is threatening biodiversity by increasing temperatures beyond the optima of many ectotherms. Owing to the inherent non-linear relationship between temperature and the rate of cellular processes, such shifts towards hot temperature are predicted to impose stronger selection compared with corresponding shifts towards cold temperature. This suggests that when adaptation to warming occurs, it should be relatively rapid and predictable. Here we tested this hypothesis from the level of single-nucleotide polymorphisms to life-history traits in the beetle Callosobruchus maculatus. We conducted an evolve-and-resequence experiment on three genetic backgrounds of the beetle reared at hot or cold temperature. Indeed, we find that phenotypic evolution was faster and more repeatable at hot temperature. However, at the genomic level, adaptation to heat was less repeatable when compared across genetic backgrounds. As a result, genomic predictions of phenotypic adaptation in populations exposed to hot temperature were accurate within, but not between, backgrounds. These results seem best explained by genetic redundancy and an increased importance of epistasis during adaptation to heat, and imply that the same mechanisms that exert strong selection and increase repeatability of phenotypic evolution at hot temperature reduce repeatability at the genomic level. Thus, predictions of adaptation in key phenotypes from genomic data may become increasingly difficult as climates warm. The authors compare genomic and phenotypic changes between genetic backgrounds of seed beetles evolved at hot or cold temperatures. Despite phenotypic changes being more rapid and predictable at hot temperatures, the underlying genome-wide changes are less predictable across genetic backgrounds, suggesting that genomic predictions may become difficult to implement as climates warm.},

  abstract     = {Biodiversity and its associated genetic diversity are being lost at an unprecedented rate. Simultaneously, the distributions of flora, fauna, fungi, microbes and pathogens are rapidly changing. Novel technology can help to capture and record genetic diversity before it is lost and to measure population shifts and pathogen distributions. Here we report the rapid application of shotgun long-read environmental DNA (eDNA) analysis for non-invasive biodiversity, genetic diversity and pathogen assessments from air. We also compared air eDNA with water and soil eDNA. Coupling long-read sequencing with established cloud-based biodiversity pipelines enabled a 2-day turnaround from airborne sample collection to completed analysis by a single investigator. To determine the full utility of airborne eDNA, we also conducted a local bioinformatic analysis and deep short-read shotgun sequencing. From outdoor air eDNA alone, comprehensive genetic analysis was performed, including population genetics (phylogenetic placement) of a charismatic mammal (bobcat, Lynx rufus) and a venomous spider (golden silk orb weaver, Trichonephila clavipes), and haplotyping humans (Homo sapiens) from natural complex community settings, such as subtropical forests and temperate locations. The rich datasets also enabled deeper analysis of specific species and genomic regions of interest, including viral variant calling, human variant analysis and antimicrobial resistance gene surveillance from airborne DNA. Our results highlight the speed, versatility and specificity of pan-biodiversity monitoring via non-invasive eDNA sampling using current benchtop/portable and cloud-based approaches. Furthermore, they reveal the future feasibility of scaling down (equipment and temporally) these approaches for near real-time analysis. Together these approaches can enable rapid simultaneous detection of all life and its genetic diversity from air, water and sediment samples for unbiased non-targeted information-rich genomics-empowered (1) biodiversity monitoring, (2) population genetics, (3) pathogen and disease-vector genomic surveillance, (4) allergen and narcotic surveillance, (5) antimicrobial resistance surveillance and (6) bioprospecting.

  abstract     = {With biodiversity loss escalating globally, a step change is needed in our capacity to accurately monitor species populations across ecosystems. Robotic and autonomous systems (RAS) offer technological solutions that may substantially advance terrestrial biodiversity monitoring, but this potential is yet to be considered systematically. We used a modified Delphi technique to synthesize knowledge from 98 biodiversity experts and 31 RAS experts, who identified the major methodological barriers that currently hinder monitoring, and explored the opportunities and challenges that RAS offer in overcoming these barriers. Biodiversity experts identified four barrier categories: site access, species and individual identification, data handling and storage, and power and network availability. Robotics experts highlighted technologies that could overcome these barriers and identified the developments needed to facilitate RAS-based autonomous biodiversity monitoring. Some existing RAS could be optimized relatively easily to survey species but would require development to be suitable for monitoring of more ‘difficult’ taxa and robust enough to work under uncontrolled conditions within ecosystems. Other nascent technologies (for instance, new sensors and biodegradable robots) need accelerated research. Overall, it was felt that RAS could lead to major progress in monitoring of terrestrial biodiversity by supplementing rather than supplanting existing methods. Transdisciplinarity needs to be fostered between biodiversity and RAS experts so that future ideas and technologies can be codeveloped effectively. An expert-elicitation process identifies current methodological barriers for monitoring terrestrial biodiversity, and how technological and procedural development of robotic and autonomous systems may contribute to overcoming these challenges.},

  abstract     = {Biological invasions threaten global biodiversity, human well-being and economies. Many regional and taxonomic syntheses of monetary costs have been produced recently but with important knowledge gaps owing to uneven geographic and taxonomic research intensity. Here we combine species distribution models, macroeconomic data and the InvaCost database to produce the highest resolution spatio-temporal cost estimates currently available to bridge these gaps. From a subset of 162 invasive species with ‘highly reliable’ documented costs at the national level, our interpolation focuses on countries that have not reported any costs despite the known presence of invasive species. This analysis demonstrates a substantial underestimation, with global costs potentially estimated to be 1,646% higher for these species than previously recorded. This discrepancy was uneven geographically and taxonomically, respectively peaking in Europe and for plants. Our results showed that damage costs were primarily driven by gross domestic product, human population size, agricultural area and environmental suitability, whereas management expenditure correlated with gross domestic product and agriculture areas. We also found a lag time for damage costs of 46 years, but management spending was not delayed. The methodological predictive approach of this study provides a more complete view of the economic dimensions of biological invasions and narrows the global disparity in invasion cost reporting. Estimates of the monetary costs of invasive species have been hampered by data gaps. These authors use documented costs for 162 species to interpolate costs of those species for countries previously lacking data and derive global costs 1,646% higher than previous estimates.},

  abstract     = {Species distributions are a product of both current spatial configuration of habitats and legacies of historical land use. Here we explore current and historical drivers of species distributions, considering combined effects of spatial spillovers and temporal legacies, both within and between habitat types. We fit Bayesian hierarchical occupancy models to data on 373 species from four taxa (ground beetles, birds, vascular plants and small terrestrial mammals) from a chronosequence of 134 woodlands (10 to &gt;250 years old) in temperate agricultural landscapes in the UK. Both spillovers and legacies affect species richness and community composition and, critically, these effects interact. Real-world combinations of spillovers and legacies result in different biodiversity responses compared with the individual factors in isolation. Woodland patches in landscapes with more old woodland and lower amounts of historical woodland loss tend to host more bird and plant but fewer beetle species. Failing to account for these drivers (in particular, legacy effects) gives a distorted view of habitat suitability. In consequence, the same management actions may result in unexpectedly different outcomes depending on the spatial and historical context within the landscape. A better understanding of spillovers and legacy effects on species distributions is required to design biodiversity-friendly, cost-effective land management. Data on beetle, bird, plant and mammal occupancy of woodland sites in UK agricultural landscapes demonstrate how contemporary spatial spillovers and legacies of past land use interact to affect species richness and community composition.},

  abstract     = {To mitigate biodiversity loss from agriculture, intensification is often promoted as an alternative to farmland expansion. However, its local impacts remain debated. We assess globally the responses of three biodiversity metrics—species richness, total abundance and relative community abundance-weighted average range size (RCAR), a proxy for biotic homogenization—to land conversion and yield increases. Our models predict a median species loss of 11% in primary vegetation in modified landscapes, and of 25% and 40% in cropland within natural and modified landscapes, respectively. Land conversion also reduces abundance and increases biotic homogenization, with impacts varying by geographic region and history of human modification. However, increasing yields changes biodiversity as well, including in adjacent primary vegetation, with effects dependent on crop, region, biodiversity metric and natural habitat cover. Ultimately, neither expansion nor intensification consistently benefits biodiversity. Intensification has better species richness outcomes in 29%, 83%, 64% and 57% of maize, soybean, wheat and rice landscapes, respectively, whereas expansion performs better in the remaining areas. In terms of abundance and RCAR, both expansion and intensification can outperform the other depending on landscape. Therefore, minimizing local biodiversity loss requires a context-dependent balance between expansion and intensification, while avoiding expansion in unmodified landscapes. Both agricultural expansion and intensification drive biodiversity losses. Here the authors quantify and compare globally the biodiversity impact of land conversion and yield increases.},

  abstract     = {Ongoing and sharply increased global forest fires, especially extreme large-scale fires (LFs) with their greater destructiveness, have significantly altered forest structures and functions. However, long-term variations in the severity of LFs and corresponding effects on the natural post-LF recovery time of global forests remain unclear. Here, we rigorously identified 3,281 global large-scale (&gt;10 km2) single-time fire events (LSFs) from 2001 to 2021, and used multiple indicators to understand the post-LSF recovery dynamics from different perspectives and comprehensively reveal major driving factors across regions and forests types based on multiple models. Compared with pre-2010, LSFs after 2010 caused greater forest damage, with the fire severity expanding further from low to high latitudes and from humid to arid regions, particularly affecting evergreen needleleaf forests. Fewer than one-third of the forests recovered successfully within 7 years, and most of these were tropical, moisture-rich broadleaf forests. The average time required for three indicators to recover to pre-fire conditions increased by 7.5% (vegetation density), 11.1% (canopy structure) and 27.3% (gross primary productivity). Moreover, the positive sensitivity of recovery time to increased fire severity was significantly intensified. Notably, more forests experienced recovery stagnation with increased severity, especially in boreal forests, further extending recovery time. The negative impact of the severity of LSFs on forest recovery was much stronger than that of post-LSF climate conditions. Soil moisture after LSFs was identified as the primary facilitating factor. Temperature generally had a positive role before 2010, but a strong negative influence on post-LSF forest recovery after 2010. These findings provide a useful reference for better understanding global forest recovery mechanisms, estimating forest carbon sinks and implementing post-LSF management accordingly. The authors undertake a global-scale, long-term analysis of trends in post-fire biomass recovery, examining the influence of fire severity and climatic drivers before and after 2010. They find that since 2001 forest recovery has been increasingly sensitive to fire severity.},

  abstract     = {Drought-induced mortality is expected to cause substantial biomass loss in the Amazon basin. However, rainforest responses to prolonged drought are largely unknown. Here, we demonstrate that an Amazonian rainforest plot subjected to more than two decades of large-scale experimental drought reached eco-hydrological stability. After elevated tree mortality during the first 15 years, ecosystem-level structural changes resulted in the remaining trees no longer experiencing drought stress. The loss of the largest trees led to increasing water availability for the remaining trees, stabilizing biomass in the last 7 years of the experiment. Hydraulic variables linked to physiological stress, such as leaf water potential, sap flow and tissue water content, converged to the values observed in a corresponding non-droughted control forest, indicating hydraulic homeostasis. While it prevented drought-induced collapse, eco-hydrological stabilization resulted in a forest with reduced biomass and carbon accumulation in wood. These findings show how tropical rainforests may be resilient to persistent soil drought. Drought is a growing issue in tropical rainforests. Here, the authors revisit a long-term rainfall manipulation experiment in the Amazon to show that tree mortality was followed by community-level adjustments to reduced precipitation.},

  abstract     = {Differences in life history can cause co-distributed species to evolve contrasting population genetic patterns, even as they occupy the same landscape. In high-latitude animals, evolutionary processes may be especially influenced by long-distance seasonal migration, a widespread adaptation to seasonality. Although migratory movements are intuitively linked to dispersal and therefore promotion of gene flow, their evolutionary genetic consequences remain poorly understood. Using ~1,700 genomes from 35 co-distributed boreal-breeding bird species that differ in non-breeding latitude and thus migration distance, we find that most long-distance migrants unexpectedly exhibit spatial genetic structure, despite their strong movement propensity. This result suggests evolutionary effects of philopatry—the tendency of many migrants to return to the same breeding site year after year, resulting in restricted dispersal. We further demonstrate that migration distance and genetic diversity are strongly positively correlated in our study species. This striking relationship suggests that the adaptive seasonal shifts in biogeography inherent to long-distance migration may enhance population stability, preserving genetic diversity in long-distance migrants relative to shorter-distance migrants that winter in harsher conditions at higher latitudes. Our results suggest that the major impact of long-distance seasonal migration on population genetic evolution occurs through promotion of demographic stability, rather than facilitation of dispersal. Comparative analysis of genomes of 35 boreal-breeding bird species with different migratory distances shows that long-distance migrants have spatial genetic structure, despite their longer movements, and higher genetic diversity than short-distance migrants.},

  abstract     = {Old trees, often living for hundreds or even thousands of years, play vital roles in maintaining biodiversity and ecosystem services. However, their extraordinary longevity occurs under rare circumstances, as most individuals succumb to mortality. From an optimal resource allocation perspective, species adopting a life-history strategy with a high potential maximum lifespan (PML) are expected to also have a higher life expectancy (LE). Here we developed a framework to assess the longevity of 1-cm-diameter trees and calculated the PML and LE for 53 major tree species in Japan. The results revealed that the PML (mean 378 years) was 4.7 times higher than the LE (mean 81 years). Both indices showed a positive correlation, with a regression slope of 0.34; however, the explanatory power of the model was low (R2 = 0.22). This can be attributed to the fact that LE exhibits a stronger negative response to climate-related habitat severity compared with that of PML. Our findings suggest two key points: (1) trees may adopt a hierarchical ordering of demographic parameters that prioritize long-term survival duration over average survival rate, and (2) considering this balance, which varies among species, could enhance the cost-effectiveness of ecosystem restoration. Using Japanese forest census data, the authors define potential maximum lifespan and life expectancy for 53 tree species, finding that life expectancy is more sensitive to habitat-associated gradients, leading to a larger disparity between the two parameters in harsher habitats.},

  abstract     = {Plant biomass tends to increase under nutrient addition and decrease under drought. Biotic and abiotic factors influence responses to both, making the combined impact of nutrient addition and drought difficult to predict. Using a globally distributed network of manipulative field experiments, we assessed grassland aboveground biomass response to both drought and increased nutrient availability at 26 sites across nine countries. Overall, drought reduced biomass by 19% and nutrient addition increased it by 24%, resulting in no net impact under combined drought and nutrient addition. Among the plant functional groups, only graminoids responded positively to nutrients during drought. However, these general responses depended on local conditions, especially aridity. Nutrient effects were stronger in arid grasslands and weaker in humid regions and nitrogen-rich soils, although nutrient addition alleviated drought effects the most in subhumid sites. Biomass responses were weaker with higher precipitation variability. Biomass increased more with increased nutrient availability and declined more with drought at high-diversity sites than at low-diversity sites. Our findings highlight the importance of local abiotic and biotic conditions in predicting grassland responses to anthropogenic nutrient and climate changes. Grasslands tend to be limited by both nutrient and water availability. Here the authors use standardized field experiments to show that the effects of nutrient addition on grassland biomass may cancel out the negative impact of drought, but the outcome depends on aridity and other local conditions.},

  abstract     = {The bidirectional relationship between plant species richness and community biomass is often variable and poorly resolved in natural grassland ecosystems, impeding progress in predicting impacts of environmental changes. Most biological communities have long-tailed species abundance distributions (for example, biomass, cover, number of individuals), a general property that may provide predictive power for species richness and community biomass. Here we show mathematical relationships between community characteristics and the abundance of dominant species arising from long-tailed distributions and test these predictions using observational and experimental data from 76 grassland sites across 6 continents. We find that community biomass provides little predictive ability for community richness, consistent with previous findings. By contrast, the relative abundance of dominant species quantitatively predicts species richness, whereas their absolute abundance quantitatively predicts community biomass under both ambient and altered environmental conditions, as expected mathematically. These results are robust to the type of abundance measure used. Three types of simulated data further show the generality of these results. Our integrative framework, arising from a few dominant species and mathematical properties of species abundance distributions, fills a persistent gap in our ability to predict community richness and biomass under ambient and anthropogenically altered conditions. By combining modelling and simulated data with empirical data from 76 grassland sites across 6 continents, the authors show that the relative abundance of dominant species predicts species richness, while their absolute abundance predicts community biomass.},

  abstract     = {The inhabitants of New Guinea and its outlying islands have played an important role in the human history of the Pacific region. Nevertheless, the genetic diversity, particularly of pre-colonial communities, is still understudied. Here we present the ancient genomes of 42 individuals from Papua New Guinea (PNG). The ancient genomic results of individuals from Watom Island (Bismarck Archipelago) and the south and northeastern coasts of PNG are contextualized with new (bio-) archaeological data. The individuals’ accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) dates span 2,500 years of human habitation, and our results demonstrate the influences of different dispersal events on the genetic make-up of ancient PNG communities. The oldest individuals show an unadmixed Papuan-related genetic signature, whereas individuals dating from 2,100 years before present carry varying degrees of an East-Asian-related contribution. These results and the inferred admixture dates suggest a centuries-long delay in genetic mixture with local communities after the arrival of populations with Asian ancestry. Two geographically close communities on the South Coast, AMS dated to within the past 540 years, diverge in their genetic profiles, suggesting differences in their interaction spheres involving groups with distinct ancestries. The inferred split time of these communities around 650 years before present coincides with intensified settlement activity and the emergence of regional trade networks. New archaeological and ancient genomic data from humans in Papua New Guinea and the Bismarck Archipelago shed light on regional human admixture and genetic isolation over the past 2,500 years.},

Yet, little attention has been paid to the inequities that scientists with disabilities face. We reviewed the websites of 541 ecology and evolution journals to examine the extent to which they prompt authors to prepare accessible manuscripts. Here we show that nearly three-quarters of journals do not encourage authors to consider accessibility when preparing manuscripts. Existing guidelines focus primarily on colour-blind-friendly figures, which were mentioned almost twice as often as any other recommendation. Our survey signals an urgent need for widespread journal policy reforms that require authors to format their manuscripts according to Universal Design principles. As a starting point to improving manuscript accessibility, we provide an accessibility checklist for authors to reference when preparing manuscripts. We conclude with recommendations for an iterative process of reform in collaboration with the disability community. An analysis of manuscript preparation guidelines across 541 ecology and evolution journals reveals widespread paucity in guidelines intended to make journal articles accessible to people with disabilities, underscoring an urgent need for journal policy reform.},

  abstract     = {The evolution of reproductive barriers leads to the formation of new species. However, recent research has demonstrated that hybridization has been pervasive across the tree of life even in the presence of strong barriers. Using swordtail fishes (genus Xiphophorus), an emerging model system, we document overlapping mechanisms that act as barriers to gene flow between Xiphophorus birchmanni and Xiphophorus cortezi by combining genomic sequencing from natural hybrid populations, experimental laboratory crosses, behavioural assays, sperm measures and developmental studies. We show that assortative mating plays a role in maintaining subpopulations with distinct ancestry within natural hybrid populations. Using F2 hybrids we identify several genomic regions that strongly impact hybrid viability. Strikingly, two of these regions underlie genetic incompatibilities in hybrids between X. birchmanni and its sister species Xiphophorus malinche. Our results demonstrate that ancient hybridization has played a role in the origin of this shared genetic incompatibility. Moreover, ancestry mismatch at these incompatible regions has remarkably similar consequences for phenotypes and hybrid survival in X. cortezi × X. birchmanni hybrids as in X. malinche × X. birchmanni hybrids. Our findings identify varied reproductive barriers that shape genetic exchange between naturally hybridizing species and highlight the complex evolutionary outcomes of hybridization. Reproductive barriers can evolve despite gene flow. A combination of genomics and behavioural assays shows two mitonuclear incompatibilities originated via ancient hybridization that underlie hybrid inviability in a pair of closely related swordtail fishes.},

  abstract     = {Vertebrate life histories evolve in response to selection imposed by abiotic and biotic environmental conditions while being limited by genetic, developmental, physiological, demographic and phylogenetic processes that constrain adaptation. Despite the well-recognized shifts in selective pressures accompanying transitions among environments, the conditions driving innovation and the consequences for life-history evolution remain outstanding questions. Here we compare the traits of vertebrates that occupy aquatic or terrestrial environments as juveniles to infer shifts in evolutionary constraints that explain differences in their life-history traits and thus their fundamental demographic rates. Our results emphasize the reduced potential for life-history diversification on land, especially that of reproductive strategies, which limits the scope of viable life-history strategies. Moreover, our study reveals differences between the evolution of viviparity in aquatic and terrestrial realms. Transitions from egg laying to live birth represent a major shift across life-history space for aquatic organisms, whereas terrestrial egg-laying organisms evolve live birth without drastic changes in life-history strategy. Whilst trade-offs in the allocation of resources place fundamental constraints on the way life histories can vary, ecological setting influences the position of species within the viable phenotypic space available for adaptive evolution. The authors examine life-history differences between terrestrial versus aquatic vertebrates and their mode of reproduction. They find that land vertebrate life histories are more constrained than aquatic ones. In particular, the results suggest a wider diversity of reproductive strategies in aquatic habitats than in terrestrial ones.},

  abstract     = {Uncovering the genomic bases of phenotypic adaptation is a major goal in biology, but this has been hard to achieve for complex behavioural traits. Here we leverage the repeated, independent evolution of obligate cavity nesting in birds to test the hypothesis that pressure to compete for a limited breeding resource has facilitated convergent evolution in behaviour, hormones and gene expression. We used an integrative approach, combining aggression assays in the field, testosterone measures and transcriptome-wide analyses of the brain in wild-captured females and males. Our experimental design compared species pairs across five avian families, each including one obligate cavity-nesting species and a related species with a more flexible nest strategy. We find behavioural convergence, with higher levels of territorial aggression in obligate cavity nesters, particularly among females. Across species, levels of testosterone in circulation were not associated with nest strategy nor aggression. Phylogenetic analyses of individual genes and co-regulated gene networks revealed more shared patterns of brain gene expression than expected by drift, although the scope of convergent gene expression evolution was limited to a small percentage of the genome. When comparing our results to other studies that did not use phylogenetic methods, we suggest that accounting for shared evolutionary history may reduce the number of genes inferred as convergently evolving. Altogether, we find that behavioural convergence in response to shared ecological pressures is associated with largely independent evolution of gene expression across different avian families, punctuated by a narrow set of convergently evolving genes. The authors performed phylogenetically controlled behavioural assays and analysed brain transcriptomes across five avian families, identifying convergent patterns of gene expression associated with aggression and nesting behaviour in obligate cavity-nesting birds.},

Here, using a meta-analysis of 34 experimental speciation studies on arthropods, yeast and vertebrates, we show that populations subject to divergent selection evolved stronger reproductive isolation compared with populations that evolved in similar environments, consistent with ecological speciation theory. However, and contrary to predictions, reproductive isolation did not increase with the number of generations. Phenotypic plasticity could partly explain these results as divergent environments induce a plastic increase in reproductive isolation greater than the effect of divergent selection, but only for pre-mating isolating barriers. Our results highlight that adaptive evolution in response to different environments in conjunction with plasticity can initiate a rapid increase in reproductive isolation in the early stage of speciation. The authors examine factors affecting reproductive isolation in the early stages of speciation by collating data from 34 experimental speciation studies in 15 species ranging from yeast to vertebrates. They show that both phenotypic plasticity and divergent selection pressures accelerate the emergence of reproductive isolation, with plasticity promoting pre-mating isolation barriers in particular.},

  abstract     = {Coral restoration is gaining popularity as part of a continuum of approaches addressing the widespread, recurring mass mortality events of corals that—together with elevated and chronic mortality, slower growth and recruitment failure—threaten the persistence of coral reefs worldwide. However, the monetary costs associated with broad-scale coral restoration are massive, making widespread implementation challenging, especially with the lack of coordinated and ecologically informed planning. By combining a comprehensive dataset documenting the success of coral restoration with current and forecasted environmental, ecological and climate data, we highlight how such a coordinated and ecologically informed approach is not forthcoming, despite the extent of previous and ongoing efforts. We show that: (1) restoration sites tend to be disproportionally close to human settlements and therefore more vulnerable to local anthropogenic impacts; (2) the immediate outcomes of restoration do not appear to be influenced by relevant ecological and environmental predictors such as cumulative impact; and (3) most restored localities have a high and severe bleaching risk by the middle of this century, with more than half of recently restored sites already affected. Our findings highlight the need for the coral reef community to reinforce joint development of restoration guidelines that go beyond local objectives, with attention to ocean warming trends and their long-term impacts on coral resilience and restoration success. An assessment of existing coral restoration projects finds that accessibility drives the choice of restoration sites more than environmental and ecological factors, and most restored reefs have been or will soon be impacted by severe bleaching.},

We show that, while changing production demands risk driving further biodiversity loss by 2030, when these demands are met alongside strategic restoration measures, as outlined by the EU Nature Restoration Regulation, future landscapes could improve the conservation status of populations for more than 20% of species of conservation concern while also increasing terrestrial carbon stocks. Our analysis demonstrates how critical the Nature Restoration Regulation is to achieving biodiversity targets and how integrated planning can align biodiversity policy objectives with future socioeconomic demands. Integrated spatial planning of the European Union Nature Restoration Regulation under multiple implementation scenarios is used to identify where restoration, conservation and production across Europe could maximize benefits to species conservation and climate mitigation under changing needs for food, bioenergy and timber to 2030.},

However, our understanding of how different human-induced pressures (such as land use and biotic invasion) interact to drive community size structure and ecosystem services remains limited. Combining 21 years of fish size spectrum data and fishery potential (fishery monetary value in the Upper Paraná River Floodplain, Brazil), we demonstrate that the size spectrum exponent of native species has become more negative over time, indicating a relative decrease in the biomass of large versus small individuals. Conversely, the size spectrum exponent of non-native species has become less negative over time owing to the increased abundance of large species. Overall, fishery potential declined by more than 50% over time. Human land use replaced the coverage of natural environments, indirectly reducing native richness. This scenario decreased the exponent of the native size spectrum, indirectly reducing fishery potential. Our study illustrates how intensification of human land use alters the size structure of communities, favouring non-native individuals and suppressing ecosystem services. Human-induced pressure may alter the size structure of animal communities. Here, the authors investigate the impact of land use, non-native species and climatic variables on the body size structure of fish communities and fishery-associated ecosystem services in the Upper Paraná Floodplain.},

Here we uncover a strong concentration of butterfly diversity in rare and rapidly shrinking high-elevation climates. Integrating comprehensive phylogenetic and geographic range data for 12,119 species, we find that global centres of butterfly richness, range rarity and phylogenetic diversity are unusually concentrated in tropical and subtropical mountain systems. Two-thirds of the assessed species are primarily mountain dwelling and mountains hold 3.5 times more butterfly hotspots (top 5%) than lowlands. These hotspots only partially overlap with those of ants, terrestrial vertebrates and vascular plants (14–36%), while butterfly diversity is uniquely concentrated above 2,000 m elevation. We project that up to 64% of the temperature niche space of butterflies in tropical realms will erode by 2070, with the geographically restricted temperature conditions of mountains potentially turning these from refugia to traps for butterfly diversity. Our study identifies critical conservation priorities for butterflies and underscores the need for quantitative global assessments of at least select insect groups to help mitigate biodiversity loss in a rapidly warming world. Butterflies are a large, functionally important and charismatic invertebrate group. Here, the authors characterize global macroecological patterns of butterflies and project shifts in their bioclimatic niches under future climate scenarios.},

  abstract     = {Evidence is accumulating of declines in widespread, abundant insect species. The consequences of these losses for ecosystem functioning are predicted to be severe but remain poorly tested in real-world ecosystems. Here we tested the relative importance of functional redundancy versus complementarity in conferring stability of multifunctional performance in the face of dominant insect species decline. We conducted an experimental manipulation of functional trait-space occupancy within naturally occurring ant communities in Australia. Experimental suppression of dominant ant species in multiple trait groupings caused a counterintuitive increase in multifunctional performance, which was associated with an increase in species richness. The resident ant community had high functional redundancy, contributing to rapid compensatory dynamics following suppression. However, colonization by new species with increased trait complementarity drove higher multifunctional performance. This increased multifunctionality probably occurred via reduced interspecific competition but at the cost of increased sensitivity of ecosystem multifunctionality to further species loss. Our findings show that functional redundancy can buffer multifunctional performance of a community against decline of dominant insect species but suggest that future stability of ecosystem multifunctionality depends more on functional complementarity and altered competitive interactions. The loss of a dominant species in a community could have major impacts on ecosystem functioning. Here, a manipulative field experiment on ants shows that species functional redundancy mitigates multifunctionality declines due to suppression of dominant species.},

How the presence of iron-sulfides influenced the acetyl-CoA pathway under primordial early Earth geochemistry is still poorly understood. Here we show that the iron-sulfides mackinawite (FeS) and greigite (Fe3S4), which formed in chemical garden experiments simulating geochemical conditions of the early Archaean eon (4.0–3.6 billion years ago), produce abiotic H2 in sufficient quantities to support hydrogenotrophic growth of the hyperthermophilic methanogen Methanocaldococcus jannaschii. Abiotic H2 from iron-sulfide formation promoted CO2 fixation and methanogenesis and induced overexpression of genes encoding the acetyl-CoA pathway. We demonstrate that H2 from iron-sulfide precipitation under simulated early Earth hydrothermal geochemistry fuels a H2-dependent primordial metabolism. In an iron-sulfide chemical garden experiment that mimics the kind of hydrothermal vents that might have occurred in the early Archaean, mackinawite and greigite are precipitated and abiotic H2 is produced in sufficient quantities to support exponential growth of a hyperthermophilic and hydrogenotrophic methanogen, Methanocaldococcus jannaschii.},

  abstract     = {We are beginning to understand the ecotoxicological effects of plastic pollution at the suborganismal, individual, population and community levels, but research has only just begun to explore the ecological and evolutionary impacts of plastic as a new habitat. The global introduction of plastic waste into aquatic environments introduces diverse and variable habitat modifications, altering ecosystems and potentially forming new ecological niches. This widespread habitat modification spans several aquatic ecosystems, including the pelagic ocean, deep-sea benthos, lakes and rivers. Recent studies suggest that habitat modification may interact with and alter ecological and evolutionary processes, affecting populations, communities and species, for example, through feeding ecology, mating behaviour and dispersal. However, further research is necessary to understand the potential long-term effects of plastic pollution on ecological and evolutionary processes across global aquatic ecosystems. Here, we review this emerging field of research and its trajectory. Plastic waste in the environment can modify habitats and change the mating, feeding and dispersal behaviours of organisms. This Progress discusses the emerging understanding of the ecological and evolutionary consequences of these effects of plastic pollution.},

  abstract     = {Sensory trade-offs between vision and olfaction in the evolution and radiation of primates have long been debated. However, insights have been limited by a lack of sensory gene sequences and accompanying functional predictions. Here we conduct large-scale functional analyses of visual and olfactory receptors and related brain regions across extant primates. Our results reveal a visual shift from ultraviolet to violet colour sensitivity in early haplorrhine primates, followed by acceleration in the rhodopsin retinal release rates at the origin of anthropoids, both of which are expected to greatly enhance visual acuity under brighter light conditions. Additionally, we find that the sensitivity of olfactory receptors shifted from narrowly to broadly tuned early in anthropoid evolution. In contrast, strepsirrhines appear to have retained sensitive dim-light vision and underwent functional enhancement of narrowly tuned olfactory receptors. Our models indicate that this would have enhanced odorant discrimination and facilitated olfaction-mediated physiology and behaviour. These differences in tuning patterns of olfactory receptors between major primate lineages mirror well-established morphological differences in external anatomy and brain structures, revealing new mechanisms of olfactory adaptation and evolutionary plasticity. Our multisystem analyses reveal patterns of co-evolution in genomic, molecular and neuroanatomical traits that are consistent with a sensory ‘reallocation’ rather than strict trade-offs. An analysis of genomic, molecular and neuroanatomical traits across extant primates reveals early divergence in visual and olfactory systems of major primate lineages consistent with lineage-specific shifts in diel activity and dietary niche, providing support for a sensory ‘reallocation’ hypothesis.},

  abstract     = {Horseshoe bats are natural hosts of zoonotic viruses, yet the genetic basis of their antiviral immunity is poorly understood. Here we generated two new chromosomal-level genome assemblies for horseshoe bat species (Rhinolophus) and three close relatives, and show that, during their diversification, horseshoe bats underwent extensive chromosomal rearrangements and gene expansions linked to segmental duplications. These expansions have generated new adaptive variations in type I interferons and the interferon-stimulated gene ANXA2R, which potentially enhance antiviral states, as suggested by our functional assays. Genome-wide selection screens, including of candidate introgressed regions, uncover numerous putative molecular adaptations linked to immunity, including in viral receptors. By expanding taxon coverage to ten horseshoe bat species, we identify new variants of the SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE2, and report convergent functionally important residues that could explain wider patterns of susceptibility across mammals. We conclude that horseshoe bats have numerous signatures of adaptation, including some potentially related to immune response to viruses, in genomic regions with diverse and multiscale mutational changes. A comparative analysis of bat genomes, including five newly assembled chromosome-scale genomes, provides insights into the diversification of horseshoe bats and reveals molecular adaptations with a potential role in antiviral immune response.},

  abstract     = {In many animal species, cognitive abilities are under strong natural selection because decisions about foraging, habitat choice and predator avoidance affect fecundity and survival. But how has sexual selection, which is usually stronger on males than females, shaped the evolution of cognitive abilities that influence success when competing for mates or fertilizations? We aimed to investigate potential links between individual differences in male cognitive performance to variation in paternity arising solely from sexual selection. We therefore ran four standard cognitive assays to quantify five measures of cognitive performance by male mosquitofish (Gambusia holbrooki). Males were then assigned to 11 outdoor ponds where they could compete for females. Females mate many times, which leads to intense sperm competition and broods with mixed paternity. We genotyped 2,430 offspring to identify their fathers. Males with greater inhibitory control and better spatial learning abilities sired significantly more offspring, while males with better initial impulse control sired significantly fewer offspring. Associative and reversal learning did not predict a male’s share of paternity. In sum, there was sexual selection on several, but not all, aspects of male cognitive performance. The authors find that male mosquitofish with greater inhibitory control and better spatial learning ability gain a significantly higher share of paternity than do more impulsive males, suggesting that these cognitive abilities are under direct sexual selection in male mosquitofish.},

  abstract     = {Lungs are essential respiratory organs in terrestrial vertebrates, present in most bony fishes but absent in cartilaginous fishes, making them an ideal model for studying organ evolution. Here we analysed single-cell RNA sequencing data from adult and developing lungs across vertebrate species, revealing significant similarities in cell composition, developmental trajectories and gene expression patterns. Surprisingly, a large proportion of lung-related genes, coexpression patterns and many lung enhancers are present in cartilaginous fishes despite their lack of lungs, suggesting that a substantial genetic foundation for lung development existed in the last common ancestor of jawed vertebrates. In addition, the 1,040 enhancers that emerged since the last common ancestor of bony fishes probably contain lung-specific elements that led to the development of lungs. We further identified alveolar type 1 cells as a mammal-specific alveolar cell type, along with several mammal-specific genes, including ager and sfta2, that are highly expressed in lungs. Functional validation showed that deletion of sfta2 in mice leads to severe respiratory defects, highlighting its critical role in mammalian lung features. Our study provides comprehensive insights into the evolution of vertebrate lungs, demonstrating how both regulatory network modifications and the emergence of new genes have shaped lung development and specialization across species. An analysis of single-cell RNA sequencing data from adult and developing lungs across vertebrate species reveals genetic components in the common ancestor of jawed vertebrates and new lung-specific enhancers that contribute to the evolution of vertebrate lungs.},

  abstract     = {In the arboviral vector Aedes aegypti, adaptation to anthropogenic environments has led to a major evolutionary shift separating the domestic Aedes aegypti aegypti (Aaa) ecotype from the wild Aedes aegypti formosus (Aaf) ecotype. Aaa mosquitoes are distributed globally and have higher vectorial capacity than Aaf, which remained in Africa. Despite the evolutionary and epidemiological relevance of this separation, inconsistent morphological data and a complex population structure have hindered the identification of genomic signals distinguishing the two ecotypes. Here we assessed the correspondence between the geographic distribution, population structure and genome-wide selection of 511 Aaf and 123 Aaa specimens and report adaptive signals in 186 genes that we call Aaa molecular signatures. Our results indicate that Aaa molecular signatures arose from standing variation associated with extensive ancestral polymorphisms in Aaf populations and have been co-opted for self-domestication through genomic and functional redundancy and local adaptation. Overall, we show that the behavioural shift of Ae. aegypti mosquitoes to live in association with humans relied on the fine regulation of chemosensory, neuronal and metabolic functions, as seen in the domestication processes of rabbits and silkworms. Our results also provide a foundation for the investigation of new genic targets for the control of Ae. aegypti populations. Analysing phylogenetic relationships, genome-wide selective sweeps and genetic differentiation among global populations of Aedes aegypti, the authors identify adaptive signals in 186 genes related to self-domestication that distinguish the globally distributed non-African ecotype from its African ancestor.},

  abstract     = {Evolutionary change requires genetic variation, and a reigning paradigm in biology is that rates of microevolution can be predicted from estimates of available genetic variation within populations. However, the accuracy of such predictions should decay on longer evolutionary timescales, as the influence of genetic constraints diminishes. Here we show that intrinsic developmental variability and standing genetic variation in wing shape in two distantly related flies, Drosophila melanogaster and Sepsis punctum, are aligned and predict deep divergence in the dipteran phylogeny, spanning &gt;900 taxa and 185 million years. This alignment cannot be easily explained by constraint hypotheses unless most of the quantified standing genetic variation is associated with deleterious side effects and is effectively unusable for evolution. However, phenotyping of 71 genetic lines of S. punctum revealed no covariation between wing shape and fitness, lending no support to this hypothesis. We also find little evidence for genetic constraints on the pace of wing shape evolution along the dipteran phylogeny. Instead, correlational selection related to allometric scaling, simultaneously shaping developmental variability and deep divergence in fly wings, emerges as a potential explanation for the observed alignment. This suggests that pervasive natural selection has the potential to shape developmental architectures of some morphological characters such that their intrinsic variability predicts their long-term evolution. Analysing wing shapes within and across distantly related dipteran lineages, the authors show that intrapopulation variation reflecting microevolutionary change can predict deep divergence at macroevolutionary timescales spanning 185 million years, and suggest that this pattern can be explained by correlational selection related to allometric scaling.},

  abstract     = {Camouflage through colour change can involve reversible or permanent changes in response to cyclic predator or herbivore pressures. The evolution of background matching in camouflaged phenotypes partly depends on the genetics of the camouflage trait, but this has received little attention in plants. Here we clarify the genetic pathway underlying the grey-leaved morph of fumewort, Corydalis hemidicentra, of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau that by being camouflaged escapes herbivory from caterpillars of host-specialized Parnassius butterflies. Field experiments show that camouflaged grey leaves matching the surrounding scree habitat experience reduced oviposition by female butterflies and herbivory by caterpillars, resulting in higher fruit set than that achieved by green-leaved plants. The defence is entirely visual. Multi-omics data and functional validation reveal that a 254-bp-inserted transposon causes anthocyanin accumulation in leaves, giving them a rock-like grey colour. Demographic analyses of plant and butterfly effective population sizes over the past 500 years indicate that plant populations have been more stable at sites with camouflage than at sites with only green-leaved plants. In the recent past, populations of Parnassius butterflies have declined at sites with camouflaged plants. These findings provide insights into the genetics of a plant camouflage trait and its potential role in the rapidly changing dynamics of plant–herbivore interactions. Multi-omics analysis reveals that a 254-bp transposon induces defensive camouflage in an alpine plant and reduces herbivory by caterpillars of a specialist butterfly. Protective effects of this camouflage are reflected in the long-term dynamics of co-evolving plant and butterfly populations.},

  abstract     = {The origin of eukaryotes was a key event in the history of life. Current leading hypotheses propose that a symbiosis between an asgardarchaeal host cell and an alphaproteobacterial endosymbiont represented a crucial step in eukaryotic origin and that metabolic cross-feeding between the partners provided the basis for their subsequent evolutionary integration. A major unanswered question is whether the metabolism of modern eukaryotes bears any vestige of this ancestral syntrophy. Here we systematically analyse the evolutionary origins of the eukaryotic gene repertoires mediating central carbon metabolism. Our phylogenetic and sequence analyses reveal that this gene repertoire is chimeric, with ancestral contributions from Asgardarchaeota and Alphaproteobacteria operating predominantly in glycolysis and the tricarboxylic acid cycle, respectively. Our analyses also reveal the extent to which this ancestral metabolic interplay has been remodelled via gene loss, transfer and subcellular retargeting in the &gt;2 billion years since the origin of eukaryotic cells, and we identify genetic contributions from other prokaryotic sources in addition to the asgardarchaeal host and alphaproteobacterial endosymbiont. Our work demonstrates that, in contrast to previous assumptions, modern eukaryotic metabolism preserves information about the nature of the original asgardarchaeal–alphaproteobacterial interactions and supports syntrophy scenarios for the origin of the eukaryotic cell. Analysis of the eukaryotic gene repertoires mediating central carbon metabolism identifies ancestral contributions from Alphaproteobacteria, Asgardarchaeota and other microbial taxa, followed by gene loss, transfer and subcellular retargeting, which have remodelled central carbon metabolism over time.},

  abstract     = {Cyanobacteria induced the great oxidation event around 2.4 billion years ago, probably triggering the rise in aerobic biodiversity. While chlorophylls are universal pigments used by all phototrophic organisms, cyanobacteria use additional pigments called phycobilins for their light-harvesting antennas—phycobilisomes—to absorb light energy at complementary wavelengths to chlorophylls. Nonetheless, an enigma persists: why did cyanobacteria need phycobilisomes? Here, we demonstrate through numerical simulations that the underwater light spectrum during the Archaean era was probably predominantly green owing to oxidized Fe(III) precipitation. The green-light environments, probably shaped by photosynthetic organisms, may have directed their own photosynthetic evolution. Genetic engineering of extant cyanobacteria, simulating past natural selection, suggests that cyanobacteria that acquired a green-specialized phycobilin called phycoerythrobilin could have flourished under green-light environments. Phylogenetic analyses indicate that the common ancestor of modern cyanobacteria embraced all key components of phycobilisomes to establish an intricate energy transfer mechanism towards chlorophylls using green light and thus gained strong selective advantage under green-light conditions. Our findings highlight the co-evolutionary relationship between oxygenic phototrophs and light environments that defined the aquatic landscape of the Archaean Earth and envision the green colour as a sign of the distinct evolutionary stage of inhabited planets. Cyanobacteria use both chlorophylls and phycobilins to absorb light energy, and authors here use cultivation experiments, numerical simulations and protein phylogenetics to argue that cyanobacteria evolved in a green-light environment during the Archaean era in which green-specialized phycobilins would have been selectively advantageous.},

Without knowing the current distribution of what drives the emergence of such novelty, predicting future ecosystem states and informing conservation and restoration policies remain difficult. Here we construct global maps of three key drivers generating novel conditions—climate change, defaunation and floristic disruption—and summarize them to a measure of total novelty exposure. We show that the terrestrial biosphere is widely exposed to novel conditions, with 58% of the total area exposed to high levels of total novelty. All climatic regions and biomes are exposed to substantial levels of novelty. Relative contributions of individual drivers vary between climatic regions, with climate changes and defaunation the largest contributors globally. Protected areas and key biodiversity areas, whether formally protected or not, have similar exposure, with high total novelty experienced in 58% of cells inside protected areas and 56% inside key biodiversity areas. Our results highlight the importance of investigating ecosystem and biodiversity responses to rising ecological novelty for informing actions towards biosphere stewardship. Even outside urban and agricultural areas, ecosystems are vastly transformed as a result of human activities.

This allometric rule fails to explain a considerable fraction of trophic links in aquatic food webs. Here we show that food-web constraints result in guilds of predators that vary in size but have specialized on prey of the same size, and that the distribution of such specialist guilds explains about one-half of the food-web structure. We classified 517 pelagic species into five predator functional groups. Most of these follow three prey selection strategies: a guild following the allometric rule whereby larger predators eat larger prey and two guilds of specialists that prefer either smaller or larger prey than predicted by the allometric rule. Such coexistence of non-specialist and specialist guilds independent from taxa or body size points towards structural principles behind ecological complexity. We show that the pattern describes &gt;90% of observed linkages in 218 food webs in 18 aquatic ecosystems worldwide. The pattern can be linked to eco-evolutionary constraints to prey exploitation and provides a blueprint for more effective food-web models. The structure of aquatic food webs does not fit standard allometric predictions.

With strategic planning, the 1.82-fold increase in finfish and 2.36-fold increase in bivalve production needed to meet expected global mariculture demand in 2050 could be achieved with up to a 30.5% decrease in cumulative impact to global marine biodiversity.

  abstract     = {Natural communities form networks of species linked by interactions. Understanding the structure and dynamics of these ecological networks is pivotal to predicting species extinction risks, community stability and ecosystem functioning under global change. Traditionally, ecological network research has focused on interactions involving the flow of matter and energy, such as feeding or pollination. In nature, however, species also interact by intentionally or unintentionally exchanging information signals and cues that influence their behaviour and movement. Here we argue that this exchange of information between species constitutes an information network of nature—a crucial but largely neglected aspect of community organization. We propose to integrate information with matter flow interactions in multilayer networks. This integration reveals a novel classification of information links based on how the senders and receivers of information are embedded in food web motifs. We show that synthesizing information and matter flow interactions in multilayer networks can lead to shorter pathways connecting species and a denser aggregation of species in fewer modules. Ultimately, this tighter interconnectedness of species increases the risk of perturbation spread in natural communities, which undermines their stability. Understanding the information network of nature is thus crucial for predicting community dynamics in the era of global change. Ecological network research has typically focused on flows of matter and energy, but species also exchange information signals and cues that influence behaviour and movement. This Perspective argues that the information network of nature is a crucial aspect of community organization.},

By implementing semistructured interviews with 25 biodiversity finance key informants and three focus groups across Europe, we explore opportunities and challenges for upscaling private investment in nature. Opportunities arise from macroeconomic and regulatory changes, along with various technological and financial innovations and growing professional experience. However, persistent barriers to upscaling include the ongoing lack of highly profitable investment opportunities and the multitude of risks facing investors, including political, ecological and reputational risks influencing supply and demand of investment opportunities. Public policy plays the foundational role in creating and hindering these mechanisms. Public policy can create nature markets and investment opportunities, meanwhile agricultural subsidies and poor coordination between public funding sources undermine the supply of return-seeking investment opportunities. Investors demand derisking investments from uncertainties; in part caused by political uncertainty. These markets require profound state intervention to enable upscaling whilst achieving positive ecological outcomes; private investment will probably not upscale without major public policy change and public investment. Semistructured interviews and focus groups with experts in biodiversity finance in Europe identify opportunities and barriers to upscaling private investment in biodiversity, and emphasize that public policy is the key to enabling progression.},

  abstract     = {Forest gains and losses may have unequal effects on forest resilience, particularly given their distinct temporal dynamics. Here, we quantify the sensitivities of boreal forest resilience to forest cover gain and loss using a resilience indicator derived from the temporal autocorrelation (TAC) of the kernel normalized difference vegetation index from 2000 to 2020. Our findings unveil pronounced asymmetric sensitivities, with stronger sensitivity to forest loss (−4.26 ± 0.14 × 10−3; TAC increase per 1% forest cover loss) than to forest gain (−1.65 ± 0.12 × 10−3; TAC decrease per 1% forest cover gain). Locally, ~73% of the boreal forest exhibits negative sensitivity, indicating enhanced resilience with forest cover gain and vice versa, especially in intact forests compared to managed ones. This sensitivity is affected by various trajectories in forest cover change, stemming primarily from temporal asynchrony in the recovery rates of various ecosystem functions. The observed asymmetry underscores the importance of prioritizing forest conservation over reactive management strategies following losses, ultimately contributing to more sustainable forest management practices. Boreal forests have been experiencing both gains and losses in recent decades. Here, the authors show that boreal forest resilience is more sensitive to forest cover losses than to gains, indicating that functional declines due to forest loss outpace improvements following forest recovery.},

  abstract     = {Global agreements to reduce the extinction risk of migratory species depend critically on intersecting migratory connectivity—the linking of individuals between regions in different seasons—and spatial patterns of environmental change. Here we integrate movement data from &gt;329,000 migratory birds of 112 species to develop a parameter representing exposure to global change: multispecies migratory connectivity. We then combine exposure with projected climate and land-cover changes as a measure of hazard and species conservation assessment scores as a metric of vulnerability to estimate the relative risk of migratory bird population declines across the Western Hemisphere. Multispecies migratory connectivity (exposure) is the strongest driver of risk relative to hazard and vulnerability, indicating the importance of synthesizing connectivity across species to comprehensively assess risk. Connections between breeding regions in Canada and non-breeding regions in South America are at the greatest risk, which underscores the particular susceptibility of long-distance migrants. Over half (54%) of the connections categorized as very high risk include breeding regions in the eastern United States. This three-part framework serves as an ecological risk assessment designed specifically for migratory species, providing both decision support for global biodiversity conservation and opportunities for intergovernmental collaboration to sustain migratory bird populations year-round. On the basis of data from &gt;329,000 migratory birds, this study presents multispecies migratory connectivity as a parameter representing exposure to global change and shows that connections between breeding regions in Canada and non-breeding regions in South America are at greatest risk from global change.},

We constructed a phylogeny with extensive sampling (1,092 loci and ~38% of species), combined with three-dimensional phenotypic data from museum specimens. We used these datasets to examine the tempo and mode of phenotypic diversification. The deep-sea pelagic anglerfishes originated from a benthic ancestor and shortly after experienced rapid lineage diversification rates. This transition incurred shifts towards larger jaws, smaller eyes and a more laterally compressed body plan. Despite these directional trends, this lineage still evolved high phenotypic disparity in body, skull and jaw shapes. In particular, bathypelagic anglerfishes show high variability in body elongation, while benthic anglerfishes are constrained around optimal shapes. Within this radiation, phenotypic evolution was concentrated among recently diverged lineages, notably those that deviated from the archetypical globose body plan. Taken together, these results demonstrate that spectacular evolutionary radiations can unfold even within environments with few ecological resources and demanding physiological challenges. Based on phylogenomic and geometric morphometric analyses of 132 anglerfish species, the authors infer a Cretaceous origin of the clade and show that bathypelagic anglerfish are undergoing rapid phenotypic diversification despite inhabiting a relatively homogeneous deep-sea habitat.},

  abstract     = {Sexual size dimorphism (SSD) is highly prevalent in nature. Several hypotheses aim to explain its evolution including sexual selection, differential equilibrium and ecological niche divergence. Disentangling the causal mechanism behind the evolution of SSD is challenging, as selection arising from multiple pressures on fitness may act simultaneously to generate observed patterns. Here, we use phylogenetic comparative methods to study the evolution of SSD across tetrapods globally. We estimate directional changes in body size evolution, and compare the number, phylogenetic position and magnitude of size changes between sexes. We find evidence that directional changes in size associated with SSD are typically more common in males—even in lineages where females are larger. However, underlying mechanisms differ among lineages—whereas SSD in amphibians becomes more male-biased with greater increases in male size and mammalian SSD becomes more female-biased with greater decreases in male size. Thus, differing mechanisms of directional body size evolution across sexes are essential to explain observed SSD patterns. A phylogenetic comparative analysis of male and female body size across tetrapods globally shows that directional change in size is usually greater in males but reveals different underlying mechanisms among lineages.},

  abstract     = {Sex chromosomes are a fundamental aspect of sex-biased biology, but the extent to which homologous X–Y gene pairs (‘the gametologs’) contribute to sex-biased phenotypes remains hotly debated. Although these genes tend to exhibit large sex differences in expression throughout the body (XX females can express both X members, and XY males can express one X and one Y member), there is conflicting evidence regarding the degree of functional divergence between the X and Y members. Here we develop and apply co-expression fingerprint analysis to characterize functional divergence between the X and Y members of 17 gametolog gene pairs across &gt;40 human tissues. Gametolog pairs exhibit functional divergence between the sexes that is driven by divergence between the X versus Y members (assayed in males), and this within-pair divergence is greatest among pairs with evolutionarily distant X and Y members. These patterns reflect that X versus Y gametologs show coordinated patterns of asymmetric coupling with large sets of autosomal genes, which are enriched for functional pathways and gene sets implicated in sex-biased biology and disease. Our findings suggest that the X versus Y gametologs have diverged in function and prioritize specific gametolog pairs for future targeted experimental studies. Based on co-expression fingerprint analysis between homologous genes in the X and Y chromosomes (gametolog pairs) across &gt;40 human tissues, the authors suggest that X and Y gametologs have diverged in function.},

Climate change is intensifying disturbances, posing risks to ecosystem services. To assess those risks, we develop a flexible, functional trait-based approach to quantify ecological, ecosystem service and economic impacts from disturbance regimes. Our broadly applicable approach integrates knowledge from disturbance ecology and ecosystem service valuation, and we highlight the pitfalls of using either perspective in isolation. We demonstrate our approach by quantifying impacts to timber and recreational enjoyment from extreme windstorms in a midlatitude forest. While we predict large potential losses to these services under historical and future disturbance regimes, common ecological metrics of compositional and biomass stability are inadequate for predicting these impacts. We then provide a roadmap for applying our approach across different social-ecological systems, illustrating the approach for crop pollination, flood hazard mitigation and cultural values from coral reefs—which all face intensifying disturbances. This study highlights and provides tools to address the pressing need to consider disturbances in future ecosystem service assessments. A generalizable, functional-trait-based approach for quantifying the effects of disturbances to ecosystem services and economic outcomes, including under climate change, highlights the need for incorporating disturbances in ecosystem services assessments.},

  abstract     = {Accounting for the cost of repairing the degradation of Earth’s biosphere is critical to guide conservation and sustainable development decisions. Yet the costs of repairing nature through the recovery of a continental suite of threatened species across their range have never been calculated. We estimated the cost of in situ recovery of nationally listed terrestrial and freshwater threatened species (n = 1,657) across the megadiverse continent of Australia by combining the spatially explicit costs of all strategies required to address species-specific threats. Individual species recovery required up to 12 strategies (mean 2.3), predominantly habitat retention and restoration, and the management of fire and invasive species. The estimated costs of maximizing threatened species recovery across Australia varied from AU$0–$12,626 per ha, depending on the species, threats and context of each location. The total cost of implementing all strategies to recover threatened species in their in situ habitat across Australia summed to an estimated AU$583 billion per year, with management of invasive weeds making up 81% of the total cost. This figure, at 25% of Australia’s GDP, does not represent a realistic biodiversity conservation budget, but needs to be accounted for when weighing up decisions that lead to further costly degradation of Australia’s natural heritage. An estimated AU$583 billion per year cost of in situ recovery of terrestrial and freshwater species in Australia, including through habitat restoration and retention and management of invasive species, is not an expected conservation budget, but exemplifies the severe cost of nature declines.},

NBSAPS are an integral feature of the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) framework and signatory nations were requested to submit revised NBSAPs before the 16th Conference of the Parties (COP-16) incorporating the GBF goals and targets. Here we review NBSAPs of the 36 nations that submitted before COP-16 and assess their commitments to implementing target 2 (the 30% restoration target) and target 3 (the 30 × 30 protection target). By first breaking these targets into their constituent elements and assessing the detailed wording of each NBSAP we discover that no nation has created a plan that meets all the requirements—and overall ambitions—of these two targets. With 5 years remaining until the intended realization of the GBF, countries will need to increase both their ambition and action if the biodiversity crisis of the Earth is to be abated. Analysis of the 36 National Biodiversity Strategies and Action Plans that were submitted to the Convention on Biological Diversity by 21 October 2024 reveal that no nation has yet created a plan that meets all elements of targets 2 and 3 of the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework.},

  abstract     = {The outcomes of ecological invasions may depend on either characteristics of the invading species or attributes of the resident community. Here we use a combination of experiments and theory to show that the interplay between dynamics, interaction strength and diversity determine the invasion outcome in microbial communities. We find that the communities with fluctuating species abundances are more invasible and diverse than stable communities, leading to a positive diversity–invasibility relationship among communities assembled in the same environment. As predicted by theory, increasing interspecies interaction strength and species pool size leads to a decrease of invasion probability in our experiment. Our results show a positive correspondence between invasibility and survival fraction of resident species across all conditions. Communities composed of strongly interacting species can exhibit an emergent priority effect in which invader species are less likely to colonize than species in the original pool. However, if an invasion is successful, its ecological effects on the resident community are greater when interspecies interactions are strong. Our findings provide a unified perspective on the diversity–invasibility debate by showing that invasibility and invasion effect are emergent properties of interacting species, which can be predicted by simple community-level features. Predicting invasion outcomes in microbial communities is challenging. Here the authors demonstrate that these outcomes in both theoretical and experimental microbial communities can be predicted based on community dynamics, diversity and species interactions.},

Factors expected to boost resilience include prior exposure to the same disturbance and dispersal from undisturbed patches. Here we set up an in vitro system to test the effect of disturbance pre-exposure and dispersal represented by community mixing. We performed a serial passage experiment on a 23-species bacterial model community, varying pre-exposure history and dispersal rate between three metacommunity patches subjected to different levels of disturbance by the antibiotic streptomycin. As expected, pre-exposure caused evolution of resistance, which prevented decrease in species abundance. The more abundant the pre-exposed species had been in the undisturbed community, the less the entire community changed. Pre-exposure of the most dominant species also decreased abundance change in off-target species. In the absence of pre-exposure, increasing dispersal rates caused increasing spread of the disturbance across the metacommunity. However, pre-exposure kept the metacommunity close to the undisturbed state regardless of dispersal rate. Our findings demonstrate that pre-exposure is an important modifier of ecological resilience in a metacommunity setting. Community resilience to stress is affected by factors such as pre-exposure to the same stress and intercommunity dispersal. The authors show that pre-exposing the most dominant members of a 23-species bacterial community to different levels of antibiotic stress leads to rapid evolution of resistance that improves metacommunity resilience even under high levels of dispersal.},

However, the growth seasonality of below-ground woody organs, such as coarse roots, has been largely overlooked. Here we use tree monitoring data and pot experiments involving saplings to examine the late-season xylem development of stem and coarse roots with leaf phenology in four common deciduous tree species in Western Europe. Coarse-roots wood growth continued throughout the winter whereas stem wood growth halted in autumn, regardless of the tree species, experimental setting or location. Our results do not indicate a clear temperature constraint on below-ground wood growth, even during prolonged periods with soil temperatures lower than 3 °C. The continuous differentiation of xylem root cells in autumn and winter suggests that the non-growing season does not exist sensu stricto for all woody organs of angiosperm deciduous tree species of the temperate zone. Our findings hold implications for understanding tree functioning, in particular the seasonal wood formation, the environmental controls of tree growth and the carbon reserves dynamics. As wood growth in deciduous tree stems halts during winter, it has been assumed that wood growth in coarse roots follows the same pattern. This study on the growth of stem and coarse roots of four European tree species challenges the assumption of winter halt in below-ground wood growth of temperate deciduous trees.},

We also highlight key challenges, risks and considerations when using generative AI within ecology, such as privacy risks, model biases and environmental effects. Ultimately, the future of generative AI in ecology lies in the development of robust interdisciplinary collaborations between ecologists and computer scientists. Such partnerships will be important for embedding ecological knowledge within AI, leading to more ecologically meaningful and relevant models. This will be critical for leveraging the power of generative AI to drive ecological insights into species across the globe.

Answering this question requires research into the effects of weather on the population dynamics of transmission and infection; elucidating these effects, however, has proved difficult due to the challenges of assessing causality from the predominantly observational data available in epidemiological research. Here we show how concepts from causal inference—the sub-field of statistics aiming at inferring causality from data—can guide that research. Through a series of case studies, we illustrate how such concepts can help assess study design and strategically choose a study’s location, evaluate and reduce the risk of bias, and interpret the multifaceted effects of meteorological variables on transmission. More broadly, we argue that interdisciplinary approaches based on explicit causal frameworks are crucial for reliably estimating the effect of weather and accurately predicting the consequences of climate change. A series of case studies is used to illustrate how concepts from causal interference can be used to guide research into the effects of weather on the transmission and population dynamics of infectious diseases.},

  abstract     = {Our understanding of animal ornaments and the mating preferences driving their exaggeration is limited by knowledge of their genetics. Post-copulatory sexual selection is credited with the rapid evolution of female sperm-storage organ morphology and corresponding sperm quality traits across diverse taxa. In Drosophila, the mechanisms by which longer flagella convey an advantage in the competition among sperm for limited storage space in the female, and by which female sperm-storage organ morphology biases fertilization in favour of longer sperm have been resolved. However, the evolutionary genetics underlying this model post-copulatory ornament and preference system have remained elusive. Here we combined comparative analyses of 149 Drosophila species, a genome-wide association study in Drosophila melanogaster and molecular evolutionary analysis of ~9,400 genes to elucidate how sperm and female sperm-storage organ length co-evolved into one of nature’s most extreme ornaments and preferences. Our results reveal a diverse repertoire of pleiotropic genes linking sperm length and seminal receptacle length expression to central nervous system development and sensory biology. Sperm length development appears condition-dependent and is governed by conserved hormonal (insulin/insulin-like growth factor) and developmental (including Notch and Fruitless) pathways. Central developmental pathway genes, including Notch, also comprised the majority of a restricted set of genes contributing to both intraspecific and interspecific variation in sperm length. Our findings support ‘good genes’ models of female preference evolution. A comparative analysis of morphological data across 149 species of Drosophilidae shows that sperm length in males has co-evolved with the length of the sperm-storage organ in females. Combining a genome-wide association study of these traits in Drosophila melanogaster with molecular evolutionary analyses of the genomes of 15 Drosophila species, the authors find that the genetic architecture underlying sperm length is associated with indirect genetic benefits in females, providing support for the ‘good genes’ hypothesis.},

  abstract     = {The probability of parallel genetic evolution is a function of the strength of selection and constraints imposed by genetic architecture. Inversions capture locally adapted alleles and suppress recombination between them, which limits the range of adaptive responses. In addition, the combined phenotypic effect of alleles within inversions is likely to be greater than that of individual alleles; this should further increase the contributions of inversions to parallel evolution. We tested the hypothesis that inversions contribute disproportionately to parallel genetic evolution in independent dune ecotypes of Helianthus petiolaris. We analysed habitat data and identified variables underlying parallel habitat shifts. Genotype–environment association analyses of these variables indicated parallel responses of inversions to shared selective pressures. We also confirmed larger seed size across the dunes and performed quantitative trait locus mapping with multiple crosses. Quantitative trait loci shared between locations fell into inversions more than expected by chance. We used whole-genome sequencing data to identify selective sweeps in the dune ecotypes and found that the majority of shared swept regions were found within inversions. Phylogenetic analyses of shared regions indicated that within inversions, the same allele typically was found in the dune habitat at both sites. These results confirm predictions that inversions drive parallel divergence in the dune ecotypes. Analysis of habitat data, quantitative trait locus mapping of seed size and selective sweeps show parallel selection acting on inversions in two independent dune ecotypes of the prairie sunflower, Helianthus petiolaris.},

  abstract     = {Environmental filtering and dispersal history limit plant distributions and affect biogeographical patterns, but how their relative importance varies across evolutionary timescales is unresolved. Phylogenetic beta diversity quantifies dissimilarity in evolutionary relatedness among assemblages and might help resolve the ecological and biogeographical mechanisms structuring biodiversity. Here, we examined the effects of environmental dissimilarity and geographical distance on phylogenetic and taxonomic turnover for ~270,000 seed plant species globally and across evolutionary timescales. We calculated past and present dispersal barriers using palaeogeographical reconstructions and calculated geographical linear and least-cost distances, accounting for dispersal over water, mountains or areas with unsuitable climates. Environmental dissimilarity and geographical distance jointly explained most of the deviance in taxonomic (up to 86.4%) and phylogenetic turnover (65.6%). While environmental dissimilarity consistently showed strongly positive effects, the effect of geographical distance on phylogenetic turnover was less pronounced further back in evolutionary time. Past physiogeographical barriers explained a relatively low amount of the variation across all timescales, with a slight peak at intermediate timescales (20–50 Myr bp). Our results suggest that while old lineages have generally dispersed widely, the imprint of environmental filtering on range expansion persists, providing insights into biogeographical and evolutionary processes underlying global biodiversity patterns. This modelling study integrates comprehensive regional plant inventories, environmental conditions and palaeogeographical reconstructions to assess the relative roles of environmental filtering and dispersal barriers in shaping global seed plant diversity, demonstrating that environmental filtering has a persistent effect on species distribution patterns across evolutionary timescales.},

While previous studies have often examined the extreme scenario of complete pollinator removal, showing negative impacts on plant reproductive success, we take a more realistic approach by focusing on the effects of decreasing pollinator diversity. Our global meta-analysis reveals a notable negative impact of reduced pollinator species diversity on plant reproductive success measures, such as seed set, fruit set and fruit weight. Notably, this effect varies across plant families, impacting both self-incompatible and self-compatible species. We also find that wild plant species suffer more than cultivated ones. Furthermore, the loss of invertebrate, nocturnal and wild pollinators has a more substantial impact than the loss of vertebrate, diurnal or managed pollinators. Overall, our findings consistently underscore the positive role of biodiversity in maintaining ecosystem functioning, highlighting the urgency of mitigating factors that lead to the decline in pollinator species diversity. A meta-analysis finds that decreasing diversity of pollinator species has a negative affect on multiple measures of plant reproductive success, with wild plant species affected more than cultivated species, and loss of invertebrate, nocturnal and wild pollinators being particularly problematic.},

  abstract     = {Anthropogenic landscape modification may lead to the proliferation of a few species and the loss of many. Here we investigate mechanisms and functional consequences of this winner–loser replacement in six human-modified Amazonian and Atlantic Forest regions in Brazil using a causal inference framework. Combining floristic and functional trait data for 1,207 tree species across 271 forest plots, we find that forest loss consistently caused an increased dominance of low-density woods and small seeds dispersed by endozoochory (winner traits) and the loss of distinctive traits, such as extremely dense woods and large seeds dispersed by synzoochory (loser traits). Effects on leaf traits and maximum tree height were rare or inconsistent. The independent causal effects of landscape configuration were rare, but local degradation remained important in multivariate trait-disturbance relationships and exceeded the effects of forest loss in one Amazonian region. Our findings highlight that tropical forest loss and local degradation drive predictable functional changes to remaining tree assemblages and that certain traits are consistently associated with winners and losers across different regional contexts. Tropical forest landscapes are increasingly being modified by human activities. Here the authors apply a causal inference approach to Neotropical forest data to disentangle the role of landscape-level and local drivers and reveal replacement of ‘loser’ by ‘winner’ tree species with distinct functional profiles.},

Even with other climatic factors controlled (for example, moisture index, temperature and vapour pressure deficit), wind speed clearly affected plant hydraulics; for example, on average, species from windier sites constructed sapwood with smaller D and lower KS that was more resilient to drought (more negative P50), deploying less leaf total area for a given sapwood cross-section. Species with these traits may be at an advantage under future climates with higher wind speeds. A global analysis of hydraulic traits in 1,922 woody plant species shows that wind speed has substantial effects on key traits related to plant water transport, independently of other climatic factors.},

  abstract     = {Climate change has altered the timing of recurring biological cycles in both plants and animals. Phenological changes may be unequal within and among trophic levels, potentially impacting the intricate interactions that regulate ecosystem functioning. Here we compile and analyse a global dataset of terrestrial phenological observations, including nearly half a million time series for both plants and animals. Our analysis reveals an increasing phenological asynchronization between plants and animals from 1981 to 2020, with a stronger overall advancement of late-season phenophases for plants than for animals. Almost 30% of temporal variations in plant phenophases can be explained by the timing of the preceding phenophases. This temporal dependency allows the advancement caused by warming to accumulate and propagate through seasons, advancing later phenophases more than earlier phases. By contrast, animals rely on various environmental cues and resource-tracking strategies to initiate their life-cycle activities, which weakens their cross-phenophase linkage and undermines the effect of warming. Our results suggest that future warming may increase phenological asynchronization between plants and animals and potentially disturb trophic interactions and ecosystem stability. Climate change is inducing widespread shifts in the phenology of terrestrial organisms.

  abstract     = {Testing the extent to which ecological communities are structured by deterministic (niche-based) assembly processes, resulting in predictable species abundance and composition, is a fundamental goal of ecology. Here we use a 10-year dataset of 55,156 lianas comprising 86 species in an old-growth tropical forest in Panama to test whether community assembly is consistent with niche-based assembly processes. We find that species diversity and community composition was maintained because species conformed to four general requirements of coexistence theory: (1) species have negative conspecific frequency-dependent feedback that control their local population size; (2) species have a stronger negative effect on their own population than that of heterospecifics; (3) the equilibrium frequencies of species correspond to their relative abundance; and (4) species have positive invasibility. These results indicate that coexistence through deterministic niche-based processes controls local population sizes and prevents any one species from displacing others. Rare species persisted because particularly strong negative feedbacks maintained them at their relatively low equilibrium abundances, thus preventing them from going extinct. Furthermore, we show that it is necessary to use population demography to test coexistence theory because stem mortality alone does not reflect species demography. These findings have broad implications for species coexistence and diversity maintenance in tropical forests and possibly other ecosystems. Ecological communities may arise through distinct assembly processes, which are difficult to disentangle. Here the authors show that deterministic niche-based, not neutral dispersal, assembly processes explain the vast majority of the structure of a tropical forest liana community.},

  abstract     = {Plant communities are composed of species that differ both in functional traits and evolutionary histories. As species’ functional traits partly result from their individual evolutionary history, we expect the functional diversity of communities to increase with increasing phylogenetic diversity. This expectation has only been tested at local scales and generally for specific growth forms or specific habitat types, for example, grasslands. Here we compare standardized effect sizes for functional and phylogenetic diversity among 1,781,836 vegetation plots using the global sPlot database. In contrast to expectations, we find functional diversity and phylogenetic diversity to be only weakly and negatively correlated, implying a decoupling between these two facets of diversity. While phylogenetic diversity is higher in forests and reflects recent climatic conditions (1981 to 2010), functional diversity tends to reflect recent and past climatic conditions (21,000 years ago). The independent nature of functional and phylogenetic diversity makes it crucial to consider both aspects of diversity when analysing ecosystem functioning and prioritizing conservation efforts. Functional diversity and phylogenetic diversity are expected to be positively correlated. Here the authors show that the covariation between these metrics in vascular plant communities around the world is often either inconsistent or negative.},

  abstract     = {Genomic and ancient DNA data have revolutionized palaeoanthropology and our vision of human evolution, with indisputable landmarks like the sequencing of Neanderthal and Denisovan genomes. Yet, using genetic data to identify, date and quantify evolutionary events—such as ancient bottlenecks or admixture—is not straightforward, as inferences may depend on model assumptions. In the last two decades, the idea that Neanderthals and members of the Homo sapiens lineage interbred has gained momentum. From the status of unlikely theory, it has reached consensus among human evolutionary biologists. This theory is mainly supported by statistical approaches that depend on demographic models minimizing or ignoring population structure, despite its widespread occurrence and the fact that, when ignored, population structure can lead to the inference of spurious demographic events. We simulated genomic data under a structured and admixture-free model of human evolution, and found that all the tested admixture approaches identified long Neanderthal fragments in our simulated genomes and an admixture event that never took place. We also observed that several published admixture models failed to predict important empirical diversity or admixture statistics, and that we could identify several scenarios from our structured model that better predicted these statistics jointly. Using a simulated time series of ancient DNA, the structured scenarios could also predict the trajectory of the empirical D statistics. Our results suggest that models accounting for population structure are fundamental to improve our understanding of human evolution, and that admixture between Neanderthals and H. sapiens needs to be re-evaluated in the light of structured models. Beyond the Neanderthal case, we argue that ancient hybridization events, which are increasingly documented in many species, including with other hominins, may also benefit from such re-evaluation. Simulating a metapopulation of human evolution without Neanderthal introgression into Homo sapiens still identifies Neanderthal fragments in simulated genomes, and an admixture event that never took place. This indicates that population structure must be accounted for in human evolutionary genomics and that putative ancient hybridization events should be reinterpreted in this light.},

  abstract     = {Ex situ living plant collections play a crucial role in providing nature-based solutions to twenty-first century global challenges. However, the complex dynamics of these artificial ecosystems are poorly quantified and understood, affecting biodiversity storage, conservation and utilization. To evaluate the management of ex situ plant diversity, we analysed a century of data comprising 2.2 million records, from a meta-collection currently holding ~500,000 accessions and 41% of global ex situ species diversity. Our study provides critical insights into the historical evolution, current state and future trajectory of global living collections. We reveal sigmoidal growth of a meta-collection that has reached capacity in both total accessions and total diversity, and identify intrinsic constraints on biodiversity management, including a median survival probability of 15 years. We explore the impact of external constraints and quantify the influence of the Convention on Biological Diversity, which we link to reduced acquisition of wild-origin and internationally sourced material by 44% and 38%, respectively. We further define the impact of these constraints on ex situ conservation but highlight targeted initiatives that successfully mitigate these challenges. Ultimately, our study underscores the urgent need for strategic prioritization and the re-evaluation of ex situ biodiversity management to achieve both scientific and conservation goals. The authors collate a meta-collection of ex situ living plant diversity held in 50 botanical collections worldwide, spanning a century of data and currently containing ~500,000 accessions. Their analyses examine the capacities and constraints within living plant collections, reveal the impact of the Convention on Biological Diversity and its consequences for material exchange and conservation, and call for the re-evaluation of strategic priorities.},

  abstract     = {Rapid growth in bio-logging—the use of animal-borne electronic tags to document the movements, behaviour, physiology and environments of wildlife—offers opportunities to mitigate biodiversity threats and expand digital natural history archives. Here we present a vision to achieve such benefits by accounting for the heterogeneity inherent to bio-logging data and the concerns of those who collect and use them. First, we can enable data integration through standard vocabularies, transfer protocols and aggregation protocols, and drive their wide adoption. Second, we need to develop integrated data collections on standardized data platforms that support data preservation through public archiving and strategies that ensure long-term access. We outline pathways to reach these goals, highlighting the need for resources to govern community data standards and guide data mobilization efforts. We propose the launch of a community-led coordinating body and provide recommendations for how stakeholders—including government data centres, museums and those who fund, permit and publish bio-logging work—can support these efforts. Animal-borne electronic tags, or bio-loggers, are increasingly used for research and wildlife conservation. This Perspective discusses the importance of standardization, long-term archiving and sharing of bio-logging data, and outlines a roadmap to achieve these goals.},

The availability of digital, open-access herbarium data is, perhaps counter-intuitively, expanding the use of physical collections by researchers who use digital collections to find specimens and then sample physical collections for multiomics investigations, including genomics, transcriptomics, metabolomics, proteomics and microbiomics. These investigations are leading to new scientific insights and supporting the development of conservation actions, but they come with a substantial cost: the partial or complete destruction of often irreplaceable specimens, which constitute a global heritage that should be permanently safeguarded for future reference. Here we provide a set of recommended best practices for the sustainable, equitable and ethical sampling of herbarium specimens. Our recommendations are intended for two complementary and partially overlapping audiences—users and stewards—who together build, use and protect herbarium collections. Greater availability of digital herbarium data is leading to more researchers seeking to sample physical herbarium collections.

  abstract     = {Large stochastic population abundance fluctuations are ubiquitous across the tree of life, impacting the predictability and outcomes of population dynamics. It is generally thought that abundance fluctuations with a Taylor’s law exponent of two do not strongly impact evolution. However, we argue that such abundance fluctuations can lead to substantial genotype frequency fluctuations if different genotypes in a population experience these fluctuations asynchronously. By serially diluting mixtures of two closely related Escherichia coli strains, we show that such asynchrony can occur, leading to giant frequency fluctuations that far exceed expectations from genetic drift. We develop an effective model explaining that the abundance fluctuations arise from correlated offspring numbers between individuals, and the large frequency fluctuations result from (even slight) decoupling in offspring number correlations between genotypes. The model quantitatively predicts the observed abundance and frequency fluctuation scaling. Initially close trajectories diverge exponentially, suggesting that chaotic dynamics may underpin the excess frequency fluctuations. Our findings suggest that decoupling noise is also present in mixed-genotype Saccharomyces cerevisiae populations. Theoretical analyses demonstrate that decoupling noise can strongly influence evolutionary outcomes, in a manner distinct from genetic drift. Given the generic nature of these frequency fluctuations, we expect them to be widespread across biological populations. Based on a combination of experiments and modelling, this study shows large stochastic fluctuations in genotype frequencies caused by intrinsic and extrinsic factors, with implications for population dynamics and evolution.},

  abstract     = {Genome-wide premortem DNA methylation patterns can be computationally reconstructed from high-coverage DNA sequences of ancient samples. Because DNA methylation is more conserved across species than across tissues, and ancient DNA is typically extracted from bones and teeth, previous works utilizing ancient DNA methylation maps focused on studying evolutionary changes in the skeletal system. Here we suggest that DNA methylation patterns in one tissue may, under certain conditions, be informative on DNA methylation patterns in other tissues of the same individual. Using the fact that tissue-specific DNA methylation builds up during embryonic development, we identified the conditions that allow for such cross-tissue inference and devised an algorithm that carries it out. We trained the algorithm on methylation data from extant species and reached high precisions of up to 0.92 for validation datasets. We then used the algorithm on archaic humans, and identified more than 1,850 positions for which we were able to observe differential DNA methylation in prefrontal cortex neurons. These positions are linked to hundreds of genes, many of which are involved in neural functions such as structural and developmental processes. Six positions are located in the neuroblastoma breaking point family (NBPF) gene family, which probably played a role in human brain evolution. The algorithm we present here allows for the examination of epigenetic changes in tissues and cell types that are absent from the palaeontological record, and therefore provides new ways to study the evolutionary impacts of epigenetic changes. The authors show that DNA methylation patterns in one tissue can inform on those in another, under certain conditions, and devise an algorithm that allows identification of differential DNA methylation. They applied it to an archaic human dataset, revealing information about human brain evolution in the absence of preserved brain tissue.},

  abstract     = {Caring for newborn offspring hampers resource acquisition of mammalian females, curbing their ability to meet the high energy expenditure of early lactation. Newborns are particularly vulnerable, and, among the large herbivores, ungulates have evolved a continuum of neonatal antipredator tactics, ranging from immobile hider (such as roe deer fawns or impala calves) to highly mobile follower offspring (such as reindeer calves or chamois kids). How these tactics constrain female movements around parturition is unknown, particularly within the current context of increasing habitat fragmentation and earlier plant phenology caused by global warming. Here, using a comparative analysis across 54 populations of 23 species of large herbivores from 5 ungulate families (Bovidae, Cervidae, Equidae, Antilocapridae and Giraffidae), we show that mothers adjust their movements to variation in resource productivity and heterogeneity according to their offspring’s neonatal tactic. Mothers with hider offspring are unable to exploit environments where the variability of resources occurs at a broad scale, which might alter resource allocation compared with mothers with follower offspring. Our findings reveal that the overlooked neonatal tactic plays a key role for predicting how species are coping with environmental variation. Combining a large-scale dataset of 23 ungulate species (in which newborns follow contrasting tactics of predator avoidance) with continuous-time stochastic movement models, the authors reveal that there are multiple dimensions of maternal movement behaviour and space use.},

  abstract     = {Australia has proposed a legislated market for biodiversity based on an existing carbon credits scheme which generates Australian carbon credit units (ACCU) from land-based projects. This provides a unique opportunity to assess the potential for markets to benefit biodiversity. We assessed the extent to which projects under the ACCU scheme overlap potential threatened species habitat, compared that to overlap afforded by protected areas, and compared the ability of different project types to deliver potential benefits to species most impacted by habitat loss. Projects are primarily located in low-cost, marginal arid lands, a pattern that reflects that of the protected area estate. Projects are smaller and fewer in number in more productive lands close to human populations. These lands also overlap most threatened species habitat, hence those species most in need of habitat restoration are the least likely to have their habitat restored under the ACCU scheme. Projects, however, do overlap the geographic range of 32% of the 1,660 threatened species assessed, including for 275 species with &lt;17% of their range in protected areas. Biodiversity markets must incentivize actions in areas of high biodiversity value underpinned by regulations that align with national priorities for biodiversity conservation. An assessment of the Australian carbon credit units scheme finds that most current projects under the scheme overlap the habitats of few threatened species. The findings generate lessons for the planned development of a national biodiversity market based on the ACCU scheme.},

  abstract     = {The net ecosystem exchange (NEE), determining terrestrial carbon sequestration capacity, is strongly controlled by climate change and has exhibited substantial year-to-year fluctuations. How the increased frequency and intensity of warm extremes affect NEE variations remains unclear. Here, we combined multiple NEE datasets from atmospheric CO2 inversions, Earth system models, eddy-covariance data-driven methods and climate datasets to show that the terrestrial carbon sequestration capacity is weakened during warm extreme occurrences over the past 40 years, primarily contributed by tropical regions (81% ± 48%). The underlying mechanism can be rooted in the overwhelmingly decreased trend of gross primary productivity compared with terrestrial ecosystem respiration. Additionally, the weakened terrestrial carbon sequestration capacity is mainly driven by the transition from temperature or soil moisture control to vapour pressure deficit control, which is associated with the increasing intensity of warm extremes. Our findings suggest that warm extremes threaten the global carbon sequestration function of terrestrial ecosystems. Therefore, more attention should be given to the evolution of the increasing intensity of warm extremes in future climate projections. Extreme weather events are becoming more frequent and may have disproportionate effects on carbon cycling. Here, the authors quantify the impact of warm extreme occurrences on terrestrial carbon sequestration capacity over the past 40 years.},

  abstract     = {Bats and birds are defined by their convergent evolution of flight, hypothesized to require the modular decoupling of wing and leg evolution. Although a wealth of evidence supports this interpretation in birds, there has been no systematic attempt to identify modular organization in the bat limb skeleton. Here we present a phylogenetically representative and ecologically diverse collection of limb skeletal measurements from 111 extant bat species. We compare this dataset with a compendium of 149 bird species, known to exhibit modular evolution and anatomically regionalized skeletal adaptation. We demonstrate that, in contrast to birds, morphological diversification across crown bats is associated with strong trait integration both within and between the forelimb and hindlimb. Different regions of the bat limb skeleton adapt to accommodate variation in distinct ecological activities, with flight-style variety accommodated by adaptation of the distal wing, while the thumb and hindlimb play an important role facilitating adaptive responses to variation in roosting habits. We suggest that the wing membrane enforces evolutionary integration across the bat skeleton, highlighting that the evolution of the bat thumb is less correlated with the evolution of other limb bone proportions. We propose that strong limb integration inhibits bat adaptive responses, explaining their lower rates of phenotypic evolution and relatively homogeneous evolutionary dynamics in contrast to birds. Powered flight, enabled by the membranous wing, is therefore not only a key bat innovation but their defining inhibition. Contrary to expectations from studies of birds, ecological radiation in crown bats is associated with strong trait integration both within and between forelimb and hindlimb.},

  abstract     = {Anthropogenic land-use change is an important driver of global biodiversity loss and threatens public health through biological interactions. Understanding these landscape–ecological effects at local scales will help achieve the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals by balancing urbanization, biodiversity and the spread of infectious diseases. Here, we address this knowledge gap by analysing a 43-year-long monthly dataset (1980–2022) of synanthropic rodents in Central China during intensive land-use change. We observed a notable increase in the mean patch size, coinciding with a substantial change in rodent community composition and a marked decline in rodent diversity; eight of the nine local rodent species experienced near-extirpation. Our analysis reveals that these irregular species replacements can be attributed to the effect of land consolidation on species competition among rodents, favouring striped field mice, a critical reservoir host of Hantaan virus (HTNV). Consequently, land consolidation has facilitated the proliferation of striped field mice and increased the prevalence of HTNV among them. This study highlights the importance of considering both direct and indirect effects of anthropogenic activities in the management of biodiversity and public health. A 43-year dataset of rodents in the Hu region of China reveals how urbanization-induced changes to land-use configuration affect rodent community composition, including benefitting striped field mice, the primary local hosts of the zoonotic pathogen Hantaan virus.},

  abstract     = {During the sixth millennium bce, the first farmers of Central Europe rapidly expanded across a varied mosaic of forested environments. Such environments would have offered important sources of mineral-rich animal feed and shelter, prompting the question: to what extent did early farmers exploit forests to raise their herds? Here, to resolve this, we have assembled multi-regional datasets, comprising bulk and compound-specific stable isotope values from zooarchaeological remains and pottery, and conducted cross-correlation analyses within a palaeo-environmental framework. Our findings reveal a diversity of pasturing strategies for cattle employed by early farmers, with a notable emphasis on intensive utilization of forests for grazing and seasonal foddering in some regions. This experimentation with forest-based animal feeds by early farmers would have enhanced animal fertility and milk yields for human consumption, concurrently contributing to the expansion of prehistoric farming settlements and the transformation of forest ecosystems. Our study emphasizes the intricate relationship that existed between early farmers and forested landscapes, shedding light on the adaptive dynamics that shaped humans, animals and environments in the past.

  abstract     = {Venoms are biochemical arsenals that have emerged in numerous animal lineages, where they have co-evolved with morphological and behavioural traits for venom production and delivery. In centipedes, venom evolution is thought to be constrained by the morphological complexity of their venom glands due to physiological limitations on the number of toxins produced by their secretory cells. Here we show that the uneven toxin expression that results from these limitations have enabled Scolopendra morsitans to regulate the composition of their secreted venom despite the lack of gross morphologically complex venom glands. We show that this control is probably achieved by a combination of this heterogenous toxin distribution with a dual mechanism of venom secretion that involves neuromuscular innervation as well as stimulation via neurotransmitters. Our results suggest that behavioural control over venom composition may be an overlooked aspect of venom biology and provide an example of how exaptation can facilitate evolutionary innovation and novelty. Uneven toxin production in giant centipedes due to morphological and physiological constraints has been evolutionarily exapted through neuromuscular innervation and neurotransmitter stimulation to provide behavioural control over venom composition.},

  abstract     = {Global biodiversity is under accelerating threats, and species are succumbing to extinction before being described. Madagascar’s biota represents an extreme example of this scenario, with the added complication that much of its endemic biodiversity is cryptic. Here we illustrate best practices for clarifying cryptic diversification processes by presenting an integrative framework that leverages multiple lines of evidence and taxon-informed cut-offs for species delimitation, while placing special emphasis on identifying patterns of isolation by distance. We systematically apply this framework to an entire taxonomically controversial primate clade, the mouse lemurs (genus Microcebus, family Cheirogaleidae). We demonstrate that species diversity has been overestimated primarily due to the interpretation of geographic variation as speciation, potentially biasing inference of the underlying processes of evolutionary diversification. Following a revised classification, we find that crypsis within the genus is best explained by a model of morphological stasis imposed by stabilizing selection and a neutral process of niche diversification. Finally, by clarifying species limits and defining evolutionarily significant units, we provide new conservation priorities, bridging fundamental and applied objectives in a generalizable framework. A spatial taxonomic framework integrating genomic, morphological, ecological, life history and acoustic data is used to clarify the cryptic evolution of the taxonomically controversial mouse lemur complex, with a view to aiding future conservation of this and other similarly cryptic clades.},

  abstract     = {Ecological variation and anthropogenic landscape modification have had key roles in the diversification and extinction of mammals in Madagascar. Lemurs represent a radiation with more than 100 species, constituting roughly one-fifth of the primate order. Almost all species of lemurs are threatened with extinction, but little is known about their genetic diversity and demographic history. Here, we analyse high-coverage genome-wide resequencing data from 162 unique individuals comprising 50 species of Lemuriformes, including multiple individuals from most species. Genomic diversity varies widely across the infraorder and yet is broadly consistent among individuals within species. We show widespread introgression in multiple genera and generally high levels of genomic diversity likely resulting from allele sharing that occurred during periods of connectivity and fragmentation during climatic shifts. We find distinct patterns of demographic history in lemurs across the ecogeographic regions of Madagascar within the last million years. Within the past 2,000 years, lemurs underwent major declines in effective population size that corresponded to the timing of human population expansion in Madagascar. In multiple regions of the island, we identified chronological trajectories of inbreeding that are consistent across genera and species, suggesting localized effects of human activity. Our results show how the extraordinary diversity of these long-neglected, endangered primates has been influenced by ecological and anthropogenic factors. Analysis of the genomes of 50 species of Lemuriformes shows high levels of genomic diversity, likely due to allele sharing, as well as population declines and inbreeding patterns resulting from ecological factors and human impacts in Madagascar.},

  abstract     = {The combined gravity of biodiversity loss and climate change keeps increasing. As the approaching catastrophe has never looked so alarming, the amount of scientific knowledge about the bioclimatic crisis is still rising exponentially. Here we reflect on how researchers in ecology or climate science behave amid this crisis. In face of the disproportionality between how much scientists know and how little they engage, we discuss four barriers that may underlie the decoupling of scientific awareness from concrete action. We then reflect on the potency of rational thinking to trigger engagement on its own, and question whether more scientific knowledge can be the tipping point towards radical changes within society. Our observations challenge the tenet that a better understanding of what surrounds us is necessary to protect it efficiently. With the environmental cost of scientific research itself as an additional factor that must be considered, we suggest there is an urgent need for researchers to collectively reflect on their situation and decide how to redirect their actions. Many scientists are acutely aware of the crises of biodiversity loss and climate change, yet this abundance of knowledge is not always coupled to action. This Perspective discusses this discrepancy and urges researchers to reflect on the situation and redirect energy to take action.},
