  abstract     = {The set of quantum logic gates that can be easily implemented is fundamental to the performance of quantum computers, as it governs the accuracy of basic quantum operations and dictates the complexity of implementing quantum algorithms. Traditional approaches to extending gate sets often require operating devices outside the ideal parameter regimes used to realize qubits, leading to increased control complexity while offering only a limited set of gates. Here we experimentally demonstrate a unified and versatile gate scheme capable of generating arbitrary two-qubit gates using only an exchange interaction and qubit driving on a superconducting quantum processor. We achieve high fidelities averaging 99.38% across a wide range of commonly used two-qubit unitaries, enabling precise multipartite entangled state preparation. Furthermore, we successfully produce a B gate, which efficiently synthesizes the entire family of two-qubit gates. Our results establish that fully exploiting the capabilities of the exchange interaction can yield a comprehensive and highly accurate gate set. With maximum expressivity, optimal gate time, demonstrated high fidelity and easy adaption to other quantum platforms, our unified control scheme offers the prospect of improved performance in quantum hardware and algorithm development. The efficiency of a quantum computer depends on which basic operations it can implement. Now a scheme that can implement any two-qubit logic gate has been demonstrated on a superconducting architecture.},

Microfabricated high-overtone bulk acoustic wave resonators (μHBARs) support high-frequency mechanical modes above 10 GHz with coherence times exceeding one millisecond. Here we demonstrate a μHBAR-based cavity optomechanical system that permits quantum optomechanical control of individual high-coherence phonon modes. We perform laser cooling of the phonon modes from an occupation of approximately 22 phonons to fewer than 0.4, corresponding to laser-based ground-state cooling of a mechanical object with a mass of 7.5 μg. During the cooling process we do not observe any absorption-induced heating, demonstrating the resilience of the HBAR optomechanical systems against parasitic heating. Our work demonstrates that μHBARs are promising as the basis for quantum optomechanical systems with robustness to decoherence that is necessary for efficient, low-noise photon–phonon conversion. A massive phonon mode in a high-overtone bulk acoustic wave resonator has been laser cooled close to its ground state. Its robustness to decoherence establishes the potential of these devices for quantum technologies.},

  abstract     = {Many of the most promising quantum information platforms store quantum information in electronic or atomic spins. To incorporate these devices into quantum networks, a spin–photon interface is required. Currently, the best on-demand single-photon sources use a semiconductor quantum dot in an engineered photonic environment. However, it is difficult to achieve coherent spin control in a high-performance single-photon source, and spin coherence is limited by magnetic noise from nuclear spins in the semiconductor host material. Here we combine all-optical spin control with a quantum dot in an open microcavity. We demonstrate fast coherent rotations of a hole spin around an arbitrary axis of the Bloch sphere with a maximum π-pulse fidelity of 98.6%. To suppress the slow magnetic noise, we laser cool the nuclear spins using the hole as a central spin. This extends the hole spin free-induction-decay time by more than an order of magnitude. It becomes much larger than both rotation time and radiative recombination time of the spin, enabling the creation of many spin–photon pairs before the loss of spin coherence. Spin–photon interfaces provide a connection between quantum information stored in atomic or electronic spins and optical communications networks. A quantum photon emitter with long-lived, controllable coherent spin has now been demonstrated.},

  abstract     = {Superconducting qubits possess outstanding capabilities for processing quantum information in the microwave domain; however they have limited coherence times. An interface between photons and phonons could allow quantum information to be stored in long-lived mechanical oscillators. Here, we introduce a platform that relies on electrostatic forces in nanoscale structures to achieve strong coupling between a superconducting qubit and a nanomechanical oscillator with an energy decay time (T1) of approximately 25 ms, well beyond those achieved in integrated superconducting circuits. We use quantum operations in this system to investigate the microscopic origins of mechanical decoherence and mitigate its impact. By using two-pulse dynamical decoupling sequences, we can extend the coherence time (T2) from 64 μs to 1 ms. These findings establish that mechanical oscillators can act as quantum memories for superconducting devices, with potential future applications in quantum computing, sensing and transduction. Superconducting qubits, a leading platform for quantum information processing, suffer from decoherence. Interfacing them with nanomechanical oscillators allows quantum information to be stored in motional states with longer lifetimes.},

Quantum optical skyrmions with local topological textures are expected to reshape the landscape of quantum photonic technology, although their experimental implementation has not yet been demonstrated. Here we present experimental realizations of nanophotonic quantum skyrmions using a semiconductor cavity quantum electrodynamics system. By manipulating the photonic spin–orbit coupling in a Gaussian microcavity, we obtained a confined optical mode whose polarizations feature skyrmionic topologies. With pronounced cavity quantum electrodynamics effects, we generated and detected single-photon skyrmions from a solid-state quantum emitter deterministically coupled to the Gaussian microcavity. The polarity associated with single-photon skyrmions can be swapped by flipping the polarization of the quantum emitter through the Zeeman effect. We also investigated the topological protection of quantum optical skyrmions under different perturbations. Our work opens an unexplored aspect of quantum light–matter interactions in the nanoscale and might advance resilient photonic quantum technology with high-dimensional qubits and high-capacity quantum memories. Quantum optical skyrmions are promising for quantum photonic applications but have not been experimentally realized.

It involves successive cycles of confinement and release that drive important morphological changes. However, it remains unclear whether migrating cells can retain a memory of their past morphological states that could potentially facilitate their navigation through confined spaces. We demonstrate that local geometry governs a switch between two cell morphologies, thereby facilitating cell passage through long and narrow gaps. We combined cell migration assays on standardized microsystems with biophysical modelling and biochemical perturbations to show that migrating cells have a long-term memory of past confinement events. The morphological cell states correlate across transitions through actin cortex remodelling. These findings indicate that mechanical memory in migrating cells plays an active role in their migratory potential in confined environments. Cells often navigate through confined spaces. Now it is shown that cells retain a mechanical memory of previous confinement events, which makes them more efficient at migrating through narrow microenvironments.},

In these environments, cells experience capillary forces, but it is unclear how these forces shape bacterial collective behaviour. Here we show that the water menisci formed around bacteria lead to capillary attraction between cells while still allowing them to slide past one another. We develop an experimental apparatus that allows us to control bacterial collective behaviour by varying the strength and range of capillary forces. Combining three-dimensional imaging and cell tracking with agent-based modelling, we demonstrate that capillary attraction organizes rod-shaped bacteria into densely packed nematic groups and influences their collective dynamics and morphologies. Our results suggest that capillary forces may be a ubiquitous physical ingredient in shaping microbial communities in partially hydrated environments. Bacteria tend to live in thin layers of water on surfaces. Now the capillary forces in these layers are shown to help organize the bacteria into dense packs.},

Central to this process is the formation of molecular clutches, which are dynamic linkages between the extracellular matrix and the actin cytoskeleton mediated by integrins and adaptor proteins. Although it is well known that force-dependent interactions between molecular-clutch components are essential for sensing substrate rigidity, the influence of nonlinear adaptor-protein elasticity is poorly understood. Here we show that adaptor-protein elasticity and local interactions between molecular clutches and the extracellular matrix are key to cellular perception of substrate stiffness. We present a semi-analytical theory that integrates experimentally measured force responses of adaptor proteins to describe cell-adhesion sensing. We propose that molecular clutches probe local mechanical substrate properties and collectively function as a differential that allows a retrograde actin flow and substrate movement to occur at different rates while maintaining a stable mechanical coupling between them. Our model reproduces experimentally measured force-loading rates of individual molecular clutches and correctly predicts cell-adhesion behaviour for a range of substrate stiffnesses. The framework presented can be extended to study complex phenomena such as focal-adhesion maturation and cell-type-specific mechanosensing. The cytoskeleton and extracellular matrix are linked by molecular clutches that enable cells to sense their environment. Now it is shown that the elastic properties of the clutches underpin stiffness sensing.},

Although the exposed microtubule exterior is readily accessible to proteins, the mechanism governing the accessibility of the confined microtubule lumen to luminal particles remains unknown. Here we show that certain tubulin family proteins (isotypes) facilitate luminal accessibility because of the mechanical properties and lateral interactions that they confer to the microtubules. We characterized the microtubules reconstituted from defined compositions of Caenorhabditis elegans tubulin isotypes. These tubulin isotypes form microtubules with comparable protofilament numbers but different luminal accessibility. We further revealed the role of tubulin isotypes in regulating the strength of inter-protofilament lateral interactions, which determines luminal accessibility through the mechanosensitivity of reversible protofilament separation. Deformation of the microtubule lattice, which generates stresses exceeding the strength of the lateral interactions, creates gaps between adjacent protofilaments, enhancing the accessibility of the lumen. Together, our findings uncovered the tubulin isotype-dependent mechanical plasticity that confers force sensitivity to the microtubule lattice and modulates the energy barrier for luminal proteins to access the lumen. Proteins interact with both the exterior and interior of microtubules. Here the relationship between microtubule building blocks and the accessibility of the microtubule interior to proteins is clarified.},

  abstract     = {Motility-induced phase separation occurs in assemblies of self-propelled units when activity is coupled negatively to density. By contrast, the consequences of a positive coupling between density and activity on the collective behaviour of active matter remain unexplored. Here we show that collective activity can emerge from such a positive coupling among non-motile building blocks. We perform experiments with self-sustained oscillators powered by contact-charge electrophoresis. Although the oscillators are non-motile by design, they spontaneously form an active gas when confined together. The super-elastic nature of collisions constitutes a positive density–activity coupling and underlies the active gas properties. Elucidating the origin of binary collisions allows us to precisely control the structure of the active gas and its eventual crystallization. Beyond considering the overlooked positive coupling between density and activity, our work suggests that rich collective properties can emerge not only from the symmetry of interactions between active building blocks but also from their adaptable and responsive behaviour. In active matter systems, increasing density usually reduces activity. Now, in a system where density enhances activity, collective motion is shown to arise from non-motile oscillators when they are confined.},

  abstract     = {The ability to manipulate polar entities with multiple external fields could enable functionalities and applications in spin systems, photonics, metamaterials and soft matter. Liquid crystals that exhibit both a crystalline structure and liquid fluidity represent a promising platform for manipulating phases with polar molecular order, notably ferroelectric ones. However, achieving a polar symmetry is challenging with rod-shaped liquid crystal molecules, which form predominantly apolar nematic phases. Here we report an approach in which a geometric lattice confinement of nematic liquid crystals is used to induce planar polar order on the scale of a mesoscopic metamaterial. We confine the nematic liquid crystal in a micropillar array, forming topological defect–pillar pairs of elastic dipoles with a free top interface in contact with an immiscible fluid. The resulting dipole lattice configurations can be programmed rheologically by flowing the top fluid and maintained even after flow cessation, a phenomenon attributed to orientational multistability of the dipoles. This multimemory effect enables the encoding and reconfiguration of directional information. Overall, these results advance our understanding of topological dipoles under confinement and shear flow, enabling the detection, tracking and recording of flow profiles and could facilitate the development of stimuli-responsive materials. Programmable topological dipoles could be used in stimuli-responsive materials. Now it is shown that confinement of an apolar liquid crystal results in controllable polar arrangements of elastic dipoles.},

  abstract     = {Topological defects give rise to non-trivial excitations—such as solitons, vortices and skyrmions—characterized by integer-valued topological charges. However, their classification becomes difficult when singularities are present in the order parameter field, complicating the computation of these charges. Although exotic nonlinear excitations have been theoretically proposed in the superfluid 3He-A phase and spinor Bose–Einstein condensates, they have not been experimentally observed and their stability has not been investigated. Here we demonstrate the presence of a singular skyrmion that goes beyond the framework of topology in a ferromagnetic superfluid. These skyrmions emerge from anomalous symmetry-breaking associated with an eccentric spin singularity and carry half the elementary charge—a feature that distinguishes them from conventional skyrmions and merons. We realize the universal regime of the quantum Kelvin–Helmholtz instability, and we identify the unconventional fractional skyrmions produced by emission from a magnetic domain wall and the spontaneous splitting of an integer skyrmion with spin singularities. The singular skyrmions are stable even after 2 s of hold time. Our results confirm the universality between classical and quantum Kelvin–Helmholtz instabilities and broaden our understanding of complex nonlinear dynamics for a non-trivial texture in topological quantum systems. The quantum Kelvin–Helmholtz instability can induce non-trivial topological excitations. Now a proof-of-principle experiment demonstrates the emergence of a stable singular fractional skyrmion spin texture originating from this quantum instability.},

  abstract     = {Fractional quantum statistics are the defining characteristic of anyons. Measuring the phase generated by an exchange of anyons is challenging, as standard interferometry set-ups—such as the Fabry–Pérot interferometer—suffer from charging effects that obscure the interference signal. Here we present the observation of anyonic interference and exchange phases in an optical-like Mach–Zehnder interferometer based on co-propagating interface modes. By avoiding backscattering and deleterious charging effects, this set-up enables pristine and robust Aharonov–Bohm interference without any phase slips. At various fractional filling factors, the observed flux periodicities agree with the fundamental fractionally charged excitations that correspond to Jain states and depend only on the bulk topological order. To probe the anyonic statistics, we used a small, charged top gate in the interferometer bulk to induce localized quasiparticles without modifying the Aharonov–Bohm phase. The added quasiparticles introduce periodic phase slips. The sign and magnitude of the observed phase slips align with the expected value at filling 1/3, but their direction shows systematic deviations at fillings 2/5 and 3/7. Control over added individual quasiparticles in this design is essential for measuring the coveted non-abelian statistics in the future. An interferometer design allows systematic investigation of the anyonic statistics of bulk fractional quantum Hall states.},

  abstract     = {In condensed matter, angular momentum is intimately related to the emergence of topological quantum states, including chiral superconductivity, quantum spin liquids and various chiral quasiparticles. Recently, it has been predicted that microscopic lattice excitations, known as phonons, can carry finite angular momentum, leading to specific physical properties of materials. However, phonon angular momentum has not yet been observed directly. Here we demonstrate that angular momentum conservation results in a macroscopic mechanical torque when applying a time-reversal symmetry-breaking thermal gradient along the chiral axis of single-crystal tellurium. We probe this torque using a cantilever-based device and establish that it changes sign by flipping the chirality or thermal gradient. This behavior disappears in polycrystalline samples that lack a preferred chirality. Our experimental results align well with theoretical calculations. We provide compelling evidence for phonon angular momentum, which might enable quantum states with potential applications in microelectronics. Theory predicts that phonons—quanta of lattice vibrations—can carry finite angular momentum and thus influence physical properties of materials. Now phonons with angular momentum have been seen in tellurium with a chiral crystal structure.},

  abstract     = {Magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene hosts a variety of strongly correlated states at partial fillings of its flat bands. In a magnetic field, these flat bands evolve into a Hofstadter spectrum renormalized by strong Coulomb interactions. Here we study the interacting Hofstadter states that spontaneously form within the topological magnetic sub-bands of an ultraclean magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene device, including symmetry-broken Chern insulator states and fractional quantum Hall states. The observed symmetry-broken Chern insulator states form a cascade, with their Chern numbers mimicking the main sequence of correlated Chern insulators. The fractional quantum Hall states form in a Jain sequence. However, they disappear at high magnetic field, in contrast to conventional fractional quantum Hall states that strengthen with increasing magnetic field. We reveal a magnetic-field-driven phase transition from composite fermion phases to a dissipative Fermi liquid. Our theoretical analysis of the magnetic sub-bands hosting the fractional quantum Hall states predicts non-uniform quantum geometric properties far from the lowest Landau level. This points towards a more natural interpretation of these states as in-field fractional Chern insulators of the magnetic sub-bands. Interacting electrons in Hofstadter bands can form symmetry-broken topological states. These are now revealed in magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene, and their properties are influenced by non-uniform quantum geometry.},

  abstract     = {Close to the Dirac point, graphene is expected to exist in a quantum critical Dirac fluid state, where the flow of both charge and heat can be described with a characteristic d.c. electrical conductivity and thermodynamic variables such as entropy and enthalpy densities. Although the fluid-like viscous flow of charge has been reported in state-of-the-art graphene devices, the value of conductivity, predicted to be quantized and determined only by the universality class of the critical point, has not been established experimentally so far. Here we have discerned the quantum critical universality in graphene transport by combining the electrical and thermal conductivities in very high-quality devices close to the Dirac point. We find that they are inversely related, as expected from relativistic hydrodynamics, and the characteristic conductivity converges to a quantized value. We also observe a giant violation of the Wiedemann–Franz law, where the Lorentz number exceeds the semiclassical value by more than 200 times close to the Dirac point at low temperatures. At high temperatures, the effective dynamic viscosity to entropy density ratio close to the Dirac point in the cleanest devices approaches that of a minimally viscous quantum fluid within a factor of four. Critical behaviour is expected in graphene when the carrier density is tuned to the Dirac point. Now, universality associated with the critical point is observed in electronic and thermal transport.},

Classical simulation methods can efficiently simulate many-body states with low entanglement, but struggle as the degree of entanglement grows. Here we investigate the relationship between quantum entanglement and quantum simulation, and show that product formula approximations for simulating many-body systems can perform better for entangled systems. We establish an upper bound for algorithmic error in terms of entanglement entropy that is tighter than previous results, and develop an adaptive simulation algorithm that incorporates measurement gadgets to estimate the algorithmic error. This shows that entanglement is not only an obstacle to classical simulation, but also a feature that can accelerate quantum algorithms. Large quantum systems with high entanglement are difficult to simulate with classical methods, but now it is shown that entanglement may be beneficial for quantum simulations.},

  abstract     = {Predicting the dynamical properties of topological matter is a challenging task, not only in theoretical and experimental settings, but also computationally. Numerical studies are often constrained to studying simplified models and lattices. Here we propose a time-dependent correlated ansatz for the dynamical preparation of a quantum-spin-liquid state on a Rydberg atom simulator. Together with a time-dependent variational Monte Carlo technique, we can faithfully represent the state of the system throughout the entire dynamical preparation protocol. We are able to match not only the physically correct form of the Rydberg atom Hamiltonian but also the relevant lattice topology at system sizes that exceed current experimental capabilities. This approach gives access to global quantities such as the topological entanglement entropy, providing insight into the topological properties of the system. Our results confirm the topological properties of the state during the dynamical preparation protocol, and deepen our understanding of topological entanglement dynamics. We show that, while the simulated state exhibits local properties resembling those of a resonating-valence-bond state, in agreement with experimental observations, it lacks the latter’s characteristic topological entanglement entropy signature irrespective of the degree of adiabaticity of the protocol. A numerical approach capable of simulating large-scale Rydberg atom quantum systems suggests that protocols for preparing topological states can produce experimental signatures of these states without reaching a topological phase.},

  abstract     = {Landauer’s principle bridges information theory and thermodynamics by linking the entropy change of a system during a process to the average energy dissipated to its environment. Although typically discussed in the context of erasing a single bit of information, Landauer’s principle can be generalized to characterize irreversibility in out-of-equilibrium processes, such as those involving complex quantum many-body systems. Specifically, the relation between the entropy change of a system and the energy dissipated to its environment can be decomposed into changes in quantum mutual information and a difference in the relative entropies of the environment. Here, we experimentally probe Landauer’s principle in the quantum many-body regime using a quantum field simulator of ultracold Bose gases. Employing a dynamical tomographic reconstruction scheme, we track the temporal evolution of the quantum field following a global mass quench from a massive to a massless Klein–Gordon model and analyse the thermodynamic and information-theoretic contributions to a generalized entropy production for various system–environment partitions of the composite system. Our results verify the quantum field theoretical calculations, interpreted using a semi-classical quasiparticle picture. Our work demonstrates the ability of ultracold atom-based quantum field simulators to experimentally investigate quantum thermodynamics. Landauer’s principle connects entropy and energy dissipation in non-equilibrium processes. An experiment now uses this principle to measure entropy production in a Bose gas to resolve contributions from correlations and dissipation.},

  abstract     = {Solving the Fermi–Hubbard model is a central task in the study of strongly correlated materials. Digital quantum computers can, in principle, be suitable for this purpose, but have so far been limited to quasi-one-dimensional models. This is because of exponential overheads caused by the interplay of noise and the non-locality of the mapping between fermions and qubits. Here we use a trapped-ion quantum computer to experimentally demonstrate that a recently developed local encoding can overcome this problem. In particular, we show that suitable reordering of terms and application of circuit identities—a scheme called corner hopping—substantially reduces the cost of simulating fermionic hopping. This enables the efficient preparation of the ground state of a 6 × 6 spinless Fermi–Hubbard model encoded in 48 physical qubits. We also develop two error mitigation schemes for systems with conserved quantities, based on local postselection and on extrapolation of local observables, respectively. Our results suggest that Fermi–Hubbard models beyond classical simulability can be addressed by digital quantum computers without large increases in gate fidelity. Digital quantum simulations of fermionic models have so far been based on the Jordan–Wigner encoding, which is computationally expensive. An alternative and more efficient encoding scheme is now demonstrated in a trapped-ion quantum computer.},

Multicellular tissues have traditionally been modelled as viscoelastic materials, which overlooked the abundance of intercellular space and intercellular flow within the structure. Although intercellular flow can substantially impact development and disease progression, its role in the mechanical behaviour of tissues remains unclear. Here we show that fluid transport via the intercellular space determines the immediate mechanical response of tissues upon deformation. We directly measure the mechanical response of multicellular tissues by applying parallel plate compression via a tailored micro-mechanics platform. We find that both cultured three-dimensional cell spheroids and native mouse pancreatic islets exhibit apparent poroelastic behaviour over a timescale of up to a minute. These findings highlight the fundamental role of interstitial fluid transport in the mechanics of multicellular systems and could help identify potential physical regulators of development and diseases, as well as strategies for engineering multicellular living systems. Tissues are usually modelled as viscoelastic materials. Now it is shown that intercellular fluid flow, rather than viscoelastic behaviour, dominates the immediate mechanical response of tissues.},

  abstract     = {In living cells, a complex mixture of biomolecules is assembled within and across membranes. This non-equilibrium state is maintained by sophisticated protein machinery, which imports food molecules, removes waste products and orchestrates cell division. However, it remains unclear how this complex cellular machinery emerged and evolved. Here we show how the molecular contents of a cell can be coupled in a coordinated way to non-equilibrium heat flow. A temperature difference across a water-filled pore assembled the core components of a modern cell, which could then activate the gene expression. The mechanism arose from the interplay of convection and thermophoresis, both driven by the same heat source. The cellular machinery of protein synthesis from DNA via RNA was triggered as a direct result of the concentration of cell components. The same non-equilibrium setting continued to attract food molecules from an adjacent fluid stream, keeping the cellular molecules in a confined pocket protected against diffusion. Our results show how a simple non-equilibrium physical process can assemble the many different molecules of a cell and trigger its basic functions. The framework provides a membrane-free environment to bridge the long evolutionary times from an RNA world to a protein-based cell-like proto-metabolism. It is unclear how cell compartmentalization emerged in prebiotic conditions. Now it is shown that a temperature gradient in a confined space can bring the core components of a cell together.},

  abstract     = {Self-organized criticality can occur in earthquakes, avalanches and biological processes, and is characterized by intermittent, scale-free energy dissipation. In living cells, the actin cytoskeleton undergoes dynamic structural reorganization, particularly during migration and division, where molecular motors generate mechanical stresses that drive large dissipative events. However, the mechanisms governing these critical transitions remain unclear. Here we show that cytoskeletal criticality emerges from the interplay between F-actin organization and active stress generation. Our study focuses on a minimal actomyosin system in vitro, which is composed of F-actin filaments, myosin II motors and nucleation-promoting factors. By systematically varying the actin connectivity and nematic order, we demonstrate that ordered and sparsely connected networks exhibit exponential stress dissipation, whereas disordered and highly connected networks show heavy-tailed distributions of energy release and the 1/f noise characteristic of self-organized criticality. Increased disorder leads to stress localization, shifting force propagation into stiffer mechanical modes, reminiscent of Anderson localization in condensed-matter systems. Furthermore, we show that network architecture directly regulates the myosin II filament size, establishing a chemical–mechanical feedback loop that modulates criticality. Our findings provide insights into the collective cytoskeletal dynamics, energy localization and cellular self-organization. Self-organized criticality can occur in cellular systems, but its origins remain unclear. Now it is shown that cytoskeletal criticality is influenced by the F-actin architecture and myosin active stress.},

This phenomenon, referred to as the transverse Thomson effect, has not been experimentally observed. Here we report the observation of this effect in a semimetallic Bi88Sb12 alloy with thermoelectric imaging. We can switch between heating or cooling by changing the direction of the magnetic field. Our experiments and analyses reveal the essential difference between the conventional and transverse Thomson effects. Whereas the former depends sorely on the temperature derivative of the Seebeck coefficient, the latter depends on the temperature derivative and the magnitude of the Nernst coefficient. The observation of the transverse Thomson effect provides a new concept for active thermal management technologies.

In the intermediate- and strong-coupling regimes common to many conventional and quantum materials, a many-body treatment of polarons requires adding up a large number of electron–phonon Feynman diagrams. In this regard, diagrammatic Monte Carlo is an efficient method for diagram summation and has been used to study polarons within simplified electron–phonon models. Here we develop diagrammatic Monte Carlo calculations based on accurate first-principles electron–phonon interactions, enabling numerically exact results for the ground-state and dynamical properties of polarons in real materials. We implement these calculations in LiF, SrTiO3, and rutile and anatase TiO2, and describe both localized and delocalized polarons. Our work enables the precise modeling of electron–phonon interactions and polarons in coupling regimes ranging from weak to strong. The results will provide deeper insights into transport phenomena, linear response and superconductivity within the strong electron–phonon coupling regime. Diagrammatic Monte Carlo calculations accurately describe polarons in different theoretical models. Now, integrating this with accurate first-principles calculations can describe the ground-state and dynamic properties of polarons in real materials.},

  abstract     = {Ultrafast light–matter interaction has emerged as a mechanism to control the macroscopic properties of quantum materials. However, technological applications of photoinduced phases are limited by their ultrashort lifetimes and the low temperatures required for their stabilization. One such phase is the hidden metallic charge density wave state in 1T-TaS2, whose origin and stability above cryogenic temperatures remain the subject of debate. Here, we demonstrate that this phase can be stabilized at thermal equilibrium by accessing a mixed charge density wave order regime through thermal quenching. Using X-ray high-dynamic-range reciprocal space mapping and scanning tunnelling spectroscopy, we reveal the coexistence of commensurate charge density wave and hidden metallic charge density wave domains up to 210 K. Our findings show that each order parameter breaks basal plane mirror symmetry with different chiral orientations and induces out-of-plane unit cell tripling in the hidden phase. Despite metallic domain walls and a finite density of states, the bulk resistance remains insulating due to charge density wave stacking disorder. Our results establish the hidden state as a thermally stable phase and introduce an alternative mechanism for switchable metallic behaviour in thin flakes of 1T-TaS2 and similar materials with competing phases. The photoinduced hidden metallic state in 1T-TaS2 has so far been stabilized only at cryogenic temperatures. Now it is shown that accessing an additional mixed-phase long-lived metastable state can stabilize the hidden phase at higher temperatures.},

This strategy promises to expand the list of candidate materials with frustrated electron hopping, but is yet to be shown in experiments. Here we demonstrate frustrated hopping in the van der Waals intermetallic Pd5AlI2, emerging from the arrangement of atomic orbitals in a primitive square lattice. Using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and quantum oscillation measurements, we reveal that the band structure of Pd5AlI2 includes linear Dirac-like bands intersected at their crossing point by a locally flat band—an essential characteristic of frustrated hopping in Lieb and dice lattices. Moreover, this compound shows exceptional chemical stability, with its unusual bulk band structure and metallicity persisting in ambient conditions down to the monolayer limit. Hence, our results showcase a way to realize electronic structures characteristic of geometrically frustrated lattices in non-frustrated systems. Electron hopping in geometrically frustrated lattices can result in a rich variety of unusual behaviours. Now, the orbital arrangement in a van der Waals metal with a non-frustrated, primitive lattice is found to show similar effects.},

  abstract     = {Correlated topological materials often maintain a delicate balance among physical symmetries. Many topological orders are symmetry protected, whereas most correlated phenomena arise from spontaneous symmetry breaking. Cases where symmetry breaking induces a non-trivial topological phase are rare. Here we demonstrate the presence of two such phases in Ta2Pd3Te5, where Coulomb interactions form excitons that condense below 100 K, one with zero and the other with finite momentum. We observed a full spectral bulk gap, which stems from exciton condensation. This topological excitonic insulator state spontaneously breaks mirror symmetries but involves a weak structural coupling. Scanning tunnelling microscopy shows gapless boundary modes in the bulk insulating phase. Their magnetic field response, together with theoretical modelling, indicates a topological origin. These observations establish Ta2Pd3Te5 as a topological excitonic insulator in a three-dimensional crystal. Thus, our results manifest a unique sequence of topological exciton condensations in a bulk crystal, offering exciting opportunities to study critical behaviour and excitations. Experimental systems in which non-trivial topology is driven by spontaneous symmetry breaking are rare. Now, topological gaps resulting from two excitonic condensates have been demonstrated in a three-dimensional material.},

In magnetic materials, magnetic interactions couple to lattice degrees of freedom, resulting in magnetoelastic coupling, which is typically small and only detectable in macroscopic samples. Here we demonstrate a giant magnetoelastic coupling in the correlated itinerant ferromagnet Sr4Ru3O10. We establish an effective control of magnetism in the surface layer and utilize it to probe the impact of magnetism on its electronic and structural properties. By using scanning tunnelling microscopy, we reveal subtle changes in the electronic structure dependent on ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic alignment between the surface and subsurface layers. We further determine the consequences of the exchange force on the relaxation of the surface layer, which exhibits giant magnetostriction. Our results provide a direct measurement of the impact of exchange interactions and correlations on structural details in a quantum material, revealing how electronic correlations result in a strong electron–lattice coupling. Magnetostructural changes are usually small and driven by spin–orbit coupling. Now, electron–lattice coupling enhanced by exchange interactions is shown to produce giant magnetostriction in a correlated ferromagnet.},

  abstract     = {In systems with multiple energy bands, the interplay between electrons with different effective masses drives correlated phenomena that do not occur in single-band systems. Magic-angle twisted trilayer graphene is a tunable platform for exploring such effects, hosting both heavy electrons in its flat bands and delocalized light Dirac electrons in dispersive bands. Superconductivity in this system spans a wider range of phase space than moiré materials without dispersive bands, suggesting that interband interactions influence the stabilization of correlated phases. Here we investigate the interplay between the light and heavy electrons in magic-angle twisted trilayer graphene by performing local compressibility measurements with a scanning single-electron-transistor microscope. We establish that weak incompressibility features near several integer moiré band fillings host a finite population of light Dirac electrons at the Fermi level, despite a gap opening in the flat band sector. At higher magnetic field near charge neutrality, we find a phase transition sequence that is robust over nearly 10 μm but exhibits complex spatial dependence. Calculations establish that the Dirac sector can be viewed as flavour analogous to the spin and valley degrees of freedom. Graphene multilayers can host heavy electrons in flat bands alongside light electrons in Dirac cones. Local probes now reveal that a finite Dirac electron population persists at the Fermi level while correlated states form in the flat bands.},

  abstract     = {Material systems that exhibit tunable spin-selective conductivity are key components of spintronic technologies. Here, we demonstrate a mechanism for spin-selective transport that is based on the unusual Landau-level sequence observed in bilayer WSe2 under large applied magnetic fields. We find that the conductivity depends strongly on the relative ordering between conducting electrons with different spins and valleys in a partially filled Landau level and the localized electrons of lower-energy filled Landau levels. We observe that the conductivity is almost completely suppressed when the spin ratio and field-tuned Coulomb energy exceed a critical threshold. We achieve switching between on and off states through either modulation of the external magnetic or electric fields, with many-body interactions driving a collective switching mechanism. In contrast to magnetoresistive heterostructures, this mechanism achieves electrically tunable spin filtering within a single material, driven by the interaction between free and localized spins residing in energy-separated spin-and-valley-polarized bands. Similar spin-selective conductivity may be realizable in flat-band systems at zero magnetic field. Mechanisms for generating spin-polarized currents may be helpful for applications. Now one such mechanism that uses the unusual Landau-level spectrum of WSe2 under a strong magnetic field is demonstrated.},

The non-trivial band topology of twisted MoTe2, which is responsible for its fractional quantum anomalous Hall states, is predicted to arise from a skyrmion lattice texture in the layer pseudospin of the electronic wavefunctions. Tracing the layer polarization of wavefunctions within the moiré unit cell can, thus, offer insights into the band topology. Here we measure the out-of-plane component of the layer-pseudospin skyrmion textures of twisted MoTe2 using scanning tunnelling microscopy and spectroscopy. We do this by simultaneously visualizing the moiré lattice structure and the spatial localization of its electronic states. We find that the wavefunctions associated with the topological flat bands exhibit a spatially dependent layer polarization within the moiré unit cell, in agreement with our theoretical modelling. Our work enables future local probe studies of the intertwined correlated and topological states arising in gate-tunable devices. The topological properties of twisted bilayer MoTe2 are thought to stem from a spatial texture in the layer polarization of the electronic wavefunctions. This polarization is now measured using scanning tunnelling microscopy.},

In these systems, a non-trivial topology in the strongly layer-hybridized regime can arise from a spatial patterning of interlayer tunnelling amplitudes and layer-dependent potentials that yields a lattice of layer skyrmions. Here we report experimental signatures of skyrmion textures in the layer degree of freedom of rhombohedral-stacked twisted WSe2 homobilayers. Using scanning tunnelling spectroscopy that separately resolves the Γ-valley and K-valley moiré electronic states, we reveal opposite layer polarizations of the K valley at two different lattice sites with opposite stacking order within the moiré unit cell. These findings are consistent with the theoretically predicted layer-skyrmion texture. We also use our experimental results to parameterize a common continuum model of moiré bands in twisted bilayers, further establishing a direct correlation between the shape of the local density of states in real space and the topology of the topmost moiré band. Evidence is shown for a skyrmion-like texture in the layer polarization of the electronic wavefunctions of a twisted two-dimensional material. This provides support for theories that link this spatial texture to the topological properties.},

Despite extensive efforts to demonstrate the existence of a resonant valence bond phase in the Hubbard model that originally motivated the concept, a definitive realization has yet to be achieved. Here we present a solution to this long-standing problem by uncovering a resonant valence bond phase exhibiting spin–charge separation in realistic Hamiltonians. We show analytically that this ground state emerges in the dilute-doping limit of a half-filled Mott insulator on corner-sharing tetrahedral lattices with frustrated hopping, in the absence of exchange interactions. We confirm numerically that the results extend to finite exchange interactions, finite-sized systems and finite dopant density. Although much attention has been devoted to the emergence of unconventional states from geometrically frustrated interactions, our work demonstrates that kinetic energy frustration in doped Mott insulators may be essential for stabilizing robust, topologically ordered states in real materials. The concept of resonant valence bond phases has inspired many areas of condensed matter physics, but few realistic models have been identified. Now an analytical solution of such a phase has been found for pyrochlore and related lattices.},

Here we use polarized neutron scattering experiments on single crystals of the Ce2Zr2O7 pyrochlore. We find evidence for magnetic excitations near zero energy, in addition to signatures of spinons at higher energies. Furthermore, we perform heat capacity measurements and find behaviour consistent with the cubic-in-temperature dependence expected for linearly dispersing gapless bosonic modes. Comparing the observed magnetic excitations with theoretical calculations, we argue that Ce2Zr2O7 is a strong candidate for a dipolar–octupolar quantum spin ice with dominant dipolar Ising interactions. Quantum spin-ice phases are predicted to have emergent gauge fields and fractionalization. Neutron scattering and thermodynamic measurements of the quantum spin-ice candidate Ce2Zr2O7 show features consistent with these predictions.},

Notably, the clock transition also gives rise to pure spin-exchange interactions, realizing the dipolar XY model, which is difficult to access in other solid-state spin systems. We exploited this feature to investigate quantum thermalization by varying the relative ratio of interaction strength to disorder, dynamically engineering the XY model into other many-body Hamiltonian models and realizing a time-crystalline phase of matter through periodic driving. Our results demonstrated that an ensemble of rare earth ions serves as a versatile test bed for many-body physics and developing quantum technologies.

These characteristics make trapped ions attractive platforms for the quantum sensing of electric fields. However, the spin states do not exhibit a strong intrinsic coupling to electric fields, lim iting the achievable sensitivity. Here, we amplify the coupling between electric field perturbations and the spin states by using a static magnetic field gradient. Displacements of the trapped ion resulting from the applied electric field perturbations are thereby mapped to an instantaneous change in the energy-level splitting of the internal spin states. This gradient-mediated coupling of the electric field to the spin enables the use of well-established magnetometry protocols for electrometry, making it possible to achieve extremely sensitive measurements of d.c. and a.c. electric fields. We also employ a rotating-frame relaxometry technique and demonstrate the use of our quantum sensor as an electric field noise spectrum analyser. Finally, we describe a set of hardware modifications that are capable of achieving a further improvement in sensitivity by up to six orders of magnitude. Trapped ions are promising for electrometry but limited by their weak intrinsic spin coupling to electric fields. Now it is shown that using a magnetic field gradient enhances sensitivity and enables precise measurements across subhertz to kilohertz frequencies.},

However, predicting the protein concentrations at which oscillations start and whether cells can maintain them under physiological perturbations remains challenging. Here we show that dynamic pattern formation is robust across a wide range of Min protein levels and variations in the growth physiology using genetically engineered Escherichia coli strains. We modulate the expression of minCD and minE under fast- and slow-growth conditions and build a MinD versus MinE phase diagram that reveals dynamic patterns, including travelling and standing waves. We found that the natural expression level of Min proteins is resource-optimal and robust to changes in protein concentration. In addition, we observed an invariant wavelength of dynamic Min patterns across the phase diagram. We explain the experimental findings quantitatively with biophysical theory based on reaction–diffusion models that consider the switching of MinE between its latent and active states, indicating its essential role as a robustness module for Min oscillation in vivo. Our results underline the potential of integrating quantitative cell physiology and biophysical modelling to understand the fundamental mechanisms controlling cell division machinery, and they offer insights applicable to other biological processes. Oscillatory Min protein patterns prevent abnormal bacterial cell division. Now it is shown that Min pattern formation is resource efficient and involves wavelength-invariant oscillations that are robust to physiological changes.},

This correspondence plays an important role in the current understanding of the capabilities of neural networks. Here we prove an analogous result for quantum neural networks. We show that the outputs of certain models based on Haar-random unitary or orthogonal quantum neural networks converge to Gaussian processes in the limit of large Hilbert space dimension d. The derivation of this result is more nuanced than in the classical case due to the role played by the input states, the measurement observable and because the entries of unitary matrices are not independent. We show that the efficiency of predicting measurements at the output of a quantum neural network using Gaussian process regression depends on the number of measured qubits. Furthermore, our theorems imply that the concentration of measure phenomenon in Haar-random quantum neural networks is worse than previously thought, because expectation values and gradients concentrate as $${\mathcal{O}}\left({1}/{\operatorname{e}^{d}\sqrt{d}}\right)$$ . The connection between classical neural networks and Gaussian processes is a fundamental result in machine learning. It has now been shown that many quantum neural networks converge to Gaussian processes, enabling their use for regression tasks.},

  abstract     = {Physical devices operating out of equilibrium are affected by thermal fluctuations, limiting their operational precision. This issue is particularly pronounced at microscopic and quantum scales, where its mitigation requires additional entropy dissipation. Understanding this constraint is important for both fundamental physics and technological design. Clocks, for example, need a thermodynamic flux towards equilibrium to measure time, resulting in a minimum entropy dissipation per clock tick. Although classical and quantum models often show a linear relationship between precision and dissipation, the ultimate bounds on this relationship remain unclear. Here we present an autonomous quantum many-body clock model that achieves clock precision that scales exponentially with entropy dissipation. This is enabled by coherent transport in a spin chain with tailored couplings, where dissipation is confined to a single link. The result demonstrates that coherent quantum dynamics can surpass the traditional thermodynamic precision limits, potentially guiding the development of future high-precision, low-dissipation quantum devices. Clock precision is thought to be fundamentally limited by entropy production in out-of-equilibrium systems. A theoretical work now introduces a quantum clock design where precision grows exponentially with dissipation.},

Here we show that a universal embezzler can be created by bipartitioning any local, translation-invariant, critical free-fermionic many-body system on a one-dimensional lattice. The same property holds for locally interacting spin chains that are dual to the critical fermionic models by the Jordan–Wigner transformation. Furthermore, for any finite error and any targeted entangled state, a finite length of the chain is sufficient to embezzle said state within the given error. Hence, universal embezzlement is not restricted to the thermodynamic limit. As well as establishing the ubiquity of universal embezzlers in many-body physics, on a technical level, our main result establishes that the half-chain observable algebras associated with ground-state sectors of the given models are type III1 factors. One-dimensional critical fermionic models play an important role in many-body physics. Now it has been shown that any entangled state can be extracted from a bipartitioned critical fermion chain with an arbitrarily small change to the initial state.},

  abstract     = {Photonic emulators have enabled the study of many solid-state and quantum optics phenomena, such as Anderson localization, topological insulators and non-Hermitian dynamics. Current photonic emulators are generally limited to bosonic behaviour with local interactions, but the use of synthetic dimensions offers a pathway to overcome this constraint. Here we investigate the flow of liquid light in modulated fast-gain ring lasers, and we establish a platform for emulating quench dynamics within a synthetic photonic lattice with equal densities across the reciprocal space. We apply an artificial electric field to the lattice and introduce a slow timescale to the flow, given by Bloch oscillations. Despite the dispersion and dissipation in our system, which desynchronize the Wannier–Stark ladder states, we were able to directly observe coherent oscillations facilitated by the fast gain. Additionally, we quenched a steady state of a coupled system onto an uncoupled one, which revealed coherent interactions between the decaying modes. These coherent dynamics resulted from the liquid state of light, which rapidly suppressed fluctuations at the shortest timescale of the system. This platform enriches our understanding of collective dynamics in the non-perturbative regime and improves our ability to control and generate coherent, multi-frequency sources. Synthetic dimensions allow photons and gauge fields to interact in photonic emulators. Now a study with fast-gain lasers shows that gain-driven coherence enables robust light flow in frequency space, establishing it as a viable platform for lattice emulation.},

  abstract     = {Soft biological tissues exhibit mechanical properties that reflect their composite structure of cells embedded within a biopolymer matrix. However, the microscopic mechanisms underlying their unique nonlinear mechanical response—characterized by strain stiffening in compression, but strain softening in shear or tension—remain poorly understood. Here we show that strain softening in composite systems can arise due to plastic dissipation, which is mediated by filler–polymer interactions. We characterize the nonlinear elasticity of composite hydrogels and soft tissues in isolation from these plastic effects, and show that their nonlinear elastic strain stiffening is driven by the stretching of the underlying biopolymer matrix. We thus show that strain stiffening in composite hydrogels and tissues is mediated by strain amplification factors that are universal in compression and shear. In doing so, we demonstrate the importance of fundamental composite properties such as filler concentration and filler–polymer interaction strength in mediating strain stiffening in composite systems. These findings highlight key structure–property relationships that underlie the nonlinear mechanics of biologically relevant soft solids such as composite gels and tissues. The nonlinear mechanical properties of soft biological tissues and composites are poorly understood. Their strain stiffening under compression and shear is now found to be universal, and follows from the physics of the underlying biopolymer matrix.},

  abstract     = {Cooling a material into a ferromagnetic phase can produce arbitrary metastable patterns of magnetic domains rather than a spatially uniform magnetic state. Control over the formation of these patterns could provide non-chemical methods of creating spintronic devices. Here we demonstrate high-efficiency optical training of magnetic domain formation in the two-dimensional van der Waals magnet Fe3GeTe2 during zero-field cooling. At ultralow power densities of around 20 µW µm−2, electrons excited by linearly polarized photons catalyse the formation of larger domains for both spin orientations. Furthermore, circularly polarized photons of the same low power density produce a single domain with its magnetization orientation determined by the optical helicity. We propose that the emergence of this single domain is caused by the optically injected spin-polarized electrons acting as initial magnetic seeds that guide different regions of the sample into the same spin orientation. Our work presents an unconventional route to tailoring spin textures in two-dimensional materials. Light at low power densities can be used to manipulate ferromagnetic domains in the two-dimensional van der Waals ferromagnet Fe3GeTe2. This capability could be used to engineer the behaviour of Fe3GeTe2-based devices.},

  abstract     = {The absorption spectra of rare-earth ions have very narrow linewidths. Even in solid-state crystals, exceedingly long coherence times have been observed for the spin and optical transitions of rare-earth-ion dopants. The influence of electronic and nuclear spins in the host crystal is a key factor limiting these coherence times. Here we suppress the effects of electron spins by using erbium dopants in a gadolinium vanadate host that is fully concentrated in electron spins but operated at sufficiently low temperatures that the spins form an antiferromagnetically ordered state. We achieve long optical coherence times and, furthermore, observe avoided crossings in the optical spectra, which are caused by strong coupling between the erbium ions and gadolinium magnons in the host crystal. This indicates the possibility of magnon-mediated microwave-to-optical quantum transduction using rare-earth ions, which would provide a connection between telecommunications technology and solid-state quantum devices operating in the microwave regime. Solid-state quantum devices can suffer from decoherence caused by fluctuating electron spins in the surrounding material. Operating in a regime where the electron spins become magnetically ordered produces substantially longer coherence times.},

Active control over phase textures further promises tunable functionality at the nanoscale. Although light-induced switching of a correlated insulator to a metallic state is well established, optical excitation generally lacks the specificity to select subwavelength domains and determine final textures. Here we drive the domain-specific quench of a textured Peierls insulator using valley-selective photodoping. Polarized excitation exploits the anisotropy of quasi-one-dimensional states at the charge-density-wave gap to initiate an insulator–metal transition with minimal electronic heating. We find that averting dissipation facilitates domain-specific carrier confinement, control over nanotextured phases and reduction in thermal relaxation from the metastable metallic state. This valley-selective photoexcitation approach will enable the activation of electronic phase separation beyond thermodynamic limitations, facilitating optically controlled hidden states, engineered heterostructures and polarization-sensitive percolation networks. Optical excitation is a way to control phase transitions in materials, but it lacks spatial specificity. Now, valley-selective photodoping in a Peierls insulator is demonstrated as a method to optically engineer phase textures with minimal heating.},

  abstract     = {Floquet engineering enables the manipulation of quantum phases of matter through periodic driving. It has been implemented across different platforms, ranging from photonic systems to optical lattices of ultracold atoms. In solids, coherent light–matter interaction induced by periodic driving leads to hybridization of Bloch electrons with photons, resulting in the formation of replica bands known as Floquet–Bloch states. These states have been observed in several materials, and their properties have been linked to a range of predicted phase transitions. However, direct energy and momentum-resolved observation of these states remains limited to a few. Here we report the direct observation of Floquet–Bloch states in monolayer epitaxial graphene. By using time-resolved and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy with mid-infrared pump excitation, we detected replicas of the Dirac cone. The dependence of these replica bands on pump polarization shows that they originate from the scattering between Floquet–Bloch states and photon-dressed free-electron-like photoemission final states, known as Volkov states. Our method can potentially be used to directly observe Floquet–Bloch states at large momenta in other quantum materials. Monolayer graphene has been long proposed as a candidate system for Floquet engineering. Time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy measurements now show the formation of Floquet–Bloch states in this material.},

  abstract     = {Floquet engineering—the coherent dressing of matter via time-periodic perturbations—is a mechanism to realize and control emergent phases in materials out of equilibrium. However, its applicability to metallic quantum materials and semimetals such as graphene is an open question. The report of light-induced anomalous Hall effect in graphene remains debated, and a time-resolved photoemission experiment has suggested that Floquet effects might not be realizable in graphene and other semimetals with relatively short decoherence times. Here we provide direct spectroscopic evidence of Floquet effects in graphene through electronic structure measurements. We observe light–matter-dressed Dirac bands by measuring the contribution of Floquet sidebands, Volkov sidebands and their quantum path interference to graphene’s photoemission spectrum. Our results demonstrate that Floquet engineering in graphene is possible, even though ultrafast decoherence processes occur on the timescale of a few tens of femtoseconds. Our approach offers a way to experimentally realize Floquet engineering strategies in metallic and semimetallic systems and for the coherent stabilization of light-induced states with potentially non-trivial topological properties. The feasibility of Floquet engineering in graphene has been called into question due to its fast decoherence processes. Measurements of graphene’s photoemission spectrum now support the generation of Floquet states in this material.},

  abstract     = {Forming long-wavelength moiré superlattices in van der Waals bilayers that have a small-angle twist between the two layers has been a key approach for creating moiré flat bands. However, for small twist angles, strong lattice reconstruction creates domain walls and other forms of disorder in the moiré pattern, posing considerable challenges for engineering such platforms. At large twist angles, the lattices are more rigid, but it is difficult to produce flat bands in shorter-wavelength moiré superlattices. Here we introduce an approach for tailoring robust supermoiré structures in bilayers of transition-metal dichalcogenides using only a single twist near a commensurate angle. Structurally, we show the spontaneous formation of a periodic arrangement of three inequivalent commensurate moiré stackings, where the angle deviation from the commensurate angle determines the periodicity. Electronically, we reveal a large set of van Hove singularities that indicate strong band hybridization, leading to flat bands near the valence band maximum. Our study extends the study of the interplay among band topology, quantum geometry and moiré superconductivity to the large twist angle regime. Moiré patterns and flat bands usually occur in multilayer materials with a small interlayer twist angle, but this can cause detrimental lattice reconstruction. Now, flat bands are shown in a bilayer with large twist angle and structural rigidity.},

  abstract     = {Recent studies have suggested that the strongly correlated flat bands of magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene may host coexisting light and heavy carriers. Although transport and spectroscopic measurements have hinted at this behaviour, distinct signatures of incoherent heavy carriers have not been reported. Here we provide evidence of this by performing thermoelectric transport measurements of magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene using the photo-thermoelectric effect in gate-defined p–n junctions. At low temperatures, we observe sign-preserving, filling-dependent oscillations of the Seebeck coefficient at non-zero integer fillings of the moiré superlattice. This suggests the preponderance of one carrier type even when the Fermi level is tuned through the charge neutrality point of the correlated states. At higher temperatures, the thermoelectric response provides evidence of strong electron correlations in the unordered, normal state. Our observations are explained by the interplay between light, long-lived electron states and heavy, short-lived hole excitations near the Fermi level of the symmetry-broken ground states. These findings are in qualitative agreement with the topological heavy fermion model. Recent theoretical work suggested that magic-angle graphene can simultaneously host localized and itinerant electrons. Now thermoelectric measurements provide evidence of this.},

  abstract     = {Increasing the number of particles in a system often leads to qualitative changes in its properties, such as breaking of symmetries and the appearance of phase transitions. This renders a macroscopic system fundamentally different from its individual microscopic constituents. Lying between these extremes, mesoscopic systems exhibit microscopic fluctuations that influence behaviour on longer length scales, leading to critical phenomena and dynamics. Therefore, tracing the properties of well-controlled mesoscopic systems can help bridge the gap between an exact description of few-body microscopic systems and the emergent description of many-body systems. Here we explore the mesoscopic signatures of an optomechanical self-organization phase transition using arrays of cold atoms inside an optical cavity. By precisely engineering atom–cavity interactions, we reveal how critical behaviour depends on the atom number, identify characteristic dynamical behaviours in the self-organized regime and observe a finite optomechanical susceptibility at the critical point. These findings advance our understanding of particle-number- and time-resolved properties of phase transitions in mesoscopic systems. Investigating mesoscopic systems can offer insights into the crossover between few-body and many-body regimes. Atomic arrays inside an optical cavity are now shown to enable the controlled study of critical properties on mesoscopic scales.},

By preparing wave packets as well as specific collective modes and probing their dynamics, we identify two distinct sound modes associated with spontaneously broken U(1) and translational symmetries. Consistent with the hydrodynamic description of superfluid smectics, longitudinal excitations propagate with finite velocities, whereas transverse perturbations exhibit diffusive behaviour. These results demonstrate how the conceptual framework of supersolidity can be used to characterize dynamic and far-from-equilibrium states. Driven quantum systems can form long-lived states with emergent order, but their excitation properties remain largely unexplored.

With the advent of ultrashort high-intensity lasers capable of accelerating electrons to gigaelectronvolt energies, muons can also be produced in laser laboratories. Here we report a proof-of-principle experiment of muon production. We accelerated an electron beam to gigaelectronvolt energies with an ultrashort, high-intensity laser pulse and passed the beam through a lead converter target in which muons were generated. We confirmed the muon signal by measuring its lifetime. We investigated the photo-production, electro-production and Bethe–Heitler processes underlying muon generation and their subsequent detection with Geant4 simulations. The results show that the dominant contribution stems from photo-production and electro-production. We estimate that a muon yield of up to 0.01 muon per incoming electron could be achieved in the converter target. This laser-driven muon source features compact, ultrashort pulses and high flux. Moreover, its implementation in a small laser laboratory is relatively straightforward, which dramatically reduces barriers for research in areas such as muonic X-ray elemental analysis or muon spin spectroscopy. Muons are conventionally produced from cosmic rays or with a proton accelerator.

  abstract     = {Frictional motion is initiated by interface failure that is mediated by ruptures—akin to earthquakes—that typically accelerate to near-sonic velocities. However, slow ruptures may occur in both laboratory and natural fault settings, but the mechanisms that drive them are not fully understood. Although fracture mechanics describes fast frictional ruptures well, its relevance to slow ruptures is uncertain. Here we experimentally show that both extremely slow and fast ruptures—on scales of cm s–1 and km s–1, respectively—can repeatably propagate within the same frictional interface. We demonstrate that a dynamic equilibrium between the loading rates and velocity dependencies of both interface resistance and fracture energy enables slow ruptures to nucleate and propagate at very low applied shear stresses. In the same interfaces, fast ruptures also occur, but only when their nucleation becomes possible under higher stress conditions. We find that the dynamics and structure of both rupture classes are well described by fracture mechanics. Their existence results from a close interplay between the interface properties and rupture velocity. These results provide key insights into fault dynamics and related frictional motion. Frictional motion of bodies in contact is facilitated by ruptures at their interface. Experiments with laboratory earthquakes now reveal that frictional ruptures at an interface can happen at both slow and fast timescales.},

  abstract     = {Bacterial second messengers are crucial for transmitting environmental information to cells. However, quantifying their information transmission capacity remains challenging. Here we develop a framework for quantifying information processing in cellular signalling systems. We engineer an isolated cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) signalling channel in Pseudomonas aeruginosa using targeted gene knockouts, optogenetics and a fluorescent cAMP probe. This design enables precise optical control and real-time monitoring of cAMP dynamics. By integrating experimental data with information theory, we reveal the optimal frequency for light-mediated cAMP signalling that maximizes information transmission, reaching about 40 bits per hour. This rate correlates strongly with cAMP degradation kinetics and uses a two-state encoding scheme. Our findings suggest a mechanism for fine-tuned regulation of multiple genes through temporal encoding of second-messenger signals, providing insights into bacterial adaptation strategies. Bacterial second messengers carry signals from the environment to target proteins in the cell. Now the associated information transmission capacity is quantified and the optimal frequency to maximize it is determined.},

  abstract     = {Blood vessels expand and contract actively as they continuously experience dynamic external stresses from blood flow. The mechanical response of the vessel wall is that of a composite material: its mechanical properties depend on its cellular components, which change dynamically as the cells respond to external stress. Mapping the relationship between these underlying cellular processes and emergent tissue mechanics is an ongoing challenge, particularly in endothelial cells. Here we assess the mechanics and cellular dynamics of an endothelial tube using a microstretcher that mimics the native environment of blood vessels. The characterization of the instantaneous monolayer elasticity reveals a strain-stiffening, actin-dependent and substrate-responsive behaviour. After a physiological pressure increase, the tissue displays a fluid-like expansion, with the reorientation of cell shape and actin fibres. We introduce a mechanical model that considers the actin fibres as a network in the nematic phase and couples their dynamics with active and elastic fibre tension. The model accurately describes the response to the pressure of endothelial tubes. Blood flow through a vessel deforms vessel walls. Cells lining these walls sense the changes in pressure as blood flows and reorient their actin fibres in the direction of largest tension.},

  abstract     = {Binding particles to an interface between immiscible liquids to reduce interfacial tension underpins the emulsification and phase behaviour of composite liquid systems. Nevertheless, we found that the strong binding and two-dimensional assembly of ferromagnetic particles at a liquid–liquid interface not only suppresses emulsification but also increases interfacial tension. Consequently, the particle-stabilized interface in a cylindrical vessel rapidly and reproducibly adopts the shape of a Grecian urn after vigorous agitation. The suppression of emulsification, the rapid formation of a stable, non-planar equilibrium interface shape and the increase in interfacial tension all originate from attractive in-plane dipolar magnetic interactions between the particles. Placing particles at the interface between immiscible fluids usually enhances emulsification. However, now it is shown that if the particles are ferromagnetic, emulsification is suppressed and a non-planar recoverable interfacial shape develops.},

  abstract     = {The study of van der Waals heterostructures with an interlayer twist, known as twistronics, has been instrumental in advancing the understanding of many strongly correlated phases, many of which derive from the topology of the physical system. Here we explore the application of the twistronics paradigm in plasmonic systems with a non-trivial topology by creating a moiré skyrmion superlattice using two superimposed plasmonic skyrmion lattices with a relative twist. We measure the complex electric field distribution of the moiré skyrmion superlattice using time-resolved polarimetric photoemission electron microscopy. Our results show that each supercell has very large topological invariants and harbours a skyrmion bag, the size of which is controllable by the twist angle and centre of rotation. Our work indicates how twistronics can enable the creation of various topological features in optical fields and provides a route for locally manipulating electromagnetic field distributions. Skyrmion bags—textures comprising multiple skyrmions contained within a larger skyrmion—have been reported in several condensed matter systems. Now an optical analogue of these structures has been observed in plasmonic moiré superlattices.},

  abstract     = {The aperiodic order of quasicrystals bridges the amorphous and crystalline regime, so it has remained unclear whether quasicrystals are metastable or stable phases of matter. Density functional theory is often used to evaluate thermodynamic stability, but quasicrystals are long-range aperiodic and their energies cannot be calculated using conventional ab initio methods. Here, we perform first-principles calculations on quasicrystal nanoparticles of increasing size, from which we can directly extrapolate their bulk and surface energies. Using this technique, we determine with high confidence that the icosahedral quasicrystals ScZn7.33 and YbCd5.7 are ground-state phases, thus revealing that translational symmetry is not a necessary condition for the zero-temperature stability of inorganic solids. Although we found the ScZn7.33 quasicrystal to be thermodynamically stable, we show on a mixed thermodynamic and kinetic phase diagram that its solidification from the melt is limited by nucleation, which illustrates why even stable materials may be kinetically challenging to grow. Our techniques broadly open the door to first-principles investigations into the structure–bonding–stability relationships of aperiodic materials. Traditionally, density functional theory could not describe quasicrystals as they lack translational symmetry. An ab initio approach now establishes that the quasicrystalline structures of ScZn7.33 and YbCd5.7 are true ground states.},

  abstract     = {Quasicrystals are long-range-ordered materials with atypical rotational symmetries, such as 5-fold, 10-fold or 12-fold symmetries, which are incompatible with crystallographic periodicity. Although spin-glass-like freezing phenomena have been observed in quasicrystals, antiferromagnetic order has not. Here we report experimental evidence for antiferromagnetic order in the icosahedral quasicrystal Au56In28.5Eu15.5. Its magnetization curve shows a sharp cusp at a Néel temperature of 6.5 K, and both metamagnetic anomaly below and specific heat anomaly at this temperature are consistent with an antiferromagnetic transition. The appearance of magnetic Bragg reflections in the neutron diffraction data below the Néel temperature further confirms the long-range antiferromagnetic order in this icosahedral quasicrystal. Our discovery resolves the long-standing issue of whether antiferromagnetic order is possible in real quasicrystals, inviting further studies particularly on antiferromagnetic icosahedral quasicrystals and quasiperiodic magnetic order, as opposed to periodic magnetic order generally in condensed-matter physics. Quasicrystals lack translational symmetry but display rotational order. Whether antiferromagnetic order can exist in quasicrystals has been unclear.

Despite numerous theoretical and numerical studies, the fabrication of quasicrystals remains a challenge, with limited means available for observing their formation in situ. As a result, questions remain regarding the detailed mechanisms of quasicrystal formation and stabilization. Observable under optical microscopes, micrometre-scale colloidal systems have been used for decades as atomic models with considerably slowed-down dynamics and tuneable interactions through surface modification, solution composition and applied external fields. Here we show that two-dimensional dodecagonal quasicrystals can be reversibly assembled from single-component microspheres using a combination of orthogonally applied magnetic and electric fields. Varying the magnitude and frequency of the applied fields not only determines the resulting structures but also sets the phase transition dynamics via an effective system temperature. We hypothesize that these quasicrystals are energetically stabilized with their formation driven by an isotropic double-well pair potential, although the origin of the second minimum remains an open question. Quasicrystals, which lack translational symmetry but display rotational order, are difficult to make. Now an assembly method for the fabrication of colloidal quasicrystals that offers a high degree of controllability and reversibility is reported.},

One explanation involves the competition between ferroelectricity and an instability characterized by the mesoscopic modulation of the polarization. These polarization density waves, which should intensify near the quantum critical point, break local inversion symmetry and are difficult to characterize with conventional X-ray scattering methods. Here we probe inversion symmetry breaking at finite momenta and visualize the instability of the polarization at the nanometre scale in SrTiO3 by combining a femtosecond X-ray free-electron laser with terahertz coherent control methods. We found polar-acoustic collective modes that are soft, particularly at the tens of nanometre scale. These precursor collective excitations provide evidence for the conjectured mesoscopic-modulated phase in SrTiO3. Despite exhibiting ferroelectric features, SrTiO3 fails to display long-range polar order at low temperatures due to quantum fluctuations.

Using this technique, we measure the electron energy dependence of the electron–phonon coupling strength for individual phonon modes. It allows us to identify distinct signatures distinguishing non-local Su–Schrieffer–Heeger-type couplings from local Holstein-type couplings. Applying this methodology to a methylammonium lead iodide perovskite, we reveal particularly different properties, for example, temperature dependence or anisotropy, of the electron–phonon couplings of two pronounced phonon modes. Our approach provides insights into the microscopic origin of the electron–phonon coupling and has potential applications in phonon-mediated ultrafast control material properties. Probing electron–phonon matrix elements in bulk materials is difficult.

These minima—known as valleys—can be used for storing and processing information, if it is possible to generate a difference in their electron populations. However, to compete with conventional electronics, it is necessary to develop universal and fast methods for controlling and reading the valley quantum number of the electrons. Even though selective optical manipulation of electron populations in inequivalent valleys has been demonstrated in two-dimensional crystals with broken time-reversal symmetry, such control is highly desired in many technologically important semiconductor materials, including silicon and diamond. We demonstrate an ultrafast technique for the generation and read-out of a valley-polarized population of electrons in bulk semiconductors on subpicosecond timescales. The principle is based on the unidirectional intervalley scattering of electrons accelerated by an oscillating electric field of linearly polarized infrared femtosecond pulses. Our results are an advance in the development of potential room-temperature valleytronic devices operating at terahertz frequencies and compatible with contemporary silicon-based technology. Control over electron populations in different conduction band minima in semiconductors can be used to store and process information.

However, understanding how impurity transport affects crystallization presents substantial experimental challenges. Here we visualized crystallization at the single-particle level for a relatively high concentration of impurities. We observed a bifurcation in growth modes—continuous growth or melting and recrystallization—governed by the ability of the system to remove impurity particles from the growth front. The initial nucleation configuration determines the crystal grain size and growth-front morphology, which in turn influence impurity transport. Small grains promote lateral impurity transport to grain boundaries, thus reducing impurity concentration and favouring continuous growth, whereas larger grains accumulate impurities, leading to melting and recrystallization. We reveal that the latter arises from the competition between crystallization and vitrification, which is a form of devitrification. This study provides insights into the relation between impurity concentration and crystallization pathways and highlights how the initial configuration shapes the final crystal morphology. Crystallization processes are influenced by the presence of impurities. Colloid experiments now reveal two distinct types of growth mode that depend on the extent to which a crystallizing system can remove impurity particles from its growth front.},

Various transducers have been developed that couple microwave and optical modes by utilizing nonlinear phenomena such as the Pockels effect and a combination of electromechanical, piezoelectric and optomechanical couplings. However, the limited strength of these nonlinearities necessitates the use of high-quality-factor resonators that can require sophisticated nanofabrication methods. Rare-earth-ion-doped crystals have high-quality atomic resonances that result in effective second-order nonlinearities that are many orders of magnitude stronger than those in conventional materials. Here we use ytterbium-171 ions doped in an YVO4 crystal to implement an on-chip microwave-to-optical transducer. Without an engineered optical cavity, we achieve per-cent-level efficiencies with an added noise referred to the input as low as 1.24(9) photons. We demonstrate the interference of photons originating from two simultaneously operated transducers, enabled by the inherently matching frequencies of the atomic transitions. Our results establish rare-earth-ion-based devices as a competitive platform for transduction and pave the way towards the remote transducer-assisted entanglement of superconducting quantum machines. Converting photons from one frequency range to another uses nonlinear effects that are often weak.

Although these modes propagate as sound waves in conservative systems, non-equilibrium phase transitions have been predicted to feature a diffusive Nambu–Goldstone mode. Here, we present the experimental characterization of such a mode in a non-equilibrium Bose–Einstein condensate of microcavity polaritons. The mode appears in the spectroscopic response of the condensate to an extra probe laser as spectral narrowing, along with the emergence of a tilted frequency plateau. Breaking the symmetry with another phase-fixing beam causes a gap to open in the imaginary part of the spectrum and the disappearance of the Nambu–Goldstone mode. These observations confirm theoretical predictions for the Nambu–Goldstone mode of non-equilibrium phase transitions and reveal the symmetry-breaking mechanism underlying polariton condensation. Gapless modes emerging from non-equilibrium phase transitions are predicted to diffuse rather than propagate as sound waves. Now, the diffusion of these modes and their suppression under symmetry breaking are confirmed in a polariton condensate.},

However, existing platforms are usually restricted to specific types of interaction, fundamentally limiting the models they can mimic. Here we realize an all-to-all interacting model with an arbitrary quadratic Hamiltonian, thus demonstrating an infinite-range tunable Heisenberg XYZ model. This was accomplished by engineering cavity-mediated four-photon interactions between an ensemble of 700 rubidium atoms with a pair of momentum states serving as the effective qubit degree of freedom. As one example of the versatility of this approach, we implemented the so-called two-axis counter-twisting model, a collective spin model that can generate spin-squeezed states that saturate the Heisenberg limit on quantum phase estimation. Furthermore, our platform allows for including more than two relevant momentum states by simply adding additional dressing laser tones. This approach opens opportunities for quantum simulation and quantum sensing with matter–wave interferometers and other quantum sensors, such as optical clocks and magnetometers. Spin models that can be emulated by quantum simulators are usually restricted to systems with conserved total magnetization. The tuning of photon-mediated interactions between atoms in a cavity enables the implementation of more general models also useful for quantum sensing tasks.},

We demonstrate that concurrent steady-state spin squeezing and sensing are possible using continuous quantum non-demolition measurements under constant optical pumping. We achieve a sustained spin-squeezed state with a large ensemble of hot atoms using metrologically relevant steady-state squeezing. We further employ the system to track different types of continuous time-fluctuating magnetic fields, and we demonstrate the use of deep learning models to infer the time-varying fields from an optical measurement. The quantum enhancement due to spin squeezing was verified by a degraded performance in test experiments where the spin squeezing was deliberately prevented. These results represent an advance in continuous quantum-enhanced metrology with entangled atoms, including the training and application of a deep neural network to infer complex time-dependent perturbations. Simultaneous spin squeezing and the detection of dynamic fields is challenging as entanglement generation and signal interrogation often interfere.

  abstract     = {Laser-cooled gases of atoms interacting with the field of an optical cavity are a versatile tool for quantum sensing and the simulation of quantum systems. These systems can exhibit phenomena such as self-organization phase transitions, lasing mechanisms, squeezed states and protection of quantum coherence. However, investigations of these phenomena typically occur in a discontinuous manner due to the need to reload atomic ensembles. Here we demonstrate hours-long continuous lasing from laser-cooled 88Sr atoms loaded into a ring cavity. The required inversion to produce lasing arises from inversion in the atomic-momentum degrees of freedom, which is linked to the self-organization phase transitions and collective atomic recoil lasing observed previously only in a cyclic fashion. We find that over a broad parameter range, the sensitivity of the lasing frequency to changes in cavity frequency is significantly reduced due to an atomic loss mechanism, suggesting a potential approach for mitigating low-frequency cavity noise. Our findings open opportunities for continuous cavity quantum electrodynamics experiments and robust and continuous super-radiant lasers. Experiments with cold atoms in optical cavities are often limited to discontinuous operation due to reloading requirements. Now, continuous lasing is demonstrated with strontium atoms in a ring cavity, stabilized by atom loss mechanisms.},

  abstract     = {Periodically driven quantum systems can realize phases of matter that do not appear in time-independent Hamiltonians. One application is the engineering of synthetic gauge fields, which enables the study of topological many-body physics with neutral atom quantum simulators. Here we realize the strongly interacting Mott–Meissner phase—a state combining interaction-induced localization with chiral currents induced by an artificial magnetic field—in large-scale bosonic flux ladders with 48 sites at half-filling using a neutral atom quantum simulator. By combining quantum gas microscopy with local basis rotations, we reveal the emerging equilibrium particle currents with local resolution across large systems. We find chiral currents exhibiting a characteristic interaction scaling, providing direct experimental evidence of the interacting Mott–Meissner phase. Moreover, we benchmark density correlations with numerical simulations and find that the effective temperature of the system is on the order of the tunnel coupling. These results establish the feasibility of scaling periodically driven quantum systems to large, strongly correlated phases, enabling further studies of topological quantum matter with single-atom resolution and control. The quantum simulation of driven, strongly correlated phases at large scales is challenging, primarily due to detrimental heating effects. Now, a large-scale interacting Mott–Meissner phase has been realized in a neutral atom quantum simulator.},

It is now being considered as a complementary approach to the use of radiofrequency cavities in next-generation lepton accelerators. However, compared with electrons, plasma-based positron acceleration is at the present time much less advanced. Although high-gradient positron acceleration in a plasma has been achieved, we are one to three orders of magnitude away from delivering the high-quality positron beams needed for a future high-energy linear collider. Here we review the status of plasma-based acceleration of electrons and positrons and discuss the prospects for substantial progress towards developing the positron arm of a plasma-based electron–positron linear collider in the next decade. The status of plasma-based acceleration of electrons and positrons is discussed, with a focus on developing the positron arm of a plasma-based electron–positron linear collider.},

Here we report the observation of another non-planar gait used as an escape strategy from threatening situations by juvenile anacondas (Eunectes notaeus), which we refer to as the S-start due to its shape. In this transient mode of locomotion, the snake writhes and bends out of the plane while rolling forward about its midsection without slippage. To quantify our observations, we develop a model for an active non-planar filament that interacts anisotropically with a frictional substrate. We demonstrate that locomotion is due to a propagating localized pulse of a topological quantity—the link density. A two-dimensional phase space characterized by scaled body weight and muscular torque shows that relatively light juveniles are capable of S-starts, whereas heavy adults are not, consistent with our experiments. We also show that a periodic sequence of S-starts naturally leads to a sidewinding gait. Snakes are capable of non-planar gaits, such as sidewinding. Now observations of juvenile anacondas reveal another non-planar gait resembling an S shape. Calculations show how topological dynamics of active filaments enable such movements.},

  abstract     = {Chemo-mechanical waves play a key role in force generation and long-range signal transmission in cells that dynamically change shape, for example, during cell division or morphogenesis. Reconstituting and controlling such chemically controlled cell deformations is a crucial but unsolved challenge for the development of synthetic cells. Here we present an optogenetic method to investigate the mechanism responsible for coordinating surface contraction waves that occur in oocytes of the starfish Patiria miniata during meiotic cell division. Using optogenetic stimuli, we create chemo-mechanical cortical excitations that are decoupled from meiotic cues and drive various shape deformations, ranging from local pinching to surface contraction waves and breakdown of the cell. A quantitative model entailing both chemical and geometry dynamics allows us to predict and explain the variety of mechanical responses to optogenetic stimuli. Finally, we qualitatively map the observed shape dynamics to understand how the versatility of intracellular protein dynamics can give rise to a broad range of mechanical phenotypes. More broadly, our results suggest a route towards real-time control over dynamical deformations in living organisms and can advance the design of synthetic cells and life-like cellular functions. Optogenetically induced chemo-mechanical excitations are used to drive and study shape deformations in starfish oocytes. Understanding and eventually controlling such waves is important for the development of synthetic cells.},

However, time-reversal symmetry is broken in systems with energy dissipation, necessitating a different approach for relating the input and output fields. We theoretically consider a saturated multimode fibre amplifier in which light generates a heat flow and suffers thermo-optical nonlinearity, thus breaking time-reversal symmetry. We identify a spacetime symmetry that maps the target output back to an input field. This spacetime symmetry mapping applies phase conjugation, gain and absorption substitution but not time reversal, and it holds in a steady state and for slowly varying inputs. Our approach enables coherent wavefront control of nonlinear dissipative systems. In many optical systems with time-reversal symmetry, it is possible to control the output waves by shaping the input fields. Now a scheme is presented that works for multimode fibres that lack time-reversal symmetry due to thermal effects.},

  abstract     = {Quantum communications technologies require a network of quantum processors connected with low-loss and low-noise communication channels capable of distributing entangled states. Superconducting microwave qubits operating in cryogenic environments have emerged as promising candidates for quantum processor nodes. However, scaling these systems is challenging because they require bulky microwave components with high thermal loads that can quickly overwhelm the cooling power of a dilution refrigerator. Telecommunication frequency optical signals, however, can be fabricated in significantly smaller form factors to avoid challenges caused by high signal loss, noise sensitivity and thermal loads due to their high carrier frequency and propagation in silica optical fibres. Transduction of information by means of coherent links between optical and microwave frequencies is therefore critical to leverage the advantages of optics for superconducting microwave qubits, while also enabling superconducting processors to be linked with low-loss optical interconnects. Here, we demonstrate coherent optical control of a superconducting qubit. We achieve this by developing a microwave–optical quantum transducer that operates with up to 1.18% conversion efficiency with low added microwave noise, and we demonstrate optically driven Rabi oscillations in a superconducting qubit. Superconducting qubits operate at microwave frequencies, but it is much more efficient to transmit information optically. Now, a superconducting qubit has been controlled with an optical signal by using a microwave–optical quantum transducer.},

For superconducting processors, microwave photons are a natural means to mediate this distribution. However, many existing architectures limit node connectivity and directionality. In this work, we construct a chiral quantum interconnect between two nominally identical modules in separate microwave packages. Our approach uses quantum interference to emit and absorb microwave photons on demand and in a chosen direction between these modules. We optimize our protocol using model-free reinforcement learning to maximize the absorption efficiency. By halting the emission process halfway through its duration, we generate remote entanglement between modules in the form of a four-qubit W state with approximately 62% fidelity in each direction, limited mainly by propagation loss. This quantum network architecture enables all-to-all connectivity between non-local processors for modular and extensible quantum simulation and computation. Large quantum computers are likely to require methods of connecting devices by transmitting and absorbing photons. Entanglement between two superconducting qubit devices has now been established using a waveguide with tunable directionality.},

Here, motivated by observations of mechanically induced changes in the dynamics of such systems and the apparent role of confinement geometry, we show that the fluidization transition broadly resembles yielding in amorphous solids, which is consistent with recent suggestions. More specifically, however, we find that a detailed analogy holds with the yielding transition under cyclic shear deformation, for large but finite persistence times. The fluidization transition is accompanied by driving-induced annealing, strong dependence on the initial state of the system, a divergence of timescales to reach steady states and a discontinuous onset of diffusive motion. We also observe a striking dependence of transition on persistence times and on the nature of confinement. Collectively, our results have implications for biological assemblies in confined geometries, including epigenetic cell-state transitions. Assemblies of active particles display a range of dynamical phenomena. Simulations now show that the transition of an assembly of active particles from a jammed to a fluidized state is similar to the process of mechanical yielding seen in amorphous solids.},

  abstract     = {Droplet microfluidics, a versatile technique for the precise manipulation of discrete droplets, has revolutionized biological and chemical research. So far, the successful implementation of droplet microfluidics necessitates the choice of non-wetting surfaces with minimal pinning forces, which hinders its broader adoptions in clinical applications. Here we report acousto-dewetting, a liquid dewetting principle that enables the three-dimensional, remotely controllable and precise operation of droplets on surfaces of any wettability, including superhydrophilic surfaces. This principle originates from the intricate interplay between acoustic streaming and droplet dynamics due to the extreme confinement of ultrasound within droplets, with an enhancement in pressure gradient of three orders of magnitude compared with traditional ultrasound-based approaches. We show that on superhydrophilic surfaces, acousto-dewetting achieves a contact line moving velocity that is two orders of magnitude higher than the previous limit and eliminates the undesired viscous film stemming from viscous dissipations. We developed a droplet microfluidics approach that achieves versatile droplet manipulation in various extreme scenarios associated with superhydrophilic surfaces, and applied it to an in vivo clinical setting for the rapid and safe removal of thrombus as well as drug delivery. In droplet microfluidic setups, droplets are driven around on a surface, which is normally hydrophobic. Now, droplet microfluidics with superhydrophilic substrates is shown to also be feasible by exploiting acoustic effects.},

However, the precise physical mechanisms of this coupling remain unclear. Here we show how cytoskeletal forces acting on a biomimetic membrane affect its deformations. Using a minimal cell model that consists of an active network of microtubules and molecular motors encapsulated inside lipid vesicles, we observe large shape fluctuations and travelling membrane deformations. Quantitative analysis of membrane and microtubule dynamics demonstrates how active forces set the temporal scale of vesicle fluctuations, giving rise to fluctuation spectra that differ in both their spatial and temporal decays from their counterparts in thermal equilibrium. Using simulations, we extend the classical framework of membrane fluctuations to active cytoskeleton-driven vesicles, demonstrating how correlated activity governs membrane dynamics and the roles of confinement, membrane material properties and cytoskeletal forces. Our findings provide a quantitative foundation for understanding the shape-morphing abilities of living cells. How cells actively change their shape is an open question. Now, a reconstituted minimal cytoskeleton composed of microtubules and molecular motors is shown to produce membrane fluctuations that drive active shape changes in synthetic cells.},

  abstract     = {The catalytic cycle involves internal motions and conformational changes that allow enzymes to specifically bind to substrates, reach the transition state and release the product. Such mechanical interactions and motions are often long ranged so that mutations of residues far from the active site can modulate the enzymatic cycle. In particular, regions that undergo high strain during the cycle give mechanical flexibility to the protein, which is crucial for protein motion. Here we directly probe the connection between strain, flexibility and functionality, and we quantify how distant high-strain residues modulate the catalytic function via long-ranged force transduction. We measure the rheological and catalytic properties of wild-type guanylate kinase and of its mutants with a single amino acid replacement in low-/high-strain regions and in binding/non-binding regions. The rheological response of the protein to an applied oscillating force fits a continuum model of a viscoelastic material whose mechanical properties are significantly affected by mutations in high-strain regions, as opposed to mutations in control regions. Furthermore, catalytic activity assays show that mutations in high-strain or binding regions tend to reduce activity, whereas mutations in low-strain, non-binding regions are neutral. These findings suggest that enzymes act as viscoelastic catalytic machines with sequence-encoded mechanical specifications. Enzymes are viscoelastic, deformable machines. Mutating high-strain regions in these machines affect their catalytic function.},

We map the internal environments and interfaces of condensates using fluorogens that localize differently to the interiors versus interface between dilute phase and condensate.

We use the theory of coupled oscillators combined with live population, and single-cell recordings and precise experimental perturbations. Coherent circadian rhythms yield oscillatory growth patterns, which unveil a global timing regulator of tissue dynamics. Knocking out core circadian elements abolishes the observed effects, highlighting the central role of circadian clock regulation.

  abstract     = {Previous theoretical efforts have predicted a type of unconventional antiferromagnet characterized by a crystal symmetry that connects antiferromagnetic sublattices in real space and simultaneously couples spin and momentum in reciprocal space. This results in a unique crystal-symmetry-paired spin–valley locking and related properties including piezomagnetism and non-collinear spin current even without spin–orbit coupling. However, most known unconventional antiferromagnets do not meet the necessary symmetry requirements for non-relativistic spin current, and this limits applications in spintronic devices. Here we demonstrate crystal-symmetry-paired spin–valley locking in a layered room-temperature antiferromagnetic compound, Rb1−δV2Te2O. Spin-resolved photoemission measurements directly show the opposite spin splitting between crystal-symmetry-paired valleys. Quasi-particle interference patterns show the suppression of intervalley scattering due to the spin selection rules that are a direct consequence of the spin–valley locking. These results suggest that Rb1−δV2Te2O is a potential room-temperature altermagnet candidate. Our observations highlight a methodology that enables both the advantages of layered materials and possible control through crystal symmetry manipulation for advancements in magnetism, electronics and information technology. Spin-split bands and certain lattice symmetries are required to generate the spin currents needed for spintronics applications. Now a layered room-temperature antiferromagnet is shown to exhibit anisotropic spin splitting between valleys paired by a crystal symmetry.},

  abstract     = {Altermagnetism is a recently discovered unconventional magnetic phase that is characterized by time-reversal symmetry breaking and spin-split band structures in materials with zero net magnetization. Recently, spin-polarized band structures and a vanishing net magnetization were observed in semiconductors MnTe and MnTe2, confirming this unconventional magnetic order. Metallic altermagnets offer advantages for exploring physical phenomena related to low-energy quasiparticle excitations and for applications in spintronics because the finite electrical conductivity of metals allows direct manipulation of the spin current through the electric field. We demonstrate that KV2Se2O is a metallic room-temperature altermagnet with d-wave spin-momentum locking. Our experiments probe the magnetic and electronic structures of this compound and reveal a highly anisotropic spin-polarized Fermi surface and the emergence of a spin-density-wave order in the altermagnetic phase. These characteristics suggest that KV2Se2O could be a helpful platform for high-performance spintronic devices and for studying many-body effects coupled with unconventional magnetism. Metallic altermagnets are promising for applications due to the spin-polarized electric current that originates from their spin-split band structure. Now d-wave altermagnetism with antisymmetric spin polarization has been demonstrated in KV2Se2O.},

  abstract     = {Superconductivity serves as a basis for non-trivial quantum phenomena and devices, but they often require artificial control of the superconducting gap. In real space, there are various ways to tailor the superconducting gap, such as by introducing interfaces and defects. However, it is challenging to manipulate the superconducting gap in momentum space. Here we demonstrate that the superconducting gap of NbSe2 monolayers on graphene can be modified at specific momenta by changing the twist angle between the layers. Our spectroscopic-imaging-based scanning tunnelling microscopy experiments reveal the interference patterns of Bogoliubov quasiparticles that are twisted with respect to NbSe2 and graphene lattices. We find that these chiral interference patterns originate from the twist-dependent sextet of regions in momentum space in which the Fermi surfaces of the NbSe2 monolayer and graphene overlap. This finding not only broadens our understanding of superconductivity in twisted bilayer systems but also opens up possibilities for designing artificial superconducting materials and devices with tunable properties. Rotating material layers with respect to each other can change their electronic properties. Now, superconducting quasiparticles with a twisted configuration are demonstrated in a NbSe2 monolayer on graphene by controlling the twist angle.},

  abstract     = {Controlling the spin current lies at the heart of spintronics and its applications. In ferromagnets, the sign of spin currents is fixed once the current direction is determined. However, spin currents in antiferromagnets can possess opposite polarizations, but this requires enormous magnetic fields to lift the degeneracy between the two modes. Therefore, controlling spin currents with opposite polarization is still a challenge. Here we demonstrate the control of spin currents at room temperature by magnon interference in a canted antiferromagnet, namely, haematite that has recently been classified as an altermagnet. Magneto-optical characterization by Brillouin light scattering reveals that the spatial periodicity of the beating patterns is tunable via the microwave frequency. We further observe that the inverse spin Hall voltage changes sign as the frequency is tuned, evincing a frequency-controlled switching of polarization of pure spin currents. Our work highlights the use of antiferromagnetic magnon interference to control spin currents, which substantially extends the horizon for the emerging field of coherent antiferromagnetic spintronics. Controlling the propagation of spin currents with opposite polarities in antiferromagnets has remained challenging. Now the frequency of coherently excited spin waves in a haematite-based device is shown to control the sign of the spin current.},

  abstract     = {Recent experiments on magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene have shown the formation of flat bands, suggesting that electronic correlation effects are likely to dominate in this material. However, a global transport measurement showing distinct signatures of strong correlations—such as local moments arising from the flat bands—is missing. Here we demonstrate the presence of emergent local moments through their impact on entropy extracted from thermopower measurements. In addition to sign changes in the thermopower at the Dirac point and full filling of the flat bands, we observe sign changes near the quarter-filled bands that do not vary with temperature from 5 K to 60 K. This is in contrast to temperature-dependent crossing points seen in our study on twisted bilayer graphene devices with weaker correlations. Furthermore, we find that applying a magnetic field reduces the thermopower, consistent with spin entropy suppression observed in layered oxides under partial spin polarization. Neither the robust crossing points nor the suppression by a magnetic field can be explained solely from the contributions of band fermions; instead, our data suggest a dominant contribution coming from the entropy of the emergent localized moments of a strongly correlated flat band. It is well known that flat bands exist in magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene. Now thermopower measurements show that the strong correlations between electrons in these bands result in the formation of local moments.},

In particular, thermopower is a valuable parameter to probe the quasiparticle statistics that give rise to excess entropy in certain even-denominator fractional quantum Hall states. Here we demonstrate that the magneto-thermopower detection of fractional quantum Hall states is more sensitive than resistivity measurements. We do this in the context of Bernal-stacked bilayer graphene and highlight several even-denominator states at a relatively low magnetic field. These capabilities of thermopower measurements support the interest in fractional quantum Hall states for finding quasiparticles with non-Abelian statistics and elevate bilayer graphene as a promising platform for achieving this. Fractional quantum Hall states can be fragile, meaning that they are difficult to probe using electrical transport measurements. Now, thermal transport is shown to be a more sensitive technique for investigating these states.},

Spectroscopy measurements show sharp excitations that have been predicted to emerge when electrons fractionalize into bound states of quasiparticles. We found energy gaps for candidate non-abelian fractional states that are larger by a factor of five than those in other related systems, for example, semiconductor heterostructures, and this suggests that bilayer graphene is an ideal platform for manipulating these quasiparticles and for creating topological quantum bits. We also found previously unobserved fractional states in our very clean graphene samples. Local probes of quantum Hall states are still in their infancy. Now scanning tunnelling measurements were used to extract the energy gap of candidate non-Abelian fractional states, which are found to be encouragingly large for applications.},

  abstract     = {Crossed Andreev reflection is a non-local transport phenomenon that creates and detects Cooper pair correlations between distant locations. It is also the basis of Cooper pair splitting to generate remote entanglement. Although crossed Andreev reflection has been extensively studied in semiconductors proximity-coupled to a superconductor, observing it in a topological insulator has been very difficult. Here we report the observation of this effect in a proximitized topological insulator nanowire. We perform local and non-local conductance spectroscopy on mesoscopic devices in which superconducting niobium and metallic contacts are connected to a bulk-insulating nanowire. In our local conductance measurements we detect a hard gap and the appearance of Andreev bound states that can reach zero bias. We also occasionally observe a negative non-local conductance when sweeping the chemical potential, providing evidence of crossed Andreev reflection. This signal is detected even over length scales much longer than the expected superconducting coherence length of either niobium or the proximitized nanowire. We suggest that this long-range effect is due to the intricate role of disorder in proximitized nanowires. Crossed Andreev reflection is an important process for using the inherent entanglement within a Cooper pair. Now this effect has been observed in a topological insulator nanowire, which has implications for topological quantum computing.},

Here we provide a sharp and universal definition of the local equilibration timescale, and show that it is bounded below by the strong-coupling scale of diffusive fluctuations, which can be expressed in terms of familiar transport parameters. When applied to conformal field theories at a finite temperature, this result produces the Planckian bound. Moreover, this fluctuation bound applies to any local thermalizing system. We study its implication for correlated insulators, metals and disordered fixed points, where it can be used to establish a lower bound on diffusivity in terms of specific heat. Finally, we discuss how the local equilibration time can be directly measured in experiments. It has been proposed that the equilibration time of many-body systems is limited by a timescale determined by Planck’s constant and temperature. A bound of this kind has now been identified for a universal definition of equilibration time.},

  abstract     = {The renormalization group is a pillar of the theory of scaling, scale invariance and universality in physics. Recently, this tool has been adapted to complex networks with pairwise interactions through a scheme based on diffusion dynamics. However, as the importance of polyadic interactions in complex systems becomes more evident, there is a pressing need to extend the renormalization group methods to higher-order networks. Here we fill this gap and propose a Laplacian renormalization group scheme for arbitrary higher-order networks. At the heart of our approach is the introduction of cross-order Laplacians, which generalize existing higher-order Laplacians by allowing the description of diffusion processes that can happen on hyperedges of any order via hyperedges of any other order. This approach enables us to probe higher-order structures, define scale invariance at various orders and propose a coarse-graining scheme. We validate our approach on controlled synthetic higher-order systems and then use it to detect the presence of order-specific scale-invariant profiles of real-world complex systems from multiple domains. The renormalization group is a powerful tool to study the universal properties of physical systems. A diffusion-based renormalization scheme now enables the study of scale invariance and universality in higher-order complex networks.},

  abstract     = {Finding ground states of quantum many-body systems is known to be hard for both classical and quantum computers. Consequently, when a quantum system is cooled in a low-temperature thermal bath, the ground state cannot always be found efficiently. Instead, the system may become trapped in a local minimum of the energy. In this work, we study the problem of finding local minima in quantum systems under thermal perturbations. Although local minima are much easier to find than ground states, we show that finding a local minimum is hard on classical computers, even when the task is merely to output a single-qubit observable at any local minimum. By contrast, we prove that a quantum computer can always find a local minimum efficiently using a thermal gradient descent algorithm that mimics natural cooling processes. To establish the classical hardness of finding local minima, we construct a family of two-dimensional Hamiltonians such that any problem solvable by polynomial-time quantum algorithms can be reduced to finding local minima of these Hamiltonians. Therefore, cooling systems to local minima is universal for quantum computation and, assuming that quantum computation is more powerful than classical computation, finding local minima is classically hard but quantumly easy. In general, it is difficult to identify the global energy minimum of a many-body system. Now, it has been shown that finding even local minima is difficult classically but efficiently achievable with a quantum computer.},

  abstract     = {During the early development of multi-cellular animals, cells self-organize to set up the body axes such as the primary head-to-tail axis. Several signalling pathways are known to control body axis formation. Here we show that tissue mechanics also plays an important role. We focus on the emergence of a primary axis in initially spherical aggregates of mouse embryonic stem cells, which mirrors events in the development of the early mouse embryo. These aggregates break rotational symmetry by establishing domains of different expression profiles, for example, of the transcription factor T/Brachyury and the adhesion molecule E-cadherin. By combining quantitative microscopy and physical modelling, we identify large-scale tissue flows with a recirculating component that contribute substantially to the symmetry breaking. We show that the recirculating flows are—akin to Marangoni flows—driven by a difference in tissue surface tensions, whose existence we further confirm using aggregate fusion experiments. Our work highlights that body axis formation is not only driven by biochemical processes but can also be amplified by tissue flows. We expect that this type of amplification may operate in many other organoid and in vivo systems. During the development of multi-cellular animals, biochemical signals control the organization of cells to set up body axes. In mouse embryonic stem cell aggregates, tissue flows are now found to amplify the formation of such body axes.},

  abstract     = {During embryogenesis, the first cell fate decision—whether the cell participates in development of the embryo or not—is often linked to the positioning of the nucleus. The cell cycle oscillator and associated cytoskeletal dynamics contribute to the control of nuclear positioning. However, the mechanisms that ensure that the correct number of nuclei move to their appropriate place remain poorly understood. Here we show that the orientation of the mitotic spindle controls the first fate decision, embryonic or yolk cell fate, in Drosophila embryos using light sheet microscopy experiments. Combining computational methods inspired by integral geometry, manipulation of cell cycle genes, and investigation of the relationship between geometry and topology, we show that spindle orientation is controlled by topological interactions with neighbouring nuclei and not by internuclear distance. Leveraging the physics of space-filling systems, we develop a theory for topological dependency in microtubule structures. Our work shows how the topological interplay of microtubule mechanics can ensure robust control of nuclear density and determine cell fate. Early positioning of the embryo nuclei is not well understood. Now, experiments show that the orientation of the mitotic spindle is controlled by topological interactions, which determine whether the nucleus remains inside the Drosophila embryo.},

  abstract     = {Many single-celled organisms exhibit both solitary and colonial existence. An important step towards multicellularity, which is associated with benefits such as enhanced nutrient uptake, was the formation of colonies of unicellular organisms. However, the initial drivers that favoured individual cells aggregating into more complex colonies are less clear. Here we show that hydrodynamic coupling between proximate neighbours results in faster feeding flows for neighbouring ciliates, such that individuals within a dynamic colony have stronger average feeding flows than solitary individuals. Flows generated by individuals acting together reach higher velocities, thus allowing access to a wider range of prey resources than individuals acting on their own. Moreover, we find that accrued feeding benefits are typically asymmetric: whereas all individuals benefit from acting together, those with slower solitary currents gain more from partnering than those with faster currents. We find that colonial organization in simple unicellular organisms is beneficial for all its members. This provides fundamental insights into the selective forces favouring the early evolution of multicellular organization. How unicellular organisms evolved into multicellular ones is an open question. Now, using unicellular Stentor coeruleus as a model system, the transition between isolated individuals and a coordinated colony is shown to benefit all colony members.},

Here we report experimental evidence of a universal feature in the patterns of flow that spontaneously emerge in groups of collectively moving cells. Specifically, we demonstrate that the flows generated by collectively moving dog kidney cells, human breast cancer cells and two different strains of pathogenic bacteria exhibit robust conformal invariance. We also show that the precise form of invariance in all four systems is described by the Schramm–Loewner evolution—a family of planar curves defined by a single parameter—and belongs to the percolation universality class. The presence of universal conformal invariance reveals that the macroscopic features of living biological matter exhibit universal translational, rotational and scale symmetries that are independent of the microscopic properties of its constituents. Our results show that flow patterns generated by different systems are highly conserved and that biological systems can be used to experimentally test predictions from the theories for conformally invariant structures. The flow features of cell monolayers depend on cellular interactions. Now four different types of cell monolayer are shown to exhibit robust conformal invariance that belongs to the percolation universality class.},

  abstract     = {Reproducible pattern and form generation during embryogenesis is poorly understood. Intestinal organoid morphogenesis involves a number of mechanochemical regulators such as cell-type-specific cytoskeletal forces and osmotically driven lumen volume changes. It is unclear how these forces are coordinated in time and space to ensure robust morphogenesis. Here we show how mechanosensitive feedback on cytoskeletal tension gives rise to morphological bistability in a minimal model of organoid morphogenesis. In the model, lumen volume changes can impact the epithelial shape via both direct mechanical and indirect mechanosensitive mechanisms. We find that both bulged and budded crypt states are possible and dependent on the history of volume changes. We test key modelling assumptions via biophysical and pharmacological experiments to demonstrate how bistability can explain experimental observations, such as the importance of the timing of lumen shrinkage and robustness of the final morphogenetic state to mechanical perturbations. This suggests that bistability arising from feedback between cellular tensions and fluid pressure could be a general mechanism that coordinates multicellular shape changes in developing systems. How forces are temporally coordinated during embryo development is unclear. Now two types of morphology are possible in a developing organoid and the final morphology depends on the system history.},

However, it is not known how torsion, a geometric property of the three-dimensional waveform, relates to mechanical twist deformations of the axoneme, the conserved cytoskeletal core of cilia and flagella. Here we show that axoneme twisting and torsion are coupled and that twist waves propagate along the beating axoneme of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii algae. We resolve the three-dimensional shapes of the axonemal waveform with nanometre precision at millisecond timescales using defocused dark-field microscopy and beat-cycle averaging, observing regular hetero-chiral torsion waves propagating base to tip. To investigate whether the observed torsion results from axonemal twist, we attach gold nanoparticles to axonemes and measure their cross-section rotation during beating. We find that, locally, the axonemal cross-section co-rotates with the bending plane, evidencing twist–torsion coupling. Our results demonstrate the link between shape and mechanical deformation in beating axonemes and can inform models of the dynamics of motor proteins inside the axoneme responsible for shaping the beat of motile cilia. Many single cells rely on beating cilia and flagella to move. Now it is shown that the core of these appendages twists to generate the torsion waves responsible for three-dimensional motion.},

Intravenously administered, ultrasound-responsive microbubbles are promising agents with demonstrated potential in clinical trials, but the mechanism underlying drug absorption remains unclear. Here we show that ultrasound-driven single microbubbles puncture the cell membrane and induce drug uptake through stable cyclic microjets. Our theoretical models successfully reproduce the observed bubble and cell dynamic responses. We find that cyclic jets arise from shape instabilities, as opposed to classical inertial jets that are driven by pressure gradients, enabling microjet formation at mild ultrasound pressures below 100 kPa. We also establish a threshold for bubble radial expansion beyond which microjets form and facilitate cellular permeation and show that the stress generated by microjetting outperforms previously suggested mechanisms by at least an order of magnitude. Overall, this work elucidates the physics behind microbubble-mediated targeted drug delivery and provides the criteria for its effective and safe application. Ultrasound-driven microbubbles are promising candidates for drug delivery, but the mechanism of action is unclear. Now, single microbubbles induce drug uptake through cyclic microjets formed at mild ultrasound pressures via interfacial instability.},

A key remaining challenge is to enhance the capabilities of individual nodes, providing precise and robust control over multiple qubits. Here we demonstrate coherent control in a hybrid quantum node based on a diamond colour centre. We entangle three types of qubit: an electron spin as an interface qubit, a nuclear spin with long memory time and a flying photonic qubit. These qubits’ frequencies span three distinct regimes, from the optical to the radio-frequency domain. By incorporating two additional nuclear spins, we encode three memory qubits into a logical state using a repetition code and entangle this logical qubit with a photonic qubit. We repeatedly read out the error syndromes of memory qubits using the electron interface qubit, then apply real-time feedback operations to correct bit-flip errors. We perform our protocol for up to 12 rounds and demonstrate an improvement in the logical–photonic joint state population compared with its uncorrected counterpart. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of several key functionalities required for quantum repeaters to operate in full-fledged quantum networks. Nodes in a quantum network must be able to interface with photonic qubits as well as perform local quantum computations. The quantum node device presented here is capable of storing quantum information and correcting bit-flip errors.},

Here we obtain the complete explicit and analytical description of a full set of quantum statistics in terms of its extremal points. This is made possible by finding all bipartite quantum states and pairs of binary measurements that can be self-tested, that is, reconstructed from empirical statistics only. Our description precisely reveals some of the extent and limitations of quantum theory.

  abstract     = {Particle physics describes the interplay of matter and forces through gauge theories. Yet, the intrinsic quantum nature of gauge theories makes important problems notoriously difficult for classical computational techniques. Quantum computers offer a promising way to overcome these roadblocks. We demonstrate two essential requirements on this path: first, we perform a quantum computation of the properties of the basic building block of two-dimensional lattice quantum electrodynamics, involving both gauge fields and matter. Second, we show how to refine the gauge-field discretization beyond its minimal representation, using a trapped-ion qudit quantum processor, where quantum information is encoded in several states per ion. Such qudits are ideally suited for describing gauge fields, which are naturally high dimensional, leading to reduced register size and circuit complexity. We prepare the ground state of the model using a variational quantum eigensolver and observe the effect of dynamical matter on quantized magnetic fields. By controlling the qudit dimension, we also show how to seamlessly observe the effect of different gauge-field truncations. Finally, we experimentally study the dynamics of pair creation and magnetic energy. Our results open the door for hardware-efficient quantum simulations of gauge theories with qudits in near-term quantum devices. Qubit-based simulations of gauge theories are challenging as gauge fields require high-dimensional encoding. Now a quantum electrodynamics model has been demonstrated using trapped-ion qudits, which encode information in multiple states of ions.},

  abstract     = {Quasiparticles are emergent excitations of matter that underlie much of our understanding of quantum many-body systems. Therefore, the prospect of controlling their properties has both fundamental and practical implications. However, in solid-state materials, it is often challenging to understand how quasiparticles are modified by external fields due to their complex interplay with other collective excitations. Here we demonstrate the manipulation of Fermi polarons—quasiparticles formed by impurities interacting with a Fermi gas—in a homogeneous atomic gas using fast radio-frequency control. Exploiting two internal states of the impurity species, we develop a steady-state spectroscopy, from which we extract the energy of the driven polaron. By varying the drive Rabi frequency, we measure the decay rate and the quasiparticle residue of the polaron in the weak-drive limit. At large Rabi frequencies, we observe signs that the drive causes a hybridization of the driven polaron with an incoherent background, leading to the breakdown of a description in terms of textbook quasiparticles. Our experiment establishes the driven Fermi polaron as a promising platform for studying controllable quasiparticles in strongly driven quantum matter and calls for a controlled theoretical framework to describe the dynamics of this strongly interacting quantum system. Fermi polarons are quasiparticles formed by impurities immersed in a Fermi gas. An experiment in an ultracold fermionic gas now shows how to control their properties with a tunable radio-frequency field.},

Here we demonstrate the presence of two superconducting regimes in CsV3Sb5 that are characterized by distinct transport and thermodynamic properties. Our results reveal a substantial quasiparticle weight in a high-temperature regime. At lower temperatures, this weight is removed through the formation of a second gap. We argue that the band with a gap opening at lower temperatures continues to host low-energy quasiparticles, possibly due to the nodal structure of the gap. Taken together, our results present evidence for band-selective superconductivity with uncoupled superconducting gaps. The pairing mechanism in kagome superconductors is still not fully understood. Now, CsV3Sb5, which belongs to this family, is shown to have orbital-selective pairing with two distinct superconducting domes that are not separated by any phase boundary.},

  abstract     = {The recent observation of the fractional quantum anomalous Hall effect in moiré fractional Chern insulators provides an opportunity to investigate zero magnetic field anyons. One approach for potentially realizing non-abelian anyons is to engineer higher flat Chern bands that mimic higher Landau levels. We investigate the interaction, topology and ferromagnetism of the second moiré miniband in twisted MoTe2 bilayers. At half-filling of the second miniband, we observed spontaneous ferromagnetism and an incipient Chern insulator state. The Chern numbers of the top two moiré flat bands exhibited opposite signs for twist angles above 3.1° but had the same sign near 2.6°, consistent with theoretical predictions. In the 2.6° device, increasing the magnetic field induced a topological phase transition due to band-crossing between opposite valleys, resulting in an emergent state with Chern number C = −2. Additionally, an insulating state at half-filling of the second valley-polarized band indicates that a charge-ordered state is favoured over the fractional Chern insulator state. These findings lay a foundation for understanding the higher flat Chern bands, which are crucial for the discovery of non-abelian fractional Chern insulators. In analogy with quantum Hall systems, it may be possible to find non-abelian anyons in the higher bands of Chern insulators. Now, the phase diagram of the second moiré band of twisted MoTe2 is explored, laying the groundwork for such investigations.},

Examples include fractional quantum anomalous Hall effects and fractional topological insulators. Recently, fractional quantum anomalous Hall effects have been experimentally realized in both twisted bilayer MoTe2 and rhombohedral-stacked multilayer graphene on hexagonal boron nitride. These studies focus mainly on the first moiré flat band, but there is a possibility that non-Abelian states could occur in the second moiré band. Here we present a systematic transport study of twisted bilayer MoTe2 devices, focusing on the second moiré band. We observe ferromagnetism in the second moiré band, and a Chern insulator state driven by out-of-plane magnetic fields at a filling factor of three holes per moiré unit cell. Between fillings of 2.2 and 2.7 holes per moiré unit cell, we observe a finite temperature resistivity minimum with a 1/T scaling law at low temperatures and a large out-of-plane negative magnetoresistance. Applying an out-of-plane electric field can induce quantum phase transitions at both integer and fractional filling factors. Our studies lay the groundwork for realizing tunable topological states and other unexpected magnetic phases beyond the first moiré flat band based in twisted MoTe2. It may be possible to find non-Abelian electronic states in the higher bands of flat-band materials.

  abstract     = {Silicon-based qubits are often made by trapping individual electrons in quantum dots defined by electric gates. Quantum information can then be stored using the spin states of the electrons. However, the nuclei of the surrounding atoms also have spin degrees of freedom that couple to the electron-spin qubits and cause decoherence. The emergence of a nuclear-spin dark state has been predicted to reduce this coupling during dynamic nuclear polarization, when the electrons in the quantum dot drive the nuclei in the semiconductor into a decoupled state. Here we report the formation of a nuclear-spin dark state in a gate-defined silicon double quantum dot. We show that, as expected, the transverse electron–nuclear coupling rapidly diminishes in the dark state, and that this state depends on the synchronized precession of the nuclear spins. Moreover, the dark state significantly reduces the relaxation rate between the singlet and triplet electronic spin states. This nuclear-spin dark state has potential applications as a quantum memory or in quantum sensing, and might enable increased polarization of nuclear-spin ensembles. Electron qubits in solid-state systems often couple to nuclear spins in the surrounding material, causing decoherence. Now, nuclear spins in silicon have been put into a dark state, which could improve qubit coherence for quantum applications.},

  abstract     = {Dissipation is an unavoidable feature of quantum systems, typically associated with decoherence and the modification of quantum correlations. In the study of strongly correlated quantum matter, we often have to overcome or suppress dissipation to uncover the underlying quantum phenomena. However, here we demonstrate that dissipation can serve as a probe for intrinsic correlations in quantum many-body systems. Applying tunable dissipation in ultracold atomic systems, we observe universal dissipative dynamics in strongly correlated one-dimensional quantum gases. Specifically, we find a universal stretched-exponential decay of the total particle number, where the stretched exponent measures the anomalous dimension of the spectral function—a parameter for characterizing strong quantum fluctuations. This approach offers a versatile framework for probing features of strongly correlated systems, including spin–charge separation and Fermi arcs in quantum materials. Although traditionally considered an obstacle to the study of quantum effects, dissipation has now been shown to enable the measurement of strong quantum fluctuations in one-dimensional atomic gases.},

  abstract     = {Gaining recognition as a physics person by peers is an important contributor to undergraduate students’ physics identity and their success in physics courses. Previous research has separately demonstrated that women perceive less recognition from peers than men in their physics courses (perceived peer recognition) and that women receive fewer nominations from their peers for being strong in their physics course than men (received peer recognition). The relation between perceived and received peer recognition for men and women, however, is not well understood. Here we test three plausible models for this relation and find that, for students receiving the same amount of recognition from peers as measured from private nominations on a survey, women report significantly lower perceived peer recognition than men. We did this by conducting a quantitative study of over 1,700 students enrolled in introductory physics courses at eight institutions in the United States. We directly compare student gender, perceived peer recognition and received peer recognition, controlling for race and ethnicity, academic year and major, and course-level variability. These findings offer important implications for testable instructional interventions. The degree to which students perceive recognition as a physics person from their peers is known to be important. Now, women report lower perceived peer recognition than men, even after controlling for the amount of peer recognition received.},

  abstract     = {The fascinating hypothesis that supercooled water may segregate into two distinct liquid phases, each with unique structures and densities, was first posited in 1992. This idea, initially based on numerical analyses with the ST2 water-like empirical potential, challenged the conventional understanding of water’s phase behaviour at the time and has since intrigued the scientific community. Over the past three decades, advancements in computational modelling—particularly through the advent of data-driven many-body potentials rigorously derived from first principles and augmented by the efficiency of neural networks—have greatly enhanced the accuracy of molecular simulations, enabling the exploration of the phase behaviour of water with unprecedented realism. Our study leverages these computational advances to probe the elusive liquid–liquid transition in supercooled water. Microsecond-long simulations with chemical accuracy, conducted over several years, provide compelling evidence that water indeed exists in two discernibly distinct liquid states at low temperature and high pressure. By pinpointing a realistic estimate for the location of the liquid–liquid critical point at ~198 K and ~1,250 atm, our study not only advances the current understanding of water’s anomalous behaviour but also establishes a basis for experimental validation. Importantly, our simulations indicate that the liquid–liquid critical point falls within temperature and pressure ranges that could potentially be experimentally probed in water nanodroplets, opening up the possibility for direct measurements. A liquid–liquid transition in supercooled water has long been predicted. State-of-the-art simulations now precisely confine the temperature and pressure ranges for this transition, which are found to be within experimental reach.},

  abstract     = {Given the vast differences in interaction details, describing the dynamics of structurally disordered materials in a unified theoretical framework presents a fundamental challenge to condensed-matter physics and materials science. Here we numerically investigate a double-percolation scenario for the two most important relaxation processes of supercooled liquids and glasses, the so-called α and β relaxations. For several simple glass formers, we find that when monitoring the dynamic shear modulus as temperature is lowered from the liquid state, percolation of immobile particles takes place at the temperature locating the α process. Mirroring this, upon continued cooling into the glass state, the mobile-particle percolation transition pinpoints a β process whenever the latter is well separated from the main (α) process. For two-dimensional systems under the same conditions, percolation of mobile and immobile particles occurs nearly simultaneously, and no β relaxation can be identified. Our findings suggest that a general description of glassy dynamics should be based on a percolation perspective. A unified description of the dynamics of structurally disordered materials is challenging. Simulations of model systems now show that percolation theory provides a framework unifying the two most prominent relaxation processes in supercooled liquids and glasses.},

  abstract     = {Particle-like topological structures such as polar skyrmions in ferroelectrics have the potential for application in high-density information storage. Since the polar topologies arise from a complicated competitive energy balance, such non-trivial topological states are difficult to manipulate by applying non-persistent external stimuli, such as bias or strain. Thus, a flexible strategy for manipulating topological polar states is needed to realize ultrahigh-density topological devices. Here we demonstrate that thermal excitation can simultaneously regulate the competition of elastic, electrostatic, polarization gradient and Landau energies to trigger polar topological state switching. By designing the temperature evolution pathways, the individual states that are believed to be unstable or intermediate can now be switched and stabilized. Therefore, our strategy expands the diversity of polar topologies in a single superlattice system. Furthermore, we demonstrate the laser-based thermal local switching of polar solitons ranging from several hundred nanometres to a few topologies. These findings will advance the design of polar topology-based ultrahigh-density storage. Stable manipulation of polar skyrmions is challenging because of the underlying competitive energy scales. Now thermal excitation has been demonstrated to be an effective way to control such topological states.},

  abstract     = {Floquet–Bloch manipulation, achieved by driving a material periodically with a laser pulse, is a method that enables the engineering of electronic and magnetic phases in solids by effectively modifying the structure of their electronic bands. However, the application of Floquet–Bloch manipulation in topological magnetic systems, particularly those with inherent disorder, remains largely unexplored. Here we realize Floquet–Bloch manipulation of the Dirac surface-state mass of the topological antiferromagnet MnBi2Te4. Using time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we show that opposite helicities of mid-infrared circularly polarized light result in substantially different Dirac mass gaps in the antiferromagnetic phase, despite the equilibrium Dirac cone being massless. We explain our findings in terms of a Dirac fermion with a random mass. Our results underscore Floquet–Bloch manipulation as a powerful tool for controlling topology, even in the presence of disorder, and for uncovering properties of materials that may elude conventional probes. Periodic laser light can modify the electronic properties of solids and offers a path to create new material phases. In a topological antiferromagnet, periodic driving with opposite light helicities is now shown to produce distinct Dirac mass gaps.},

  abstract     = {Photo-excited quantum materials can be driven into thermally inaccessible metastable states that exhibit structural, charge, spin, topological and superconducting orders. Metastable states typically emerge on timescales set by the intrinsic electronic and phononic energy scales, ranging from femtoseconds to picoseconds, and can persist for weeks. Therefore, studies have primarily focused on ultrafast or quasi-static limits, leaving the intermediate time window less explored. Here we reveal a metastable state with broken glide-plane symmetry in photo-doped Ca2RuO4 using time-resolved optical second-harmonic generation and birefringence measurements. We find that the metastable state appears long after intralayer antiferromagnetic order has melted and photo-carriers have recombined. Its properties are distinct from all known states in the equilibrium phase diagram and are consistent with intralayer ferromagnetic order. Furthermore, model Hamiltonian calculations reveal that a non-thermal trajectory to this state can be accessed via photo-doping. Our results expand the search space for out-of-equilibrium electronic matter to metastable states emerging at intermediate timescales. Searches for metastable states with properties not found in thermal equilibrium have been restricted to either ultrafast or slow timescales. A metastable state in an intermediate time window has now been identified in a photo-doped Mott insulator.},

  abstract     = {Superconductivity is a common feature of graphite allotropes, having been observed in Bernal bilayers, rhombohedral trilayers and a wide variety of angle-misaligned multilayers. Despite notable differences in the electronic structure of these systems, supporting the graphite on a WSe2 substrate has been consistently observed to expand the range of the superconductivity in terms of carrier density and temperature. Here we report the observation of two distinct superconducting states in Bernal bilayer graphene with strong proximity-induced Ising spin–orbit coupling. Our quantum oscillation measurements show that, although the normal state of the first superconducting phase is consistent with the single-particle band structure, the second emerges from a nematic normal state with broken rotational symmetry. Both superconductors are robust to in-plane magnetic fields, but neither reach fields expected for spin–valley-locked Ising superconductors. The Fermi surface geometry of the first superconducting phase suggests that the superconductivity is limited by orbital depairing arising from the imperfect layer polarization of the electron wavefunctions. Finally, an analysis of transport and thermodynamic compressibility measurements in the second superconducting phase shows that the proximity to isospin phase boundaries, observed in other rhombohedral graphene allotropes, is probably coincidental, thus constraining theories of the pairing mechanisms in these systems. Two regions of superconductivity are observed in the phase diagram of Bernal-stacked bilayer graphene. Spin–orbit coupling induced by the substrate and orbital moments are shown to be important in describing their properties.},

One feature of these phase diagrams is the emergence of microemulsion phases, where regions of different phases self-organize across multiple length scales. The experimental characterization of these microemulsions can pose considerable challenges, as the long-range Coulomb interaction microscopically mingles with the competing states. Here we observe the signatures of the microemulsion between an electronic Wigner crystal and an electron liquid in a MoSe2 monolayer using cryogenic reflectance and magneto-optical spectroscopy. We find that the transition into this microemulsion state is marked by anomalies in exciton reflectance, spin susceptibility and umklapp scattering, establishing it as a distinct phase of electronic matter. Competition between different possible ground states of strongly correlated electron systems can lead to the emergence of mixed states called microemulsions. Now this phenomenon is reported at the melting transition of a Wigner crystal.},

The nature of this density wave order was not clearly identified. Here we probe the magnetic response of the zero-pressure phase of La3Ni2O7–δ as hydrostatic pressure is applied, and find that the apparent single density wave transition at zero applied pressure splits into two. The comparison of our muon-spin rotation and relaxation experiments with dipole-field numerical analysis reveals the magnetic structure’s compatibility with a stripe-type arrangement of Ni moments, characterized by alternating lines of magnetic moments and non-magnetic stripes at ambient pressure. When pressure is applied, the magnetic ordering temperature increases, whereas the unidentified density wave transition temperature falls. Our findings reveal that the ground state of the La3Ni2O7–δ system is characterized by the coexistence of two distinct orders—a magnetically ordered spin density wave and a lower-temperature ordering that is most probably a charge density wave—with a notable pressure-enhanced separation between them. The density wave transition in a superconducting nickelate is shown to split when hydrostatic pressure is applied, indicating that it is composed of both a spin density wave and another form of ordered state.},

  abstract     = {Flat-band moiré graphene systems are a quintessential platform for investigating correlated phases of matter. Various interaction-driven ground states have been proposed, but despite extensive experimental effort, there has been little direct evidence that distinguishes between various phases, in particular near the charge neutrality point. Here we probe the fine details of the density of states and the effects of Coulomb interactions in alternating-twist trilayer graphene by imaging the local thermodynamic quantum oscillations with a nanoscale scanning superconducting quantum interference device. We find that the charging self-energy due to occupied electronic states is most important in explaining the high-carrier-density physics. At half-filling of the conduction flat band, we observe ferromagnetic-driven symmetry breaking, suggesting that it is the most robust mechanism in the hierarchy of phase transitions. Near charge neutrality, where exchange energy dominates over charging self-energy, we find a nematic semimetal ground state, which is theoretically favoured over gapped states in the presence of heterostrain. In this semimetallic phase, the flat-band Dirac cones migrate towards the mini-Brillouin zone centre, spontaneously breaking the threefold rotational symmetry. Our low-field local quantum oscillation technique can be used to explore the ground states of many strongly interacting van der Waals systems. Our understanding of the phase diagram of twisted graphene structures is incomplete. Now, twisted trilayer graphene is examined using a technique that locally images quantum oscillations and shows that a nematic semimetal is favoured at low density.},

  abstract     = {Resolving two or more constantly scattering identical point sources using freely propagating waves is limited by diffraction. Here we show that, by illuminating with a diffraction minimum, a given number of point scatterers can be resolved at distances of small fractions of the wavelength. Specifically, we identify an 8 nm distance, which corresponds to 1/80 of the employed 640 nm wavelength, between two constantly emitting fluorescent molecules in the focal plane of an optical microscope. We also measure 22 nm side length for a quadratic array of four molecules. Moreover, we show that the measurement precision improves with decreasing distance and with increased scatterer density. This work opens up the prospect of resolving individual scatterers in clusters that are far smaller than the wavelength. The central maximum of a diffraction pattern is commonly used to resolve point-like scatterers. Now spatial resolution far below the diffraction limit is achieved by using the scattering minima.},

  abstract     = {Reducing decoherence in quantum computers rapidly decreases the overhead needed to construct a logical qubit from physical qubits. In solid-state systems, a class of defects known as two-level systems is a major source of decoherence. Currently, superconducting qubit experiments reduce dissipation due to the two-level systems by using large device dimensions. However, this approach only provides partial protection and results in a trade-off between qubit size and dissipation. In this work, we instead engineer the interactions between a qubit and the surrounding two-level systems using phononics. We fabricate a superconducting qubit on a phononic-bandgap metamaterial that suppresses phonon emission mediated by the two-level systems. The phonon-engineered bath of two-level systems shows increased lifetime and affects the thermalization dynamics of the qubit. Within the phononic bandgap, we observe the emergence of a non-Markovian qubit behaviour. Combined with qubit miniaturization, our approach could substantially extend the qubit relaxation times. Defects known as two-level systems are a major source of noise for superconducting qubits. Adding a phononic crystal is now shown to extend the lifetime of these two-level systems, which could lead to improved qubit coherence.},

However, the practical cryogenic limitations of operating large numbers of superconducting qubits are becoming a bottleneck for further scaling. Due to the low thermal conductivity and the dense optical multiplexing capacity of telecommunications fibre, converting qubit signal processing to the optical domain using microwave-to-optics transduction would substantially relax the strain on cryogenic space and thermal budgets. Here we demonstrate optical readout of a superconducting transmon qubit through an optical fibre connected via a coaxial cable to a fully integrated piezo-optomechanical transducer. Using a demolition readout technique, we achieve a single-shot readout fidelity of 81%. Our results illustrate the benefits of piezo-optomechanical transduction for low-dissipation operation of large quantum processors. Superconducting qubits are measured using microwaves, posing constraints on its size and thermal budgets.

  abstract     = {The rapid development of superconducting quantum hardware is expected to run into substantial restrictions on scalability because error correction in a cryogenic environment has stringent input–output requirements. Classical data centres rely on fibre-optic interconnects to remove similar networking bottlenecks. In the same spirit, ultracold electro-optic links have been proposed and used to generate qubit control signals, or to replace cryogenic readout electronics. So far, these approaches have suffered from either low efficiency, low bandwidth or additional noise. Here we realize radio-over-fibre qubit readout at millikelvin temperatures. We use one device to simultaneously perform upconversion and downconversion between microwave and optical frequencies and so do not require any active or passive cryogenic microwave equipment. We demonstrate all-optical single-shot readout in a circulator-free readout scheme. Importantly, we do not observe any direct radiation impact on the qubit state, despite the absence of shielding elements. This compatibility between superconducting circuits and telecom-wavelength light is not only a prerequisite to establish modular quantum networks, but it is also relevant for multiplexed readout of superconducting photon detectors and classical superconducting logic. Microwaves are usually used to interact with superconducting qubits, but optical photons can be processed at room temperature. The electro-optical transceiver presented here allows all-optical readout of a qubit without affecting its performance.},

  abstract     = {False vacuum decay—the transition from a metastable quantum state to a true vacuum state—plays an important role in quantum field theory and non-equilibrium phenomena such as phase transitions and dynamical metastability. The non-perturbative nature of false vacuum decay and the limited experimental access to this process make it challenging to study, leaving several open questions regarding how true vacuum bubbles form, move and interact. Here we observe quantized bubble formation in real time, a key feature of false vacuum decay dynamics, using a quantum annealer with 5,564 superconducting flux qubits. We develop an effective model that captures both initial bubble creation and subsequent interactions, and remains accurate under dissipation. The annealer reveals coherent scaling laws in the driven many-body dynamics for more than 1,000 intrinsic qubit time units. This work provides a method for investigating false vacuum dynamics of large quantum systems in quantum annealers. Bubble formation is a signal of false vacuum decay, in which a system transitions from a local energy minimum to a true vacuum. Now, simulations on a quantum annealer show how interactions between bubbles drive the long-time dynamics of this process.},

  abstract     = {Ultrasensitive detection of the frequency, phase and amplitude of radiofrequency electric fields is crucial for applications in radio communication, cosmology, dark matter searches and high-fidelity qubit control. Quantum harmonic oscillator systems, especially trapped ions, offer high-sensitivity electric field sensing with nanometre spatial resolution but are typically restricted to narrow frequency ranges centred around the motional frequency of the trapped-ion oscillator or the frequency of an optical transition in the ion. Here we present a procedure that enables precise electric field detection over an expanded frequency range. Specifically, we use motional Raman transitions in a single trapped ion to achieve sensitivity across a frequency range over 800 times larger than previous approaches. We show that the method is compatible with both quantum amplification via squeezing and measurement in the Fock basis, allowing a demonstration of performance 3.4(2.0) dB below the standard quantum limit. The approach can be extended to other quantum harmonic oscillator systems, such as superconducting qubit–resonator systems. The narrow frequency response of quantum harmonic oscillators typically limits their application in radiofrequency electric field detection. Now motional Raman transitions in trapped ions are shown to enable wideband, high-precision radiofrequency field sensing.},

  abstract     = {Equilibrium phase transitions in many-body systems have been predicted and observed in two and three spatial dimensions but have long been thought not to exist in one-dimensional systems. It was suggested that a phase transition in one dimension can occur in the presence of long-range interactions. However, an experimental realization has so far not been achieved due to the requirement to both realize interactions over sufficiently long distances and to prepare equilibrium states. Here we demonstrate a finite-energy phase transition in one dimension by implementing a long-range interacting model in a trapped-ion quantum simulator. We show that finite-energy states can be generated by time-evolving initial product states and letting them thermalize under the dynamics of a many-body Hamiltonian. By preparing initial states with different energies, we study the finite-energy phase diagram of a long-range interacting quantum system. We observe a ferromagnetic equilibrium phase transition as well as a crossover from a low-energy polarized paramagnet to a high-energy unpolarized paramagnet, in agreement with numerical simulations. Our work presents a scheme for preparing finite-energy states in quantum simulation platforms, enabling access to phases at finite energy density. Long-range interactions have been predicted to enable a phase transition in one-dimensional systems. An experiment now validates this hypothesis in a trapped-ion quantum simulator by observing a finite-energy phase transition in one dimension.},

  abstract     = {Quantum networks require quantum nodes with coherent optical interfaces and several stationary qubits. In terms of optical properties, semiconductor quantum dots are highly compelling, but their adoption as quantum nodes has been impaired by the lack of auxiliary qubits. Here we demonstrate that the dense, always-present, nuclear spin ensemble surrounding a gallium arsenide quantum dot can be used as a functional quantum register. We prepared 13,000 host nuclear spins in a single many-body dark state that acts as a logical state of the register. A second logical state is defined as a single nuclear-magnon excitation, enabling controlled quantum-state transfer between an electron spin qubit in the quantum dot and the nuclear magnonic register. Using SWAP gates, we implemented a full write–store–retrieve-read-out protocol with 68.6(4)% raw overall fidelity and a storage time of 130(16) μs, which could be extended to 20 ms or beyond using dynamical decoupling techniques. Our work establishes how many-body physics can add functionality to quantum devices, in this case transforming quantum dots into multi-qubit quantum nodes with deterministic registers. The thousands of nuclear spins surrounding gallium arsenide quantum dots can interface with electron spin qubits and photons. With quantum engineering, this nuclear spin ensemble becomes a robust register for quantum information storage.},

They can be used to encode error-correctable logical qubits, which has been demonstrated using continuous-variable states in microwave cavities or the motional modes of trapped ions. For example, high-dimensional systems can be used to realize ‘Schrödinger cat’ states, which are superpositions of widely displaced coherent states that can be used to illustrate quantum effects at large scales. Recent proposals have suggested encoding qubits in high-spin atomic nuclei, which are finite-dimensional systems that can host hardware-efficient versions of continuous-variable codes. Here we demonstrate the creation and manipulation of Schrödinger cat states using the spin-7/2 nucleus of an antimony atom embedded in a silicon nanoelectronic device. We use a multi-frequency control scheme to produce spin rotations that preserve the symmetry of the qudit, and we constitute logical Pauli operations for qubits encoded in the Schrödinger cat states. Our work demonstrates the ability to prepare and control non-classical resource states, which is a prerequisite for applications in quantum information processing and quantum error correction, using our scalable, manufacturable semiconductor platform. A large nuclear spin has been successfully placed in a Schrödinger cat state, a superposition of its two most widely separated spin coherent states. This can be used as an error-correctable qubit.},

The theory of higher-order topological dynamics, which combines higher-order interactions with discrete topology and nonlinear dynamics, has the potential to enhance our understanding of complex systems, such as the brain and the climate, and to advance the development of next-generation AI algorithms. This theoretical framework, which goes beyond traditional node-centric descriptions, encodes the dynamics of a network through topological signals—variables assigned not only to nodes but also to edges, triangles and other higher-order cells. Recent findings show that topological signals lead to the emergence of distinct types of dynamical state and collective phenomena, including topological and Dirac synchronization, pattern formation and triadic percolation. These results offer insights into how topology shapes dynamics, how dynamics learns topology and how topology evolves dynamically. This Perspective primarily aims to guide physicists, mathematicians, computer scientists and network scientists through the emerging field of higher-order topological dynamics, while also outlining future research challenges. Higher-order interactions reveal new aspects of the interplay between topology and dynamics in complex systems. This Perspective describes the emerging field of higher-order topological dynamics and discusses the open research questions in the area.},

  abstract     = {Although classical thermal machines power industries and modern living, quantum thermal engines have yet to prove their utility. Here, we demonstrate a useful quantum absorption refrigerator formed from superconducting circuits. We use it to cool a transmon qubit to a temperature lower than that achievable with any one available bath, thereby resetting the qubit to an initial state suitable for quantum computing. The process is driven by a thermal gradient and is autonomous, requiring no external feedback. The refrigerator exploits an engineered three-body interaction between the target qubit and two auxiliary qudits. Each auxiliary qudit is coupled to a physical heat bath, realized with a microwave waveguide populated with synthesized quasithermal radiation. If the target qubit is initially fully excited, its effective temperature reaches a steady-state level of approximately 22 mK, lower than what can be achieved by existing state-of-the-art reset protocols. Our results demonstrate that superconducting circuits with propagating thermal fields can be used to experimentally explore quantum thermodynamics and apply it to quantum information-processing tasks. Resetting qubits in a quantum computer requires significant hardware resources. Now, an experiment demonstrates an on-chip quantum refrigerator that uses a thermal gradient to reset a superconducting qubit more effectively than conventional methods.},

  abstract     = {Gauge theories describe the fundamental forces in the standard model of particle physics and play an important role in condensed-matter physics. The constituents of gauge theories, for example, charged matter and electric gauge field, are governed by local gauge constraints, which lead to key phenomena such as the confinement of particles that are not fully understood. In this context, quantum simulators may address questions that are challenging for classical methods. Although engineering gauge constraints is highly demanding, recent advances in quantum computing are beginning to enable digital quantum simulations of gauge theories. Here we simulate confinement dynamics in a $${{\mathbb{Z}}}_{2}$$ lattice gauge theory on a superconducting quantum processor. Tuning a term that couples only to the electric field produces confinement of charges, a manifestation of the tight bond that the gauge constraint generates between both. Moreover, we show how a modification of the gauge constraint from $${{\mathbb{Z}}}_{2}$$ towards U(1) symmetry freezes the system dynamics. Our work illustrates the restriction that the underlying gauge constraint imposes on the dynamics of a lattice gauge theory, showcases how gauge constraints can be modified and protected, and promotes the study of other models governed by multibody interactions. Gauge theories host important phenomena such as confinement that are difficult to study theoretically. Advances in quantum computers have now made it possible to perform digital quantum simulations of confinement dynamics in a gauge theory.},

These range from semiconductor sensors, in which the Brownian motion of charge carriers poses limits, to optical reference cavities for atomic clocks or gravitational wave detection, which are limited by thermo-refractive and thermo-elastic noise. Here we find that charge-carrier density fluctuations give rise to a noise process in electro-optic photonic integrated circuits. We show that the noise exhibited by lithium niobate and lithium tantalate photonic integrated microresonators feature a frequency scaling to the power of −1.2, deviating from thermo-refractive noise theory. This noise is consistent with thermodynamical charge noise, which leads to electrical field fluctuations that are transduced via the strong Pockels effects of electro-optic materials. Our results establish electrical Johnson–Nyquist noise as the fundamental limitation for electro-optic integrated photonics, crucial for determining performance limits for both classical and quantum devices. Thermal agitation of charge carriers, known as Johnson noise, is the dominant noise in electronic circuits. Now it has also been observed as a key noise source in integrated electro-optic photonic circuits, posing challenges for future applications.},

  abstract     = {Quantum error correction is essential for mitigating hardware errors in quantum computers by encoding logical information into several physical qubits. However, no single error-correcting code intrinsically supports a fault-tolerant implementation of all the gates needed for universal quantum computing. One approach for addressing this problem is to switch between two suitable error-correcting codes that in combination provide a fault-tolerant universal gate set. Here we present the experimental implementation of fault-tolerant code switching between two different codes in a trapped-ion processor. We switch between the 7-qubit colour code, which features fault-tolerant CNOT and H quantum gates, and the 10-qubit code, which allows for a fault-tolerant T gate implementation. Together, these codes form a complementary universal gate set. We construct logical circuits and prepare 12 different logical states that are not accessible natively in a fault-tolerant way within a single code. Finally, we use code switching to entangle two logical qubits using the full universal gate set in a single logical quantum circuit. Our results experimentally demonstrate a route towards deterministic control over logical qubits with low auxiliary qubit overhead and without relying on the probabilistic preparation of resource states. Quantum error correction is essential for reliable quantum computing, but no single code supports all required fault-tolerant gates. The demonstration of switching between two codes now enables universal quantum computation with reduced overhead.},

  abstract     = {Simulations of quantum chemistry and quantum materials are believed to be among the most important applications of quantum information processors. However, realizing practical quantum advantage for such problems is challenging because of the prohibitive computational cost of programming typical problems into quantum hardware. Here we introduce a simulation framework for strongly correlated quantum systems represented by model spin Hamiltonians that uses reconfigurable qubit architectures to simulate real-time dynamics in a programmable way. Our approach also introduces an algorithm for extracting chemically relevant spectral properties via classical co-processing of quantum measurement results. We develop a digital–analogue simulation toolbox for efficient Hamiltonian time evolution using digital Floquet engineering and hardware-optimized multi-qubit operations to accurately realize complex spin–spin interactions. As an example, we propose an implementation based on Rydberg atom arrays. In addition, we show how detailed spectral information can be extracted from the dynamics through snapshot measurements and single-ancilla control, enabling the evaluation of excitation energies and finite-temperature susceptibilities from a single dataset. To illustrate the approach, we show how to use the method to compute key properties of a polynuclear transition-metal catalyst and two-dimensional magnetic materials. Quantum simulations of chemistry and materials are challenging due to the complexity of correlated systems. A framework based on reconfigurable qubit architectures and digital–analogue simulations provides a hardware-efficient path forwards.},

  abstract     = {Malignancies of epithelial tissues, called carcinomas, account for most cancer cases. Research has largely focused on correlating different carcinoma subtypes to genetic alterations. However, as well as a rewiring in the signalling networks, carcinoma progression is accompanied by mechanical changes in the epithelial cells and the extracellular matrix. Here we reveal intricate morphologies in the basement membrane at the onset of bladder cancer and propose that they emerge from a mechanical instability upon epithelial overgrowth. We imaged mouse and human bladder tissue and performed differential growth simulations, and found that stiffness changes in the different mucosa layers can result in aberrant tissue morphologies. The resulting thickening, wrinkles and folds resemble early papillary tumours and carcinomas in situ. Atomic force microscopy confirmed local stiffness changes in the pathological basement membrane. Our findings suggest a possible mechanical origin of the different bladder carcinoma subtypes and may guide future developments in treatment and prophylaxis. Carcinoma subtypes are normally linked to specific genetic alterations, but tissue mechanical changes also play a role. Now, aberrant morphologies resembling bladder carcinoma are shown to emerge from stiffness changes during epithelial overgrowth.},

However, the mechanical signatures that influence the fate of extruding cells remain unknown. Here we show that modified force transmission across adherens junctions inhibits apoptotic cell eliminations. By combining cell experiments with varying levels of E-cadherin junctions and three-dimensional modelling of cell monolayers, we find that these changes not only affect the fate of the extruded cells but also shift extrusion from the apical to the basal side, leading to cell invasion into soft collagen gels. We generalize our findings using xenografts and cysts cultured in matrigel, derived from patients with breast cancer. Our results link intercellular force transmission regulated by cell–cell communication to cell extrusion mechanisms, with potential implications during morphogenesis and invasion of cancer cells. Tissues eliminate unwanted cells through cell extrusion, but the factors determining whether these extuded cells live or die are not fully understood. Now force transmission across adherens junctions is shown to have a role in shaping their fate.},

Here we perform microrheology experiments on concentrated emulsions and measure the storage and loss moduli for a wide range of frequencies. We applied a linear response formalism for microrheology to a soft sphere model that undergoes the jamming transition. We find that the theory quantitatively explains the experiments. Our analysis reveals that the anomalous viscous loss seen in emulsions results from the boson peak, which is a universal vibrational property of amorphous solids and reflects the marginal stability in soft jammed solids. We show that the anomalous viscous loss is universal in systems with various interparticle interactions as it stems from the universal boson peak; it even survives below the jamming density at which thermal fluctuation is pronounced and the dynamics becomes inherently nonlinear. The viscoelastic response of emulsions shows an anomalous loss. This effect is now shown to be related to the boson peak, a universal vibrational feature of amorphous solids.},

Here we investigate motility-driven annealing and fluidization in these systems and establish a correspondence between the yielding behaviour of glassy systems under active dynamics and their yielding under oscillatory shear. The yielded region of the phase diagram correlates with tissue fluidization, whereas the annealing region explains age-related maturation and stiffening. This suggests that some mechanical changes observed in ageing tissues can partially stem from processes analogous to enhanced ageing observed in active glasses. In addition to showing similar yielding diagrams, we strengthen the correspondence to oscillatory shear by demonstrating diverging time scales to steady states, the possibility of memory encoding and reading, and the importance of stress reversals in the annealing process in both cases. Finally, we study yielding in active solids and demonstrate that given the correct geometry, one can either suppress or promote brittle failure via shear band formation by tuning activity. Active glasses are dense, disordered structures made up of motile constituents. Simulations now show that motility-driven annealing in such systems leads to mechanical changes, including increased brittleness.},

Here, we demonstrate variable-phase coupling between two nano-constriction spin Hall nano-oscillators and their mutual synchronization driven by propagating spin waves. Using electrical measurements and phase-resolved micro-focused Brillouin light scattering microscopy, we show that the phase of the mutual synchronization can be tuned by modulating the drive current or the applied field. Our micromagnetic simulations explore the phase tunability using voltage gating. Our results advance the capabilities of mutually synchronized spin Hall nano-oscillators and open the possibilities for applications in spin-wave logic-based devices.

This effect can be realized in two-dimensional moiré systems hosting flat electronic bands but is not usually seen in inversion-symmetric materials. Here, we show that this physics is manifested in helical trilayer graphene—three graphene layers, each twisted in sequence by the same angle—although the system retains global in-plane inversion symmetry. We uncover a phase diagram of correlated and magnetic states at a magic twist angle of 1.8∘, which is explained by a lattice relaxation that leads to the formation of large periodic domains where in-plane inversion symmetry is broken on the moiré scale. Each domain harbours flat topological bands with opposite Chern numbers in the two valleys. We find correlated states at multiple integer and fractional electron fillings per moiré unit cell and an AHE at a subset of them. The AHE disappears above a critical electric displacement field at one electron per unit cell, indicating a topological phase transition. We establish helical trilayer graphene as a platform that presents an opportunity to engineer topology due to its emergent moiré-scale symmetries. Trilayer graphene with the layers consecutively twisted by the same angle is shown to be a platform in which correlated and topological states exist, driven by local lattice relaxations.},

  abstract     = {Helices and spirals, prevalent across various physical systems, play a crucial role in characterizing symmetry, describing dynamics and enabling unique functionalities, all stemming from their inherent simplicity and chiral nature. Helical excitations on quantized vortices, referred to as Kelvin waves, are one example of such a physical system. Kelvin waves play a vital role in energy dissipation within inviscid quantum fluids. However, deliberately exciting Kelvin waves has proven to be challenging. Here we introduce a controlled method for exciting Kelvin waves on a quantized vortex in superfluid helium-4. We used a charged nanoparticle that oscillates when driven by a time-varying electric field to stimulate Kelvin waves on the vortex. Confirmation of the helical nature of Kelvin waves was achieved through three-dimensional image reconstruction, which provided visual evidence of their complex dynamics. Additionally, we determined the dispersion relation and the phase velocity of the Kelvin wave and identified the vorticity direction, thus enhancing our understanding of quantum fluid behaviour. This work elucidates the dynamics of Kelvin waves and initiates an approach for manipulating and observing quantized vortices in three dimensions, thereby opening avenues for exploring quantum fluidic systems. In classical hydrodynamics, Kelvin waves refer to helically vibrating normal modes. Experiments now show that quantum analogues of Kelvin waves can be excited in superfluid helium-4.},

A key phenomenon in certain flat-band systems is Aharonov–Bohm caging, where particles become localized due to destructive interference caused by gauge fields. Here we report on the experimental realization of highly tunable flat-band models populated by strongly interacting Rydberg atoms. By employing synthetic dimensions, we engineer a flat-band rhombic lattice with twisted boundaries and explore the control of Aharonov–Bohm caging during non-equilibrium dynamics through a tunable gauge field. Microscopic measurements of Rydberg pairs reveal the interaction-driven breakdown of Aharonov–Bohm caging in the limit of strong dipolar interactions, where lattice bands mix. In the limit of weak interactions, where caging persists, we observe effective magnetism arising from the interaction-driven mixing of degenerate flat-band states. These observations offer insights into emergent phenomena in synthetic quantum materials and expand our understanding of quantum many-body physics in engineered lattice systems. The effect of strong interactions on the physics hosted by flat bands remains largely unexplored in atomic systems.

Here we demonstrate an all-optical Joule–Thomson expansion process mediated by photon–photon interactions whereby the temperature of the optical gas drops abruptly to zero. Our experiments in various configurations of coupled multicore nonlinear waveguide arrangements illustrate how light undergoing expansion-induced cooling can be channelled from arbitrary input states into the fundamental mode with near-unity efficiency. We show that the stability of the post-expansion state is ensured through an irreversible process of energy conversion. The all-optical thermodynamic phenomena explored in this study may enable innovative techniques where various uncorrelated but identical sources are merged into a unified spatially coherent state, offering a route for direct beam combining. An optical thermodynamic framework can describe the complex dynamics in highly multimodal systems.

  abstract     = {Counterflow superfluidity is an anomalous quantum phase that was predicted two decades ago in the context of a two-component Bose–Hubbard model. In this phase, although both components exhibit fluidity, their correlated counterflow currents cancel each other out, resulting in the system behaving as an incompressible Mott insulator. However, realizing and identifying this phase experimentally has proven challenging due to the stringent requirements for a single set-up, including defect-free state preparation, minimal heating during coherent manipulations, and spin- and site-resolved detection of the phases. Here, we report on the observation of counterflow superfluidity in a binary Bose mixture in optical lattices. After preparing a low-entropy spin-Mott state by conveying two spin-1/2 bosonic atoms at every single lattice site to form a doublon, we adiabatically drove the system to the counterflow superfluid phase at approximately 1 nK. We observed features of antipair correlations through site- and spin-resolved quantum-gas microscopy in both real and momentum spaces. Finally, we measured long-range off-diagonal spin correlations in the rotated basis, revealing a correlation length approaching the system size. These techniques and observations demonstrated here provide accessibility to Borromean counterfluids. Counterflow superfluidity is a quantum phase in which two fluid components flow in opposite directions without resistance, cancelling out their overall combined motion. This phase has now been observed in an optical lattice system hosting Bose mixtures.},

  abstract     = {The antimatter equivalent of atomic hydrogen—antihydrogen—is an outstanding testbed for precision studies of matter–antimatter symmetry. Here we report on the simultaneous observation of both accessible hyperfine components of the 1S–2S transition in trapped antihydrogen. We determine the 2S hyperfine splitting in antihydrogen and—by comparing our results with those obtained in hydrogen—constrain the charge–parity–time-reversal symmetry-violating coefficients in the standard model extension framework. Our experimental protocol allows the characterization of the relevant spectral lines in 1 day, representing a 70-fold improvement in the data-taking rate. We show that the spectroscopy is applicable to laser-cooled antihydrogen with important implications for future tests of fundamental symmetries. The ALPHA Collaboration reports measurements of the hyperfine components of the 1S–2S transition in trapped antihydrogen. They interpret the results as a test of the invariance of charge–parity–time-reversal symmetry.},

  abstract     = {Recent theoretical and experimental breakthroughs have given rise to the emerging field of free-electron quantum optics, reshaping the understanding of free-electron physics. Traditionally rooted in classical electrodynamics, this field now reveals quantum-mechanical features that necessitate the frameworks of quantum electrodynamics and quantum optics. This shift compels a re-evaluation of well-established areas, bringing quantum-mechanical corrections to accelerator science and to electron-radiation phenomena. Simultaneously, the ability to shape single-electron wavefunctions opens new possibilities in microscopy and spectroscopy. These developments are primarily driven by innovations in electron microscopy and its intersection with laser science, where laser-driven electron modulation substantially influences quantum electron interactions with light and matter. In this Perspective, we review these developments, highlighting the current challenges and future opportunities. We explore the role of the free electron as a quantum resource, complementing conventional two-level systems and harmonic oscillators. In the coming years, free electrons may offer new modalities for reading and writing quantum information on ultrafast timescales, performing quantum-state tomography, and ultrafast quantum gates on the atomic scale. Free-electron quantum optics is an emerging field that requires a quantum-mechanical description of both the electronic and the optical contributions. This Perspective summarizes recent developments and discusses challenges and opportunities.},

However, future quantum computing architectures are likely to require interaction mechanisms between qubits across a range of length scales. In this work, we demonstrate a coherent interaction between two semiconductor spin qubits 250 μm apart using a superconducting resonator. This separation is several orders of magnitude larger than for the commonly used direct interaction mechanisms in this platform. We operate the system in a regime in which the resonator mediates a spin–spin coupling through virtual photons. We report the anti-phase oscillations of the populations of the two spins with controllable frequency. The observations are consistent with iSWAP oscillations of the spin qubits, and suggest that entangling operations are possible in 10 ns. These results hold promise for scalable networks of spin qubit modules on a chip. Coupling semiconductor spin qubits over long distances using a superconducting resonator makes different quantum architectures possible. Now, the coherent swapping of quantum states has been observed between qubits coupled using this design.},

Here we demonstrate the generation of the simplest long-range order—Ising order—using a measurement-based protocol on 54 system qubits in the presence of coherent and incoherent errors. We implement a constant-depth preparation protocol that uses classical decoding of measurements to identify long-range order that is otherwise hidden by the randomness of quantum measurements. By experimentally tuning the error rates, we demonstrate the stability of this decoded long-range order in two spatial dimensions, up to a critical phase transition belonging to the unusual Nishimori universality class. Although in classical systems Nishimori physics requires fine-tuning multiple parameters, here it arises as a direct result of the Born rule for measurement probabilities. Our study demonstrates the emergent phenomena that can be explored on quantum processors beyond a hundred qubits. Measurements combined with post-processing of their outcomes can be used to prepare ordered quantum states. It has been shown that they can drive a Nishimori phase transition into a disordered state even in the presence of quantum errors.},

  abstract     = {The topological θ-angle is central to several gauge theories in condensed-matter and high-energy physics. For example, it is responsible for the strong CP problem in quantum chromodynamics and can emerge in effective theories of electrodynamics in topological insulators. Although analogue quantum simulators potentially offer a venue for realizing and controlling the θ-angle, doing so has hitherto remained an outstanding challenge. Here, we describe the experimental realization of a tunable topological θ-angle in a Bose–Hubbard gauge-theory quantum simulator, which was implemented through a tilted superlattice potential that induces an effective background electric field. We demonstrate the emerging physics through the direct observation of the confinement–deconfinement transition of (1 + 1)-dimensional quantum electrodynamics. Using an atomic-precision quantum gas microscope, we distinguish between the confined and deconfined phases by monitoring the real-time evolution of particle–antiparticle pairs. Our work provides a step forward in the realization of topological terms on modern quantum simulators. Topological terms arise naturally in gauge theories but have been difficult to implement in quantum simulators. Now, a tunable topological θ-angle is demonstrated with a cold-atom platform.},

  abstract     = {Vorticity, a measure of the local rate of rotation of a fluid element, is the driver of incompressible flow. In viscous fluids, powering bulk flows requires the continuous injection of vorticity from boundaries to counteract the diffusive effects of viscosity. Here we power a flow from within by suspending approximately cylindrical particles and magnetically driving them to rotate at Reynolds numbers in the intermediate range. We find that a single particle generates a localized three-dimensional region of vorticity around it—which we call a vortlet—that drives a number of remarkable behaviours. Slight asymmetries in the particle shape can deform the vortlet and cause the particle to self-propel. Interactions between vortlets are similarly rich, generating bound dynamical states. When a large number of vortlets interact, they spontaneously form collectively moving flocks. These flocks remain coherent while propelling, splitting and merging. If enough particles are added so as to saturate the flow chamber, a homogeneous three-dimensional active chiral fluid of vortlets is formed, which can be manipulated with gravity or flow chamber boundaries, leading to lively collective dynamics. Our findings demonstrate an inertial regime for synthetic active matter, provide a controlled physical system for the quantitative study of three-dimensional flocking in non-sentient systems and establish a platform for the study of three-dimensional active chiral fluids. A particle rotating in a fluid generates vorticity around itself. Now the dynamics of a collective of such spinners suspended in a liquid is shown to display flocking and three-dimensional active chirality.},

  abstract     = {A dynamical rearrangement in the electronic structure of a molecule can be driven by different phenomena, including nuclear motion, electronic coherence or electron correlation. Recording such electronic dynamics and identifying its fate in an aqueous solution has remained a challenge. Here, we reveal the electronic dynamics induced by electronic relaxation through conical intersections in both isolated and solvated pyrazine molecules using X-ray spectroscopy. We show that the ensuing created dynamics corresponds to a cyclic rearrangement of the electronic structure around the aromatic ring. Furthermore, we found that such electronic dynamics were entirely suppressed when pyrazine was dissolved in water. Our observations confirm that conical intersections can create electronic dynamics that are not directly excited by the pump pulse and that aqueous solvation can dephase them in less than 40 fs. These results have implications for the investigation of electronic dynamics created during light-induced molecular dynamics and shed light on their susceptibility to aqueous solvation. Tracking ultrafast electronic changes in molecules is challenging, especially in liquids. An X-ray spectroscopy study in pyrazine now shows electronic dynamics created at conical intersections that are rapidly suppressed when the molecule is in water.},

  abstract     = {A classical particle moving in a periodic potential can localize inside a single potential minimum, but a quantum particle forms extended states by tunnelling to neighbouring minima. These two limits are separated by a quantum Schmid–Bulgadaev phase transition driven by a viscous friction force. This physics has implications for Josephson junction devices, which feature superconducting phase dynamics that can be modelled by a fictitious particle in a periodic potential. As a result, it has been anticipated that any junction of two superconductors connected to a resistor can undergo a Schmid–Bulgadaev transition when the value of the resistor exceeds a threshold. Here we observe this transition by implementing the ohmic environment as a massively multimode cavity and probing the effect of the junction on the standing-wave mode spectrum of the cavity. We find that, depending on the characteristic impedance of the cavity, sufficiently weak junctions scatter cavity photons as either inductors or capacitors. These regimes correspond to the superconducting and insulating phases, respectively, and the critical impedance matches the expected value. At the phase boundary, quantum fluctuations boost the junction nonlinearity so that the junction behaves as a resistor. This loss mechanism reconciles the superconducting and insulating phases and provides a possibly useful indication of quantum-critical dynamics. Josephson junctions are expected to transition from superconducting to insulating behaviour depending on the impedance of their environment. This Schmid–Bulgadaev transition has now been observed by probing the effect of a junction on its environment.},

  abstract     = {Perovskites with the generic composition ABO3 exhibit an enormous variety of quantum states, such as orbital order, magnetism and superconductivity. Their flexible and comparatively simple structure allows for straightforward chemical substitution and cube-on-cube combination of different compounds in atomically sharp epitaxial heterostructures. Many of the diverse physical properties of perovskites are determined by small deviations from the ideal cubic perovskite structure, which are challenging to control. Here we show that directional imprinting of atomic displacements in the antiferromagnetic Mott insulator YVO3 can be achieved by depositing epitaxial films on different facets of the same isostructural substrate. These facets were chosen such that other well-known control parameters, including lattice and polarity mismatch with the overlayer, remain nearly unchanged. We observe signatures of staggered orbital and magnetic order and demonstrate distinct spin–orbital ordering patterns on different facets. We attribute these results to the influence of specific octahedral rotation and cation displacement patterns, which are imprinted by the substrate facet, on the covalency of the bonds and the superexchange interactions in YVO3. Our results show that substrate-induced templating of lattice distortion patterns constitutes a pathway for materials design beyond established strain-engineering strategies. Different facets of an orthorhombic substrate can stabilize different ordering patterns in a perovskite oxide, even in the absence of differences in strain and polarity mismatches.},

  abstract     = {Superionic materials represent a regime intermediate between the crystalline and liquid states of matter. Despite the considerable interest in potential applications for solid-state batteries or thermoelectric devices, it remains unclear whether the fast ionic diffusion observed in superionic materials reflects liquid-like dynamics or whether the hops of mobile ions are inherently coupled to more conventional lattice phonons. Here we reveal a crossover from crystalline vibrations to relaxational dynamics of ionic diffusion in the superionic compound Li6PS5Cl, a candidate solid-state electrolyte. By combining inelastic and quasi-elastic neutron-scattering measurements with first-principles-based machine-learned molecular dynamics simulations, we found that the vibrational density of states in the superionic state strongly deviates from the quadratic behaviour expected from the Debye law of lattice dynamics. The superionic dynamics emerges from overdamped phonon quasiparticles to give rise to a linear density of states characteristic of instantaneous normal modes in the liquid state. Further, we showed that the coupling of lattice phonons with a dynamic breathing of the Li+ diffusion bottleneck enables an order-of-magnitude increase in diffusivity. Thus, our results shed insights into superionics for future energy storage and conversion technologies. Understanding the mechanism of ionic diffusion in superionic materials is crucial for their potential applications in solid-state batteries. Now liquid-like dynamics that break the Debye law of lattice dynamics have been demonstrated in a lithium electrolyte.},

  abstract     = {Understanding the geometric properties of quantum states and their implications in fundamental physical phenomena is a core aspect of contemporary physics. The quantum geometric tensor (QGT) is a central physical object in this regard, encoding complete information about the geometry of the quantum state. The imaginary part of the QGT is the well-known Berry curvature, which plays an integral role in the topological magnetoelectric and optoelectronic phenomena. The real part of the QGT is the quantum metric, whose importance has come to prominence recently, giving rise to a new set of quantum geometric phenomena such as anomalous Landau levels, flat band superfluidity, excitonic Lamb shifts and nonlinear Hall effect. Despite the central importance of the QGT, its experimental measurements have been restricted only to artificial two-level systems. Here, we develop a framework to measure the QGT in crystalline solids using polarization-, spin- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. Using this framework, we demonstrate the effective reconstruction of the QGT in the kagome metal CoSn, which hosts topological flat bands. Establishing this momentum- and energy-resolved spectroscopic probe of the QGT is poised to significantly advance our understanding of quantum geometric responses in a wide range of crystalline systems. Experiments that directly probe the quantum geometric tensor in solids have not been reported. Now, the quantum metric and spin Berry curvature—dual components of the quantum geometric tensor—have been simultaneously measured in reciprocal space.},

  abstract     = {Continuous quantum phase transitions are widely assumed and frequently observed in various systems of quantum particles or spins. Their characteristic trait is a second-order, gradual suppression of the order parameter as the quantum critical point is approached. The localization of Cooper pairs in disordered superconductors and the resulting breakdown of superconductivity have long stood as a prototypical example. Here we show a departure from this paradigm, in which a discontinuous first-order quantum phase transition is tuned by disorder. We measure the plasmon spectrum in superconducting microwave resonators on amorphous superconducting films of indium oxide to provide evidence for a marked jump in both the zero-temperature superfluid stiffness and the transition temperature at the critical disorder. This discontinuous transition sheds light on the role of repulsive interactions between Cooper pairs and the subsequent competition between superconductivity and insulating Cooper-pair glass. Furthermore, we show that the critical temperature of the films no longer relates to the pairing amplitude but aligns with the superfluid stiffness, consistent with the pseudogap regime of preformed Cooper pairs. Our findings raise fundamental new questions about the role of disorder in quantum phase transitions and carry implications for superinductances in quantum circuits. A first-order, disorder-driven, superconductor–insulator phase transition is demonstrated. This is in contrast with the usually observed second-order transition and highlights the role of Coulomb interactions between preformed Cooper pairs.},

  abstract     = {A fundamental obstacle to understanding high-temperature superconducting cuprates is that the occurrence of superconductivity hinders the observation of the normal-state properties at low temperature. One important property illustrating this issue is the spin susceptibility: its decrease upon cooling in the normal state is considered as evidence of pseudogap behaviour. However, unambiguous interpretation of this decrease has been impossible, as the crucial low-temperature data inevitably reflect the superconducting pairing rather than the normal state. Here we measure the spin susceptibility of YBa2Cu3Oy at low temperature while suppressing superconductivity in high magnetic field. We found that there are two thermally activated contributions, each of which comes from a different gap, alongside a residual component due to gapless excitations. We relate these two distinct gaps to short-range charge density waves and to the formation of singlets, as occurs in certain quantum spin systems. Both phenomena contribute to the pseudogap at low temperature, supplementing the short-lived antiferromagnetism that initiates pseudogap behaviour at high temperatures. We, therefore, propose that the pseudogap should be regarded as a composite property and that, when not undergoing spin-stripe ordering, underdoped cuprates tend to form short-range spin singlets. Measurements of the spin susceptibility in a model cuprate reveal the presence of two distinct gaps underlying the pseudogap behaviour. One gap is attributed to charge density waves and the other to the predicted formation of spin singlets.},

  abstract     = {Nematic phases, in which electrons in a solid spontaneously break rotational symmetry while preserving translational symmetry, exist in several families of unconventional superconductors. Superconductivity mediated by nematic fluctuations is well established theoretically, but it has yet to be unambiguously identified experimentally. One major challenge is that nematicity is often intertwined with other degrees of freedom, such as magnetism and charge order. The FeSe1−xSx family of superconductors provides an opportunity to explore this concept, as it features an isolated nematic phase that can be suppressed by sulfur substitution at a quantum critical point where the nematic fluctuations are the largest. Here we determine the momentum structure of the superconducting gap near the centre of the Brillouin zone in FeSe0.81S0.19—close to the quantum critical point—and find that it is anisotropic and nearly nodal. The gap minima occur in a direction that is rotated 45° with respect to the Fe–Fe direction, unlike the usual isotropic gaps due to spin-mediated pairing in other tetragonal Fe-based superconductors. Instead, we find that the gap structure agrees with theoretical predictions for superconductivity mediated by nematic fluctuations, indicating a change in the pairing mechanism across the phase diagram of FeSe1−xSx. Superconductivity that is mediated by fluctuations of a nematic electronic order has not been experimentally demonstrated. Now an analysis of the symmetry of the superconducting gap in doped FeSe provides evidence of this phenomenon.},

However, in frustrated magnets it remains difficult to establish convincing experimental evidence for quantum spin liquid ground states and their fractional excitations. Here we study the time-dependent magnetic response of the candidate quantum spin ice material Ce2Sn2O7. We find a gapped spectrum that features a threshold and peaks that match theories for pair production and propagation of fractional matter excitations strongly coupled to a background quantum electrodynamic field. The multiple peaks in our neutron spectroscopy data are a specific signature of the so-called π-flux phase of quantum spin ice, providing spectroscopic evidence for fractionalization in a three-dimensional quantum spin liquid.

Phonons often act as a source of noise and decoherence when solid-state quantum systems interact with the phonon bath of their host matrix. In this study, we demonstrate the ability to control the phononic local density of states of the host matrix using phononic crystals and measure its positive impact on single quantum systems. We design and fabricate diamond phononic crystals with features down to around 20 nm, resulting in a high-frequency complete phononic bandgap from 50 to 70 GHz. The engineered local density of states is probed using single silicon-vacancy colour centres embedded in the phononic crystals. We observe an 18-fold reduction in the phonon-induced orbital relaxation rate of the emitters compared to bulk, thereby demonstrating that the phononic crystal suppresses spontaneous single-phonon processes. Furthermore, we show that our approach can efficiently suppress single-phonon–emitter interactions up to 20 K, allowing the investigation of multi-phonon processes in the emitters. Our results represent an important step towards the realization of efficient phonon–emitter interfaces that can be used for quantum acoustodynamics and quantum phononic networks. The phonon density of states in diamond is engineered using phononic crystals to suppress single-phonon processes that induce decoherence in individual quantum emitters.},

By preparing and manipulating arrays of emitters hosting weakly and strongly interacting many-body phases of excitations, we demonstrate directional collective emission and study the interplay between retardation and super- and subradiant dynamics. Moreover, we directly observe the spontaneous buildup of coherence among emitters. Our results on collective radiative dynamics establish ultracold matter waves as a versatile tool for studying many-body quantum optics in spatially extended and ordered systems. Experiments on cooperative radiative decay typically involve rapidly escaping photons. Collective emission dynamics have now been studied in an array of quantum emitters interacting via atomic matter waves in a novel regime of slow propagation.},

  abstract     = {Ultracold quantum gases play a pivotal role in many-body physics, quantum sensing and quantum simulation. Over time, methods such as evaporative cooling in bulk ensembles and precision laser-cooling have been employed to effectively achieve quantum degeneracy in atomic gases. A simpler and more rapid way to form quantum gases would, thus, hold considerable promise in advancing the field. Here, we report the creation of a quantum gas by cooling individual rubidium atoms pinned in a three-dimensional optical lattice using electromagnetically induced transparency and adiabatic expansion. After just 10 ms of cooling, we verified the phase transition from a thermal to a quantum gas by adiabatically transferring the atoms to optical dipole traps. We observed the collapse of atoms in three-dimensional traps, a distinctive hallmark of a quantum gas with negative scattering length. Additionally, in a one-dimensional optical trap, we observed the emergence of a stable and strongly correlated quantum gas. Our results introduce a versatile and fast approach to achieving quantum degenerate gases with minimal time and resource requirements. Current methods for directly cooling atomic gases to quantum degeneracy involve time-consuming steps. A method based on electromagnetically induced transparency now achieves quantum degeneracy with a notable reduction in preparation time.},

  abstract     = {Strongly correlated quantum matter, such as interacting electron systems or interacting quantum fluids, exhibits properties that defy explanation in terms of linear fluctuations and free quasiparticles. In these systems, quantum fluctuations are large and generically display non-Gaussian statistics—a property captured only by inspecting high-order correlations, whose quantitative reconstruction presents a challenge for both experiments and theory. A prime example of correlated quantum matter is the strongly interacting Bose fluid, realized first in superfluid helium and, more recently, in ultracold atoms. Here, we experimentally study interacting Bose gases from the weakly to the strongly interacting regime through single-atom-resolved correlations in momentum space. We find that the Bogoliubov pairing among modes of opposite momenta, characteristic of the weakly interacting regime, is suppressed as interactions grow. This departure from the predictions of Bogoliubov theory marks the onset of the strongly correlated regime, as confirmed by numerical simulations that highlight the role of nonlinear quantum fluctuations in our system. Furthermore, our measurements reveal a non-zero four-operator cumulant at even stronger interactions, which is a direct signature of non-Gaussian correlations. These results shed light on the emergence and physical origin of non-Gaussian correlations in ensembles of interacting bosons. In strongly correlated systems, weak interactions can lead to the formation of correlated pairs of bosons with opposite momenta. Now, an experiment on ultracold bosons shows the breakdown of this effect in the strong interaction regime.},

  abstract     = {Hydrodynamics is a successful framework for effectively describing the dynamics of complex many-body systems, ranging from subnuclear to cosmological scales. It applies coarse-grained assumptions about the microscopic constituents of a system to define macroscopic fluid cells, which are large compared to the interparticle spacing and mean free path. In high-energy heavy-ion collisions, hydrodynamic behaviour is inferred from the observation of elliptic flow, which is the elliptical deformation of the particle momentum distribution. Here we demonstrate the emergence of elliptic flow in a mesoscopic system with a few strongly interacting ultracold atoms. In our system, a hydrodynamic description is a priori not applicable, as all relevant length scales—the system size, the interparticle spacing and the mean free path—are comparable. The single-particle resolution and the deterministic control over the number of particles and interaction strength in our experiment allow us to explore the boundaries between a microscopic description and a hydrodynamic framework, and we show that elliptic flow appears as an interaction-driven effect. Our results demonstrate the emergence of collective behaviour in a regime where hydrodynamics is not usually applicable. Hydrodynamics can describe the collective behaviour of many-body systems when all the relevant length scales are separable. Now, an experiment with ultracold atoms shows signatures of hydrodynamic behaviour in a regime where length scales are comparable.},

  abstract     = {The most efficient and promising operational regime for the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor tokamak is the high-confinement mode. In this regime, however, periodic relaxations of the plasma edge can occur. These edge-localized modes pose a threat to the integrity of the fusion device. Here we reveal the strong impact of energetic ions on the spatio-temporal structure of edge-localized modes in tokamaks using nonlinear hybrid kinetic–magnetohydrodynamic simulations. A resonant interaction between the fast ions at the plasma edge and the electromagnetic perturbations from the edge-localized mode leads to an energy and momentum exchange. Energetic ions modify, for example, the amplitude, frequency spectrum and crash timing of edge-localized modes. The simulations reproduce some observations that feature abrupt and large edge-localized mode crashes. The results indicate that, in the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor, a strong interaction between the fusion-born alpha particles and ions from neutral beam injection, a main heating and fast particle source, is expected with predicted edge-localized mode perturbations. This work advances the understanding of the physics underlying edge-localized mode crashes in the presence of energetic particles and highlights the importance of including energetic ion kinetic effects in the optimization of edge-localized mode control techniques and regimes that are free of such modes. Edge-localized plasma modes in a tokamak can damage its innermost wall. Simulations now show that fast ions can modify the spatio-temporal structure of these modes. These effects need to be considered in the optimization of control techniques.},

  abstract     = {In recent decades, rare-isotope facilities have enabled the study of short-lived, neutron-rich nuclei. Their measured properties indicate that shell structure changes in the regime of unbalanced neutron-to-proton ratios compared with that of stable nuclei. In the so-called islands of inversion in the nuclear chart—around the neutron-rich nuclei 32Mg, 42Si and 64Cr, for example—the textbook shell model predicts spherical shapes due to the respective magic neutron numbers of 20, 28 and 40 of these nuclei. However, nuclei in these regions turn out to be deformed in their ground states. Another hallmark of these islands is shape coexistence, where a nucleus assumes different shapes with excitation energy. Here we present evidence for this phenomenon from the observation of an excited 0+ state in 62Cr, two neutrons away from the heart of the island of inversion around neutron number N = 40. We use large-scale shell-model calculations to interpret the results, and we report extrapolations for the doubly magic nucleus 60Ca. Islands of inversions are regions of the nuclear chart where deformed configurations are energetically favoured over spherical ones. Now experiments show that 62Cr assumes different shapes with excitation energy, which is a signature of such islands.},

  abstract     = {Gauge theories constitute the basis of the Standard Model and provide useful descriptions of various phenomena in condensed matter. Realizing gauge theories on tunable tabletop quantum devices such as cold-atom quantum simulators offers the possibility to study their dynamics from first principles and to probe effects that are out of reach of dedicated particle colliders, such as deviations from gauge invariance. These quantum simulators can potentially provide insights into high-energy and nuclear physics questions, while also serving as a versatile tool for the exploration of topological phases and ergodicity-breaking mechanisms relevant to low-energy many-body physics. Recent years have seen substantial progress in the implementation of (1 + 1)D Abelian gauge theories using ultracold atoms. In this Review, we chronicle these advances, highlighting key developments in stabilizing gauge invariance and scaling up from basic building blocks to large-scale realizations where gauge-theory phenomena can be probed. We offer an outlook on future directions and the requirements for advancing this technology to the next level. Large-scale quantum simulations of gauge theories are relevant to high-energy and condensed matter physics.
