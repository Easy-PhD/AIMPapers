  abstract     = {Messenger RNA (mRNA) therapeutics are a promising strategy to combat diverse diseases. Traditional lipid nanoparticle (LNP) formulations for mRNA delivery contain poly(ethylene) glycol (PEG), a polymer widely used in drug delivery carriers but that recently has been associated with efficacy and immunogenicity concerns. Here we report poly(carboxybetaine) (PCB) lipids as surrogates for PEG-lipids used in mRNA formulations. In vitro studies with immortalized and primary cells show that PCB-containing LNPs have higher mRNA transfection efficiency than PEG-containing LNPs across different formulations. Moreover, primary cell engineering and in vivo immunization studies in mice further demonstrate greater therapeutic efficacy of PCB-containing LNPs over their PEG counterparts. Mechanistic assays show that this improvement is attributed to enhanced endosomal escape of PCB-containing LNPs. These formulations exhibit a safe immunotoxicity profile and effectively mitigate the accelerated blood clearance effect that has been observed for PEG-containing LNPs, enabling repeated administrations without efficacy loss. Overall, these findings highlight PCB-containing LNPs as a potent and safe mRNA delivery platform for clinical applications. Poly(carboxybetaine) lipids enhance mRNA lipid nanoparticles efficacy and reduce their immunogenicity, being promising alternatives to poly(ethylene) glycol lipids used in traditional mRNA lipid nanoparticle formulations.},

  abstract     = {Messenger RNA lipid-nanoparticle-based therapies represent an emerging class of medicines for a variety of applications. However, anti-poly(ethylene glycol) (anti-PEG) antibodies generated by widely used PEGylated medicines and lipid nanoparticles hinder therapeutic efficacy upon repeated dosing. Here we report the chemical design, synthesis and optimization of high-density brush-shaped polymer lipids that reduce anti-PEG antibody binding to improve protein production consistency in repeated dosing. Brush-shaped polymer lipid parameters, including side chain length, degree of polymerization, anchor alkyl length and surface regimes on lipid nanoparticles modulate anti-PEG antibody binding affinity and control their blood circulation pharmacokinetics. Compared to widely used 1,2-dimyristoyl-rac-glycero-3-methoxypolyethylene glycol-2000, lipid nanoparticles containing brush-shaped polymer lipids generate superior therapeutic outcomes in protein replacement therapy and genome editing models, reformulating structure–activity guidelines for the design of PEG lipid substitutes. Overall, these findings contribute to the general effort in the development of lipid nanoparticles with low immunogenicity to overcome current roadblocks to nucleic acid medicines.

  abstract     = {The advent of mRNA vaccines represents a breakthrough in the realm of cancer therapy and the prevention of infectious disease. Nevertheless, traditional lipid nanoparticle (LNP)-based mRNA vaccines can accumulate in the liver post-intramuscular injection, posing a risk of hepatotoxicity and reducing efficacy. Here we develop an albumin-recruiting LNP system with high lymphatic drainage and no accumulation in hepatic tissue to potentiate the efficacy and safety of mRNA vaccines. We construct a library of ionizable lipids with albumin-binding capacity as alternatives to traditional polyethylene-glycol-conjugated lipid. We identify an Evans blue-modified lipid-based LNP (EB-LNP) formulation that shows high in vivo expression, albumin-facilitated transport through intramuscular lymphatic vessels to the lymph nodes, high internalization by dendritic cells and low penetration into intramuscular blood vessels, thereby avoiding liver accumulation. EB-LNP-based mRNA vaccines demonstrate excellent antitumour and antiviral efficacy, resulting in strong cellular and humoral immune responses, including the robust activation of cytotoxic T lymphocytes and production of neutralizing antibodies post-vaccination. Overall, this system shows promise as an effective and minimally toxic platform for the development of mRNA vaccines with high efficacy and safety. Ionizable lipids containing albumin-binding motifs are used in lipid-nanoparticle-based mRNA vaccines, facilitating lymph node enrichment and dendritic cell internalization to potentiate their efficacy and avoiding liver accumulation.},

  abstract     = {Within most tissues, the extracellular microenvironment provides mechanical cues that guide cell fate and function. Changes in the extracellular matrix such as aberrant deposition, densification and increased crosslinking are hallmarks of late-stage fibrotic diseases that often lead to organ dysfunction. Biomaterials have been widely used to mimic the mechanical properties of the fibrotic matrix and study pathophysiologic cell function. However, the initiation of fibrosis has largely been overlooked, due to challenges in recapitulating early stages of disease progression within the native extracellular microenvironment. Here, using visible-light-mediated photochemistry, we induced local crosslinking and stiffening of extracellular matrix proteins within ex vivo mouse and human lung tissue. In ex vivo lung tissue of epithelial cell lineage-traced mice, local matrix crosslinking mimicked early fibrotic lesions that increased alveolar epithelial cell mechanosensing, differentiation, and nascent protein deposition and remodelling. However, the inhibition of cytoskeletal tension, mechanosensitive signalling pathways or integrin engagement reduced epithelial cell spreading and differentiation. Our findings emphasize the role of local extracellular matrix crosslinking and nascent protein deposition in early stage tissue fibrosis and have implications for ex vivo disease modelling and applications to other tissues. Using visible-light-induced crosslinking, a local stiffening approach is developed for ex vivo mouse and human lung tissue as an early lung injury model, directing epithelial cell mechanosensing, differentiation and nascent protein deposition.},

Here we report a continuous space-time crystal in a nematic liquid crystal driven by ambient-power, constant-intensity unstructured light. Our numerically constructed four-dimensional configurations exhibit good agreement with these experimental findings. Although meeting the established criteria to identify time-crystalline order, both experiments and computer simulations reveal a space-time crystallization phase formed by particle-like topological solitons. The robustness against temporal perturbations and spatiotemporal dislocations shows the stability and rigidity of the studied space-time crystals, which relates to their locally topological nature and many-body interactions between emergent spontaneously twisted, particle-like solitonic building blocks. Their potential technological utility includes optical devices, photonic space-time crystal generators, telecommunications and anti-counterfeiting designs, among others.

Here we report a lantern-shaped ribbon-cluster meta-unit that harnesses programmable and reprogrammable elastic energy to achieve over 13 distinct volumetric snapping morphologies from a single unit. Governed by three Euler angles, the meta-unit post-fabrication offers a tunable mechanical design space spanning up to quadrastable states. Unlike single-ribbon or mechanism-based designs, our system autonomously selects snapping pathways via nastic coupling between multiple ribbons, enabling the inverse design of complex snapping morphologies. We harness magnetically actuated bud-to-bloom and tristable morphogenesis to enable fast, non-invasive grasping and remote flow regulation in confined environments. These results establish a general framework for architected materials with programmable shape, stability and function, offering potential applications in soft robotics, deployable devices and mechanical logic.

Here we present an encompassing study into the phase behaviour of 55 polymer:small-molecular acceptor blends, pivotal in determining device performance and stability. Many of these exhibit non-trivial behaviour, which cannot be understood by conventional mixing theory. Interestingly, the phase diagrams are subject to variations in glass transition temperature, strongly suggesting an important role of configurational entropy. We present an extended model for the mixing free energy, accounting for a temperature dependence of free volume and configurational freedom. The phase behaviour can be roughly categorized in terms of the ratio of the monomeric volumes of the individual components. The model qualitatively reproduces all experimental observations and poses a viable starting point for assisting development. Insights to elucidate the composition–behaviour relationship in organic photovoltaic materials are required. Here the phase behaviour of disordered polymer:small-molecule acceptor blends is studied and an extended model is invoked to understand the temperature–composition diagrams.},

Here we report a self-assembly perovskite strategy for integrating optoelectronic arrays with arbitrary non-developable structures. The perovskite films are grown from a rapid nucleation-dominated crystallization driven by the low energy fluctuation of lead iodide solution, where the fluid precursor can be evenly dispersed along non-developable substrates by surface tension and then self-assembles into compact films through gaseous manipulation. The strategy covers arbitrarily shaped substrates with three-dimensional length scales over 106 orders of magnitude and enables the unique structural manipulations of photodiode arrays with micrometre precision. As a proof of concept, the theoretical focal surface of a single-lens image system is realized into a non-developable sensor, effectively correcting the off-axis coma aberrations compared with its planar or hemispherical counterpart.

This makes it challenging to surpass the current state-of-the-art, which exhibits energy spreads exceeding 1 eV and pulse durations of hundreds of femtoseconds. Here we report an unconventional delayed emission from a one-dimensional carbon-nanotube-based electron source. By utilizing a special pump–probe approach, we apply 7-fs laser pulses to the carbon-nanotube emitters and observe free electron emission tens of femtoseconds after the pulse. This delayed emission results in a substantially reduced energy spread of approximately 0.3 eV and an electron pulse width of about 13 fs. Through time-dependent density functional theory calculations, we find that the delayed emission is driven by the interplay of collective oscillations and electron–electron interactions. Our results may provide a promising technology for developing cutting-edge ultrafast electron sources.

  abstract     = {All-solid-state batteries receive ample attention due to their promising safety characteristics and energy density. The latter holds true if they are compatible with next-generation high-capacity anodes, but most highly ion-conductive solid electrolytes decompose at low operating potentials, leading to lithium loss and increased cell resistances. Here the dynamic stability of solid electrolytes that can improve all-solid-state battery performance is demonstrated. Halide electrolytes Li3YCl3Br3 and Li2ZrCl6, considered unstable at low potentials, are found to exhibit structurally reversible redox activity beyond their electrochemical stability windows, increasing compatibility with anodes and contributing to capacity without compromising ionic conductivity. The benefit of this dynamic stability window is demonstrated with cost-effective red phosphorus anodes, resulting in high reversible capacities (2,308 mAh g−1), high rate capacity retention (1,024 mAh g−1 at 7.75 mA cm−2) and extended cycle life (61% retention after 1,780 cycles). Furthermore, high areal capacity (7.65 mAh cm−2) and stability (70% retention after 1,000 cycles) are achieved for halide-based full cells with red phosphorous anodes. The beneficial redox activity of halide electrolytes greatly expands their application scenarios and suggests valuable battery design principles to enhance performance. All-solid-state batteries are potentially superior to Li-ion batteries, but to maximize performance, the solid electrolyte needs to be compatible with high-performance anodes. Halide solid electrolytes are shown to possess dynamic stability that extends beyond the electrochemical stability window, allowing improved full-cell performance.},

Here we report superconductivity in Sr2+-doped La3–xSrxNi2O7 films. The superconducting transition temperature (Tc) follows an incomplete dome-like profile, maintaining similar Tc values across a wide doping range (0 ≤ x ≤ 0.21) before diminishing near x ≈ 0.38. Optimally doped films achieve a Tc value of ~42 K, with a high critical current (Jc &gt; 1.4 kA cm−2 at 2 K) and upper critical fields (μ0Hc,∥(0) = 83.7 T, μ0Hc,⟂(0) = 110.3 T). Scanning transmission electron microscopy reveals that oxygen vacancies predominantly occupy planar NiO2 sites—unlike apical-site vacancies in bulk samples—due to compressive strain. Additionally, the elongated out-of-plane Ni–O bonds, exceeding those in pressurized bulk samples by 4%, likely weaken the interlayer $${d}_{{z}^{2}}$$ coupling and contribute to the reduced Tc in strained films. The authors study the effects of heterovalent doping on superconducting bilayer nickelate thin films.},

  abstract     = {Orbital torque is a promising approach for electrically controlling magnetization in spintronic devices. However, unravelling the underlying mechanisms governing the orbital Hall effect (OHE), especially the role of extrinsic scattering and its scaling with conductivity (σxx), is crucial for realizing the full potential of orbital torque in energy-efficient spintronic devices. Here, using SrRuO3 as a model system, we discover an unconventional scaling of orbital Hall conductivity ( $${\sigma }_{{\rm{OH}}}$$ ) with tunable σxx. $${\sigma }_{{\rm{OH}}}$$ remains constant at high σxx but exhibits a striking enhancement as σxx decreases, contrasting with spin Hall effect suppression at low σxx. This behaviour underscores the Dyakonov–Perel-like orbital relaxation mechanism as key to unconventional OHE. Leveraging this scaling, we achieve enhanced orbital torque via concurrent increases in orbital Hall conductivity and orbital Hall angle, demonstrating threefold power reduction in spin–orbit torque switching with moderate σxx reduction. Our work highlights the dominant role of extrinsic disorder scattering in unconventional OHE and establishes a transformative paradigm for energy-efficient spintronics. Scattering in the archetypal oxide SrRuO3 is shown to enhance orbital currents. This counter-intuitive effect establishes a transformative paradigm for energy-efficient spintronic devices.},

  abstract     = {Blue organic light-emitting diodes based on thermally activated delayed fluorescence suffer from low stability and broad emission. Hyperfluorescence—in which the excited state created on the thermally activated delayed fluorescence emitter is transferred to a fluorescent terminal emitter with a narrow emission spectrum—is promising towards improving colour purity and stability. However, direct charge trapping on the smaller-gap terminal emitter may lead to direct emissive losses, inhibited charge transport and charge imbalance. Here we demonstrate single-layer pure-blue hyperfluorescent organic light-emitting diodes that are not compromised by charge trapping on the terminal emitter. We reveal that the energetic disorder of the thermally activated delayed fluorescence sensitizer allows for the presence of a terminal emitter with a smaller energy gap, without affecting charge transport. Consequently, the stability benefits of single-layer organic light-emitting diodes can be combined with trap-free hyperfluorescence, resulting in pure-blue emission, a simple device structure, high quantum and power efficiencies, and state-of-the-art operational stability. Single-layer organic light-emitting diodes based on thermally activated delayed fluorescence are demonstrated, exhibiting pure-blue emission, high quantum and power efficiencies, and operational stability.},

  abstract     = {The confinement of electromagnetic radiation to subwavelength scales relies on strong light–matter interactions. In the infrared and terahertz spectral ranges, phonon polaritons are commonly employed to achieve deeply subdiffractional light confinement, with such optical modes offering much lower losses in comparison to plasmon polaritons. Among these, hyperbolic phonon polaritons in anisotropic materials offer a promising platform for light confinement. Here we report on ultraconfined phonon polaritons in hafnium-based dichalcogenides with confinement factors exceeding λ0/250 in the terahertz spectral range. This extreme light compression within deeply subwavelength thin films is enabled by the large magnitude of the light–matter coupling strength in these compounds and the natural hyperbolicity of HfSe2. Our findings emphasize the role of light–matter coupling for polariton confinement, which for phonon polaritons in polar dielectrics is dictated by the transverse–longitudinal optical phonon energy splitting. Our results demonstrate transition-metal dichalcogenides as an enabling platform for terahertz nanophotonic applications. The authors demonstrate deeply subwavelength light confinement in the terahertz spectral range by exploiting the strong light–matter coupling and hyperbolicity of phonon polaritons in hafnium-based dichalcogenides.},

  abstract     = {A major challenge in materials science is the determination of the structure of nanometre-sized objects. Here we present an approach that uses a generative machine learning model based on diffusion processes that are trained on 45,229 known structures. The model factors measured the diffraction pattern as well as the relevant statistical priors on the unit cell of atomic cluster structures. Conditioned only on the chemical formula and the information-scarce finite-sized broadened powder diffraction pattern, we find that our model, PXRDnet, can successfully solve the simulated nanocrystals as small as 10 Å across 200 materials of varying symmetries and complexities, including structures from all seven crystal systems. We show that our model can successfully and verifiably determine structural candidates four out of five times, with an average error among these candidates being only 7% (as measured by the post-Rietveld refinement R-factor). Furthermore, PXRDnet is capable of solving structures from noisy diffraction patterns gathered in real-world experiments. We suggest that data-driven approaches, bootstrapped from theoretical simulation, will ultimately provide a path towards determining the structure of previously unsolved nanomaterials. A machine learning model that can solve nanocrystalline structures from highly degraded PXRD patterns is presented. It is shown to be successful on simulated crystals as small as 10 Å, and is robust to noisy patterns from real-world experiments.},

  abstract     = {Rolling two-dimensional materials into one-dimensional nanoscrolls introduces curvature, chirality and symmetry breaking, enabling emergent properties. Conventional methods relying on external driving forces, however, exhibit poor control, low yield and limited reproducibility. Here we report spontaneous scrolling in polar van der Waals materials via an electrochemical intercalation/exfoliation process, enabling scalable nanoscroll production. This self-rolling is driven intrinsically by out-of-plane electric polarization (P⊥), where the magnitude of P⊥ is modulated by the intercalant size. Validated across eight polar materials, this approach achieves virtually 100% yield and reproducibility with defined scrolling direction, surpassing external driving force limitations. The nanoscrolls exhibit layer-independent inversion symmetry breaking and coherently enhanced second-harmonic generation, exceeding two-dimensional flakes by ~100-fold and rivalling leading two-dimensional nonlinear materials. Electrochemical initiation further facilitates metal-ion co-intercalation, yielding ten hybrid nanoscroll architectures. These findings establish a scalable route to create one-dimensional nanostructures and hybrid heterostructures, paving the way for designer quantum solids and van der Waals superlattices in quantum nanodevices. Spontaneous scrolling in two-dimensional polar van der Waals materials, driven by intrinsic out-of-plane electric polarization, enables the scalable production of nanoscrolls and their heterostructures.},

Such frustrated coupling manifests as the quantum interference of Josephson currents from different tunnelling channels and becomes tunable if channel transparency can be varied5–8. To explore these unconventional effects in the prototypical s±-wave superconductor FeSe (ref. 9), we use atomic-resolution scanned Josephson tunnelling microscopy10–13 for condensate-resolved imaging and junction tuning—capabilities unattainable in macroscopic Josephson devices with fixed characteristics. We quantitatively demonstrate frustrated Josephson tunnelling by examining two tunnelling inequalities. The relative transparency of two parallel tunnelling pathways is found tunable, revealing a tendency towards a 0–π transition with decreasing scanned Josephson tunnelling microscopy junction resistance. The simultaneous visualization of both superconducting condensates reveals anticorrelated superfluid modulations, highlighting the role of interband scattering. Our study establishes scanned Josephson tunnelling microscopy as a powerful tool enabling new research frontiers of multicondensate superconductivity. Atomic-resolution scanned Josephson tunnelling microscopy on multigap superconductor FeSe single crystals is studied, demonstrating condensate-resolved imaging and tuning capabilities.},

Here we design and synthesize 72 BBB-crossing lipids fabricated by conjugating BBB-crossing modules and amino lipids, and use them to assemble BBB-crossing lipid nanoparticles for mRNA delivery. Screening and structure optimization studies resulted in a lead formulation that has substantially higher mRNA delivery efficiency into the brain than those exhibited by FDA-approved lipid nanoparticles. Studies in distinct mouse models show that these BBB-crossing lipid nanoparticles can transfect neurons and astrocytes of the whole brain after intravenous injections, being well tolerated across several dosage regimens. Moreover, these nanoparticles can deliver mRNA to human brain ex vivo samples. Overall, these BBB-crossing lipid nanoparticles deliver mRNA to neurons and astrocytes in broad brain regions, thereby being a promising platform to treat a range of central nervous system diseases. A lipid-nanoparticle-based formulation incorporating engineered lipids containing a blood–brain-barrier-crossing moiety effectively delivers mRNA to neurons and astrocytes following systemic administration in mice.},

Here we describe a modular approach to protein nanomaterial design inspired by the rich chemical diversity that can be generated from the small number of atomic valencies. We design protein building blocks using deep learning-based generative tools, incorporating regular coordination geometries and tailorable bonding interactions that enable the assembly of diverse closed and open architectures guided by simple geometric principles. Experimental characterization confirms the successful formation of more than 20 multicomponent polyhedral protein cages, two-dimensional arrays and three-dimensional protein lattices, with a high (10%–50%) success rate and electron microscopy data closely matching the corresponding design models. Due to modularity, individual building blocks can assemble with different partners to generate distinct regular assemblies, resulting in an economy of parts and enabling the construction of reconfigurable networks for designer nanomaterials. Deep learning-based generative tools are used to design protein building blocks with well-defined directional bonding interactions, allowing the generation of a variety of scalable protein assemblies from a small set of reusable subunits.},

However, nearly all nanoparticles designed so far exhibit strict point group symmetry, which limits structural diversity and precludes anisotropic functionalization. Here we describe a computational strategy for designing multicomponent bifaceted protein nanomaterials with two distinctly addressable sides. The method centres on docking pseudosymmetric hetero-oligomeric building blocks in architectures with dihedral symmetry and designing an asymmetric protein–protein interface between them. We obtain an initial 30-subunit assembly with pseudo-D5 symmetry and generate variants in which we alter the size and morphology of the bifaceted nanoparticles by designing extensions to one of the subunits. Functionalization of the two nanoparticle faces with protein minibinders enables the specific colocalization of two populations of polystyrene microparticles coated with the target protein receptors. The ability to accurately design anisotropic protein nanoparticles could be broadly useful in applications requiring the colocalization of distinct target moieties. Predictive protein design and experiments are combined to develop anisotropic bifaceted protein nanomaterials using pseudosymmetric hetero-oligomeric building blocks.},

  abstract     = {The cathode interfacial layer (CIL) critically influences electron extraction and charge recombination, thereby playing a pivotal role in organic solar cells (OSCs). However, most state-of-the-art CILs are constrained by limited conductivity, high recombination and poor morphology, which collectively hinder device efficiency and stability. Here we report an inorganic–organic hybrid CIL (AZnO-F3N), developed by a dual-component synergy strategy, which integrates organic material PNDIT-F3N with two-dimensional amorphous zinc oxide. This design leverages the synergistic interactions between two-dimensional amorphous zinc oxide and PNDIT-F3N, resulting in reduced interfacial defect, enhanced conductivity and improved film uniformity. OSCs incorporating the AZnO-F3N CIL exhibit more efficient charge extraction and transport, along with reduced recombination. Consequently, a D18:L8-BO-based binary OSC achieves an efficiency of 20.6%. The introduction of BTP-eC9 as the third component further elevates the efficiency to 21.0% (certified as 20.8%). Moreover, the CIL demonstrates versatility across various active layers, thick-film configuration and flexible devices, underscoring its great potential to advance OSC technology. A hybrid cathode interfacial layer (AZnO-F3N) is developed, delivering 21.0% efficiency along with excellent stability, mechanical robustness and broad versatility, highlighting its potential to advance organic solar cells.},

Despite important advances in macroscopic frames, the realization and phonon imaging of nanoscale mechanical metamaterials has remained challenging. Here we extend the principle of topologically engineered mechanical frames to self-assembled nanoparticle lattices, resolving phonon dynamics using liquid-phase transmission electron microscopy. The vibrations of nanoparticles in Maxwell lattices are used to measure properties that have been difficult to obtain, such as phonon band structures, nanoscale spring constants and nonlinear lattice deformation paths. Studies of five different lattices reveal that these properties are modulated by nanoscale colloidal interactions. Our discrete mechanical model and simulations capture these interactions and the critical role of effects beyond nearest neighbours, bridging mechanical metamaterials with nanoparticle self-assembly. Our study provides opportunities for understanding and manufacturing self-assembled nanostructures for phonon manipulation, offering solution processability, transformability and emergent functions at underexplored scales of length, frequency and energy density. The realization and phonon imaging of nanoscale mechanical metamaterials has remained challenging.

Here we report an adaptive internal pressure encapsulation strategy that leverages the dynamic swelling behaviour of woven cotton fibres enclosed in a gel matrix in methanol. This strategy achieves simultaneous interfacial self-reinforcement and pressure modulation, enabling the fabrication of fibre-shaped direct methanol fuel cells. These flexible fuel cells operate across a broad temperature range, from –22 °C to 70 °C, showcasing cuttability, water resistance and fast refuelling capabilities, with full refuelling being achieved within 1 min. Furthermore, the fuel cells maintain consistent discharge performance, even after enduring 2,000 continuous flexing cycles. With an energy density of 161.36 Wh kg−1, these fibre-shaped direct methanol fuel cells surpass the energy densities of typical fibre-based power systems. This technology mitigates many of the technical challenges related to the lightweight and flexible application of fuel cells or fuel cell stacks for powering high-energy flexible devices.

Here, using X-ray diffraction, resonant inelastic X-ray scattering and X-ray absorption near-edge spectra experiments, we investigated an amorphous Li–V–O–F cathode (a-LVOF) with tetrahedral coordination and elucidated an O–O formal redox mechanism at a moderate voltage of 4.1 V, without a conventional octahedral Li–O–Li configuration. The electrochemically amorphized material fosters randomly distributed VO4 units and scattered dangling oxygen bonds, which facilitated O–O binding. Moreover, a-LVOF demonstrates a high capacity of 230 mAh g−1. Our findings reveal a low-voltage O–O formal redox mechanism in an amorphized cathode material. Cathode materials for lithium-ion batteries typically possess octahedral coordination, which may exclude other possible solutions to degradation during deep cycling. A series of tetrahedral-framework-based amorphous Li–V–O–F materials are investigated, and shown to demonstrate O–O formal redox at 4.1 V.},

  abstract     = {Zigzag edges of graphene are predicted to host magnetic electronic states, critical for spintronics, but an experimental confirmation of these magnetic conduction channels remains elusive. Here we report the signatures of magnetism in zigzag graphene nanoribbons (zGNRs) embedded in hexagonal boron nitride. Hexagonal boron nitride provides crucial edge stabilization, enabling the direct probing of this intrinsic magnetism. Scanning nitrogen-vacancy-centre microscopy initially confirmed magnetism in zGNR. Subsequently, an ~9-nm-wide zGNR transistor was fabricated with a sub-50-nm channel length. Magnetotransport measurements at 4 K revealed distinct Fabry–Pérot-like interference patterns, indicating coherent transport. A large, anisotropic magnetoresistance (~175 Ω, ~1.3%) was observed, persisting well above room temperature. These findings strongly corroborate the existence of robust magnetic ordering in the zGNR edge state. This hexagonal-boron-nitride-embedded zGNR system offers an effective platform for future graphene-based spintronic devices. Nitrogen-vacancy-centre microscopy and anisotropic magnetoresistance measurements reveal the evidence of magnetism in zigzag graphene nanoribbons embedded in hexagonal boron nitride.},

  abstract     = {Optically excited quantum materials exhibit non-equilibrium states with remarkable emergent properties, but these phenomena are usually transient, decaying on picosecond timescales and limiting practical applications. Advancing the design and control of non-equilibrium phases requires the development of targeted strategies to achieve long-lived, metastable phases. Here we report the discovery of symmetry-protected electronic metastability in the model cuprate ladder Sr14Cu24O41. Using femtosecond resonant X-ray scattering and spectroscopy, we show that this metastability is driven by a transfer of holes from chain-like charge reservoirs into the ladders. This ultrafast charge redistribution arises from the optical dressing and activation of a hopping pathway that is forbidden by symmetry at equilibrium. Relaxation back to the ground state is, hence, suppressed after the pump coherence dissipates. Our findings highlight how dressing materials with electromagnetic fields can dynamically activate terms in the electronic Hamiltonian, and provide a rational design strategy for non-equilibrium phases of matter. A long-lived photoinduced metastable state in a quasi-one-dimensional cuprate, Sr14Cu24O41, is reported.},

  abstract     = {In polycyclic heteroaromatic (PHA) emitters, which possess great potential for application in ultrahigh-definition displays, the origin of a small singlet–triplet energy gap (ΔES1T1) and its relationship with the molecular structure still remain poorly established. Here we derive an effective expression for ΔES1T1, in which ΔES1T1 positively depends on 2KHL (where KHL is the exchange energy between the highest occupied molecular orbital and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO)) and on the energy gap between LUMO and LUMO + 1 (ΔELUMO–LUMO+1). This expression for ΔES1T1 is validated over a series of 100 reported PHA emitters. It allows us to easily identify various molecular design approaches for managing ΔES1T1 by synergistically regulating 2KHL and ΔELUMO–LUMO+1. The proof-of-concept PHA molecules were synthesized and characterized to further confirm the validity of this expression for ΔES1T1. Overall, our work provides a physical picture to not only modulate ΔES1T1 in emerging PHA emitters but also design and screen such materials with small ΔES1T1. Insight into the singlet–triplet energy gap and molecular structure relationship in polycyclic heteroaromatic molecules enables organic light-emitting diodes based on multiresonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence, with improved efficiency and roll-off.},

Conversely, leaky waves can convert radiation from confined sources towards the far field. Here we combine hyperbolic polaritons and leaky wave radiation to demonstrate flatland leaky polaritonic wakes. We employ a mixed-dimensional van der Waals heterostructure consisting of a nanoscale waveguide strip on a van der Waals film. The waveguide mode, confined inside the hyperbolic light cone of the background film, enables efficient directional in-plane emission of fast phonon polaritons. The constructive interference of these leaky polaritons generates highly directional polaritonic wakes. Their spatial symmetry can be tailored through the orientation of the heterostructure with respect to the hyperbolic film dispersion. Leveraging van der Waals stacking, we also demonstrate effective acceleration and deceleration of polaritonic wakes by locally tailoring the leaky nano-waveguide dispersion through gradient thickness design. Our findings demonstrate that polaritonic wakes hold promise for integrated nanophotonic circuits. The authors combine the strong confinement of hyperbolic polaritons with leaky nano-waveguides to demonstrate directional in-plane emission of fast phonon polaritons and their acceleration and deceleration by tailoring waveguide dispersion.},

  abstract     = {Material fractures are typically irreversible, marking a one-time event leading to failure. Great efforts have been made to enhance both strength and fracture toughness of bulk materials for engineering applications, such as by introducing self-recovery and secondary breaking behaviours. In low-dimensional structures, two-dimensional materials often exhibit exceptional strength but accompanied by extreme brittleness. Here we discover that the toughness of two-dimensional materials can be enhanced without sacrificing strength—by simply twisting the layers. Through in situ scanning transmission electron microscopy, supported by nanoindentation and theoretical analysis, we reveal that twisted bilayer structures enable sequential fracture events: initial cracks heal to form stable grain boundaries, which then shield subsequent fracture tips from stress concentration. This process consumes additional energy compared with conventional fracture, with toughness enhancement tunable through twist angle adjustment. The intrinsic toughening mechanism via twisting, along with the emerging electronic properties of twistronics that are currently attracting substantial attention, presents an exciting opportunity for future devices. Intrinsic toughening in two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides can be achieved simply by twisting the layers. This twisting promotes cross-layer healing and grain boundary formation, which shield fracture tips from stress concentration.},

While monolayer 2D materials exhibit impressive fracture resistance, as demonstrated in hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN), preserving these remarkable properties in vdW materials remains a challenge. Here we reveal an anomalous mechanical interlayer coupling that involves interlayer-friction toughening and edge-reconstruction embrittlement during the fracture of multilayer h-BN. Both asynchronous and synchronous fracture modes and their flaw-size dependence are identified. Edge reconstruction in the synchronous fracture mode can eliminate a toughening mechanism induced by lattice asymmetry in monolayer h-BN, leading to embrittlement of the multilayer h-BN, while the asynchronous fracture mode results in greater fracture resistance. Such findings will provide fundamental guidelines for engineering interlayer interactions in vdW materials including heterostructures and layered architectures for better mechanical and functional performances.

However, this process often results in catastrophic fracture when applied to most inorganic semiconductors owing to their inherent brittleness. Here we report the unique room-temperature plastic deformation mechanism involving sublattice amorphization coupled with Ag-ion diffusion in inorganic semiconductors Ag2Te1–xSx (0.3 ≤ x ≤ 0.6), and an ultrahigh extensibility of up to 10,150%. Once subject to external stress, the crystalline Te/S sublattice undergoes a uniform transformation into an amorphous state, whereas the Ag cations continuously bond with Te/S anions, endowing bulk Ag2Te1–xSx with exceptional plastic deformability. Remarkably, even slight polishing can induce sublattice amorphization in the surface layers. Furthermore, this sublattice amorphization can be reversed to crystals through simple annealing, enlightening the iterative sublattice amorphization strategy, with which metal-like wire drawing, curving, forging and ultrahigh ductility have been obtained in bulk Ag2Te1–xSx at room temperature. These results highlight sublattice amorphization as a critical plastic deformation mechanism in silver chalcogenide inorganic semiconductors, which will facilitate their applications in flexible electronics and drive further exploration of more plastic inorganic semiconductors. Sublattice amorphization is revealed as the deformation mechanism of Ag2Te1–xSx (0.3 ≤ x ≤ 0.6), based on which an iterative crystalline–amorphous transition strategy is proposed to enable these bulk inorganic semiconductors with metal-like processability.},

Because of their brittleness, semiconductors are usually processed by the complicated techniques of sputtering or deposition2–4, instead of the effective and versatile metalworking methods like rolling, extrusion and pressing used with metals5. Here we show that brittle semiconductors can be plastically manufactured with an extensibility as large as ~3,000% using warm metalworking, that is, plastic manufacturing at slightly elevated temperatures (empirically below 500 K). Many bulk brittle semiconductors, such as Cu2Se, Ag2Se and Bi90Sb10, can be processed like metals below 400–500 K into free-standing, large and high-quality films with a thickness from the macro-scale to the micrometre scale. A model based on temperature-dependent collective atomic displacement and thermal vibration is proposed to explain the superior plasticity. The warm-metalworked films can retain the excellent and tunable physical properties of the bulk versions, such as a high carrier mobility up to ~5,000 cm2 V−1 s−1 and tunable electrical conductivities over six orders of magnitude by adjusting the chemical composition. A case study in film thermoelectric devices demonstrates ultra-high normalized output power densities of 43–54 μW cm−2 K−2. This work suggests that brittle semiconductors can be manufactured by warm metalworking for applications in various electronics.

  abstract     = {Despite 10% of the Earth’s surface being covered by ice, ice power remains untapped. Although ice is known to generate electricity upon bending via flexoelectricity1, the generated electric polarization per curvature, that is, the flexoelectric coefficient, is too small (~1–10 nC m−1) to be utilized for electromechanical devices. Here we demonstrate that doping ice with NaCl can enhance its flexoelectric coefficient 1,000-fold, to ~1–10 μC m−1. We find that this enhancement is due to the bending-induced streaming current along ice grain boundaries. On the basis of this mechanism, we fabricated flexural devices with an effective piezoelectric coefficient of ~4,000 pC N−1, which is comparable to that of the best piezoelectric materials. The high flexoelectricity of saline ice brings the vision of harnessing ice power one step closer to reality, and may also be relevant to the electrical activity of ice-covered terrestrial regions and icy ocean worlds such as Europa or Enceladus. In addition, the model for coupling between strain gradients and streaming currents is not limited to ice and provides a general framework for extracting electromechanical activity from liquid-infused porous solids. By doping ice with NaCl, it is shown that a flexoelectric coefficient of up to 10 μC m−1 is generated, enabling effective piezoelectric coefficients that are comparable to those of ceramics. This arises from the streaming current of quasi-liquid flow through grain boundaries from one side of the sample to the other.},

Such remodelling is multifaceted including changes to the biochemical composition, architecture and mechanics, clouding our understanding of how and which extracellular matrix properties contribute to a dysfunctional state. Here we describe a decellularized extracellular matrix–synthetic hydrogel hybrid scaffold that independently confers two distinct matrix properties—ligand presentation and stiffness—to cultured cells in vitro, allowing for the identification of their specific roles in cardiac ageing. The hybrid scaffold maintains native matrix composition and organization of young or aged murine cardiac tissue, whereas its mechanical properties can be independently tuned to mimic young or aged tissue stiffness. Seeding these scaffolds with murine primary cardiac fibroblasts, we identify distinct age- and matrix-dependent mechanisms of cardiac fibroblast activation, matrix remodelling and senescence. Importantly, we show that the ligand presentation of a young extracellular matrix can outweigh the profibrotic stiffness cues typically present in an aged extracellular matrix in maintaining or driving cardiac fibroblast quiescence. Ultimately, these tunable scaffolds can enable the discovery of specific extracellular targets to prevent ageing dysfunction and promote rejuvenation. A hybrid extracellular matrix–hydrogel with tunable mechanical stiffness and biochemical composition of young or aged cardiac tissue is used to identify the specific contributions of extracellular matrix ligands and mechanics for fibroblast aging.},

  abstract     = {Cell migration in mechanically confined environments is a crucial step of metastatic cancer progression. Nonetheless, the molecular components and processes mediating such behaviour are still not fully understood. Here we demonstrate that a pool of the scaffolding protein anillin and its cofactor Ect2, which are both predominantly nuclear proteins and critical mediators of cytokinesis, is present in the cytoplasm of multiple interphase cell types that promote confined cell migration. Confined migration in biomimetic microfluidic models triggers the actomyosin-binding-dependent recruitment of anillin to the plasma membrane at the poles of migrating cells in a manner that scales with microenvironmental stiffness and confinement. The guanine nucleotide exchange activity of Ect2 is required for its RhoA-GTPase-mediated activation of myosin II at the cell poles, enhancing invasion, bleb-based migration and extravasation. Confinement-induced nuclear envelope rupture further amplifies this process due to the release of further anillin and Ect2 into the cytoplasm. Overall, these results show how Ect2 and anillin cooperate to mediate RhoA/ROCK/myosin II-dependent mechanoadaptation and invasive cancer progression. Cell migration in confined environments is initiated by a cytoplasmic pool of anillin and Ect2 that promotes RhoA/myosin II-mediated activation at the poles of migrating cells, in a process dependent on the extracellular environment stiffness.},

These materials are stabilized by directional hydrogen-bonding patterns, giving rise to one-dimensional or two-dimensional assembly. It remains a challenge to mimic biology’s context-adaptive and flexible structures. Here we introduce minimalistic tripeptide sequences that form highly soluble dynamic ensembles through multivalent side-chain interactions. We observe these supramolecular dispersions undergo drying-induced sequential liquid–liquid phase separation followed by solidification, resulting in the formation of films of stiff, densely packed and porous peptide microparticles that can be instantaneously redispersed upon the re-introduction of water. Air-drying of peptide dispersions in the presence of proteins or small-molecule payloads results in efficient encapsulation and the retention of protein stability after redispersion, showing promise for the emulsification, encapsulation, protection and storage of biomacromolecules. The mechanism resembles the protective strategies in natural systems during desiccation, which rely on liquid–liquid phase separation to survive extreme conditions. Here the authors design tripeptides that form dynamic soluble dispersions and undergo phase separation upon drying to assemble into porous particles. This evaporation-driven emulsification can be harnessed to encapsulate and stabilize biomolecules.},

  abstract     = {Hot carriers, inheriting excess kinetic energy from high-energy photons, drive numerous optoelectronic applications reliant on non-equilibrium transport processes. Although extensively studied in inorganic materials, their potential in organic-based systems remains largely unexplored. Here we demonstrate highly mobile hot carriers in crystalline two-dimensional conjugated coordination polymer Cu3BHT (BHT, benzenehexathiol) films. Leveraging a suite of ultrafast spectroscopic and imaging techniques, we map the microscopic charge transport landscape in Cu3BHT films following non-equilibrium photoexcitation across temporal, spatial and frequency domains, revealing two distinct high-mobility transport regimes. In the non-equilibrium regime, hot carriers achieve an ultrahigh mobility of ~2,000 cm2 V–1 s–1, traversing grain boundaries up to ~300 nm within a picosecond. In the quasi-equilibrium regime, free carriers exhibit Drude-type, band-like transport with a remarkable mobility of ~400 cm2 V–1 s–1 and an intrinsic diffusion length exceeding 1 μm. These findings position two-dimensional conjugated coordination polymers as versatile platforms for advancing organic-based hot carrier applications. Hot carrier transport in organic systems has remained elusive due to rapid energy relaxation and limited transport properties. Here highly mobile hot carriers and their relaxation dynamics are reported in a crystalline two-dimensional conjugated coordination polymer, revealing two distinct transport regimes.},

  abstract     = {Although being highly demanded in organic electronics, functional conjugated polymers face challenges on scalable synthesis with batch uniformities. Here a reactivity-regulated sequent cross-coupling carbon–nitrogen polycondensation method is developed to enable the precise synthesis of functional polyarylamines with excellent batch-to-batch uniformity. It is revealed that the stepwise regulation of intermediate reactivities is key to accomplish controllable polycondensation via two sequent palladium-promoted carbon–nitrogen coupling cycles, which is distinct to the unicyclic carbon–carbon coupling. A variety of polyarylamines are prepared to improve the material functionalities, where a ternary polymer consisting of polar substituents is shown to optimize the interfacial and bulk properties of perovskite layers fabricated on top. The corresponding inverted perovskite solar cells achieved remarkable power conversion efficiencies of 25.2% (active area, 5.97 mm2) and 23.2% (active area, 128 mm2), along with decent operational stabilities. Overall, this work provides an effective polymerization method for advanced conjugated polymers to enable high-performance optoelectronics. The precise synthesis of functional polyarylamines based on a reactivity-regulated sequent cross-coupling carbon–nitrogen polycondensation method has been reported, with excellent batch-to-batch uniformity for perovskite solar cells.},

  abstract     = {Solvent co-intercalation, that is, the combined intercalation of ions and solvent molecules into electrode materials, is an additional but much less explored lever for modifying the properties of metal-ion battery electrodes (metal = Li, Na, Mg, etc.). Knowledge on solvent co-intercalation is relatively scarce and largely limited to graphite anodes, for which in sodium-ion batteries, the co-intercalation of glyme molecules is fast and highly reversible. The use of co-intercalation for cathode active materials (CAMs) remains much less explored. Here we investigate for a series of sodium-layered sulfide CAMs (NaxMS2, M = Ti, V, Cr and mixtures) under which conditions solvent co-intercalation occurs and how this process impacts the phase behaviour, electrode breathing, redox potential and cycle life compared to ‘Na+-only’ intercalation. Co-intercalation is a complex process that can, for example, cause opposing fluxes, meaning that solvents intercalate into the CAMs while sodium ions simultaneously deintercalate. Co-intercalation leads to layered structures that can include different amounts of confined solvated ions, ions and unbound solvent molecules. It is an approach to designing structurally diverse, layered materials with potential applications for batteries and beyond. Solvent co-intercalation into graphite anodes for sodium-ion batteries is common; however, intercalation into cathodes is much less explored. Here, using operando experiments as well as theory, solvent co-intercalation in a range of layered sulfides is investigated.},

  abstract     = {Sodium niobate, a lead-free ferroic material, hosts delicately balanced, competing order parameters, including ferroelectric states that can be stabilized by epitaxial strain. Here we show that the resulting macroscopic ferroelectricity exhibits an unconventional microscopic structure using multislice electron ptychography. This technique overcomes multiple scattering artefacts limiting conventional electron microscopy, enabling both lateral spatial resolution beyond the diffraction limit and recovery of three-dimensional structural information. These imaging capabilities allow us to separate the ferroelectric interior of the sample from the relaxed surface structure and identify the soft phonon mode and related structural distortions with picometre precision. Unlike conventional ferroelectric perovskites, we find that the polar distortion in this material involves minimal distortions of the cation sublattices and is instead dominated by anion displacements relative to the niobium sublattice. We establish limits on film thickness for interfacial octahedral rotation engineering and directly visualize a random octahedral rotation pattern, arising from the flat dispersion of the associated phonon mode. Limited by challenges in light-atom imaging, microscopic investigations of ferroelectricity have used cation–cation displacements as a proxy for the true cation–anion distortions. Using electron ptychography, oxygen anions can be tracked to observe an otherwise-hidden ferroelectric mechanism in thin-film NaNbO3, which would have appeared antiferroelectric from cations alone.},

  abstract     = {Polar skyrmions have demonstrated rich physics and exotic properties for developing novel functionalities. However, so far, skyrmion nanodomains exist only in a few material systems, such as ferroelectric/dielectric superlattices, free-standing PbTiO3/SrTiO3 epitaxial bilayers and ultrathin Pb(Zr,Ti)O3/SrTiO3/Pb(Zr,Ti)O3 sandwiches. These heterostructures are fabricated with elaborately designed boundary conditions to meet the delicate energy balance for stabilizing topological phases. This requirement limits the broad applications of skyrmions in electronic devices. Here we show widespread skyrmion nanodomains in ferroelectric–antiferroelectric solid solutions, composed of ferroelectric PbTiO3 and one antiferroelectric PbSnO3 (Pb(Ti1–xSnx)O3), PbHfO3 (Pb(Ti1–xHfx)O3) or PbZrO3 (Pb(Ti1–xZrx)O3). The skyrmionic textures are formed by engineering dipole–dipole and antiferrodistortive–dipole couplings in competition between ferroelectric and antiferroelectric polar orderings, allowing the stabilization of topological phases. A phase diagram is built for the three solid solution series, revealing the stabilization regions of skyrmion nanodomains. In addition, the non-trivial domains also exhibit improved switching character, reversible writing/erasure and long-term retention for the electrical manipulation of polar configurations. These findings open an avenue for the investigation and exploitation of polar skyrmions in ferroelectric-based materials, providing opportunities in topological electronics. Polar skyrmions are of interest for nanoelectronics due to their exotic properties. However, so far, these are metastable states requiring a delicate balance of boundary conditions to form in heterostructures. In ferroelectric and antiferroelectric solid solutions, skyrmionic textures are observed to form in both bulk and film.},

Two-dimensional magnets unlock opportunities to combine AFM and FM materials; however, the buried AFM–FM interfaces obtained by stacking remains challenging to understand. Here we demonstrate interfacial control via intralayer exchange coupling in the layered AFM CrPS4, where connected even and odd layers realize pristine lateral interfaces between AFM-like and FM-like regions. We distinguish antiphase even-layer states by scanning nitrogen-vacancy centre magnetometry due to a weak surface magnetization. This surface magnetization enables control over the even-layer state, with different regions switching at distinct fields due to their own lateral couplings. We toggle three AFM domains adjacent to a FM-like region and demonstrate a tunable multilevel exchange bias. Our nanoscale visualization unveils the microscopic origins of exchange bias and advances single two-dimensional crystals for hybrid AFM–FM technologies. The authors use nitrogen-vacancy centre magnetometry to explore layer number and magnetic field evolution of ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic domains in the A-type antiferromagnet CrPS4.},

  abstract     = {Antiferromagnets as active components in devices have been attracting attention due to their negligible stray field and ultrafast magnetic dynamics, which are promising for high-density and fast memory devices. Although the switching of antiferromagnetic (AFM) order by current-induced spin–orbit torque (SOT) has already been realized, field-free SOT-induced bidirectional switching of AFM order in perpendicular geometry has been elusive. Here we experimentally demonstrate field-free perpendicular switching of the magnetic octupole moct in chiral AFM Mn3Sn by combining in-plane and out-of-plane SOTs generated by two-dimensional van der Vaals WTe2. The out-of-plane SOT breaks the in-plane inversion symmetry and leads to deterministic bidirectional switching of moct in polycrystalline Mn3Sn even without a fixed perpendicular moct easy axis. The switching ratio reaches up to 80% compared to 20–30% in polycrystalline Mn3Sn and the critical current density is reduced by an order of magnitude to around 1 MA cm−2. Our work promotes the development of chiral AFM devices toward practical application. By introducing an unconventional spin–orbit torque, the authors demonstrate an all-electrical way to bidirectionally switch the perpendicular chiral antiferromagnetic order in Mn3Sn, promoting the application of antiferromagnetic spintronics.},

We show direct evidence for an in-plane magnetic order competing with the superconducting state motivated by theoretical proposals. We use two complementary electrical transport measurements. First, in statistically significant switching events in the superconducting state of magic-angle twisted trilayer graphene, we observe non-monotonic and hysteretic responses in the switching distributions as a function of temperature and in-plane magnetic field. Additionally, the system behaves like a network of Josephson junctions due to lattice-relaxation-induced moiré inhomogeneity. Second, in normal regions doped slightly away from the superconducting regime, hysteretic and linear positive magnetoresistance with the in-plane magnetic field shows evidence for an in-plane magnetic order. Furthermore, we estimate superfluid stiffness Js ≈ 0.15 K with strong temperature dependence and show a broadened Berezinskii–Kosterlitz–Thouless transition. Our observations may constrain possible intervalley-coherent magnetic orders and the superconductivity arising from its fluctuations.

  abstract     = {Understanding the interplay of non-Hermiticity and topology is crucial given the intrinsic openness of most natural and engineered systems, and has important ramifications in topological lasers and sensors. Recently, it has been theoretically proposed that topological features could originate solely from a system’s non-Hermiticity in photonic platforms. Here we experimentally demonstrate the appearance of non-Hermitian topology exclusively from loss modulation in a photonic system that is topologically trivial in the absence of loss. We do this by implementing a non-Hermitian generalization of an Aubry–André–Harper model with purely imaginary potential in a programmable integrated photonics platform, which allows us to investigate different periodic and quasiperiodic configurations of the model. In both cases, we show the emergence of topological edge modes and explore their resilience to different kinds of disorder. Our work highlights loss engineering as a mechanism to generate topological properties. Using a reconfigurable integrated photonic platform, the authors reveal the appearance of non-Hermitian topology and the existence of edge modes emerging exclusively from optical loss modulation.},

Such a hypothetical metal would possess a spectral gap1,2—a ‘hyper-gap’—in its absorption spectrum, separating the intraband and interband absorptions, in which optical losses could vanish. Currently, this property is achievable only within the bandgap of insulators. However, realizing such a hyper-gap metal demands an exotic electronic structure in which the conducting bands have a bandwidth narrower than their energy separations from the remaining electronic states. Here we present such a hyper-gap in a family of organic metals—the Fabre charge-transfer salts3—through first-principles predictions coupled with both electrical and optical measurements. A transparent window, spanning from red to near-infrared wavelengths, is identified in bulk single crystals that remain transmissive over a thickness of 30 µm. The corresponding absorption coefficient is the lowest among known stoichiometric metals, rivalling thin films of transparent conductive oxides. This finding introduces a path, beyond traditional doping strategies in insulators, to combine electronic conduction and optical transparency. A family of organic metals that behave as hyper-gap transparent conductors is discussed. Such an elusive combination of electronic conduction and optical transparency is highly attractive for plasmonics and photonics applications.},

However, efficiently producing high-quality BPNRs with precise control over their size and structure remains a great challenge. Here we achieved high-quality, narrow and clean BPNRs with nearly atomically smooth edges and well-defined edge orientation at high yield (up to ~95%) through the sonochemical exfoliation of the synthesized bulk BP crystals with a slightly enlarged lattice parameter along the armchair direction. The resulting BPNRs have widths centred at 32 nm and can be as narrow as 1.5 nm, with edges consistently aligned along the zigzag direction in measured BPNRs with widths ≤340 nm. The formation of one-dimensional BPNRs with zigzag edges is attributed to the introduction of pre-stress along the armchair direction of the grown bulk BP and the application of suitable sonication conditions. The BPNR bandgap increases as the BPNR width decreases from 83 nm to 13 nm, with a large bandgap of 0.64 eV for a 13-nm-wide BPNR. A typical graphene-contacted field-effect transistor fabricated with a 13-nm-wide and 10-nm-thick BPNR can achieve an on/off ratio of 1.7 × 106, mobility of 1,506 cm2 V−1 s−1 and on-state channel conductivity of 1,845 µS. The devices also exhibit excellent photodetection performance. Our method opens up a route to produce BPNRs with high material quality and defined edge chirality for fundamental studies and practical applications in electronic and optoelectronic fields. Through the sonochemical exfoliation of grown black phosphorus crystals, high-quality, narrow and clean black phosphorus nanoribbons with smooth edges and defined edge chirality are achieved, enabling the realization of high-performance transistors and photodetectors.},

The driving force for the appearance of vortices in ferroelectrics is the need to minimize the depolarizing fields at interfaces3–5,14; by making the polarization rotate, depolarization fields vanish4,5,8,9. Antiferroelectrics, by contrast, are defined by an antiparallel arrangement of electric dipoles15. A priori, therefore, they lack the depolarization fields that drive the appearance of non-trivial topologies in ferroelectrics. At the atomic scale of the dipoles, however, we find that polar discontinuities can still happen, driving the appearance of topological singularities at ferroelastic domain walls. Topological phenomena in ferroelectrics such as vortices are of interest as they may be useful for high-density storage applications, but similar phenomena have not been seen in antiferroelectrics, which possess antipolar dipole arrangements.

  abstract     = {The power and energy consumption of resistive switching devices can be lowered by reducing the dimensions of their active layers. Efforts to push this low-energy switching property to its limits have led to the investigation of active regions made with two-dimensional (2D) layered materials. Despite their small dimensions, 2D layered materials exhibit a rich variety of switching mechanisms, each involving different types of atomic structure reconfiguration. In this Review, we highlight and classify the mechanisms of resistive switching in monolayer and bulk 2D layered materials, with a subsequent focus on those occurring in a monolayer and/or localized to point defects in the crystalline sheet. We discuss the complex energetics involved in these fundamentally defect-assisted processes, including the coexistence of multiple mechanisms and the effects of the contacts used. Examining the highly localized ‘atomristor’-type switching, we provide insights into atomic motions and electronic transport across the metal–2D interfaces underlying their operation. Finally, we discuss progress and our perspective on the challenges associated with the development of 2D resistive switching devices. Promising application areas and material systems are identified and suggested for further research. The authors review the mechanisms of resistive switching in monolayer and bulk forms of two-dimensional layered materials, providing insights into atomic motions and electronic transport across interfaces.},

Collagen I, a key scaffolding material in bodily tissues, presents challenges in controlling its assembly kinetics in a biocompatible manner in vitro, restricting its use as a primary scaffold or adhesive in cellular biofabrication. Here we report a collagen fabrication method termed as tunable rapid assembly of collagenous elements that leverages macromolecular crowding to achieve the instant assembly of unmodified collagen. By applying an inert crowder to accelerate the liquid–gel transition of collagen, our method enables the high-throughput creation of physiological collagen constructs across length scales—from micro to macro—and facilitates cell self-assembly and morphogenesis through the generation of tunable multiscale architectural cues. With high biocompatibility and rapid gelation kinetics, the tunable rapid assembly of collagenous elements method also offers a versatile bioprinting approach for collagen over a wide concentration range, enabling the direct printing of cellular tissues using pH-neutral, bioactive collagen bioinks and achieving both structural complexity and biofunctionality. This work broadens the scope of controllable multiscale biofabrication for tissues across various organ systems using unmodified collagen. The accelerated liquid–gel transition of collagen induced by an inert crowding agent enables the rapid and versatile fabrication of collagenous tissues under biocompatible and bioactive conditions for tissue engineering applications.},

  abstract     = {Bioinspired materials based on self-assembling peptides are promising for tackling various challenges in biomedical engineering. While contemporary data-driven approaches have led to the discovery of self-assembling peptides with various structures and properties, predicting the functionalities of these materials is still challenging. Here we describe the deep learning-guided de novo design of antimicrobial materials based on self-assembling peptides targeting bacterial membranes to address the emerging problem of bacterial drug resistance. Our approach integrates non-natural amino acids for enhanced peptide self-assembly and effectively predicts the functional activity of the self-assembling peptide materials with minimal experimental annotation. The designed self-assembling peptide leader displays excellent in vivo therapeutic efficacy against intestinal bacterial infection in mice. Moreover, it exhibits an enhanced biofilm eradication capability and does not induce acquired drug resistance. Mechanistic studies reveal that the designed peptide can self-assemble on bacterial membranes to form nanofibrous structures for killing multidrug-resistant bacteria. This work thus provides a strategy to discover functional peptide materials by customized design. A deep learning-guided de novo design identifies self-assembling peptides containing non-natural amino acids capable of killing multidrug-resistant bacteria and treating mice with acute intestinal infection.},

However, existing delivery systems are still inefficient in delivering drugs in a biorhythm-mimicking fashion. Here we describe a biorhythm-inspired growth hormone transdermal microneedle patch with multistage drug release that mimics the natural rhythm of human growth hormone secretion at night. Programmed drug release is achieved by combining a ‘burst-release’ module with several ‘delayed-release’ modules. Compared with the subcutaneous daily injections currently used in clinics, the patch exhibits enhanced efficacy in terms of longitudinal bone growth and bone quality, leading to bone length increases of ~10 mm and ~5 mm in healthy rats and growth hormone gene knockout mice, respectively. Our findings reveal that the biorhythm-mimicking release pattern significantly enhances growth hormone bioavailability and effectively regulates the growth-related biological process, thus boosting the secretion of insulin-like growth factor-1 and ultimately promoting bone growth. A bioinspired microneedle patch mimics the natural rhythm of human growth hormone secretion by combining burst-release and delayed-release modules to promote improved bone growth in mice and rats.},

  abstract     = {The ability to fabricate materials and devices at small scales by design has resulted in tremendous technological progress. However, the need for engineered three-dimensional (3D) nanoscale materials requires new strategies for organizing nanocomponents. Here we demonstrate an inverse design approach for the assembly of nanoparticles into hierarchically ordered 3D organizations using DNA voxels with directional, addressable bonds. By identifying intrinsic symmetries in repeating mesoscale structural motifs, we prescribe a set of voxels, termed a mesovoxel, that are assembled into target 3D crystals. The relationship between different degrees of encoded information used for voxel bonds and the fidelity of assembly is investigated using experimental and computational methods. We apply this assembly strategy to create periodic 3D nanoparticle ordered organizations, including structures with low-dimensional elements, helical motifs, a nanoscale analogue of a face-centred perovskite crystal and a distributed Bragg reflector based on a crystal with plasmonic and photonic length-scale regimes. An inverse design strategy is reported for the organization of nanoscale matter using DNA-programmable bonds and the fabrication of hierarchically ordered 3D assemblies.},

  abstract     = {The efficiency of perovskite solar cells has recently been dramatically improved by a self-assembled monolayer (SAM), but forming uniform, dense and especially stable SAM remains a challenge. The hydroxyl groups on indium tin oxide (ITO) serve as the bonding sites for the SAM molecule, directly determining the distribution and anchoring stability of SAM. We developed a solution-based strategy to fully hydroxylate the ITO in as fast as 15 s. Moreover, further hydroxylation etching could also create abundant uncoordinated indium ions on the new exposed ITO surface for the anchoring of SAM by forming coordination bonds. In addition, the rapid hydroxylation etching allows commercial ITO to be directly used to omit the conventional multistep ITO pretreatment. Moreover, hydroxylation etching can also spontaneously form nano-antireflective structures on ITO to improve photon transmission. The versatile bonding site engineering resulted in better SAM anchoring, which delivered efficient perovskite solar cells (power conversion efficiency, 26.6%) that only lose 4% of the initial efficiency after 2,800 h of operation at 65 °C (ISOS-L-2 protocol). Formation of a stable self-assembled monolayer for high-efficiency perovskite solar cells remains a challenge. Here uniform and stable SAM anchoring is achieved on a hydroxylated indium tin oxide surface, leading to highly efficient and stable perovskite solar cells.},

However, the interference of phonons, or thermal vibrations, central to understanding coherent thermal transport in all electrically insulating materials, has been poorly characterized due to experimental challenges. Here we report the observation of phonon interference at room temperature in molecular-scale junctions. This is enabled by custom-developed scanning thermal probes with combined high stability and sensitivity, allowing quantification of heat flow through molecular junctions one molecule at a time. Using isomers of oligo(phenylene ethynylene)3 with either para- or meta-connected centre rings, our experiments revealed a remarkable reduction in thermal conductance in meta-conformations. Quantum-mechanically accurate molecular dynamics simulations show that this difference arises from the destructive interference of phonons through the molecular backbone. This work opens opportunities for studying numerous wave-driven material properties of phonons down to the single-molecule level that have remained experimentally inaccessible. Characterizing the interference of phonons at the single-molecule level remains a challenging task.

  abstract     = {Photocatalysis has traditionally been constrained by selective utilization of either singlet or triplet excited states, limiting efficiency and reaction scope. Achieving simultaneous optimization of both states has remained a challenge. Here we introduce donor–acceptor covalent organic frameworks (COFs) that integrate a dual-state activation strategy. The COFs feature segregated columnar π-arrays, aligned micropores and short donor–acceptor distances. Upon photoexcitation, electron transfer occurs at acceptor units, while energy transfer occurs at donor sites. The porous network also ensures efficient substrate transport to catalytic centres, while intra- and interlayer hydrogen bonding stabilizes excited states, further enhancing photostability and reactivity. This dual-state strategy provides a benchmark for photocatalytic organic transformations, including high turnover frequencies under red-light irradiation, broad-spectrum absorption extending into the near-infrared and operation without metals, co-catalysts or sacrificial donors. By integrating photophysical and structural optimizations, our approach establishes a design strategy that overcomes limitations in solar-driven chemical transformations and broadens the scope of COF-based photocatalysis. A strategy with donor–acceptor covalent organic frameworks enhances photocatalysis by harnessing both singlet and triplet states, enabling metal-free, co-catalyst-free and sacrificial donor-free red-light-driven organic transformations with high efficiency.},

  abstract     = {Controlling the molecular orientation of conjugated polymers is a vital yet complex process to modulate their optoelectronic properties along with boosting device performance. Here we propose a molecular-force-driven anisotropy strategy to modulate the molecular orientation of conjugated polymers. This strategy relies on the intermolecular interactions, gauged by the Hansen solubility parameters framework, to provide solvent selection criteria for conjugated polymers that render films with a preferential orientation. We showcase molecular-force-driven anisotropy to overcome the inverse coupling between the electrical conductivity and Seebeck coefficient in solution-processed organic thermoelectrics, a major challenge in the field. Our kinetic Monte Carlo simulations suggest that edge-on orientations break the trade-off by increasing the in-plane delocalization length. The molecular-force-driven anisotropy approach yields a power factor of 115 μW m−1 K−2 and a figure of merit of 0.17 at room temperature for the doped n-type 2DPP-2CNTVT:N-DMBI system. This power factor is 20 times larger than that of conventional doping approaches. Electronic devices based on conjugated polymers require a preferential molecular orientation to maximize performance. Here a self-induced anisotropy strategy is demonstrated that harnesses intermolecular forces between solvents, dopants and the polymer to orient the film, enabling an enhanced thermoelectric power factor.},

Despite immense efforts to scale down ferroelectric features, however, only few materials have been shown to exhibit ferroelectricity at the unit-cell level. Here we report a controllable unit-cell-scale domain in brownmillerite oxides consisting of alternating octahedral/tetrahedral layers. By combining atomic-scale imaging and in situ transmission electron microscopy, we directly probed sub-unit-cell-segmented ferroelectricity and investigated their switching characteristics. First-principles calculations confirm that the phonon modes related to oxygen octahedra are decoupled from those of the oxygen tetrahedra in brownmillerite oxides, and such localized oxygen tetrahedral phonons stabilize the sub-unit-cell-segmented ferroelectric domain. The unit-cell-wide ferroelectricity observed in our study could provide opportunities to design high-density memory devices using phonon decoupling. Scaling effects on ferroelectric domains could impact applications for next-generation miniaturized devices.

Here we report the intrinsic superconductivity and normal-state transport properties in compressively strained La2PrNi2O7 thin films, achieved through a combination of isovalent Pr substitution, growth optimization and precision ozone annealing. The superconducting onset occurs above 48 K, with zero resistance reached above 30 K, and the critical current density at 1.4 K is 100-fold larger than previous reports. The normal-state resistivity exhibits quadratic temperature dependence indicative of Fermi liquid behaviour, and other phenomenological similarities to transport in overdoped cuprates suggest parallels in their emergent properties.

Although possible, the detection of atomic-scale electron energy loss magnetic chiral dichroism in a scanning transmission electron microscope remains elusive due to challenges associated with convergent beam setups. Here we demonstrate the detection of atomic-scale electron energy loss magnetic chiral dichroism signals in a probe-corrected scanning transmission electron microscope. We not only determine the orbital-to-spin moments ratio for individual atomic planes of an iron crystal but also reveal its local variations at subatomic scales.

Visualizing lattice dynamics, which is typically done using time-resolved X-ray and electron diffraction techniques, yields information about the physical processes involved. However, the detection of atomic motion of an amplitude much less than a picometre has remained challenging. For this purpose, we suggest exploiting the acoustic pulse generated by a spatially localized ultrafast process in the surrounding volume. Its optical detection in a material possessing a narrow polariton resonance provides superior sensitivity. In the validating experiment, we detect the acoustic pulse generated by a 100 attometre thermal expansion of a 100 nanometre metallic film heated with a temperature increase of 0.2 kelvin by a femtosecond optical pulse. Even though the generated acoustic pulse carries dynamical strain with a magnitude of only 10−9, being injected into the polaritonic layer, it can be confidently detected through transient reflectivity. Polariton probing of high-frequency acoustic pulses enables the detection of coherent acoustic phonons, allowing the authors to monitor atomic motions in the 100 attometre range relative to their lattice position.},

As a classic example, rhombohedral-stacked (3R) two-dimensional materials exhibit ferroelectricity and optical nonlinearity that are non-existent in naturally abundant hexagonal-stacked (2H) counterparts. However, the ability to grow stacking-controlled large-area films remains challenging due to the thermodynamic competition of different polytypes. Here we report the chemical vapour deposition growth of two-inch wafer-scale 3R-MoS2 films with high phase purity by homoepitaxy on top of a crystalline monolayer MoS2. A defect-promoted nucleation mechanism was proposed, in which Mo-substituted sulfur vacancy is identified as one of the possible defects promoting 3R stacking. We fabricate ferroelectric semiconductor field-effect transistors with 3R-MoS2 channels and demonstrate non-volatile memory characteristics. The control of interlayer stacking is an essential step towards the large-scale production of two-dimensional materials for multifunctional integration.

  abstract     = {Atom-thin amorphous materials (for example, amorphous monolayer carbon) offer a designable material platform for fundamental studies of the disorder system, as well as the development of various applications. However, their growth at a single layer remains challenging since their thermodynamically favourable grains are neither two dimensional nor layered. Here we demonstrate the growth of 1-nm-thick, amorphous metal chalcogenides at a wafer scale using a nanodroplet-driven nanoribbon-to-film strategy. Metal clusters are initially liquified into 1–2 nm droplets at 120 °C, and they then orchestrate the growth of amorphous single-layer nanoribbons, which eventually merge into a continuous centimetre-scale film. Phase-field simulations, combined with our characterizations, suggest a non-equilibrium kinetic growth mechanism, which can be applicable to various films, for example, PtSex, IrSex, PdSex and RhSex. The synthesized films exhibit a range of unique properties, including tunable conductivity through disorder modulation, high work functions and remarkable catalytic activity, making them promising candidates for hole-injection contacts in p-type transistors and hydrogen production applications. This work opens a pathway for the synthesis of non-layered materials approaching the single-layer limit. The synthesis of atom-thin amorphous films remains challenging as their thermodynamically favourable grains are neither two dimensional nor layered. Here a droplet-driven nanoribbon-to-film growth strategy is reported to achieve amorphous metal chalcogenides at the single-layer limit.},

  abstract     = {Diamond possesses a suite of extraordinary properties, including unparalleled hardness, excellent thermal conductivity, a wide bandgap and optical transparency. These features render it essential for a broad spectrum of scientific and industrial applications. However, the inherent brittleness and limited toughness of diamond have posed substantial barriers to broader technological integration. Recent advances have demonstrated that engineered structural configurations—including nanotwinned diamond architectures, hierarchically structured nanotwinned diamond composites, graphite–diamond hybrids, diamond–graphene composites and amorphous diamond phases—can overcome these conventional limitations, exhibiting superior mechanical and physical properties. This Review examines the latest developments in diamond and its derivative materials, focusing on microstructural design strategies, phase transition mechanisms, opportunities to enhance properties and emergent phenomena. We also outline promising research directions and potential applications for diamond-based materials, advancing the frontiers of diamond-based technologies. Diamond-based materials present diverse microstructures that can be tailored to tune their properties.

  abstract     = {Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is associated with life-threatening and permanent disabilities. Given the limited capacity of neurons to regenerate, effective treatments for TBI are lacking. Neural stem cells (NSCs) can differentiate into fully functioning neurons and thus hold promise for TBI treatment. Nonetheless, NSC differentiation and proliferation are slow and inefficient. Studies have shown that piezoelectric stimulation is capable of promoting the differentiation and proliferation of NSCs. Here, we describe barium titanate–reduced graphene oxide (BTO/rGO) hybrid piezoelectric nanostickers that promote NSC proliferation and differentiation. These hybrid nanostickers attach to NSC membranes, serving as long-term generators of piezoelectric potentials upon ultrasound stimulation. BTO/rGO nanostickers promote rapid neuronal differentiation and maturation by activating the voltage-gated calcium channel/Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II/cAMP response element-binding protein pathways. Transplantation of NSCs with BTO/rGO nanostickers into the injured brain region of rats with TBI substantially repairs brain tissue and effectively restores physiological functions after 28 d following 5-min ultrasound irradiation every 2 d. These results demonstrate the potential of the combination of NSCs and BTO/rGO nanostickers for TBI treatment. Ultrasound-induced differentiation of neural stem cells into neurons using piezoelectric nanostickers achieves injury repair and effective restoration of physiological functions of rats with traumatic brain injury.},

  abstract     = {Cell–cell adhesions mediated by adherens junctions, structures connecting cells to each other and to the cortical cytoskeleton, are essential for epithelial physical and biological integrity. Nonetheless, how such structures resist mechanical stimuli that prompt cell–cell rupture is still not fully understood. Here we challenge the conventional views on cell–cell adhesion stability, highlighting the importance of viscous dissipation at the cellular level. Using microdevices to measure the rupture energy of cell–cell junctions and synthetic cadherins to discriminate cadherin binding energy from downstream cytoskeletal regulation, we demonstrate that the balance between cortical tension and cell shape recovery time determines a transition from ductile to brittle fracture in cell–cell contact. These findings suggest that junction toughness, defined as the junction disruption energy, is a more accurate measure of junctional stability, challenging the current emphasis on bond energy and tension. Overall, our results highlight the role and the regulation of energy dissipation through the cytoskeleton during junction deformation for epithelial integrity. Epithelial cell–cell contact resistance to mechanical stress is defined by a regulated viscous dissipation through the cytoskeleton, where the toughness of the cell junction is set by the balance between cortical tension and cell shape recovery time.},

  abstract     = {Structures in nature combine hard and soft materials in precise three-dimensional (3D) arrangements, imbuing bulk properties and functionalities that remain elusive to mimic synthetically. However, the potential for biomimetic analogues to seamlessly interface hard materials with soft interfaces has driven the demand for innovative chemistries and manufacturing approaches. Here, we report a liquid resin for rapid, high-resolution digital light processing (DLP) 3D printing of multimaterial objects with an unprecedented combination of strength, elasticity and resistance to ageing. A covalently bound hybrid epoxy–acrylate monomer precludes plasticization of soft domains, while a wavelength-selective photosensitizer accelerates cationic curing of hard domains. Using dual projection for multicolour DLP 3D printing, bioinspired metamaterial structures are fabricated, including hard springs embedded in a soft cylinder to adjust compressive behaviour and a detailed knee joint featuring ‘bones’ and ‘ligaments’ for smooth motion. Finally, a proof-of-concept device demonstrates selective stretching for electronics.

  abstract     = {Nanofluidics have led to the discovery of unconventional properties for water and ion transport at the nanoscale, but key challenges remain in their large-scale implementation. Here we report an osmotic resonance across macroscopic composite membranes made by the assembly of microporous and mesoporous layers, taking root from the rectified osmotic transport in nanopores. This osmotic diode induces ionic sieving and continuous fast macroscopic electro-osmotic transport. This is the basis for a versatile approach for water purification, by which fresh water is driven across a composite material under an a.c. electric field. Water flow is driven within the mesoporous layer, while selectivity is achieved within the microporous layer. The maximal rectified, diode-like water flow is found to be in the hertz range. Building on analytical predictions, we show that a conversion factor of up to ~15 equivalent bars per applied volt can be reached using appropriate materials. While nanofluidics demonstrate unconventional properties at the nanoscale, large-scale implementation remains challenging. The authors demonstrate macroscale resonant electro-osmotic transport in asymmetric membranes for advanced water filtration applications.},

However, their low optical damage thresholds have limited their use in nonlinear optics, particularly in stimulated Raman scattering. Here we demonstrate a general method to significantly amplify molecular vibrations in organic semiconductors by utilizing spectrally tailored gain from stimulated emission, bypassing the necessity for traditional optical cavities. This method achieves Raman thresholds as low as ~10–50 μJ cm−2 or ~2–10 kW cm−2, outperforming current Raman lasers by four orders of magnitude. The resulting nonlinear Raman response leads to cascaded Raman emission characterized by pump-dependent emission efficiency, a nonlinearity factor of 3.8, a signal-to-noise ratio of 30.9 dB and a bandwidth of 110 nm. Our study opens exciting prospects for the development of compact, efficient Raman amplifiers and lasers, leveraging the unique properties of organic semiconductors for advanced photonic applications, including high-sensitivity spectroscopy and versatile frequency conversion technologies.

  abstract     = {Argyrodite (Li6PS5Cl) is a promising electrolyte for high-performance solid-state lithium–sulfur batteries (SSSBs), which operate on the reversible conversion of S↔Li2S. However, argyrodite is electrochemically decomposed above 2.5 V versus Li+/Li on charge, because free S2− ions in the lattice are oxidized to sulfur at a similar potential as Li2S. Here we demonstrate that creating a strong interaction between the Li ions in argyrodite and the sulfur host synergistically suppresses the oxidation of argyrodite by inhibiting the extraction of Li+ in the initial step. A carbon nitride/N-doped graphene host serves as a proof of concept to demonstrate this effect. Additionally, its moderate electron transport enables SSSB operation and constrains electron mobility at the argyrodite interface. Consequently, SSSBs utilizing this host deliver excellent rate capability and stable long-term cycling compared with non-polar carbon materials. An areal capacity of 2 mAh cm−2 was achieved over 230 cycles at room temperature, whereas a high capacity of 11.3 mAh cm−2 was obtained with 90% retention at 60 °C. The descriptors presented here could enrich the understanding of solid electrolyte redox activities and guide interface and materials design in SSSBs. By utilizing a nitrogen-rich carbon host with good conductivity to kinetically limit Li-ion extraction and shift the potential for sulfide conversion to sulfur, argyrodite decomposition in solid-state lithium–sulfur batteries is largely suppressed. Li–S cells delivering an areal capacity of 11.3 mAh cm−2, with 90% retention over 200 cycles at lower areal capacity, are demonstrated.},

The temperature capability of dielectric polymers is limited to below 200 °C, lagging behind requirements for high-power and harsh-condition electronics. Here we report a molecular topology design for dielectric polymers with mechanical bonds that overcomes this obstacle, where cyclic polyethers are threaded onto the axles of various polyimides. From density functional theory and molecular dynamics calculations, we found that the local vibrations of the encircled polymer chains were damped by the cyclic molecules through mechanical bonding, substantially inhibiting the phonon-assisted interchain charge transport that dominates conduction loss when approaching the thermal extremes. At 250 °C, we experimentally observed a d.c. electrical resistivity four orders of magnitude greater than that of commercial polyimides, with the discharged energy density reaching 4.1 J cm−3 with 90% charge–discharge efficiency, exceeding conventional dielectric polymers and polymer composites. These findings open up opportunities for substantially promoting the temperature capability of dielectric polymers given the rich diversity of existing molecular topologies modified with mechanical bonds. Here a strategy is proposed to increase the temperature stability of polymer dielectrics by using mechanical bonding from cyclic polyethers to damp the local vibrations of polymer chains, thus inhibiting high-temperature charge transport and enabling a discharged energy density of 4.1 J cm−3 with 90% efficiency at 250 °C.},

  abstract     = {Relaxor ferroelectrics have been intensively studied during the past two decades for capacitive energy storage in modern electronics and electrical power systems. However, the energy density of relaxor ferroelectrics is fundamentally limited by early polarization saturation and largely reduced polarization despite high dielectric constants. To overcome this challenge, here we report the formation of a high-entropy superparaelectric phase in relaxor ferroelectric polymers induced by low-dose proton irradiation, which exhibits delayed polarization saturation, reduced ferroelectric loss and markedly improved polarizability. Our combined theoretical and experimental results reveal that new chemical bonds generated by the irradiation-induced chemical reactions are essential to the formation of the high-entropy state in ferroelectric polymers. The high-entropy superparaelectric phase endows the polymer with a substantially enhanced intrinsic energy density of 45.7 J cm–3 at room temperature, outperforming the current ferroelectric polymers and nanocomposites under the same electric field. Our work widens the high-entropy concept in ferroelectrics and lays the foundation for the future exploration of high-performance ferroelectric polymers. High-entropy systems can present a range of striking physical properties, but mainly involve metal alloys. Here, using low-energy proton irradiation, a high-entropy superparaelectric phase is generated in a relaxor ferroelectric composition, increasing polarizability and enabling a capacitive energy density of 45.7 J cm–3.},

  abstract     = {Spin–orbit coupling (SOC) has played an important role in many topological and correlated electron materials. In graphene-based systems, SOC induced by a transition metal dichalcogenide at close proximity has been shown to drive topological states and strengthen superconductivity. However, in rhombohedral multilayer graphene, a robust platform for electron correlation and topology, superconductivity and the role of SOC remain largely unexplored. Here we report transport measurements of transition metal dichalcogenide-proximitized rhombohedral trilayer graphene. We observed a hole-doped superconducting state SC4 with a critical temperature of 234 mK. On the electron-doped side, we noted an isospin-symmetry-breaking three-quarter-metal phase and observed that the nearby weak superconducting state SC3 is substantially enhanced. Surprisingly, the original superconducting state SC1 in bare rhombohedral trilayer graphene is strongly suppressed in the presence of transition metal dichalcogenide—opposite to the effect of SOC on all other graphene superconductivities. Our observations form the basis of exploring superconductivity and non-Abelian quasiparticles in rhombohedral graphene devices. The authors present transport measurements of rhombohedral trilayer graphene proximitized by transition metal dichalcogenides. They find that the presence of transition metal dichalcogenides enables the emergence of new superconducting and metallic phases and affects the superconducting states present in bare rhombohedral trilayer graphene.},

Since the spin polarization of an electric-field-induced non-equilibrium spin accumulation in conventional spin-source materials is restricted to be in the film plane, the ensuing UMR can only respond to the in-plane component of magnetization. However, magnets with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy are highly desired for magnetic memory and spin-logic devices, whereas the electrical read-out of perpendicular magnetic anisotropy magnets through UMR is critically missing. Here we report the discovery of an unconventional UMR in the heterostructures of a topological semimetal (WTe2) and a perpendicular magnetic anisotropy ferromagnetic insulator (Cr2Ge2Te6), which allows to electrically read the up and down magnetic states of the Cr2Ge2Te6 layer through longitudinal resistance measurements.

Using terahertz light resonant with optical transitions of its flat bands, we observe bulk photocurrents driven by broken symmetries and reveal the interplay between electron interactions and quantum geometry. We observe inversion-breaking gapped states undetectable through quantum transport, sharp changes in the polarization axes caused by interaction-induced band renormalization and recurring photocurrent patterns at integer filling factors of the moiré unit cell that track the evolution of quantum geometry through the cascade of phase transitions. The large and tunable terahertz response intrinsic to flat-band systems offers direct insights into the quantum geometry of interacting electrons and paves the way for innovative terahertz quantum technologies. Exploiting the intrinsic response of magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene to resonant terahertz radiation, the interplay between electron interactions and quantum geometry is studied in such flat-band systems.},

Correlated materials that host excitons coupled to other degrees of freedom could offer pathways for controlling these interactions. Here we demonstrate magnon-mediated interactions between excitons in CrSBr, an antiferromagnetic semiconductor. These interactions manifest as the dependence of the exciton energy on the exciton density via a magnonic adjustment of the spin canting angle.

  abstract     = {Stacking two atomic crystals with a twist between their crystal axes produces moiré potentials that modify the electronic properties. Here we show that double-moiré potentials generated by superposing three atomic crystals create a unique class of tunable quasiperiodic structures that alter the symmetry and spatial distribution of the electronic wavefunctions. By using scanning tunnelling microscopy and scanning tunnelling spectroscopy to study twisted bilayer graphene on hexagonal boron nitride, we unveil a moiré phase diagram defined by the lattice constants of the two moiré lattices (graphene-on-graphene and graphene-on-hexagonal boron nitride), comprising both commensurate periodic and incommensurate quasiperiodic crystals. Remarkably, the 1:1 commensurate crystals, which should theoretically exist at only one point on this phase diagram, are observed over a wide range, demonstrating an unexpected self-alignment mechanism. The incommensurate crystals include quasicrystals, which are quasiperiodic and feature a Bravais-forbidden dodecagonal symmetry, and intercrystals, which are also quasiperiodic but lack forbidden symmetries. This rich variety of tunable double-moiré structures offers a synthetic platform for exploring the unique electronic properties of quasiperiodic crystals, which are rarely found in nature. A class of moiré quasiperiodic crystals with unexpected electronic properties is presented, exhibiting flat bands and correlation-induced gaps that signal the emergence of correlated quantum states.},

  abstract     = {Ohm’s law has been a cornerstone of electronics since its experimental discovery. This law establishes that, in a conductive system, the voltage is directly proportional to the current. Even when time-reversal symmetry is disrupted, leading to the emergence of magnetoresistance and Hall effects, the linear relationship between voltage and current remains intact. However, recent experiments have demonstrated a breakdown of Ohm’s law in non-centrosymmetric structures. In these systems, nonlinear transport effects are permitted with quadratic scaling between voltages and currents. Here we review the main demonstrations of nonlinear transport in non-centrosymmetric systems, analysing the connection between nonlinear behaviour and the system’s symmetry. We also investigate the microscopic mechanisms driving these effects, such as Berry curvature dipole and Berry connection polarizability. Finally, we highlight potential applications of nonlinear transport in spintronics and energy harvesting. There has been substantial progress in observing and understanding nonlinear transport properties of non-centrosymmetric materials in recent years. This Review surveys the interplay between symmetry and nonlinear phenomena, and how nonlinear transport probes quantum properties of solids. The authors also highlight the potential applications of these nonlinear transport effects in fields such as spintronics, orbitronics and energy harvesting.},

Although studies have established the role of biochemical mechanisms in this process, due to challenges in measuring forces in these systems, how mechanical forces determine the competition outcome remains unclear. Here we report a form of cell competition that is regulated by differences in force transmission capabilities, selecting for cell types with stronger intercellular adhesion. Direct force measurements in ex vivo tissues and different cell lines reveal that there is an increased mechanical activity at the interface between two competing cell types, which can lead to large stress fluctuations resulting in upward forces and cell elimination. We show how a winning cell type endowed with a stronger intercellular adhesion exhibits higher resistance to elimination and benefiting from efficient force transmission to the neighbouring cells. This cell elimination mechanism could have broad implications for keeping the strong force transmission ability for maintaining tissue boundaries and cell invasion pathology. Differences in force transmission capabilities between competing cells create large stress fluctuation at their interface, resulting in upward forces and cell elimination, which might have implications for tissue homeostasis and tumour cell invasion.},

  abstract     = {Mechanical factors such as stress in the extracellular environment affect the phenotypic commitment of cells. Stress fields experienced by cells in tissues are multiaxial, but how cells integrate such information is largely unknown. Here we report that the anisotropy of stress fields is a critical factor triggering a phenotypic transition in fibroblast cells, outweighing the role of stress amplitude, a factor previously described to modulate such a transition. Combining experimental and computational approaches, we identified a self-reinforcing mechanism in which cellular protrusions interact with collagen fibres to establish tension anisotropy. This anisotropy, in turn, stabilizes the protrusions and enhances their contractile forces. Disruption of this self-reinforcing process, either by reducing tension anisotropy or by inhibiting contractile protrusions, prevents the phenotypic conversion of fibroblasts to contractile myofibroblasts. Overall, our findings support stress anisotropy as a factor modulating cellular responses, expanding our understanding of the role of mechanical forces in biological processes. Extracellular anisotropic stresses trigger fibroblast transition into myofibroblasts by the mechanical self-reinforcement of cell–extracellular matrix interactions.},

  abstract     = {Mechanical metamaterials can achieve high stiffness and strength at low densities, but often at the expense of low ductility and stretchability—a persistent trade-off in materials. In contrast, double-network hydrogels feature interpenetrating compliant and stiff polymer networks, and exhibit unprecedented combinations of high stiffness and stretchability, resulting in exceptional toughness. Here we present double-network-inspired metamaterials by integrating monolithic truss (stiff) and woven (compliant) components into a metamaterial architecture, which achieves a tenfold increase in stiffness and stretchability compared to its pure counterparts. Nonlinear computational mechanics models elucidate that enhanced energy dissipation in these double-network-inspired metamaterials stems from increased frictional dissipation due to entanglements between networks. Through introduction of internal defects, which typically degrade mechanical properties, we demonstrate a threefold increase in energy dissipation for these metamaterials via failure delocalization. This work opens avenues for developing metamaterials in a high-compliance regime inspired by polymer network topologies. Inspired by the entangled structure of double-network hydrogels, the authors integrate stiff truss and compliant woven components into metamaterial architectures to realize simultaneous high stiffness and high stretchability.},

Constructing similar dynamic processes in vitro presents opportunities for developing life-like intelligent soft materials. Here we report an active fluid formed from the liquid–liquid phase separation of photoresponsive DNA nanomachines. The photofluids can orchestrate and amplify nanoscale mechanical movements by orders of magnitude to produce macroscopic cell-like behaviours including elongation, division and rotation. We identify two dissipative processes in the DNA droplets, photoalignment and photofibrillation, which are crucial for harnessing stochastic molecular motions cooperatively. Our results demonstrate an active liquid molecular system that consumes photoenergy to create ordered out-of-equilibrium structures and behaviours. This system may help elucidate the physical principles underlying cooperative motion in active matter and pave the way for developing programmable interactive materials. Artificial DNA photofluids exhibit dissipative life-like motion when fuelled by light in space and time, converting photoenergy into out-of-equilibrium structures on the macroscale.},

Organic light-emitting transistors, as three-terminal electroluminescent devices, offer advantages in simplifying device architecture and achieving high efficiency under gate regulation. However, achieving high efficiency and narrow emission remains a challenge. Here we demonstrate that laterally integrated organic light-emitting transistors with intrinsic multiple-order microcavities can enhance efficiency and narrow emission with a universal capability for different emitters. Full-width at half-maximum values of 18 nm for red, 14 nm for green and 13 nm for blue were achieved with a maximum narrowed degree of 68%. This resulted in an impressive BT.2020 colour gamut of 97%. The peak current efficiency or blue index values for red, green and blue organic light-emitting transistors reached 26.3 cd A−1, 37.3 cd A−1 and 72.6, respectively. Moreover, organic light-emitting transistors exhibit much narrower emission and higher efficiency than equivalent, comparable devices due to their unique gate regulation capability. Our work could enable smart display technologies with high colour purity and enhanced efficiency. Achieving both high efficiency and narrow emission in organic light-emitting transistors (OLETs) remains a challenge.

  abstract     = {Dealloying reactions underpin the operation of next-generation battery electrodes and are also a synthesis route for porous metals, but the influence of mechanical stress on these processes is not well understood. Here we investigate how the applied stack pressure affects structural evolution and electrochemical reversibility during the alloying/dealloying of Li alloy materials (Li–Al, Li–Sn, Li–In and Li–Si) using solid-state and liquid electrolytes. The extent of porosity formation during the dealloying of metals is found to be universally governed by stack pressure, with pressures of at least 20% of the yield strength required to achieve ~80% relative density. This concept is correlated to the cycling of alloy electrodes in solid-state batteries, with a yield-strength-dependent threshold pressure needed for reversible high Li-storage capacity due to densification. With this understanding, we design Al and Si anodes with a densified interfacial layer enabling stable cycling at low stack pressures (2 MPa), providing guidance towards practical high-energy solid-state batteries. Stack pressure controls porosity during Li alloying/dealloying. A threshold pressure is needed for the densification and stable cycling of Li alloys in batteries, leading to the design of Li alloy anodes with densified interfacial layers for cycling at low pressures in solid-state batteries.},

Here we report a trimetallic-copper-based catalyst, consisting of copper nitride doped with gold nanoparticles and isolated silver atoms, with high selectivity for the formation of C2+ alcohols (Faradic efficiency for ethanol + n-propanol is &gt;70%), within gas-fed flow cells at high current densities. Although active sites are metallic Cu(111) copper atoms derived from copper nitride, gold and silver doping suppresses ethylene formation due to the increased carbophibicity of the catalyst surface, as shown computationally.

Here we report an isolation strategy to preserve highly dispersed ultrafine NPs under extremely harsh conditions. Oxide nano-islands were grafted between the catalyst support and metal NPs, serving as a general approach by following a charge attraction principle. Specifically, LaOx nano-islands were ideally suited for stabilizing Ru NPs among the synthetic library, exhibiting strong adhesion to minimize the chemical potential and disconnect the sintering path. Thus, ultrafine Ru NPs in Ru/LaOx–SiO2 were isolated, maintaining a mean size of 1.4 nm in CO- and H2-rich atmosphere during efficient catalysis for methane dry reforming at 800 °C for 400 h. This isolation strategy has proved effective for many other metals on various supports, paving a practical way for the design of sintering-resistant catalysts. An isolation strategy is presented to improve the stability of metal nanoparticles by grafting oxide nano-islands between the support and the nanoparticles. This enhances sintering resistance, with the mean size of the nanoparticles maintained at 1.4 nm after 400 h of catalytic dry reforming of methane.},

However, the effect of the Pearl vortex on a large enhancement in the kinetic inductance has not been fully explored. Here we discovered Pearl inductance, an additional form of kinetic inductance arising from geometrical structuring of high-superconducting-transition-temperature (Tc) YBCO superconductor thin films at the Pearl length scale. This results from an extension of vortex screening supercurrents from λL to 14λL in an ultrathin metamaterial resonator of thickness λL/7, enabling terahertz superinductance. Our device shows impedance exceeding the quantum resistance limit RQ = 6.47 kΩ by 33%, offering possibilities for cutting-edge electronic, photonic and quantum devices.

Hexagonal transition metal dichalcogenides induce valley Zeeman spin–orbit coupling in graphene, creating spin lifetime anisotropy between in-plane and out-of-plane spin orientations. However, in-plane spin lifetimes remain isotropic due to the inherent heterostructure’s three-fold symmetry. Here we demonstrate that pentagonal PdSe2, with its unique in-plane anisotropy, induces anisotropic gate-tunable spin–orbit coupling in graphene. This enables a tenfold modulation of spin lifetimes at room temperature, depending on the in-plane spin orientation. Moreover, the directional dependence of the spin lifetimes, along the three spatial directions, reveals a persistent in-plane spin texture component that governs the spin dynamics. These findings advance our understanding of spin physics in van der Waals heterostructures and pave the way for designing topological phases in graphene-based heterostructures in the strong spin–orbit coupling regime.

These properties are constant across this frequency range in LN, but have a strong frequency dependence in BTO. Still, our measurements show that BTO has remarkable electro-optic properties compared with LN. Furthermore, we show how BTO devices can be designed with a flat electro-optic frequency response despite the Pockels coefficient dispersion. Finally, we expound our method for broadband characterization of these vital electro-optic properties, utilizing specialized integrated electro-optic phase shifters. Altogether, this work empowers the design of high-speed BTO devices and the development of new electro-optic materials.

However, mainstream CPL detectors rely on chiral absorptive materials, and thus suffer from limited response wavelengths, low responsivity and poor discrimination ratios. Here we present a chiral light detector by utilizing valley materials to observe the spin angular momentum carried by chiral light. Delicately designed centrosymmetric metamaterials that can preserve the sign of optical spin angular momentum and greatly enhance its intensity in the near field are harnessed as a medium to inject polarized electrons into valley materials, which are then detected by the valley Hall effect. This enables high-sensitivity infrared CPL detection at room temperature by valleytronic transistors, and the detection wavelength is extended to the infrared. This approach opens pathways for chiral light detection and provides insights into potential applications of valleytronics in optoelectronic sensing.

  abstract     = {The layered lanthanide oxychloride (LnOCl) family, featuring a low equivalent oxide thickness, high breakdown field and magnetic ordering properties, holds great promise for next-generation van der Waals devices. However, the exploitation of LnOCl materials has been hindered by a lack of reliable methods for growing their single-crystalline phases. Here we achieved the growth of inch-sized bulk LnOCl single crystals and single-crystalline thin films with thickness down to the monolayer in a few hours. The monolayer LnOCl exhibits ultralow equivalent oxide thicknesses, for instance, LaOCl and SmOCl have values of 0.25 and 0.34, respectively. Furthermore, using LnOCl as a dielectric in graphene devices, we demonstrate wafer-scale enhancement of carrier mobility and a well-developed quantum Hall effect. The induced strong magnetic proximity effect by SmOCl and DyOCl enables efficient interfacial charge transfer with magnetic exchange coupling This work provides a general strategy for synthesizing large-sized single-crystalline layered materials, enriching the library of ultralow-equivalent-oxide-thickness dielectric materials, and two-dimensional magnetic materials with induced strong magnetic proximity effect. Inch-sized bulk lanthanide oxychloride single crystals and single-crystalline thin films with thickness down to the monolayer are synthesized through flux-enabled oriented attachment, providing a library of van der Waals materials with interesting dielectric and quantum properties.},

  abstract     = {The stacking sequence of two-dimensional hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) is a critical factor that determines its polytypes and its distinct physical properties. Although most hBN layers adopt the thermodynamically stable AA′ stacking sequence, achieving alternative stacking configurations has remained a long-standing challenge. Here we demonstrate the scalable synthesis of hBN featuring unprecedented AA stacking, where atomic monolayers align along the c axis without any translation or rotation. This previously considered thermodynamically unfavourable hBN polytype is achieved through epitaxial growth on a two-inch single-crystalline gallium nitride wafer, using a metal–organic chemical vapour deposition technique. Comprehensive structural and optical characterizations, complemented by theoretical modelling, evidence the formation of AA-stacked multilayer hBN and reveal that hBN nucleation on the vicinal gallium nitride surface drives the unidirectional alignment of layers. Here electron doping plays a central role in stabilizing the AA stacking configuration. Our findings provide further insights into the scalable synthesis of engineered hBN polytypes, characterized by unique properties such as large optical nonlinearity. Metal–organic chemical vapour deposition enables the wafer-scale growth of hexagonal boron nitride with an AA stacking sequence that was previously considered thermodynamically unfavourable.},

Here, by simply coupling the thermal activation with a simultaneously applied electric field, we efficiently generate ordered oxygen vacancies within bulk crystals of ternary SrAl2O4, binary TiO2 and other common oxide materials, which give rise to superior functionalities. We expect that this approach offers a general and practical way for the vacancy engineering of oxide materials and holds great promise for their applications.

Selected materials examples, which are relevant for electrochemical devices (for example, low- and intermediate-temperature fuel cells) or which are of fundamental interest (such as molecular water acting as dopant in a lithium halide), are treated in more detail. Interrelations between hydration and electronic defects are also briefly touched upon. The uptake of water by polar solids can modify electrical and mass transport properties.

We optimize the microneedle design for both a reliable delivery of messenger RNA (mRNA) therapeutics and the near-infrared fluorescent microparticles that encode the on-patient medical record-keeping. Deep learning-based image processing enables encoding and decoding of the information with excellent temporal and spatial robustness. Long-term studies in a swine model demonstrate the safety, efficacy and reliability of this approach for the co-delivery of on-patient medical record-keeping and the mRNA vaccine encoding severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). This technology could help healthcare workers make informed decisions in circumstances where reliable record-keeping is unavailable, thus contributing to global healthcare equity.

The formed crystal is achiral, but is composed of chiral bilayers with alternating handedness. The left- and right-handed chirality of the bilayers, combined with the plasmonic nature of the gold tetrahedra, produces chiroptical responses at the crystal surface. We uncover that the hydrophobic substrate facilitates the arrangement of tetrahedra into irregular ring-like patterns, creating a critical, uneven topography to stabilize the observed octo-diamond structure. This study reveals a potent way to affect colloidal crystallization through particle–substrate interactions, expanding the nanoparticle self-assembly toolbox. A superlattice structure of gold tetrahedra formed via a surface-promoted pathway is reported. The octo-diamond crystal is achiral, but exhibits bilayers of left- and right-handed chiral motifs with chiroptical plasmonic responses.},

  abstract     = {It is widely acknowledged that constructing small injection barriers for balanced electron and hole injections is essential for light-emitting diodes (LEDs). However, in highly efficient LEDs based on metal halide perovskites, a seemingly large hole injection barrier is usually observed. Here we rationalize this high efficiency through a surfactant-induced effect where the hole concentration at the perovskite surface is enhanced to enable sufficient bimolecular recombination pathways with injected electrons. This effect originates from the additive engineering and is verified by a series of optical and electrical measurements. In addition, surfactant additives that induce an increased hole concentration also significantly improve the luminescence yield, an important parameter for the efficient operation of perovskite LEDs. Our results not only provide rational design rules to fabricate high-efficiency perovskite LEDs but also present new insights to benefit the design of other perovskite optoelectronic devices.

  abstract     = {The electron-transporting material (ETM) is a key component of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) optimizing electron extraction from perovskite to cathode. Fullerenes, specifically C60 and [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM), have been used as the benchmark ETMs for inverted PSCs. However, C60 is restricted to thermal evaporation, and PCBM suffers from poor photothermal stability and suboptimal electron transport, limiting their PSC applications. Here a solution-processable non-fullerene ETM, cyano-functionalized bithiophene imide dimer (CNI2)-based polymer (PCNI2-BTI), holds multiple advantages, including excellent photothermal stability, efficient electron transport and improved interaction with the perovskite layer. Consequently, inverted PSCs incorporating PCNI2-BTI deliver an outstanding power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 26.0% (certified 25.4%) and remarkable operational stability, with a T80 approaching 1,300 h under ISOS-L-3. Moreover, we synthesize three additional CNI2-based polymer ETMs, yielding an average PCE of &gt;25% in PSCs. These findings demonstrate unprecedented potential of non-fullerene ETMs enabling high-performance and stable PSCs. The benchmark fullerene-based electron-transporting materials (ETMs) for inverted perovskite solar cells are often limited by thermal evaporation or stability issues. Here the authors report solution-processable non-fullerene ETMs with improved device stability and efficiency.},

Identifying these changes is crucial for determining how morphology controls catalytic properties but the mechanisms by which operating conditions shape the catalyst’s working state are not yet fully understood. In this study, we show using correlated operando microscopy and spectroscopy that as well-defined Cu2O cubes evolve under electrochemical nitrate reduction reaction conditions, distinct catalyst motifs are formed depending on the applied potential and the chemical environment. By further matching the timescales of morphological changes observed via electrochemical liquid cell transmission electron microscopy with time-resolved chemical state information obtained from operando transmission soft X-ray microscopy, hard X-ray absorption spectroscopy and Raman spectroscopy, we reveal that Cu2O can be kinetically stabilized alongside metallic copper for extended durations under moderately reductive conditions due to surface hydroxide formation. Finally, we rationalize how the interaction between the electrolyte and the catalyst influences the ammonia selectivity. Studies based on correlated operando characterization techniques reveal the coexistence of copper metal, oxide and hydroxide phases during the electrochemical reduction of nitrates to ammonia, providing insights into electrocatalyst evolution during reaction and related catalytic performance.},

  abstract     = {Electrocatalysts support crucial industrial processes and emerging decarbonization technologies, but their design is hindered by structural and compositional changes during operation, especially at application-relevant current densities. Here we use operando X-ray spectroscopy and modelling to track, and eventually direct, the reconstruction of iron sulfides and oxides for the oxygen evolution reaction. We show that inappropriate activation protocols lead to uncontrollable Fe oxidation and irreversible catalyst degradation, compromising stability and reliability and precluding predictive design. Based on these, we develop activation programming strategies that, considering the thermodynamics and kinetics of surface reconstruction, offer control over precatalyst oxidation. This enables reliable predictions and the design of active and stable electrocatalysts. In a NixFe1−xS2 model system, this leads to a threefold improvement in durability after programmed activation, with a cell degradation rate of 0.12 mV h−1 over 550 h (standard operation: 0.29 mV h−1, constrained to 200 h), in an anion exchange membrane water electrolyser operating at 1 A cm−2. This work bridges predictive modelling and experimental design, improving the electrocatalyst reliability for industrial water electrolysis and beyond at high current densities. Predictive electrocatalyst design is challenged by uncontrollable precatalyst reconstruction during operation. Here, informed by operando spectroscopies, activation protocols are developed to stabilize surfaces and improve catalyst reliability.},

  abstract     = {Anionic redox has reshaped the conventional way of exploring advanced cathode materials for Li-ion batteries. However, how anions participate in the redox process has been the subject of intensive debate, evolving from electron holes to O–O dimerization and currently to a focus on trapped molecular O2 based on high-resolution resonant X-ray inelastic scattering research. Here we show that the resonant X-ray inelastic scattering signal of molecular O2 is not exclusive to Li-rich oxide cathodes, but appears consistently in O-redox-inactive oxide materials even with a short beam exposure time as low as 1 min, indicating that molecular O2 species are not directly related to voltage hysteresis and voltage decay. We further demonstrated that molecular O2 is not a direct product of electrochemistry but more likely a consequence of the core excitation process in resonant X-ray inelastic scattering, for which the possible scenarios of the dissociation of ‘M-(O–O)’-like species on beam excitation must be considered. Collectively, our results reconcile the conflicting reported results on the (non-)observation of molecular O2 signal collected from different beamlines and suggest that molecular O2 is not the energetic engine of new battery oxide cathodes. Resonant inelastic X-ray scattering measurements suggest that the oxidized oxygen species in high-energy Li-rich oxide cathodes are trapped molecular O2, which is also observed in O-redox-inactive materials. This suggests that resonant X-ray inelastic scattering measurements generate these species, and molecular O2 is not responsible for voltage hysteresis and decay.},

However, its widespread application is hindered by long-term stability issues, particularly at the electrode–thermoelectric material interface. Here we address this challenge by constructing an atomic-scale direct bonding interface. By forming robust chemical bonds between Co and Sb atoms, we develop MgAgSb/Co thermoelectric junctions with a low interfacial resistivity (2.5 µΩ cm2), high bonding strength (60.6 MPa) and high thermal stability at 573 K. This thermally stable and ohmic contact interface enables MgAgSb-based thermoelectric modules to achieve a conversion efficiency of 10.2% at a temperature difference of 287 K and to exhibit negligible degradation over 1,440 h of thermal cycling. Our findings underscore the critical role of atomic-scale interface engineering in advancing thermoelectric semiconductor devices, enabling more efficient and durable thermoelectric modules. Solid-state thermoelectrics can convert waste heat to electrical energy, but applications are hindered by long-term stability issues.

  abstract     = {Dislocations in van der Waals (vdW) layered nanomaterials induce strain and structural changes that substantially impact thermal transport. Understanding these effects could enable the manipulation of dislocations for improved thermoelectric and optoelectronic applications, but experimental insights remain limited. In this study, we use synthetic Eshelby twisted vdW GeS nanowires (NWs) with single screw dislocations as a model system to explore the interplay between dislocation-induced structural modifications and lattice thermal conductivity. Our measurements reveal a monoclinic structure stabilized by the dislocation, leading to a substantial drop in thermal conductivity for larger-diameter NWs (70% at room temperature), supported by first-principles calculations. Interestingly, we also find an anomalous enhancement of thermal conductivity with decreasing diameter in twisted NWs, contrary to typical trends in non-twisted GeS NWs. This is attributed to increased conductivity near the NW cores due to compressive strain around the central dislocations, and aligns with a density-functional-theory-informed core–shell model. Our results highlight the critical role of dislocations in thermal conduction, providing fundamental insights for defect and strain engineering in advanced thermal applications. The thermal transport properties of Eshelby twisted van der Waals GeS nanowire are investigated as model systems for thermal transport. The thermal conductivity of these systems are found to display anomalous behaviour with thermal conductivity with decreased nanowire diameter.},

  abstract     = {Antiferromagnetic Heisenberg chains exhibit two distinct types of excitation spectrum: gapped for integer-spin chains and gapless for half-integer-spin chains. However, in finite-length half-integer-spin chains, quantization induces a gap, requiring precise control over sufficiently long chains to study its evolution. Here we create length-controlled spin-1/2 Heisenberg chains by covalently linking Olympicenes—Olympic-ring-shaped magnetic nanographenes. With large exchange interactions, tunable lengths and negligible magnetic anisotropy, this system is ideal for investigating length-dependent spin excitations, probed via inelastic electron tunnelling spectroscopy. We observe a power-law decay of the lowest excitation energy with length L, following a 1/L dependence in the large-L regime, consistent with theory. For L = 50, a V-shaped excitation continuum confirms a gapless behaviour in the thermodynamic limit. Additionally, low-bias current maps reveal the standing wave of a single spinon in odd-numbered chains. Our findings provide evidence for the realization of a one-dimensional analogue of a gapless spin liquid within an artificial graphene lattice. Open-shell nanographenes are used to fabricate length-controlled antiferromagnetic spin-1/2 Heisenberg chains. It is revealed that the spin excitation spectra evolve from gapped to gapless following a power-law dependence on chain length, along with the visualization of the standing waves of confined single spinons.},

Ti4MnBi2 is inherently frustrated, forming near a quantum critical point that separates different phases at temperature T = 0. One-dimensional magnetism dominates at the lowest T, and is barely affected by weak interchain coupling. Ti4MnBi2 is a previously unrecognized metallic spin chain in which 3D conduction electrons become strongly correlated due to their coupling to 1D magnetic moments. The authors report that the metallic spin-1/2 chain compound Ti4MnBi2 forms near a quantum critical point with inherent frustration.

  abstract     = {Thermal transport across solid–solid interfaces is vital for advanced electronic and photonic applications, yet conventional conduction pathways often restrict performance. In polar crystals, hybridized vibrational modes called phonon polaritons offer a promising avenue to overcome the limitations of intrinsic phonon heat conduction. Here our work demonstrates that volume-confined hyperbolic phonon polariton (HPhP) modes can transfer energy across solid–solid interfaces at rates far exceeding phonon–phonon conduction. Using pump–probe thermoreflectance with a mid-infrared, tunable probe pulse with subpicosecond resolution, we remotely and selectively observe HPhP modes in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) via broadband radiative heating from a gold source. Our measurements ascertain that hot electrons impinging at the interface radiate directly into the HPhPs of hBN in the near field, bypassing the phonon–phonon transport pathway. Such polaritonic coupling enables thermal transport speeds in solids orders of magnitude faster than possible through diffusive phonon processes. We thereby showcase a pronounced thermal transport enhancement across the gold–hBN interface via phonon–polariton coupling, advancing the limits of interfacial heat transfer. The authors report subnanosecond thermal transport on a gold–hexagonal boron nitrite interface governed by hyperbolic phonon–polariton coupling, demonstrating a cooling mechanism orders of magnitude faster than those relying on phonon-mediated processes.},

The p-type nature is due to the strong suborbital hybridization of Bi 6s26p3 with O 2p4 at the crystal’s M-point valence band maximum. Our work can be used as a reference that adds more 2D non-layered materials to the 2D toolkit and shows 2D β-Bi2O3 to be promising candidate for future electronics. High-quality, non-layered 2D β-Bi2O3 crystals are grown using a vapour–liquid–solid–solid growth technique. These crystals demonstrate promising properties for p-channel field-effect transistors.},

  abstract     = {Organic molecular crystals encompass a vast range of materials from pharmaceuticals to organic optoelectronics, proteins and waxes in biological and industrial settings. Crystal defects from grain boundaries to dislocations are known to play key roles in mechanisms of growth1,2 and in the functional properties of molecular crystals3–5. In contrast to the precise analysis of individual defects in metals, ceramics and inorganic semiconductors enabled by electron microscopy, substantially greater ambiguity remains in the experimental determination of individual dislocation character and slip systems in molecular materials3. In large part, nanoscale dislocation analysis in molecular crystals has been hindered by the low electron doses required to avoid irreversibly degrading these crystals6. Here we present a low-dose, single-exposure approach enabling nanometre-resolved analysis of individual dislocations in molecular crystals. We demonstrate the approach for a range of crystal types to reveal dislocation character and operative slip systems unambiguously. A low-dose, single-exposure electron diffraction approach is used to reveal the dislocation character and operative slip systems in beam-sensitive molecular crystals.},

  abstract     = {Anode-free solid-state batteries contain no active material at the negative electrode in the as-manufactured state, yielding high energy densities for use in long-range electric vehicles. The mechanisms governing charge–discharge cycling of anode-free batteries are largely controlled by electro-chemo-mechanical phenomena at solid–solid interfaces, and there are important mechanistic differences when compared with conventional lithium-excess batteries. This Perspective provides an overview of the factors governing lithium nucleation, growth, stripping and cycling in anode-free solid-state batteries, including mechanical deformation of lithium, the chemical and mechanical properties of the current collector, microstructural effects, and stripping dynamics. Pathways for engineering interfaces to maximize performance and extend battery lifetime are discussed. We end with critical research questions to pursue, including understanding behaviour at low stack pressure, tailoring interphase growth, and engineering current collectors and interlayers. Anode-free batteries contain no active material at the negative electrode when manufactured, and this can enable them to have high energy density. This Perspective presents a critical overview of the mechanisms governing the behaviour of anode-free solid-state batteries and provides guidance to improve this type of battery.},

  abstract     = {Pneumonia is a ubiquitous disease caused by viral and bacterial infections, characterized by high levels of reactive oxygen species in inflamed areas. Therapeutic strategies targeting reactive oxygen species levels in pneumonia have limited success due to the intricate nature of lung tissues and lung inflammatory responses. Here we describe an inhalable, non-invasive therapeutic platform composed of engineered cerium-based tannic acid nanozymes bound to a self-assembling peptide. In vitro and in vivo studies show that the nanozyme is internalized mostly by activated macrophages and epithelial cells in the inflamed sites. In the oxidative environments of a mouse model of viral pneumonia, nanozyme aggregates into catalytically active structures that reduce reactive oxygen species levels and inflammatory cytokine production and promote macrophage polarization to the prohealing (M2) phenotype. Moreover, the nanozyme attenuates bacterial inflammation and reduces tissue damage in a mouse viral pneumonia model with secondary bacterial infection. Overall, this nanozyme platform is a promising strategy for treating pneumonia and its associated conditions. Inhalable nanozymes aggregate and become active in inflamed sites in the lungs, decreasing reactive oxygen species and inflammatory cytokines, and promoting macrophage polarization to alleviate viral pneumonia and secondary bacterial infection.},

  abstract     = {Antithrombotic surfaces that prevent coagulation activation without interfering with haemostasis are required for blood-contacting devices. Such materials would restrain device-induced thrombogenesis and decrease the need for anticoagulant use, thereby reducing unwanted bleeding. Here, by optimizing the interactions with coagulation factor XII rather than preventing its surface adsorption, we develop a substrate-independent antithrombotic polymeric coating with sheltered positive charges. The antithrombic properties of the coating were demonstrated in vitro with human blood and in vivo using a carotid artery–jugular vein shunt model in rabbits. The coating exhibits a strong interaction with factor XII, but results in a low reciprocal activation of the contact pathway that triggers clot formation. These findings contradict the prevailing strategy of designing antithrombotic materials through protein-repelling surfaces. Overall, the polymeric coating we describe can benefit most blood-contacting devices and is a useful engineering guideline for designing surfaces with improved antithrombotic properties. A polymeric coating with sheltered positive charges establishes strong interactions with coagulation factor XII without inducing surface-induced coagulation activation, being a promising antithrombotic coating for biomedical devices.},

  abstract     = {Cells use ‘active’ energy-consuming motor and filament protein networks to control micrometre-scale transport and fluid flows. Biological active materials could be used in dynamically programmable devices that achieve spatial and temporal resolution that exceeds current microfluidic technologies. However, reconstituted motor–microtubule systems generate chaotic flows and cannot be directly harnessed for engineering applications. Here we develop a light-controlled programming strategy for biological active matter to construct micrometre-scale fluid flow fields for transport, separation and mixing. We circumvent nonlinear dynamic effects within the active fluids by limiting hydrodynamic interactions between contracting motor–filament networks patterned with light. Using a predictive model, we design and apply flow fields to accomplish canonical microfluidic tasks such as transporting and separating cell clusters, probing the extensional rheology of polymers and giant lipid vesicles and generating mixing flows at low Reynolds numbers. Our findings provide a framework for programming dynamic flows and demonstrate the potential of active matter systems as an engineering technology. Light-controlled motor–microtubule systems are used to construct micrometre-scale fluid flows for programmable transport, separation and mixing.},

  abstract     = {The scission of chemical bonds in materials can lead to catastrophic failure, with weak bonds typically undermining the materials’ strength. Here we demonstrate how weak bonds can be leveraged to achieve self-strengthening in polymer network materials. These weak sacrificial bonds trigger mechanochemical reactions, forming new networks rapidly enough to reinforce the material during deformation and significantly improve crack resistance. This rapid strengthening exhibits strong rate dependence, dictated by the interplay between bond breaking and the kinetics of force-induced network formation. As the network formation is generally applicable to diverse monomers and crosslinkers with different kinetics, a wide range of mechanical properties can be obtained. These findings may inspire the design of tough polymer materials with on-demand, rate-dependent mechanical behaviours through mechanochemistry, broadening their applications across various fields. Weak bonds enable self-strengthening in polymers by triggering mechanochemical reactions during deformation, forming new networks that enhance strength and crack resistance. This rate-dependent process allows custom design of tough polymers.},

By contrast, synthetic hydrogels have not shown comparable combinations of properties, as current stiffening approaches inevitably suppress the required chain/bond dynamics for self-healing. Here we show a stiff and self-healing hydrogel with a modulus of 50 MPa and tensile strength up to 4.2 MPa by polymer entanglements in co-planar nanoconfinement. This is realized by polymerizing a highly concentrated monomer solution within a scaffold of fully delaminated synthetic hectorite nanosheets, shear oriented into a macroscopic monodomain. The resultant physical gels show self-healing efficiency up to 100% despite the high modulus, and high adhesion shear strength on a broad range of substrates. This nanoconfinement approach allows the incorporation of novel functionalities by embedding colloidal materials such as MXenes and can be generalized to other polymers and solvents to fabricate stiff and self-healing gels for soft robotics, additive manufacturing and biomedical applications. Mechanical stiffness and self-healing properties are difficult to combine in synthetic hydrogels. Using polymer entanglements in co-planar nanoconfinement, stiff and self-healing hydrogels are fabricated, with applications in biology and engineering.},

  abstract     = {All-solid-state batteries offer high-energy-density and eco-friendly energy storage but face commercial hurdles due to dendrite formation, especially with lithium metal anodes. Here we report that dendrite formation in Li/Li7La3Zr2O12/Li batteries occurs via two distinct mechanisms, using non-invasive solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance and magnetic resonance imaging. Tracer-exchange nuclear magnetic resonance shows non-uniform Li plating at electrode–electrolyte interfaces and local Li+ reduction at Li7La3Zr2O12 grain boundaries. In situ magnetic resonance imaging reveals rapid dendrite formation via non-uniform Li plating, followed by sluggish bulk dendrite nucleation from Li+ reduction, with an intervening period of stalled growth. Formation of amorphous dendrites and subsequent crystallization, the defect chemistry of solid electrolytes and battery operating conditions play a critical role in shaping the complex interplay between the two mechanisms. Overall, this work deepens our understanding of dendrite formation in solid-state Li batteries and provides comprehensive insight that might be valuable for mitigating dendrite-related challenges. NMR spectroscopy and imaging show that dendrites in a solid-state Li battery are formed from Li plating on the electrode and Li+ reduction at solid electrolyte grain boundaries, with an interlapped stalled growth period.},

  abstract     = {Cathodic corrosion is an electrochemical phenomenon that etches metals at moderately negative potentials. Although cathodic corrosion probably occurs by forming a metal-containing anion, such intermediate species have not yet been observed. Here, aiming to resolve this long-standing debate, our work provides such evidence through X-ray absorption spectroscopy. High-energy-resolution X-ray absorption near-edge structure experiments are used to characterize platinum nanoparticles during cathodic corrosion in 10 mol l−1 NaOH. These experiments detect minute chemical changes in the Pt during corrosion that match first-principles simulations of X-ray absorption spectra of surface platinum multilayer hydrides. Thus, this work supports the existence of hydride-like platinum during cathodic corrosion. Notably, these results provide a direct observation of these species under conditions where they are highly unstable and where prominent hydrogen bubble formation interferes with most spectroscopy methods. Therefore, this work identifies the elusive intermediate that underlies cathodic corrosion. Cathodic corrosion of platinum is investigated using operando high-resolution X-ray absorption spectroscopy matched with density functional calculations. Platinum hydrides are found to be reaction intermediates in conditions at which these species are expected to be unstable.},

  abstract     = {Piezoelectric materials are indispensable in electromechanical actuators, which require a large electrostrain with a fast and precise response. By designing a chemopiezoelectric effect, we developed an approach to achieve a high electrostrain of 1.9% under −3 kV mm−1, at 1 Hz, corresponding to an effective piezoelectric coefficient of &gt;6,300 pm V−1 at room temperature in lead-free potassium sodium niobate piezoceramics. This electrostrain has satisfactory fatigue resistance and thermal stability, and low hysteresis, far outperforming existing lead-based and lead-free perovskite counterparts. From tracer diffusion, atomic optical emission spectrometry experiments, combined with machine-learning molecular dynamics and phase-field simulations, we attribute the high electrostrain to short-range hopping of oxygen vacancies near ceramic surfaces under an alternating electric field, which is supported by strain levels reaching 3.0% under the same applied field when the sample was annealed at a low oxygen partial pressure. These findings provide an additional degree of freedom for designing materials on the basis of defect engineering, which will favour not only the electrostrain of piezoelectrics but also the functional properties of a broader range of oxide-based materials. The authors demonstrate a chemopiezoelectric effect in which the displacive migration of oxygen vacancies driven by an electric field induces a large strain in the surface layer of thin (K,Na)NbO3 ceramics. They achieve an electrostrain of 1.9% under a field of −3 kV mm−1, with thermal stability up to 200 °C.},

We show tunability of the coupling strength between the quantum dot and the superconducting lead, and gate control of the ratio of charging energy and the induced gap, and we tune the ground state of the system between even and odd parity. Furthermore, we characterize critical magnetic field strengths, finding a critical out-of-plane field of 0.90 ± 0.04 T. Finally, we explore sub-gap spin splitting, observing rich physics in the resulting spectra, that we model using a zero-bandwidth model in the Yu–Shiba–Rusinov limit.

Similarly to Cooper pairs in superconductors, magnons can be paired into bound states under attractive interactions. The Zeeman coupling to a magnetic field is able to tune the particle density through a quantum critical point, beyond which a ‘hidden order’ is predicted to exist. Here we report direct observation of the Bose–Einstein condensation of the two-magnon bound state in Na2BaNi(PO4)2. Comprehensive thermodynamic measurements confirmed the two-dimensional Bose–Einstein condensation quantum critical point at the saturation field. Inelastic neutron scattering experiments were performed to establish the microscopic model. An exact solution revealed stable two-magnon bound states that were further confirmed by electron spin resonance and nuclear magnetic resonance experiments, demonstrating that the quantum critical point is due to the pair condensation, and the phase below the saturation field is likely the long-sought-after spin nematic phase. The authors report Bose–Einstein condensation of a two-magnon bound state in Na2BaNi(PO4)2. This should stimulate further work on these types of geometrically frustrated materials.},

However, at the centimetre scale necessary for practical applications, previous multiwavelength achromatic metalenses have faced challenges in mass production and exhibited a low numerical aperture (NA), which limits their practical application in NEDs. Here we introduce a centimetre-scale red, green and blue achromatic metalens fabricated using a roll-to-plate technique and explore its potential for practical applications in NEDs. This metalens is designed through topological inverse design utilizing a finite-difference time-domain simulation for entire areas (~10,000λ). Our design method demonstrates the ability to compensate chromatic aberrations even at the centimetre scale and high NA with low-index materials such as resin suitable for scalable manufacturing. In addition, we developed a compact NED by integrating the metalens with computer-generated holography (CGH). In this NED system, the high-NA metalens address the limitations of narrow field of view and extensive empty space typical of conventional CGH-based NEDs. The CGH optimization model further resolves the challenges of broadband operation and off-axis aberration in centimetre-scale red, green and blue achromatic metalenses. Using a topological inverse design process with finite-difference time-domain simulations, the authors fabricate high-numerical-aperture red, green and blue achromatic metalenses for compact near-eye displays using a scalable roll-to-plate technique.},

  abstract     = {Moiré superlattices, such as those formed from transition metal dichalcogenide heterostructures, have emerged as an exciting platform for exploring quantum many-body physics. They have the potential to serve as solid-state analogues to ultracold gases for quantum simulations. A key open question is the coherence and dynamics of the quantum phases arising from photoexcited moiré excitons, particularly amid dissipation. Here we use transient photoluminescence and ultrafast reflectance microscopy to image non-equilibrium exciton phase transitions. Counterintuitively, experimental results and theoretical simulations indicate that strong long-range dipolar repulsion freezes the motion of the Mott insulator phase for over 70 ns. In mixed electron–exciton lattices, reduced dipolar interactions lead to diminished freezing dynamics. These findings challenge the prevailing notion that repulsion disperses particles, whereas attraction binds them. The observed phenomenon of frozen dynamics due to strong repulsive interactions is characteristic of highly coherent systems, a feature previously realized exclusively in ultracold gases. The authors image non-equilibrium exciton phase-transition dynamics in moiré superlattices, revealing how strong long-range dipolar repulsion freezes the motion of the Mott insulator over a timescale of tens of nanoseconds.},

  abstract     = {Innovations in device architectures and materials promote transistor miniaturization for improved performance, energy efficiency and integration density. At foreseeable ångström nodes, a gate-all-around (GAA) field-effect transistor based on two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors would provide excellent electrostatic gate controllability to achieve ultimate power scaling and performance delivering. However, a major roadblock lies in the scalable integration of 2D GAA heterostructures with atomically smooth and conformal interfaces. Here we report a wafer-scale multi-layer-stacked single-crystalline 2D GAA configuration achieved with low-temperature monolithic three-dimensional integration, in which high-mobility 2D semiconductor Bi2O2Se was epitaxially integrated by high-κ layered native-oxide dielectric Bi2SeO5 with an atomically smooth interface, enabling a high electron mobility of 280 cm2 V−1 s−1 and a near-ideal subthreshold swing of 62 mV dec−1. The scaled 2D GAA field-effect transistor with 30 nm gate length exhibits an ultralow operation voltage of 0.5 V, a high on-state current exceeding 1 mA μm−1, an ultralow intrinsic delay of 1.9 ps and an energy-delay product of 1.84 × 10−27 Js μm−1. This work demonstrates a wafer-scale 2D-material-based GAA system with valid performance and power merits, holding promising prospects for beyond-silicon monolithic three-dimensional circuits. A multi-layer wafer-scale 2D gate-all-around system with an atomically smooth interface fabricated via epitaxial monolithic 3D integration shows good performance and power efficiency, holding promise for the forthcoming ångström technology node.},

  abstract     = {Natural and synthetic diamonds mostly have a cubic lattice, whereas a rare hexagonal structure—known as hexagonal diamond (HD)—has been largely unexplored due to the low purity and minuscule size of most samples obtained. The synthesis of HD remains a challenge and even its existence remains controversial. Here we report the synthesis of well-crystallized, nearly pure HD by heating highly compressed graphite, which is applicable to both bulk and nanosized graphitic precursors. Experiments and theoretical analyses show that the formation of a post-graphite phase within compressed graphite and temperature gradients promote HD growth. Using this approach, a millimetre-sized, highly oriented HD block comprising stacked single-crystal-like HD nanolayers is obtained. This HD exhibits high thermal stability up to 1,100 °C and a very high hardness of 155 GPa. Our findings offer valuable insights regarding the graphite-to-diamond conversion under elevated pressure and temperature, providing opportunities for the fabrication and applications of this unique material. Synthesis of millimetre-sized hexagonal diamond has been demonstrated, facilitated by the formation of intermediate post-graphite phases and temperature gradients.},

  abstract     = {Unalloyed titanium boasts an impressive combination of ductility, biocompatibility and corrosion resistance. However, its strength properties are moderate, which constrains its use in demanding structural applications. Traditional alloying methods used to strengthen titanium often compromise ductility and tend to be costly and energy intensive. Here we present a lean alloy design approach to create a strong and ductile dual-phase titanium–oxygen alloy. By embedding a coherent nanoscale allotropic face-centred cubic titanium phase into the hexagonal close-packed titanium matrix, we significantly enhance strength while preserving substantial ductility. This hexagonal-close-packed/face-centred-cubic dual-phase titanium–oxygen alloy is created by leveraging the tailored oxide-layer thickness of the powders and the rapid cooling inherent in laser-based powder bed fusion. The as-printed Ti–0.67 wt% O alloy exhibits an ultimate tensile strength of 1,119.3 ± 29.2 MPa and a ductility of 23.3 ± 1.9%. Our strategy of incorporating a coherent nanoscale allotropic phase offers a promising pathway to developing high-performance, cost-effective and sustainable lean alloys. A hexagonal-close-packed/face-centred-cubic dual-phase titanium–oxygen alloy is lean designed and fabricated by laser-based powder bed fusion using titanium powders with customized oxide-layer thickness. The as-printed alloy achieves an excellent combination of high strength and ductility.},

  abstract     = {Architected materials provide a pathway to defy the limitations of monolithic materials through their engineered microstructures or geometries, allowing them to exhibit unique and extreme properties. Thus far, most studies on architected materials have been limited to fabricating periodic structures in small tessellations and investigating them under mostly quasi-static conditions, but explorations of more complex architecture designs and their properties across length scales and timescales will be essential to fully uncover the potential of this materials system. In this Perspective, we summarize state-of-the-art approaches to realizing multiscale architected materials and highlight existing knowledge gaps and opportunities in their design, fabrication and characterization. We also propose a roadmap to accelerate the discovery of architected materials with programmable properties via the synergistic combination of experimental and computational efforts. Finally, we identify research opportunities and open questions in the development of next-generation architected materials, intelligent devices and integrated systems that can bridge the gap between the conception and implementation of these materials in real-world engineering applications. Architected materials provide a pathway to achieve properties beyond those of monolithic materials. This Perspective discusses complex architecture designs and their fabrication, characterization and functions across length scales and timescales.},

Here we provide in vivo evidence showing that endogenous electric fields drive the directed collective cell migration of an embryonic stem cell population—the cephalic neural crest of Xenopus laevis. We demonstrate that the voltage-sensitive phosphatase 1 is a key component of the molecular mechanism, enabling neural crest cells to specifically transduce electric fields into a directional cue in vivo. Finally, we propose that endogenous electric fields are mechanically established by the convergent extension movements of the ectoderm, which generate a membrane tension gradient that opens stretch-activated ion channels. Overall, these findings establish a role for electrotaxis in tissue morphogenesis, highlighting the functions of endogenous bioelectrical stimuli in non-neural contexts. Electric fields guide collective cell migration in developing embryos of Xenopus laevis via a voltage-sensitive phosphatase.},

  abstract     = {Understanding the relationship between the microscopic structure and topology of a material and its macroscopic properties is a fundamental challenge across a wide range of systems. Here we investigate the viscoelasticity of DNA nanostar hydrogels—a model system for physical networks with limited valence—by coupling rheology measurements, confocal imaging and molecular dynamics simulations. We discover that these networks display a large degree of interpenetration and that loops within the network are topologically linked, forming a percolating network-within-network structure. Below the overlapping concentration, the fraction of branching points and the pore size determine the high-frequency elasticity of these physical gels. At higher concentrations, we discover that this elastic response is dictated by the abundance of topological links between looped motifs in the gel. Our findings highlight the emergence of ‘topological elasticity’ as a previously overlooked mechanism in generic network-forming liquids and gels and inform the design of topologically controllable material behaviours. Experiments and simulations of DNA nanostar hydrogels reveal that microscopic topology determines macroscale elasticity in amorphous networks.},

  abstract     = {Printing of large-area solar panels necessitates advanced organic solar cells with thick active layers. However, increasing the active layer thickness typically leads to a marked drop in the power conversion efficiency. Here we developed an organic semiconductor regulator, called AT-β2O, to tune the crystallization sequence of the components in active layers. When adding AT-β2O in the donor (D18-Cl) and acceptor (N3) blend, N3 crystallizes behind D18-Cl, and this phenomenon is different from the co-crystallization observed in binary D18-Cl:N3 blends. This manipulation of crystallization dynamics is favourable to form bulk-heterojunction-gradient vertical phase separation in the active layer accompanied by the high crystallinity of the acceptor and balanced charge carrier mobilities in thick films. The resultant single-junction organic solar cells exhibited a certified power conversion efficiency of over 20%, as well as demonstrated exceptional adaptability across the active layer thicknesses (100–400 nm) and remarkable universality. Such breakthroughs enable large-area modules with a certified power conversion efficiency of 18.04%. An organic regulator that can tune the crystallization sequence of active layer components has been described, achieving a certified efficiency of over 20% in single-junction organic solar cells, demonstrating remarkable tolerance for active layer thickness of 100–400 nm.},

  abstract     = {The rational design of non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs) with both high crystallinity and photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) is of crucial importance for achieving high-efficiency and low-energy-loss organic solar cells (OSCs). However, increasing the crystallinity of an NFA tends to decrease its PLQY, which results in a high non-radiative energy loss in OSCs. Here we demonstrate that the crystallinity and PLQY of NFAs can be fine-tuned by asymmetrically adapting the branching position of alkyl chains on the thiophene unit of the L8-BO acceptor. It was found that L8-BO-C4, with 2-butyloctyl on one side and 4-butyldecyl on the other side, can simultaneously achieve high crystallinity and PLQY. A high efficiency of 20.42% (certified as 20.1%) with an open-circuit voltage of 0.894 V and a fill factor of 81.6% is achieved for the single-junction OSC. This work reveals how important the strategy of shifting the alkyl chain branching position is in developing high-performance NFAs for efficient OSCs. Design strategies for non-fullerene acceptors are important for achieving high-efficiency organic solar cells. Here the authors design asymmetrically branched alkyl chains on the thiophene unit of the L8-BO acceptor to achieve high crystallinity and photoluminescence quantum yield, yielding over 20% efficiency in single-junction organic solar cells.},

  abstract     = {Precious metals such as Pt are favoured as catalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) due to their excellent catalytic activity. However, the scarcity and high cost of precious metals have prompted researchers to explore cheaper alternatives such as Cu. Nevertheless, Cu shows poor catalytic performance due to weak binding with intermediates. Here the catalytic activity of pure Cu is activated via electroreduction-driven modification of the local structure, achieving a HER catalytic performance superior to commercial Pt/C catalysts for working current densities greater than 100 mA cm−2 in acid electrolyte. Activation involved two steps. First, polycrystalline Cu2O nanoparticles were prepared via pulsed laser ablation, resulting in grain boundaries within the Cu2O particles as observed using electron microscopy. Next, the Cu2O particles were electroreduced to pure Cu, inducing the formation of distorted nanotwins and edge dislocations. These local structures induce high lattice strain and decrease the Cu coordination number, enhancing the interaction between Cu and intermediates—as calculated using density functional theory—leading to the excellent catalytic activity and durability of the catalyst. Our observations show that low-cost pure Cu can be a promising HER catalyst for large-scale industrial applications. Low-cost Cu catalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) can transform industrial water electrolysis, but pure Cu typically exhibits a negligible HER. Here, combining pulsed laser ablation and subsequent electroreduction, Cu nanotwins form that enable the HER at an overpotential of 301 mV, with 125 h of stable operation at a current density of 500 mA cm−2.},

  abstract     = {All-solid-state lithium metal batteries promise high levels of safety and energy density, but their practical realization is limited by low Li reversibility, limited cell loading and demand for high-temperature and high-pressure operation, stemming from solid-state electrolyte (SSE) low-voltage reduction and high-voltage decomposition, and from lithium dendrite growth. Here we concurrently address these challenges by reporting that a family of reductive electrophiles gain electrons and cations from metal–nucleophile materials (here a Li sulfide SSE) upon contact to undergo electrochemical reduction and form interphase layers (named solid reductive-electrophile interphase) on material surfaces. The solid reductive-electrophile interphase is electron blocking and lithiophobic, prevents SSE reduction, suppresses Li dendrites and supports high-voltage cathodes. Consequently, a reductive-electrophile-treated SSE exhibits high critical capacity and Li reversibility at the anode, and enables Li(1% Mg)/SSE/LiNi0.8Co0.15Al0.05O2 all-solid-state lithium metal batteries to achieve a high coulombic efficiency (&gt;99.9%), long cycle life (~10,000 h) and high loading (&gt;7 mAh cm−2) at 30 °C and 2.5 MPa. This concept also extends to cathodes of other materials (for example, metal oxides), boosting the high-nickel cathode’s cycle life and expanding the operational voltage up to 4.5 V. Such solid reductive-electrophile interphase tailoring of material surfaces holds promise to accelerate all-solid-state lithium metal battery commercialization and offer solutions for a wide range of materials. Solid-state electrolyte reduction and Li dendrite growth limit the stability of all-solid-state Li metal batteries. Here the authors show that reductive electrophiles gain electrons and metal cations from metal–nucleophile materials on contact, allowing the electrochemical formation of a dense, electron-blocking film that improves the stability of both the anode and high-voltage cathode.},

Yet, visualizing spin-wave dynamics at nanoscale and microwave frequencies remains a formidable challenge due to the lack of spin-sensitive, time-resolved microscopy. Here we report a breakthrough in imaging dipole-exchange spin waves in a ferromagnetic film owing to the development of laser-free ultrafast Lorentz electron microscopy, which is equipped with a microwave-mediated electron pulser for high spatiotemporal resolution. Using topological spin textures, we captured the emission, propagation, reflection and interference of spin waves from spin anti-vortices under radio-frequency excitations. Remarkably, we show that spin-wave generation is closely tied to the oscillatory motion of specific magnetic domain walls, providing the missing link between wave emission and wall dynamics near magnetic singularities. This work opens new possibilities in magnonics, offering a nanoscopic view of spin dynamics via transmission electron microscopy and enabling controlled excitation via radio-frequency fields for exploring non-equilibrium states in magnetic and multiferroic systems.

However, unlike the remote epitaxial growth of three-dimensional bulk crystals, the growth of two-dimensional material heterostructures across atomic layers has been limited due to the weak vdW interaction. Here we report the double-sided epitaxy of vdW layered materials through atomic membranes. We grow vdW topological insulators Sb2Te3 and Bi2Se3 by molecular-beam epitaxy on both surfaces of atomically thin graphene or hexagonal boron nitride, which serve as suspended two-dimensional vdW substrate layers. Both homo- and hetero-double-sided vdW topological insulator tunnel junctions are fabricated, with the atomically thin hexagonal boron nitride acting as a crystal-momentum-conserving tunnelling barrier with abrupt and epitaxial interfaces. By performing field-angle-dependent magneto-tunnelling spectroscopy on these devices, we reveal the energy–momentum–spin resonance of massless Dirac electrons tunnelling between helical Landau levels developed in the topological surface states at the interfaces. Double-sided epitaxy of van der Waals materials through atomic membranes is demonstrated, enabling electrons to resonantly tunnel between aligned topological insulator surfaces with the conservation of energy, momentum and spin helicity.},

  abstract     = {The discovery of two-dimensional van der Waals magnets has greatly expanded our ability to create and control nanoscale quantum phases. A unique capability emerges when a two-dimensional magnet is also a semiconductor that features tightly bound excitons with large oscillator strengths that fundamentally determine the optical response and are tunable with magnetic fields. Here we report a previously unidentified type of optical excitation—a magnetic surface exciton—enabled by the antiferromagnetic spin correlations that confine excitons to the surface of CrSBr. Magnetic surface excitons exhibit stronger Coulomb attraction, leading to a higher binding energy than excitons confined in bulk layers, and profoundly alter the optical response of few-layer crystals. Distinct magnetic confinement of surface and bulk excitons is established by layer- and temperature-dependent exciton reflection spectroscopy and corroborated by ab initio many-body perturbation theory calculations. By quenching interlayer excitonic interactions, the antiferromagnetic order of CrSBr strictly confines the bound electron–hole pairs within the same layer, regardless of the total number of layers. Our work unveils unique confined excitons in a layered antiferromagnet, highlighting magnetic interactions as a vital approach for nanoscale quantum confinement, from few layers to the bulk limit. The emergence of magnetically confined surface excitons enabled by antiferromagnetic spin correlations is reported, which leads to the confinement of excitons to the surface of layered antiferromagnet CrSBr.},

  abstract     = {Many surprising properties of quantum materials result from Coulomb correlations defining electronic quasiparticles and their interaction chains. In van der Waals layered crystals, enhanced correlations have been tailored in reduced dimensions, enabling excitons with giant binding energies and emergent phases including ferroelectric, ferromagnetic and multiferroic orders. Yet, correlation design has primarily relied on structural engineering. Here we present quantitative experiment–theory proof that excitonic correlations can be switched through magnetic order. By probing internal Rydberg-like transitions of excitons in the magnetic semiconductor CrSBr, we reveal their binding energy and a dramatic anisotropy of their quasi-one-dimensional orbitals manifesting in strong fine-structure splitting. We switch the internal structure from strongly bound, monolayer-localized states to weakly bound, interlayer-delocalized states by pushing the system from antiferromagnetic to paramagnetic phases. Our analysis connects this transition to the exciton’s spin-controlled effective quantum confinement, supported by the exciton’s dynamics. In future applications, excitons or even condensates may be interfaced with spintronics; extrinsically switchable Coulomb correlations could shape phase transitions on demand. The antiferromagnetic-to-paramagnetic phase transition in a two-dimensional semiconducting magnet, CrSBr, induces an exciton confinement transition from a strongly bound quasi-one-dimensional state to a weakly bound interlayer-delocalized state.},

  abstract     = {Creating chirality in achiral graphene and other two-dimensional materials has attracted broad scientific interest due to their potential application in advanced optics, electronics and spintronics. However, investigations into their optical activities and related chiro-electronic properties are constrained by experimental challenges, particularly in the precise control over the chirality of these materials. Here a universal wax-aided immersion method is developed to yield graphene rolls with controllable chiral angles, and the method can be generalized in other two-dimensional materials for high-yield fabrication. The left-handed and right-handed rolls exhibit optical activity and excellent spin selectivity effects with a spin polarization over 90% at room temperature. The discovery of tunable chirality-induced spin selectivity in tailored roll-shaped allotropes, achievable only through precise control of chirality, distinguishes itself from other carbon materials or existing chiral materials. Our Dirac fermion model shows that the electrons moving predominately along one side of the chiral roll develop a preferred spin polarization, and the rolling-chirality-induced spin selectivity is a result of this finite spin selectivity effect. Our method opens up opportunities for endowing achiral two-dimensional materials with tunable chirality, and may enable the emergence of quantum behaviours and room-temperature spintronic technologies. A wax-aided immersion methodology is developed to yield graphene rolls with tunable chiral angles; these graphene rolls exhibit promising chiral electronic properties beyond those of other carbon allotropes.},

  abstract     = {Van der Waals materials display rich structural polymorphs with distinct physical properties. An atomistic understanding of the phase-transition dynamics, propagation pathway and associated evolution of physical properties is essential for capturing their potential in practical technologies. However, direct visualization of the rapid phase-transition process is fundamentally challenging due to the inherent trade-offs among atomic resolution, field of view and imaging frame rate. Here we exploit a controllable current-driven phase transition and utilize in situ scanning transmission electron microscopy to visualize dynamic atomic rearrangements during the 2H-α to 2H-β transition in layered In2Se3. We identify a unique intralayer-splitting (unzipping) and interlayer-reconstruction (zipping) pathway, driven by an energy-cascading mechanism through which bond formation across the van der Waals gap facilitates bond cleavage in the covalent layers. We also observe current-direction-dependent asymmetric phase-transition propagation and attribute it to a temperature profile induced by the Peltier effect at the heterophase interface. These findings provide insights that are essential for designing tailored structural phase transitions in advanced technologies. Current-driven dynamic atomic rearrangements in layered In2Se3 are visualized. The authors identify an intralayer ‘unzipping’ and interlayer ‘zipping’ phase-transition pathway in which bond formation across the van der Waals gaps drives bond cleavage within covalent layers.},

  abstract     = {Deformation twinning, a phenomenon primarily documented within metallic systems, has remained essentially unexplored in covalent materials due to the formidable challenges posed by their inherent extreme hardness and brittleness. Here, by employing a five-degree-of-freedom nano-manipulation stage inside a transmission electron microscope, we reveal a loading-specific twinning criterion for cubic boron nitride and successfully activate extensive deformation twinning with substantial improvements in mechanical properties in &lt;100&gt;-oriented cubic boron nitride submicrometre pillars at room temperature. Beyond cubic boron nitride, this criterion is also proven widely applicable across a spectrum of covalent materials. Investigations on the twinning dynamics at the atomic level in cubic boron nitride suggest a continuous-transition-mediated pathway. These findings substantially advance our comprehension of twinning mechanisms in covalent face-centred cubic materials, and herald a promising avenue for microstructural engineering aimed at enhancing the strength and toughness of these materials in their applications. Deformation twinning, a key deformation mechanism that is rarely explored in superhard materials, is shown to be activated in cubic boron nitride and other cubic covalent materials under a loading-specific twinning criterion.},

Despite the utility and importance of this property in regard to scientific and engineering applications, the atomic-scale location of the force that returns an object to its original shape remains elusive in molecular crystals. Here we use a series of density functional theory calculations to locate precisely where the energy is stored when single crystals of three molecular materials are placed under elastic stress. We show for each material that different intermolecular interactions are responsible for the restoring force under both expansive and compressive strain. These findings provide insight into the elastic behaviour of crystalline materials that is needed for more efficient design of flexible technologies and future smart devices. Elasticity is ubiquitous in everyday life, but the molecular origin of the restoring force remains elusive. Here the authors use a series of density functional theory calculations to understand how interaction energies change as a result of the bending of molecular crystals.},

  abstract     = {Molecules are the building blocks of all of nature’s functional components, serving as the machinery that captures, stores and releases energy or converts it into useful work. However, molecules interact with each other over extremely short distances, which hinders the spread of energy across molecular systems. Conversely, photons are inert, but they are fast and can traverse large distances very efficiently. Using optical resonators, these distinct entities can be mixed with each other, opening a path to new architectures that benefit from both the active nature of molecules and the long-range transport obtained by the coupling with light. In this Review, we present the physics underlying the enhancement of energy transfer and energy transport in molecular systems, and highlight the experimental and theoretical advances in this field over the past decade. Finally, we identify several key questions and theoretical challenges that remain to be resolved via future research.

  abstract     = {Cells can deform their local niche in three dimensions via whole-cell movements such as spreading, migration or volume expansion. These behaviours, occurring over hours to days, influence long-term cell fates including differentiation. Here we report a whole-cell movement that occurs in sliding hydrogels at the minutes timescale, termed cell tumbling, characterized by three-dimensional cell dynamics and hydrogel deformation elicited by heightened seconds-to-minutes-scale cytoskeletal and nuclear activity. Studies inhibiting or promoting the cell tumbling of mesenchymal stem cells show that this behaviour enhances differentiation into chondrocytes. Further, it is associated with a decrease in global chromatin accessibility, which is required for enhanced differentiation. Cell tumbling also occurs during differentiation into other lineages and its differentiation-enhancing effects are validated in various hydrogel platforms. Our results establish that cell tumbling is an additional regulator of stem cell differentiation, mediated by rapid niche deformation and nuclear mechanotransduction. Minutes-scale whole-cell movements fuelled by fast cytoskeletal dynamics and nuclear activity regulate mesenchymal stem cells differentiation into chondrocytes in hydrogels, being another process modulating the stem cell fate.},

  abstract     = {Antibodies are produced when naive B cells differentiate into plasma cells within germinal centres (GCs) of lymphoid tissues. Patients with B cell lymphoma on effective immunotherapies exhibit diminished antibody production, leading to higher infection rates and reduced vaccine efficacy, even after B cell recovery. Current ex vivo models fail to sustain long-term GC reactions and effectively test B cell responses. Here we developed synthetic hydrogels mimicking the lymphoid tissue microenvironment, enabling human GCs from tonsils and peripheral blood mononuclear cell-derived B cells. Immune organoids derived from peripheral blood mononuclear cells maintain GC B cells and plasma cells longer than tonsil-derived ones and exhibit unique B cell programming, including GC compartments, somatic hypermutation, immunoglobulin class switching and B cell clones. Chemical inhibition of transcriptional and epigenetic processes enhances plasma cell formation. While integrating polarized CXCL12 protein in a lymphoid organ-on-chip modulates GC responses in healthy donor B cells, it fails with B cells derived from patients with lymphoma. Our system allows rapid, controlled modelling of immune responses and B cell disorders. Synthetic hydrogels and immune organs-on-chip mimicking human immune tissue developed from blood samples allow effective modelling of immune responses and B cell disorders, with implications for the development of improved immunotherapies and vaccines.},

  abstract     = {A successful therapeutic outcome in the treatment of solid tumours requires efficient intratumoural drug accumulation and retention. Here we demonstrate that zinc gluconate in oral supplements assembles with plasma proteins to form ZnO nanoparticles that selectively accumulate into papillary Caki-2 renal tumours and promote the recruitment of dendritic cells and cytotoxic CD8+ T cells to tumour tissues. Renal tumour targeting is mediated by the preferential binding of zinc ions to metallothionein-1X proteins, which are constitutively overexpressed in Caki-2 renal tumour cells. This binding event further upregulates intracellular metallothionein-1X expression to induce additional nanoparticle binding and retention. In both tumour animal models and human renal tumour samples, we show that ZnO nanoparticles actively cross the vascular wall to achieve high intratumoural accumulation. We further explore this feature of ZnO nanoparticles for the delivery of chemotherapeutics to mouse and rabbit cancer models. Our findings demonstrate that ZnO nanoparticles derived from supplements can serve as a multifunctional drug delivery and cancer immunotherapy platform. Zinc gluconate in oral supplements associates with plasma proteins to form renal-tumour-accumulating ZnO nanoparticles, which have antitumoural immune activity and can also be used for the delivery of chemotherapeutic agents.},

However, their shapes are often transient and hard to reprogramme. Here we construct a synthetic cell model composed of signal-responsive DNA nanorafts, biogenic pores and giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs). We demonstrate that reshaping of DNA rafts at the nanoscale can be coupled to reshaping of GUVs at the microscale. The nanorafts collectively undergo reversible transitions between isotropic and short-range local order on the lipid membrane, programmably remodelling the GUV shape. Assisted by the biogenic pores, during GUV shape recovery the locally ordered DNA rafts perforate the membrane, forming sealable synthetic channels for large cargo transport. Our work outlines a versatile platform for interfacing reconfigurable DNA nanostructures with synthetic cells, expanding the potential of DNA nanotechnology in synthetic biology. The shape of biological matter is central to their function and interaction with other cellular components. A combination of DNA origami nanorafts with biogenic pores reversibly controls the shape and permeability of lipid vesicles at the microscale.},

Here we conduct numerical investigations into the structure–dynamics relationship in model glass-forming liquids, with a specific focus on an elementary particle rearrangement mode known as the ‘T1 process’. We discover that the ability of a T1 process to preserve glassy structural order before and after is pivotal towards determining a liquid’s fragility—whether it exhibits super-Arrhenius-like or Arrhenius-like behaviour. If a T1 process disrupts local structural order, it must occur independently without cooperativity, resulting in Arrhenius-like behaviour. By contrast, if it can maintain order, it sequentially propagates from disordered peripheries to the middle of high-structural-order regions, leading to cooperativity and super-Arrhenius-like behaviour. Our study establishes a microscopic link between liquid-structure ordering, dynamic cooperativity and super-Arrhenius-like dynamics, extending the understanding of the structure–dynamics relationships in supercooled liquids. An elementary particle rearrangement mode known as the T1 process links liquid dynamics and local structural ordering to understand the physical mechanisms of super-Arrhenius-like behaviour in glass-forming liquids.},

This control is central to such diverse fields as molecular optoelectronics, quantum sensing, quantum biology and spin chemistry, but its effect is typically fairly weak in pure molecular systems. Here we introduce hybrid radical pairs constructed from semiconductor quantum dots and organic molecules. The large g-factor difference enables us to directly observe the radical-pair spin quantum beats usually hidden in previous studies, which are further accelerated by the strong exchange coupling of radical pairs enabled by the quantum confinement of quantum dots. The rapid quantum beats enable the efficient and coherent control of charge recombination dynamics at room temperature, with the modulation level of the yield of spin-triplet products reaching 400%. Photochemical quantum process in quantum dot–molecule hybrids is normally weak and difficult to be coherently controlled.

However, the substantial open-circuit voltage loss in the wide-bandgap perovskite subcell hinders further improvements in power-conversion efficiency. Here we develop wide-bandgap perovskite films with improved (100) crystal orientation that suppress non-radiative recombination. We show that using two-dimensional perovskite as an intermediate phase on the film surface promotes heterogeneous nucleation along the (100) three-dimensional perovskite facets during crystallization. Preferred (100) orientations can be realized by augmenting the quantity of two-dimensional phases through surface composition engineering, without the need for excessive two-dimensional ligands that otherwise impede carrier transport. We demonstrate an open-circuit voltage of 1.373 V for 1.78 eV wide-bandgap perovskite solar cells, along with a high fill factor of 84.7%. This yields an open-circuit voltage of 2.21 V and a certified power-conversion efficiency of 29.1% for all-perovskite tandem solar cells, measured under the maximum power-point conditions. Substantial open-circuit voltage loss and inherent non-radiative recombination hinder efficiency improvements in wide-bandgap perovskite solar cells.

  abstract     = {Lithium–sulfur (Li–S) all-solid-state batteries (ASSBs) hold great promise for next-generation safe, durable and energy-dense battery technology. However, solid-state sulfur conversion reactions are kinetically sluggish and primarily constrained to the restricted three-phase boundary area of sulfur, carbon and solid electrolytes, making it challenging to achieve high sulfur utilization. Here we develop and implement mixed ionic–electronic conductors (MIECs) in sulfur cathodes to replace conventional solid electrolytes and invoke conversion reactions at sulfur–MIEC interfaces in addition to traditional three-phase boundaries. Microscopic and tomographic analyses reveal the emergence of mixed-conducting domains embedded in sulfur at sulfur–MIEC boundaries, helping promote the thorough conversion of active sulfur into Li2S. Consequently, substantially improved active sulfur ratios (up to 87.3%) and conversion degrees (&gt;94%) are achieved in Li–S ASSBs with high discharge capacity (&gt;1,450 mAh g–1) and long cycle life (&gt;1,000 cycles). The strategy is also applied to enhance the active material utilization of other conversion cathodes. Low-cost conversion cathodes are promising for future all-solid-state battery technology, but their poor electronic and ionic conductivity restrict reactions to three-phase boundaries. By using mixed ionic–electronic conductors, conversion reactions can be initiated at two-phase boundaries, resulting in enhanced discharge capacity and lifespan.},

Unlike conventional Na3V2(PO4)3, when used as positive electrode materials in Na-ion batteries, the NaxV2(PO4)3 compositions lead to unusual single-phase Na+ extraction/insertion mechanisms with continuous voltage changes upon Na+ extraction/insertion. We demonstrate that the average equilibrium operating voltage observed upon Na+ deintercalation from single-phase Na2V2(PO4)3 is increased up to an average value of ~3.70 V versus Na+/Na (thanks to the activation of the V4+/V5+ redox couple) compared to 3.37 V versus Na+/Na in conventional Na3V2(PO4)3, thus leading to an increase in the theoretical energy density from 396.3 Wh kg–1 to 458.1 Wh kg–1. Electrochemical and chemical Na+ deintercalation from c-Na2V2(PO4)3 enables complete Na-ion extraction, increasing energy density.

In van der Waals antiferromagnets, a new type of magnetic polymorphism arises, presenting multiple layer-selective magnetic structures with identical total magnetization. However, resolving and manipulating such magnetic polymorphs remain challenging. Here, phase-resolved magnetic second harmonic generation microscopy is used to elucidate magnetic polymorphism in 2D layered antiferromagnet CrSBr, demonstrating deterministic and layer-selective switching of magnetic polymorphs. Using a nonlinear magneto-optical technique, we unambiguously resolve the polymorphic spin-flip transitions in CrSBr bilayers and tetralayers through both the amplitude and phase of light. Remarkably, the deterministic routing of polymorphic spin-flip transitions originates from a ‘layer-sharing’ effect, where the transitions are governed by laterally extended layers acting as ‘control bits’. We envision that such controllable magnetic polymorphism could be ubiquitous for van der Waals layered antiferromagnets, enabling new designs and constructions of spintronic and opto-spintronic devices for probabilistic computation and neuromorphic engineering.

So far, it has been shown that electric-field pulses in the spectral region from the visible to the terahertz range can be used to induce ultrafast switching between different spin states. Here we demonstrate that a multicycle terahertz magnetic-field pulse can be used to induce non-thermal spin switching in antiferromagnets. When a strong pulse is applied to Sm0.7Er0.3FeO3, the magnetic order parameter is first driven away from the barrier between the two potential minima of this antiferromagnet and then, in the subsequent inertial motion towards the opposite direction, it crosses the barrier. Our analysis reveals that the initial motion is driven by a dynamical modification of the magnetic potential, and this modification is enhanced through coupling between the two magnon modes. The authors realize non-thermal spin switching in a canted antiferromagnet through dynamically modifying the magnetic potential using a strong multicycle terahertz magnetic near field.},

Here we examine the interaction between light chirality and electron spins in indium selenide and study the effect of magnetic field on emerging tunnelling photocurrents at the Van Hove singularity. Although the effect is symmetric under linearly polarized light excitation, a non-symmetric signal emerges when the excitation is circularly polarized, making it possible to electrically detect light’s chirality. Our study shows a negligible out-of-plane g-factor for few-layer indium selenide at the valence band edge, resulting in an unbalanced Zeeman splitting in hexagonal boron nitride spin bands. This finding allows us to measure the change in energy barrier height with exceptional resolution (~15 μeV). Furthermore, we confirm the long-standing theoretical prediction of spin-polarized hole accumulation in the flat valence band at increasing laser powers. Light chirality and electron spin interactions and the dependence of tunnelling photocurrent on the magnetic field are studied in indium selenide, exploiting its non-symmetric response to circularly polarized light to electrically detect chirality.},

  abstract     = {Active optical metasurfaces, capable of dynamically manipulating light in ultrathin form factors, enable novel interfaces between humans and technology. In such interfaces, soft materials bring many advantages based on their flexibility, compliance and large stimulus-driven responses. Here, we create electrochemically mutable, soft metasurfaces that capitalize on the swelling of soft conducting polymers to alter the shape and associated resonant response of metasurface elements. Such geometric tuning overcomes the typical trade-off between achieving substantial tuning and low optical loss that is intrinsic to dynamic metasurfaces relying on index tuning of materials. Using the commercial polymer PEDOT:PSS, we demonstrate dynamic, high-resolution colour tuning and high-diffraction-efficiency (&gt;19%) beam-steering devices that operate at CMOS-compatible voltages (~1.5 V). These results highlight how the deformability of soft materials can enable a class of high-performance metasurfaces that are suitable for body-worn technologies. Electrochemically mutable soft metasurfaces based on soft conducting polymers exploit the deformability of soft materials through swelling to dynamically tune the shape and associated resonant response of the metasurface devices.},

  abstract     = {The downscaling of complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor technology has produced breakthroughs in electronics, but more extreme scaling has hit a wall of device performance degradation. One key challenge is the development of insulators with high dielectric constant, wide bandgap and high tunnel masses. Here, we show that two-dimensional monocrystalline gadolinium pentoxide, which is devised through combining particle swarm optimization algorithm and theoretical calculations and synthesized via van der Waals epitaxy, could exhibit a high dielectric constant of ~25.5 and a wide bandgap simultaneously. A desirable equivalent oxide thickness down to 1 nm with an ultralow leakage current of ~10−4 A cm−2 even at 5 MV cm−1 is achieved. The molybdenum disulfide transistors gated by gadolinium pentoxide exhibit high on/off ratios over 108 and near-Boltzmann-limit subthreshold swing at an operation voltage of 0.5 V. We also constructed inverter circuits with high gain and nanowatt power consumption. This reliable approach to integrating ultrathin monocrystalline insulators paves the way to future nanoelectronics. Two-dimensional monocrystalline gadolinium pentoxide with high dielectric constant and wide bandgap was prepared through van der Waals epitaxy, allowing the realization of sub-1 nm equivalent oxide thickness and low-power nanoelectronics.},

  abstract     = {Batch production of single-crystal two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides is one prerequisite for the fabrication of next-generation integrated circuits. Contemporary strategies for the wafer-scale high-quality crystallinity of 2D materials centre on merging unidirectionally aligned, differently sized domains. However, an imperfectly merged area with a translational lattice brings about a high defect density and low device uniformity, which restricts the application of the 2D materials. Here we establish a liquid-to-solid crystallization in 2D space that can rapidly grow a centimetre-scale single-crystal MoS2 domain with no grain boundaries. The large MoS2 single crystal obtained shows superb uniformity and high quality with an ultra-low defect density. A statistical analysis of field effect transistors fabricated from the MoS2 reveals a high device yield and minimal variation in mobility, positioning this FET as an advanced standard monolayer MoS2 device. This 2D Czochralski method has implications for fabricating high-quality and scalable 2D semiconductor materials and devices. A 2D Czochralski method is introduced for rapidly growing centimetre-scale single-crystal MoS2 domains with low defect density and impressive electrical performance. This method shows potential for fabricating high-quality and scalable 2D semiconductor materials and devices.},

Here we describe a set of cellular units with metabolically engineered glycoproteins that allow cells to tether together to function as macrotissue building blocks and bioeffectors. The generated human living materials, termed as Cellgels, can be rapidly assembled in a wide variety of programmable three-dimensional configurations with physiologically relevant cell densities (up to 108 cells per cm3), tunable mechanical properties and handleability. Cellgels inherit the ability of living cells to sense and respond to their environment, showing autonomous tissue-integrative behaviour, mechanical maturation, biological self-healing, biospecific adhesion and capacity to promote wound healing. These living features also enable the modular bottom-up assembly of multiscale constructs, which are reminiscent of human tissue interfaces with heterogeneous composition. This technology can potentially be extended to any human cell type, unlocking the possibility for fabricating living materials that harness the intrinsic biofunctionalities of biological systems. Glycoengineered cells containing bioorthogonal tethers function as building blocks for the programmable fabrication of human living materials with distinct structures and tissue functionalities.},

  abstract     = {Nitric oxide (NO), a pivotal signalling molecule, plays multifaceted roles in physiological and pathological processes, including cardiovascular and immune functions, neurotransmission and cancer progression. Nevertheless, measuring NO in vivo is challenging due to its transient nature and the complexity of the biological environment. Here we describe NO-responsive magnetic probes made of crosslinked superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles tethered to a NO-sensitive cleavable linker for highly sensitive and selective NO magnetic resonance imaging in vivo. These probes enable the detection of NO at concentrations as low as 0.147 μM, allowing for the imaging and quantification of NO in mouse tumour models, studying its effects on tumour progression and immunity and assessing the response of tumour-associated macrophages to cancer immunotherapeutic agents. Additionally, they facilitate concurrent anatomical and molecular imaging of organs, helping to identify pathological alterations in the liver. Overall, these probes represent promising non-invasive tools for investigating the dose-dependent conflicting role of NO in physiological and pathophysiological processes. Iron oxide nanoparticles containing a nitric oxide-responsive cleavable linker allow in vivo magnetic resonance imaging and the quantification of nitric oxide with high sensitivity and selectivity in mice.},

  abstract     = {Metal carbonates, which are ubiquitous in the near-surface mineral record, are a major product of biomineralizing organisms and serve as important targets for capturing anthropogenic CO2 emissions. However, pathways of carbonate mineralization typically diverge from classical predictions due to the involvement of disordered precursors, such as the dense liquid phase (DLP), yet little is known about DLP formation or solidification processes. Using in situ methods we report that a highly hydrated bicarbonate DLP forms via liquid–liquid phase separation and transforms into hollow hydrated amorphous CaCO3 particles. Acidic proteins and polymers extend DLP lifetimes while leaving the pathway and chemistry unchanged. Molecular simulations suggest that the DLP forms via direct condensation of solvated Ca²+⋅(HCO3−)2 complexes that react due to proximity effects in the confined DLP droplets. Our findings provide insight into CaCO3 nucleation that is mediated by liquid–liquid phase separation, advancing the ability to direct carbonate mineralization and elucidating an often-proposed complex pathway of biomineralization. In situ and computational methods are used to investigate the nature of the dense liquid phase of calcium carbonate and its transformation to the amorphous phase that is common in biomineralization processes.},

Here, inspired by the flight muscle structure of insects, we develop a self-oscillator based on two antagonistically contracting photo-active layers sandwiching an inactive layer. The actuator produces an output power density of 33 W kg−1, 275-fold higher than other configurations and comparable to that of insects. Such oscillators allow for broad-wavelength operation and multifunction integration, including proprioceptive actuation and energy harvesting. We demonstrate high-performance flapping motion enabling various locomotion modes, including a wing with a thrust-to-weight ratio of 0.32. This work advances autonomous, sustained and untethered actuators for powerful robotics.

By overcoming obstacles associated with miniaturization, we demonstrate microscopic electronically configurable morphing metasheet robots. These metabots expand locally using a kirigami structure spanning five decades in length, from 10 nm electrochemically actuated hinges to 100 μm splaying panels making up the ~1 mm robot. The panels are organized into unit cells that can expand and contract by 40% within 100 ms. These units are tiled to create metasheets with over 200 hinges and independent electronically actuating regions that enable the robot to switch between multiple target geometries with distinct curvature distributions. By electronically actuating independent regions with prescribed phase delays, we generate locomotory gaits. These results advance a metamaterial paradigm for microscopic, continuum, compliant, programmable robots and pave the way to a broad spectrum of applications, including reconfigurable micromachines, tunable optical metasurfaces and miniaturized biomedical devices. Shape transformations in microrobots less than 1 mm in size remain challenging.

These properties, however, depend on the microstructure that develops in their aqueous operational environment. We investigated the structure of a model organic mixed ionic–electronic conductor across multiple length scales using cryogenic four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy in both its dry and hydrated states. Four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy allows us to identify the prevalent defects in the polymer crystalline regions and to analyse the liquid crystalline nature of the polymer. The orientation maps of the dry and hydrated polymers show that swelling-induced disorder is mostly localized in discrete regions, thereby largely preserving the liquid crystalline order. Therefore, the liquid crystalline mesostructure makes electronic transport robust to electrolyte ingress. This study demonstrates that cryogenic four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy provides multiscale structural insights into complex, hierarchical structures such as polymeric organic mixed ionic–electronic conductors, even in their hydrated operating state. Electrochemical properties of organic mixed ionic–electronic conductors depend on their microstructure in operational ionic environments. The microstructure of a model organic mixed ionic–electronic conductor across multiple length scales in both dry and hydrated states, as well as its evolution on hydration, is revealed using cryogenic four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy.},

  abstract     = {Delithiation of layered oxide electrodes triggers irreversible oxygen loss, one of the primary degradation modes in lithium-ion batteries. However, the delithiation-dependent mechanisms of oxygen loss remain poorly understood. Here we investigate the oxygen non-stoichiometry in Li1.18–xNi0.21Mn0.53Co0.08O2–δ electrodes as a function of Li content by using cycling protocols with long open-circuit voltage steps at varying states of charge. Surprisingly, we observe substantial oxygen loss even at moderate delithiation, corresponding to 2.5, 4.0 and 7.6 ml O2 per gram of Li1.18–xNi0.21Mn0.53Co0.08O2–δ after resting at upper capacity cut-offs of 135, 200 and 265 mAh g−1 for 100 h. Our observations suggest an intrinsic oxygen instability consistent with predictions of high oxygen activity at intermediate potentials versus Li/Li+. In addition, we observe a large chemical expansion coefficient with respect to oxygen non-stoichiometry, which is about three times greater than those of classical oxygen-deficient materials such as fluorite and perovskite oxides. Our work challenges the conventional wisdom that deep delithiation is a necessary condition for oxygen loss in layered oxide electrodes and highlights the importance of calendar ageing for investigating oxygen stability. Li-rich oxides were found to slowly release considerable quantities of oxygen at varying states of charge. These observations point to the intrinsic instability of oxygen in partially charged oxides and highlight the need for degradation studies.},

  abstract     = {The sodium (Na) superionic conductor is a key component that could revolutionize the energy density and safety of conventional Na-ion batteries. However, existing Na superionic conductors are primarily based on a single-anion framework, each presenting inherent advantages and disadvantages. Here we introduce a family of amorphous Na-ion conductors (Na2O2–MCly, M = Hf, Zr and Ta) based on the dual-anion framework of oxychloride. Benefiting from a dual-anion chemistry and with the resulting distinctive structures, Na2O2–MCly electrolytes exhibit room-temperature ionic conductivities up to 2.0 mS cm−1, wide electrochemical stability windows and desirable mechanical properties. All-solid-state Na-ion batteries incorporating amorphous Na2O2–HfCl4 electrolyte and a Na0.85Mn0.5Ni0.4Fe0.1O2 cathode exhibit a superior rate capability and long-term cycle stability, with 78% capacity retention after 700 cycles under 0.2 C (1C = 120 mA g−1) at room temperature. The discoveries in this work could trigger a new wave of enthusiasm for exploring new superionic conductors beyond those based on a single-anion framework. All-solid-state sodium-ion batteries are promising candidates for grid-scale energy storage, but they require superior solid-state electrolytes (SSEs). Here sodium-ion SSEs based on dual-anion frameworks of oxychloride are studied and found to show high ionic conductivity and electrochemical oxidative stability with mechanical softness.},

This result fills a gap of a high performance below 300 K and is promising for low-temperature thermoelectric applications. The large magneto-Seebeck response is attributed to the ultrahigh mobility and the Dirac band dispersion. The application of a low magnetic field to achieve a high thermoelectric performance can be extended to topological materials with similar features that are rapidly emerging because it synergistically optimizes the thermoelectric parameters.

Here we report that long-distance propagation of chiral magnonic edge states can be achieved at room temperature in manganite thin films with long, antiferromagnetically coupled spin spirals (millimetre length) and low magnetic Gilbert damping (~3.04 × 10−4). By directly observing the non-reciprocal spin-wave propagation and analysing the strong magnon–magnon coupling in the spiral textures, we elucidate the crucial role of the dynamic dipolar interaction on the birth and hybridization of this chiral magnonic edge state. The observed hybridized magnons with robust chirality can be reversibly and selectively switched on/off by different threshold angles under an external field, indicating great potential for the design of versatile magnonic devices at the nanoscale. The authors engineer chiral magnon modes in a strongly correlated oxide using lattice strain.

These states induce opposite signs of the Hall effect proportional to magnetization, which is widely used for their electrical read-out. By contrast, conventional antiferromagnets with a collinear antiparallel spin configuration cannot host such functions, because of $${\mathcal{T}}{\mathrm{t}}$$ symmetry (time-reversal $${\mathcal{T}}$$ followed by translation t symmetry) and lack of macroscopic magnetization. Here we report the experimental observation of a spontaneous Hall effect in the collinear antiferromagnet FeS at room temperature.

Our analysis suggests that this does not reflect magnetization, but rather originates from a fictitious magnetic field associated with the $${\mathcal{T}}{\mathrm{t}}$$ -symmetry-broken antiferromagnetic order. The present results pave the way for electrical reading and writing of the ↑↓ and ↓↑ spin states in conductive systems at room temperature, and suggest that $${\mathcal{T}}{\mathrm{t}}$$ -symmetry-broken collinear antiferromagnets can serve as an information medium with vanishingly small magnetization.

Exciton polaritons offer excellent platforms for spin-optronic devices via the optical spin Hall effect. However, this effect could neither be unequivocally observed at room temperature nor be exploited for practical spintronic devices due to the presence of strong thermal fluctuations or large linear spin splitting. Here we report the observation of room-temperature optical spin Hall effect of exciton polaritons, with the spin current flow over 60 μm in a formamidinium lead bromide perovskite microcavity. We provide direct evidence of long-range coherence in the flow of polaritons and the spin current carried by them. Leveraging the spin Hall transport of polaritons, we further demonstrate two polaritonic devices, namely, a NOT gate and a spin-polarized beamsplitter, advancing the frontier of room-temperature polaritonics in perovskite microcavities. The optical spin Hall transport of exciton polaritons at room temperature is reported in a perovskite microcavity, which enables them to realize polariton spintronic devices such as a spin-polarized beamsplitter and a polariton spin inverter.},

Here we overcome this challenge by using type-(I + II) QDs, which feature a trion-like optical gain state with strongly suppressed Auger recombination. When combined with a Littrow optical cavity, static (non-circulated) solutions of these QDs exhibit stable lasing tunable from 634 nm to 575 nm. These results indicate the feasibility of technologically viable dye-like QD lasers that exhibit broad spectral tunability and, importantly, provide stable operation without the need for a circulation system—a standard attribute of traditional dye lasers. The latter opens the door to less complex and more compact devices that can be readily integrated with various optical and electro-optical systems. An additional advantage of these lasers is the wide range of potentially available wavelengths that can be selected by controlling the composition, size and structure of the QDs. Liquid lasers based on solutions of colloidal quantum dots exhibit a trion-like optical gain state with suppressed Auger recombination, which combined with a Littrow optical cavity enables stable and tunable liquid-state lasing.},

  abstract     = {Multi-scale structures are ubiquitous in biological systems. However, manufacturing man-made structures with controllable features spanning multiple length scales, particularly down to nanoscale features, is very challenging, which seriously impacts their collective properties. Here we introduce an aluminium-based three-dimensional lithography that combines sequential nano–micro–macro-imprinting and anodization of multi-scale anodic aluminium oxide templates to manufacture well-defined multi-scale structures, using various materials. The high-fidelity nano-patterns and micro-patterns were facilitated by the surface work hardening phenomenon, where the nano-patterns can be further fine-tailored by anodization to have high-aspect-ratio and tunable nano-holes. Based on the aluminium-based three-dimensional lithography, multi-scale materials across length scales of at least 107 orders of magnitude were precisely fabricated, including carbon, semiconductors and metals. We integrated pressure sensors and biosensors with superior and customizable performances by tailoring the multi-scale carbon networks on different length scales from nanofibres and micropyramids to macrodome arrays. This work provides a versatile technique for prototyping on-demand multi-scale structures and materials to explore desirable mechanical and physical properties. Aluminium surface work hardening is used to create structures that cover multiple length scales, featuring precise nano-features and adaptable material options. The potential is showcased through multi-scale carbon network sensors.},

  abstract     = {In the 1850s, Lord Kelvin predicted the existence of a thermoelectric cooling effect inside a whole material (the Thomson effect) according to thermodynamics1, in addition to the Peltier effect that enables cooling at the junction between dissimilar materials. However, the Thomson effect is usually negligible (ΔT/T &lt; 2%) in conventional thermoelectric materials because the entropy change in charge carriers is fairly small2, leading to the guiding principles for advancing thermoelectric cooling to be based on the framework of the Peltier effect and that the figure of merit ZT should be maximized to optimize performance. Here, we demonstrate a Thomson-effect-enhanced thermoelectric cooler using a large Thomson coefficient (τ) induced by the direct manipulation of charge entropy through an electronic phase transition in YbInCu4. The devices achieve a steady temperature span (ΔT) of &gt;5 K from T = 38 K. Our findings suggest not only another approach to advance thermoelectric coolers in addition to improving ZT but also technologically opens opportunities for solid-state cryogenic cooling applications. Thermoelectric cooling can occur inside a whole material, but this is usually insignificant compared with Peltier cooling at material interfaces. An electronic phase transition in YbInCu4 causes substantial Thomson cooling inside the whole material with a temperature drop of 6 K at 38 K.},

Therefore, the resource utilization rate and the rate at which those resources become available in the environment must be in equilibrium while maintaining the well-being of people and nature. Metal halide perovskite (MHP) semiconductors could revolutionize PV technology due to high efficiency, readily available/accessible materials and low-cost production. Here we outline how MHP-PV panels could scale a sustainable supply chain while appreciably contributing to a global renewable energy transition. We evaluate the critical material concerns, embodied energy, carbon impacts and circular supply chain processes of MHP-PVs. The research community is in an influential position to prioritize research efforts in reliability, recycling and remanufacturing to make MHP-PVs one of the most sustainable energy sources on the market. Metal halide perovskite (MHP) materials could revolutionize photovoltaic (PV) technology but sustainability issues need to be considered.
