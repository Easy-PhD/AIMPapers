  abstract     = {Embryo development entails the formation of anatomical structures with distinct biochemical compositions. Compared with the wealth of knowledge on gene regulation, our understanding of metabolic programs operating during embryogenesis is limited. Mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) has the potential to map the distribution of metabolites across embryo development. Here we established uMAIA, an analytical framework for the joint analysis of large MSI datasets, which enables the construction of multidimensional metabolomic atlases. Employing this framework, we mapped the four-dimensional (4D) distribution of over a hundred lipids at micrometric resolution in Danio rerio embryos. We discovered metabolic trajectories that unfold in concert with morphogenesis and revealed spatially organized biochemical coordination overlooked by bulk measurements. Interestingly, lipid mapping revealed unexpected distributions of sphingolipid and triglyceride species, suggesting their involvement in pattern establishment and organ development. Our approach empowers a new generation of whole-organism metabolomic atlases and enables the discovery of spatially organized metabolic circuits. uMAIA is an analytical framework designed to enable the construction of metabolic atlases at high resolution using mass spectrometry imaging data.},

  abstract     = {T cells recognize antigens and induce specialized gene expression programs (GEPs), enabling functions like proliferation, cytotoxicity and cytokine production. Traditionally, different T cell classes are thought to exhibit mutually exclusive responses, including TH1, TH2 and TH17 programs. However, single-cell RNA sequencing has revealed a continuum of T cell states without clearly distinct subsets, necessitating new analytical frameworks. Here, we introduce T-CellAnnoTator (TCAT), a pipeline that improves T cell characterization by simultaneously quantifying predefined GEPs capturing activation states and cellular subsets. Analyzing 1,700,000 T cells from 700 individuals spanning 38 tissues and five disease contexts, we identify 46 reproducible GEPs reflecting core T cell functions including proliferation, cytotoxicity, exhaustion and effector states. We experimentally demonstrate new activation programs and apply TCAT to characterize activation GEPs that predict immune checkpoint inhibitor response across multiple tumor types. Our software package starCAT generalizes this framework, enabling reproducible annotation in other cell types and tissues. TCAT is a pipeline that can simultaneously capture gene expression programs related to T cell subsets and activation states for accurate T cell characterization.},

This dataset encompasses 319,045,108 gene expression events, generated through 2 high-throughput technologies: the previously documented high-throughput sequencing-based high-throughput screening (HTS2) and the newly developed highly multiplexed and parallel sequencing (HiMAP-seq). Our results show that HiMAP-seq is comparable to RNA sequencing, but can profile the expression of thousands of genes across thousands of samples in one single test by utilizing a pooled-sample strategy. We further illustrate CIGS’s utility in elucidating the mechanism of action of unannotated small molecules, like ligustroflavone and 2,4-dihydroxybenzaldehyde, and to identify perturbation-induced cell states, such as those resistant to ferroptosis.

  abstract     = {Concurrent recording of electroencephalogram (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) signals reveals cross-scale neurovascular dynamics crucial for explaining fundamental linkages between function and behaviors. However, MRI scanners generate artifacts for EEG detection. Despite existing denoising methods, cabled connections to EEG receivers are susceptible to environmental fluctuations inside MRI scanners, creating baseline drifts that complicate EEG signal retrieval from the noisy background. Here we show that a wireless integrated sensing detector for simultaneous EEG and MRI can encode fMRI and EEG signals on distinct sidebands of the detector’s oscillation wave for detection by a standard MRI console over the entire duration of the fMRI sequence. Local field potential and fMRI maps are retrieved through low-pass and high-pass filtering of frequency-demodulated signals. From optogenetically stimulated somatosensory cortex in ChR2-transfected Sprague Dawley rats, positive correlation between evoked local field potential and fMRI signals validates strong neurovascular coupling, enabling cross-scale brain mapping with this two-in-one transducer. WISDEM is a hybrid detector for simultaneous EEG and fMRI recordings without artifacts or crosstalk, which allows access to neural activity at high temporal and spatial resolution, respectively, as demonstrated in rats.},

The system was integrated with a broadband anti-resonant hollow-core fiber featuring low transmission loss, minimal dispersion from 700 nm to 1,060 nm and high tolerance of laser power. By correcting chromatic and spherical aberrations and optimizing the fluorescence collection aperture, we achieved cortical neuronal imaging at depths exceeding 820 μm and, using a GRIN lens, hippocampal Ca2+ imaging at single dendritic spine resolution. Moreover, we engineered three interchangeable parfocal objectives, allowing for a tenfold scalable field of view up to 1 × 0.8 mm², with lateral resolutions ranging from 0.68 μm to 1.46 μm. By multicolor imaging at excitation wavelengths of 780 nm, 920 nm and 1,030 nm, we investigated mitochondrial and cytosolic Ca2+ activities relative to the deposition of amyloid plaques in the cortex of awake APP/PS1 transgenic mice. Thus, FHIRM-TPM 3.0 provides a versatile imaging system suitable for diverse brain imaging scenarios. FHIRM-TPM 3.0 is a miniature microscope for multicolor two-photon imaging in freely moving mice. In addition to the multicolor imaging abilities achieved with the help of a specially designed optical fiber, the microscope is also compatible with multiple lenses for a choice of field of view and resolution.},

Currently, vCLEM alignment relies on time-consuming and subjective manual methods. This paper presents CLEM-Reg, an algorithm that automates the three-dimensional alignment of vCLEM datasets by leveraging probabilistic point cloud registration techniques. Point clouds are derived from segmentations of common structures in each modality, created by state-of-the-art open-source methods. CLEM-Reg drastically reduces the registration time of vCLEM datasets to a few minutes and achieves correlation of fluorescent signal to submicron target structures in electron microscopy on three newly acquired vCLEM benchmark datasets. CLEM-Reg was then used to automatically obtain vCLEM overlays to unambiguously identify TGN46-positive transport carriers involved in protein trafficking between the trans-Golgi network and plasma membrane. Datasets are available on EMPIAR and BioStudies, and a napari plugin is provided to aid end-user adoption.

Here we present iSCALE, a method that reconstructs large-scale, super-resolution gene expression landscapes and automatically annotates cellular-level tissue architecture in samples exceeding capture areas of current ST platforms. The performance of iSCALE was assessed by comprehensive evaluations involving benchmarking experiments, immunohistochemistry staining and manual annotations by pathologists. When applied to multiple sclerosis human brain samples, iSCALE uncovered lesion-associated cellular characteristics undetectable by conventional ST experiments. Our results demonstrate the utility of iSCALE in analyzing large tissues by enabling unbiased annotation, resolving cell type composition, mapping cellular microenvironments and revealing spatial features beyond the reach of standard ST analysis or routine histopathological assessment. iSCALE leverages histology and spatial transcriptomics to infer gene expression at super resolution in large tissues.},

Recent benchmarking showed that current methodologies have limited accuracy and spatial resolution, constraining translational capacity. Here, we introduce GHIST, a deep learning-based framework that predicts spatial gene expression at single-cell resolution by leveraging subcellular spatial transcriptomics and synergistic relationships between multiple layers of biological information. We validated GHIST using public datasets and The Cancer Genome Atlas data, demonstrating its flexibility across different spatial resolutions and superior performance. Our results underscore the utility of in silico generation of single-cell spatial gene expression measurements and the capacity to enrich existing datasets with a spatially resolved omics modality, paving the way for scalable multi-omics analysis and biomarker identification.

This makes it challenging to obtain high-resolution reconstructions, or may even cause projects to fail altogether. We have previously observed that laser flash melting and revitrification of cryo-EM samples reduces preferred orientation for large, symmetric particles. Here we demonstrate that our method can in fact be used to scramble the orientation of proteins of a range of sizes and symmetries. The effect can be enhanced for some proteins by increasing the heating rate during flash melting or by depositing amorphous ice onto the sample prior to revitrification. This also allows us to shed light onto the underlying mechanism. Our experiments establish a set of tools for overcoming preferred orientation that can be easily integrated into existing workflows. Individual proteins tend to adopt preferred orientations when subjected to vitrification for cryo-electron microscopy analysis. A laser flash melting procedure followed by rapid revitrification provides a simple approach to mitigate this issue, reducing the number of micrographs required for successful structure determination at high-resolution.},

  abstract     = {Protein language models trained on evolutionary data have emerged as powerful tools for predictive problems involving protein sequence, structure and function. However, these models overlook decades of research into biophysical factors governing protein function. We propose mutational effect transfer learning (METL), a protein language model framework that unites advanced machine learning and biophysical modeling. Using the METL framework, we pretrain transformer-based neural networks on biophysical simulation data to capture fundamental relationships between protein sequence, structure and energetics. We fine-tune METL on experimental sequence–function data to harness these biophysical signals and apply them when predicting protein properties like thermostability, catalytic activity and fluorescence. METL excels in challenging protein engineering tasks like generalizing from small training sets and position extrapolation, although existing methods that train on evolutionary signals remain powerful for many types of experimental assays. We demonstrate METL’s ability to design functional green fluorescent protein variants when trained on only 64 examples, showcasing the potential of biophysics-based protein language models for protein engineering. Mutational effect transfer learning (METL) is a protein language model framework that unites machine learning and biophysical modeling.

Accurate PTM site prediction using deep learning can help identify PTM-altering variants, but progress has been limited by the lack of large, high-quality training datasets. Here, we introduce PTMAtlas, a curated compendium of 397,524 PTM sites generated through systematic reprocessing of 241 public mass-spectrometry datasets, and DeepMVP, a deep learning framework trained on PTMAtlas to predict PTM sites for phosphorylation, acetylation, methylation, sumoylation, ubiquitination and N-glycosylation. DeepMVP substantially outperforms existing tools across all six PTM types. Its application to predicting PTM-altering missense variants shows strong concordance with experimental results, validated using literature-curated variants and cancer proteogenomic datasets. Together, PTMAtlas and DeepMVP provide a robust platform for PTM research and a scalable framework for assessing the functional consequences of coding variants through the lens of PTMs. DeepMVP is a deep learning framework for predicting PTM sites and variant-induced alterations across six modification types, including phosphorylation, acetylation, methylation, sumoylation, ubiquitination and N-glycosylation.},

A long-standing challenge in studying RBP regulation has been mapping RNA interactomes within the dynamic transcriptomic landscape, especially in single-cell contexts and primary tissues. Here we introduce MAPIT-seq (modification added to RBP interacting transcript-sequencing), which uses an antibody-directed editing strategy to map genome-wide in situ RBP–RNA interactions and gene expression concurrently. We demonstrate MAPIT-seq’s robustness across multiple RBPs and systematically analyze RNA substrates associated with core polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) components. MAPIT-seq is also applicable to frozen tissue sections, enabling the mapping of RBP roles during brain development. Importantly, we develop high-throughput single-cell MAPIT-seq (scMAPIT-seq) to reveal cell stage-specific RBP regulation. In summary, MAPIT-seq expands multi-omics profiling, providing an effective framework to study post-transcriptional regulation in dynamic biological processes and clinically relevant scenarios.

As this emerging field of physical oncology is being advanced by tumor biologists, cell and developmental biologists, engineers, physicists and oncologists, there is a critical need for model systems and measurement tools to mechanistically probe these physical hallmarks. Here, after briefly defining these physical hallmarks, we discuss the tools and model systems available for probing each hallmark in vitro, ex vivo, in vivo and in clinical settings. We finally review the unmet needs for mechanistic probing of the physical hallmarks of tumors and discuss the challenges and unanswered questions associated with each hallmark.

The JUMP Cell Painting Consortium perturbed roughly 75% of the protein-coding genome in human U-2 OS cells, generating a rich resource of single-cell images and extracted features. These profiles capture the phenotypic impacts of perturbing 15,243 human genes, including overexpressing 12,609 genes (using open reading frames) and knocking out 7,975 genes (using CRISPR–Cas9). Here we mitigated technical artifacts by rigorously evaluating data processing options and validated the dataset’s robustness and biological relevance. Analysis of phenotypic profiles revealed previously undiscovered gene clusters and functional relationships, including those associated with mitochondrial function, cancer and neural processes. The JUMP Cell Painting genetic dataset is a valuable resource for exploring gene relationships and uncovering previously unknown functions. This Resource presents the genetic subset of the 136,000 chemical and genetic perturbations tested by the Joint Undertaking for Morphological Profiling (JUMP) Cell Painting Consortium and associated analysis of phenotypic profiles.},

Here, we report the engineering and characterization of a genetically encoded green fluorescent chemokine sensor, named CRAFi-CCR2, which utilizes the CCR2 receptor as a sensing moiety. In astrocytes, hCRAFi-CCR2, derived from the human CCR2B receptor, exhibited ~300% increase in fluorescence in response to mCCL2, with nanomolar affinity (2.5 nM). Activation of hCRAFi-CCR2 did not affect downstream signaling pathways, such as calcium mobilization and receptor internalization. Using this sensor, we performed 17–20 h of real-time imaging to observe endogenous mCCL2 release under inflammatory conditions, both in cell culture and in mice. In mouse brain, we observed spatial heterogeneity of CCL2 signal response on a scale of about 20–50 µm, highlighting the complexity of the immune system’s spatiotemporal signaling. The genetically encoded sensor hCRAFi-CCR2 enables detection of chemokines binding to the CCR2 receptor, such as the main ligand CCL2 but also CCL7, CCL8, CCL13 and CXCL1. The sensor’s capabilities are demonstrated in cell culture and in various mouse models in vivo.},

Current approaches for discovering binders are laborious and time-consuming, taking months or more, and have a high failure rate. Here we establish phage-assisted noncontinuous selection of protein binders (PANCS-Binders), an in vivo selection platform that links the life cycle of M13 phage to target protein binding through proximity-dependent split RNA polymerase biosensors, allowing for comprehensive screening of whether a variant binds a target with high fidelity. We showcase PANCS-Binders by screening multiple protein libraries each against a panel of 95 separate targets, thereby individually assessing more than 1011 protein–protein interaction pairs, in 2 days. These selections yielded large, high-quality datasets and hundreds of novel binders, which can be affinity matured or directly used in mammalian cells to inhibit or degrade targets. We believe that PANCS-Binders accelerates and simplifies the binder discovery process, which will help unlock new creative potential in proteome targeting with engineered binder-based biotechnologies. Phage-assisted noncontinuous selection of protein binders (PANCS-Binders) allows multiple high-diversity protein libraries to each be screened against a panel of dozens of targets for high-throughput protein binder discovery.},

We developed an interaction language model (iLM), Sliding Window Interaction Grammar (SWING) that leverages differences in amino-acid properties to generate an interaction vocabulary. SWING successfully predicted both class I and class II peptide–major histocompatibility complex interactions. Furthermore, the class I SWING model could uniquely cross-predict class II interactions, a complex prediction task not attempted by existing methods. Using human class I and II data, SWING accurately predicted murine class II peptide–major histocompatibility interactions involving risk alleles in systemic lupus erythematosus and type 1 diabetes. SWING accurately predicted how variants can disrupt specific protein–protein interactions, based on sequence information alone. SWING outperformed passive uses of protein language model embeddings, demonstrating the value of the unique iLM architecture. Overall, SWING is a generalizable zero-shot iLM that learns the language of protein–protein interactions. SWING is a versatile interaction language model that can learn the language of peptide and protein interactions.},

A prominent example are switchable protein variants, created by receptor domain insertion into effector proteins. Identifying suitable, allosteric sites for domain insertion, however, typically requires extensive screening and optimization. We present ProDomino, a machine learning pipeline to rationalize domain recombination, trained on a semisynthetic protein sequence dataset derived from naturally occurring intradomain insertion events. ProDomino robustly identifies domain insertion sites in proteins of biotechnological relevance, which we experimentally validated in Escherichia coli and human cells. Finally, we used light- and chemically regulated receptor domains as inserts and demonstrate the rapid, model-guided creation of potent, single-component opto- and chemogenetic protein switches. These include novel CRISPR–Cas9 and –Cas12a variants for inducible genome engineering in human cells. Our work enables one-shot domain insertion engineering and substantially accelerates the design of customized allosteric proteins. ProDomino is a machine leaning-based method, trained on a semisynthetic domain insertion dataset, to guide the engineering of protein domain recombination.},

In this study, we developed SynNICE, a method for assembling and delivering intact, naive, synthetic megabase (Mb)-scale human DNA into early mouse embryos, to study de novo epigenetic regulation. By assembling and delivering a 1.14-Mb human AZFa (hAZFa) locus, we observed the spontaneous incorporation of murine histones and the establishment of DNA methylation at the one-cell stage. Notably, DNA methylation from scratch strongly enriches at repeat sequences without H3K9me3 reinforcement. Furthermore, the transcription of hAZFa initiated at the four-cell stage is regulated by newly established DNA methylation. This method provides a unique platform for exploring de novo epigenomic regulation mechanisms in higher animals. This work presents a strategy for synthesizing and assembling megabase-scale DNA, along with a delivery method for introducing the synthetic DNA into mouse embryos, offering a valuable tool for investigating de novo epigenetic regulation.},

  abstract     = {Gene-set analysis seeks to identify the biological mechanisms underlying groups of genes with shared functions. Large language models (LLMs) have recently shown promise in generating functional descriptions for input gene sets but may produce factually incorrect statements, commonly referred to as hallucinations in LLMs. Here we present GeneAgent, an LLM-based AI agent for gene-set analysis that reduces hallucinations by autonomously interacting with biological databases to verify its own output. Evaluation of 1,106 gene sets collected from different sources demonstrates that GeneAgent is consistently more accurate than GPT-4 by a significant margin. We further applied GeneAgent to seven novel gene sets derived from mouse B2905 melanoma cell lines. Expert review confirmed that GeneAgent produces more relevant and comprehensive functional descriptions than GPT-4, providing valuable insights into gene functions and expediting knowledge discovery. GeneAgent is a language agent using large language models and self-verification to improve gene-set function annotation.},

  abstract     = {Recent advances in genome sequencing have improved variant calling in complex regions of the human genome. However, it is difficult to quantify variant calling performance because existing standards often focus on specificity, neglecting completeness in difficult-to-analyze regions. To create a more comprehensive truth set, we used Mendelian inheritance in a large pedigree (CEPH-1463) to filter variants across PacBio high-fidelity (HiFi), Illumina and Oxford Nanopore Technologies platforms. This generated a variant map with over 4.7 million single-nucleotide variants, 767,795 insertions and deletions (indels), 537,486 tandem repeats and 24,315 structural variants, covering 2.77 Gb of the GRCh38 genome. This work adds ~200 Mb of high-confidence regions, including 8% more small variants, and introduces the first tandem repeat and structural variant truth sets for NA12878 and her family. As an example of the value of this improved benchmark, we retrained DeepVariant using these data to reduce genotyping errors by ~34%. This work introduces a pedigree-derived benchmark for single-nucleotide variants, indels, structural variants and tandem repeats, offering a variant map to validate sequencing workflows or to support the development and evaluation of new variant callers.},

  abstract     = {Next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies have achieved remarkable success in both biological research and clinical applications. However, in recent years, performance improvements have slowed due to fundamental limitations imposed by Poiseuille fluid dynamics in flow cells, which we overcome using Couette flow. Here we show NGS by roll-to-roll fluidics (r2r-fl), a cost-effective approach compatible with flexible biochip sizes. r2r-fl is a practical implementation of plane Couette flow, with up to 85-fold lower reagent consumption (US$0.16 per gigabase pair), rinsing times under 2 s and a reduction in paired-end 100-base pair sequencing turnaround from days to less than 12 h. The method maintains over 99.9% precision and 99.3% sensitivity of single nucleotide polymorphisms in the human genome, 99.9% mapping rate for Escherichia coli, and minimal nucleotide substitutions, deletions or insertions in the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 alpha strain. By lowering cost and time, r2r-fl enables rapid, scalable NGS for pathogen detection, cancer diagnostics and genetic disease profiling. This work introduces roll-to-roll fluidics, a method that enhances reagent efficiency and reduces turnaround time, enabling rapid and economical next-generation sequencing.},

Here we compared five foundation models and two other deep learning models against deliberately simple baselines for predicting transcriptome changes after single or double perturbations. None outperformed the baselines, which highlights the importance of critical benchmarking in directing and evaluating method development. The analysis presented in this Brief Communication shows that, despite their complexity, current deep learning models do not outperform linear baselines in predicting gene perturbation effects, thus emphasizing the importance of further method development and thorough evaluation.},

However, the diversity of SRM techniques, each operating through different mechanisms, combined with the lack of a clear consensus on the definition of resolution, has hindered the biological community from fully recognizing SRM’s contribution to structural biology. I propose a framework for defining, measuring and reporting resolution in SRM. Within this framework, I examine the capabilities of state-of-the-art methods that can achieve ‘ångström-scale resolution’ and clarify the level of structural detail users can expect to observe. Finally, drawing from recent advancements, I explore pathways to extend SRM towards live structural imaging. This Perspective introduces a framework for defining, measuring and reporting resolution in super-resolution microscopy and details the current state of the art in using fluorescence microscopy for structural biology at the ångström scale.},

  abstract     = {The networked architecture of the brain promotes synchrony among neuronal populations. These communication patterns can be mapped using functional imaging, yielding functional connectivity (FC) networks. While most studies use Pearson’s correlations by default, numerous pairwise interaction statistics exist in the scientific literature. How does the organization of the FC matrix vary with the choice of pairwise statistic? Here we use a library of 239 pairwise statistics to benchmark canonical features of FC networks, including hub mapping, weight–distance trade-offs, structure–function coupling, correspondence with other neurophysiological networks, individual fingerprinting and brain–behavior prediction. We find substantial quantitative and qualitative variation across FC methods. Measures such as covariance, precision and distance display multiple desirable properties, including correspondence with structural connectivity and the capacity to differentiate individuals and predict individual differences in behavior. Our report highlights how FC mapping can be optimized by tailoring pairwise statistics to specific neurophysiological mechanisms and research questions. In this Analysis, Liu et al. benchmark more than 200 pairwise statistics for functional brain connectivity in tasks such as hub mapping, distance relationships, structure–function coupling and behavior prediction, revealing varying effectiveness for specific neurophysiological applications.},

  abstract     = {Brain connectivity can be estimated in many ways, depending on modality and processing strategy. Here, we present the Krakencoder, a joint connectome mapping tool that simultaneously bidirectionally translates between structural and functional connectivity, and between different atlases and processing choices via a common latent representation. These mappings demonstrate exceptional accuracy and individual-level identifiability; the mapping between structural and functional connectivity has identifiability 42–54% higher than existing models. The Krakencoder combines all connectome flavors via a shared low-dimensional latent space. This fusion representation better reflects familial relatedness, preserves age- and sex-relevant information, and enhances cognition-relevant information. The Krakencoder can be applied, without retraining, to new out-of-distribution data while still preserving inter-individual differences in the connectome predictions and familial relationships in the latent representations. The Krakencoder is a notable leap forward in capturing the relationship between multimodal brain connectomes in an individualized, behaviorally and demographically relevant way. The Krakencoder can translate between structural and functional connectivity as well as between different atlases and processing choices via latent representations, as illustrated with datasets from the Human Connectome Project.},

Recent developments in omics technologies, including single-cell RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptomics, provide detailed genomic data alongside tissue histology. However, current computational models focus on either omics or image analysis, lacking their integration. To address this, we developed OmiCLIP, a visual–omics foundation model linking hematoxylin and eosin images and transcriptomics using tissue patches from Visium data. We transformed transcriptomic data into ‘sentences’ by concatenating top-expressed gene symbols from each patch. We curated a dataset of 2.2 million paired tissue images and transcriptomic data across 32 organs to train OmiCLIP integrating histology and transcriptomics. Building on OmiCLIP, our Loki platform offers five key functions: tissue alignment, annotation via bulk RNA sequencing or marker genes, cell-type decomposition, image–transcriptomics retrieval and spatial transcriptomics gene expression prediction from hematoxylin and eosin-stained images. Compared with 22 state-of-the-art models on 5 simulations, and 19 public and 4 in-house experimental datasets, Loki demonstrated consistent accuracy and robustness. OmiCLIP is a visual–omics foundation model that integrates histology and spatial transcriptomics. The associated Loki platform offers accurate and robust tools for alignment, annotation, cell-type decomposition and spatial gene expression prediction.},

However, the accuracy of these analyses is limited by image quality, which can be compromised by missing data, tissue damage or low resolution due to mechanical, temporal or financial constraints. Here, we introduce InterpolAI, a method for interpolation of synthetic images between pairs of authentic images in a stack of images, by leveraging frame interpolation for large image motion, an optical flow-based artificial intelligence (AI) model. InterpolAI outperforms both linear interpolation and state-of-the-art optical flow-based method XVFI, preserving microanatomical features and cell counts, and image contrast, variance and luminance. InterpolAI repairs tissue damages and reduces stitching artifacts. We validated InterpolAI across multiple imaging modalities, species, staining techniques and pixel resolutions. This work demonstrates the potential of AI in improving the resolution, throughput and quality of image datasets to enable improved 3D imaging. InterpolAI leverages optimal flow-based artificial intelligence to produce synthetic images between pairs of images for diverse three-dimensional image types. InterpolAI is more robust and accurate than existing methods, improving data quality for downstream analysis.},

  abstract     = {Light-field microscopy (LFM) and its variants have significantly advanced intravital high-speed 3D imaging. However, their practical applications remain limited due to trade-offs among processing speed, fidelity, and generalization in existing reconstruction methods. Here we propose a physics-driven self-supervised reconstruction network (SeReNet) for unscanned LFM and scanning LFM (sLFM) to achieve near-diffraction-limited resolution at millisecond-level processing speed. SeReNet leverages 4D information priors to not only achieve better generalization than existing deep-learning methods, especially under challenging conditions such as strong noise, optical aberration, and sample motion, but also improve processing speed by 700 times over iterative tomography. Axial performance can be further enhanced via fine-tuning as an optional add-on with compromised generalization. We demonstrate these advantages by imaging living cells, zebrafish embryos and larvae, Caenorhabditis elegans, and mice. Equipped with SeReNet, sLFM now enables continuous day-long high-speed 3D subcellular imaging with over 300,000 volumes of large-scale intercellular dynamics, such as immune responses and neural activities, leading to widespread practical biological applications. SeReNet is an accurate, generalizable, and efficient physics-driven self-supervised reconstruction network for light-field microscopy that enables day-long high-speed 3D intravital imaging of processes including immune responses and neural activity.},

Here we introduce a morphology-appropriate representation learning framework that uses three-dimensional rotation-invariant autoencoders and point clouds. This framework is used to learn representations of complex shapes that are independent of orientation, compact and interpretable. We apply our framework to intracellular structures with punctate morphologies (for example, DNA replication foci) and polymorphic morphologies (for example, nucleoli). We explore the trade-offs in the performance of this framework compared to image-based autoencoders by performing multi-metric benchmarking across efficiency, generative capability and representation expressivity metrics. We find that the proposed framework, which embraces the underlying morphology of multi-piece structures, can facilitate the unsupervised discovery of subclusters for each structure. We show how this approach can also be applied to phenotypic profiling using a dataset of nucleolar images following drug perturbations. An image analysis framework makes use of rotation-invariant autoencoders and point clouds for morphology-appropriate representation learning to better understand the organization of complex subcellular structures.},

In addition, no methods currently exist for identifying histological tissue artifacts that are unique to SRT. Here, we introduce SpotSweeper, a spatially aware QC method that leverages local neighborhoods to correct for spatial confounding in order to identify both local outliers and regional artifacts in SRT. Using SpotSweeper on publicly available data, we identify a consistent set of Visium barcoded spots as systematically low quality and demonstrate that SpotSweeper accurately identifies two distinct types of regional artifacts. SpotSweeper represents a substantial advancement in spatially resolved transcriptomics QC for SRT, providing a robust, generalizable framework to ensure data reliability across diverse experimental conditions and technologies.

Most current single-cell RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptomics computational approaches exhibit high false-positive rates, do not detect signals between individual cells and only identify single ligand–receptor communication. To overcome these challenges, we developed Cell Neural Networks on Spatial Transcriptomics (CellNEST) to decipher patterns of communication. Our model introduces a new type of relay-network communication detection that identifies putative ligand–receptor–ligand–receptor communication. CellNEST detects T cell homing signals in human lymph nodes, identifies aggressive cancer communication in lung adenocarcinoma and colorectal cancer, and predicts new patterns of communication that may act as relay networks in pancreatic cancer. Along with CellNEST, we provide a web-based, interactive visualization method to explore in situ communication. CellNEST is available at https://github.com/schwartzlab-methods/CellNEST . Cell Neural Networks on Spatial Transcriptomics (CellNEST) deciphers patterns of communication between cells in spatially resolved transcriptomics data and can detect both signals between individual cells and relay networks of communication.},

Imaging-based spatial transcriptomics (iST), in particular, relies on the precise detection of millions of transcripts in low signal-to-noise images. Despite recent advances in computer vision, most of the currently used spot detection techniques are still based on classical signal processing and require tedious manual tuning per dataset. Here we introduce Spotiflow, a deep learning method for subpixel-accurate spot detection that formulates spot detection as a multiscale heatmap and stereographic flow regression problem. Spotiflow supports 2D and 3D images, generalizes across different imaging conditions and is more time and memory efficient than existing methods. We show the efficacy of Spotiflow by extensive quantitative experiments on diverse datasets and demonstrate that its increased accuracy leads to meaningful improvements in biological insights obtained from iST and live imaging experiments. Spotiflow is available as an easy-to-use Python library as well as a napari plugin at https://github.com/weigertlab/spotiflow . Spotiflow uses deep learning for subpixel-accurate spot detection in diverse 2D and 3D images. The improved accuracy offered by Spotiflow enables improved biological insights in both iST and live imaging experiments.},

  abstract     = {Proteins and other biomolecules form dynamic macromolecular machines that are tightly orchestrated to move, bind and perform chemistry. Cryo-electron microscopy and cryo-electron tomography can access the intrinsic heterogeneity of these complexes and are therefore key tools for understanding their function. However, three-dimensional reconstruction of the collected imaging data presents a challenging computational problem, especially without any starting information, a setting termed ab initio reconstruction. Here we introduce cryoDRGN-AI, a method leveraging an expressive neural representation and combining an exhaustive search strategy with gradient-based optimization to process challenging heterogeneous datasets. Using cryoDRGN-AI, we reveal new conformational states in large datasets, reconstruct previously unresolved motions from unfiltered datasets and demonstrate ab initio reconstruction of biomolecular complexes from in situ data. With this expressive and scalable model for structure determination, we hope to unlock the full potential of cryo-electron microscopy and cryo-electron tomography as a high-throughput tool for structural biology and discovery. CryoDRGN-AI is a deep learning system for ab initio reconstruction of dynamic biomolecular complexes from cryo-electron microscopy and cryo-electron tomography imaging datasets.},

  abstract     = {Understanding protein hydration at the atomic level is a hallmark challenge in deciphering ligand binding and guiding ligand discovery. The fact that 95% of deposited crystal structures are cryogenic currently limits the utility of crystallographic water features, because water networks change with temperature. Here, to increase our confidence in interpreting cryogenic water networks, we developed ColdBrew—a machine learning method that predicts the likelihood of cryogenic crystallographic water molecules appearing at room temperature. To link ColdBrew probabilities to water displaceability, we examined &gt;1 million waters in ligand-bound cryogenic structures and found that ColdBrew sufficiently separated conserved waters from displaceable or absent ones. To link our metric to water energies, we applied inhomogeneous solvation theory to show that waters with high ColdBrew probability and low displaceability indeed have more favorable energies. Unlike expensive computational methods, ColdBrew provides a scalable approach to assessing the utility of water molecules for ligand discovery directly from experimental cryogenic crystal structures. We precalculated ColdBrew probabilities for &gt;46 million waters in over 100,000 Protein Data Bank structures. ColdBrew is a machine learning-based method that predicts the probability of cryogenic crystallographic waters to be present at room temperature, which links to their relative energies and displaceability by ligands.},

Protein sequences intrinsically encode their propensity to form condensates, but specific sequence features that regulate this behavior have not been systematically explored at scale. Here, we develop CondenSeq, a high-throughput pooled imaging with in situ sequencing approach to measure propensities of thousands of protein sequences to form nuclear condensates. Leveraging the large scale of these experiments, we evaluated the impacts of dozens of sequence features across a wide range of sequence contexts, identifying several features with highly consistent, context-independent effects and others with less-consistent effects. We also identified multiple classes of condensates and discovered distinct sequence properties that drive their formation. Our results provide a systematic overview of the relationships between protein sequences and nuclear condensate formation and establish a general approach for further dissecting these relationships at scale. CondenSeq is an imaging-based, high-throughput platform for characterizing condensate formation within the nuclear environment, uncovering the protein sequence features that promote this process.},

  abstract     = {A critical challenge in mass spectrometry proteomics is accurately assessing error control, especially given that software tools employ distinct methods for reporting errors. Many tools are closed-source and poorly documented, leading to inconsistent validation strategies. Here we identify three prevalent methods for validating false discovery rate (FDR) control: one invalid, one providing only a lower bound, and one valid but under-powered. The result is that the proteomics community has limited insight into actual FDR control effectiveness, especially for data-independent acquisition (DIA) analyses. We propose a theoretical framework for entrapment experiments, allowing us to rigorously characterize different approaches. Moreover, we introduce a more powerful evaluation method and apply it alongside existing techniques to assess existing tools. We first validate our analysis in the better-understood data-dependent acquisition setup, and then, we analyze DIA data, where we find that no DIA search tool consistently controls the FDR, with particularly poor performance on single-cell datasets. A theoretical foundation for entrapment methods is presented, along with a method that enables more accurate evaluation of false discovery rate (FDR) control in proteomics mass spectrometry analysis pipelines. Evaluation of popular data-dependent acquisition tools indicates that these generally seem to control the FDR, but data-independent acquisition tools exhibit inconsistent control of the FDR at both the peptide and protein levels.},

  abstract     = {A core computational challenge in the analysis of mass spectrometry data is the de novo sequencing problem, in which the generating amino acid sequence is inferred directly from an observed fragmentation spectrum without the use of a sequence database. Recently, deep learning models have made substantial advances in de novo sequencing by learning from massive datasets of high-confidence labeled mass spectra. However, these methods are designed primarily for data-dependent acquisition experiments. Over the past decade, the field of mass spectrometry has been moving toward using data-independent acquisition (DIA) protocols for the analysis of complex proteomic samples owing to their superior specificity and reproducibility. Hence, we present a de novo sequencing model called Cascadia, which uses a transformer architecture to handle the more complex data generated by DIA protocols. In comparisons with existing approaches for de novo sequencing of DIA data, Cascadia achieves substantially improved performance across a range of instruments and experimental protocols. Cascadia is a mass spectrometry-based de novo sequencing model that uses a transformer architecture to handle data-independent acquisition data and achieves substantially improved performance across a range of instruments and experimental protocols.},

Here we describe SAVANA, an algorithm designed to detect somatic SVs and SCNAs at single-haplotype resolution and estimate tumor purity and ploidy using long-read sequencing data with or without a germline control sample. We also establish best practices for benchmarking SV detection algorithms across the entire genome in a data-driven manner using replication and read-backed phasing analysis. Through the analysis of matched Illumina and nanopore whole-genome sequencing data for 99 human tumor-normal pairs, we show that SAVANA has significantly higher sensitivity and 13- and 82-times-higher specificity than the second and third-best performing algorithms. Moreover, SVs reported by SAVANA are highly consistent with those detected using short-read sequencing. In summary, SAVANA enables the application of long-read sequencing to detect SVs and SCNAs reliably. SAVANA is a tool to detect somatic structural variants and copy number aberrations using long-read sequencing data, offering high sensitivity, specificity and compatibility with or without germline controls.},

  abstract     = {Effective connectivity (EC), which reflects the causal interactions between brain regions, is fundamental to understanding information processing in the brain; however, traditional methods for obtaining EC, which rely on neural responses to stimulation, are often invasive or limited in spatial coverage, making them unsuitable for whole-brain EC mapping in humans. Here, to address this gap, we introduce Neural Perturbational Inference (NPI), a data-driven framework for mapping whole-brain EC. NPI employs an artificial neural network trained to model large-scale neural dynamics, serving as a computational surrogate of the brain. By systematically perturbing all regions in the surrogate brain and analyzing the resulting responses in other regions, NPI maps the directionality, strength and excitatory/inhibitory properties of brain-wide EC. Validation of NPI on generative models with known ground-truth EC demonstrates its superiority over existing methods such as Granger causality and dynamic causal modeling. When applied to resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data across diverse datasets, NPI reveals consistent, structurally supported EC patterns. Furthermore, comparisons with cortico-cortical evoked potential data show a strong resemblance between NPI-inferred EC and real stimulation propagation patterns. By transitioning from correlational to causal understandings of brain functionality, NPI marks a stride in decoding the brain’s functional architecture and facilitating both neuroscience studies and clinical applications. Neural Perturbational Inference is an approach for estimating effective connectivity, in which virtual perturbations to a surrogate brain allow gaining insights into human brain functions.},

However, tissue scattering severely limits its application in dense neuronal populations. Here we adopt the principle of localization microscopy, a technique that enables super-resolution imaging of single molecules, to resolve dense neuronal activities in vivo. Leveraging the sparse activation of neurons during action potentials (APs), we precisely localize the fluorescence changes associated with each AP, creating a super-resolution image of neuronal activity. This approach, termed activity localization imaging (ALI), identifies overlapping neurons and separates their activities with over tenfold greater precision than what tissue scattering permits. We applied ALI to widefield, targeted illumination and light sheet microscopy data, resolving neurons that cannot be distinguished by existing signal extraction pipelines. In the mouse hippocampus, ALI generates a cellular resolution map of theta oscillations, revealing the diversity of neuronal phase locking within a dense local network. ALI is an approach for analyzing voltage imaging data that is inspired by algorithms used in super-resolution microscopy. It allows resolving the activity of single neurons in densely labeled populations in scattering conditions.},

Due to its simplicity and reproducibility, this system is ideal for high-throughput quantitative studies of tissue patterning and has led to many insights into the mechanisms of mammalian gastrulation. However, 2D gastruloids have been studied only up to about 2 days owing to a loss of organization beyond this time with earlier protocols. Here we report an extended 2D gastruloid model to up to 10 days. We discovered a phase of highly reproducible morphogenesis between 2 and 4 days during which directed migration from the primitive streak-like region gives rise to a mesodermal layer beneath an epiblast-like layer. Multiple types of mesoderm arise with striking spatial organization including lateral plate mesoderm-like cells on the colony border and paraxial mesoderm-like cells further inside the colony. Single-cell transcriptomics showed strong similarity of these cells to mesoderm in human and nonhuman primate embryos. Our results illustrate that extended culture of 2D gastruloids provides a powerful model for human mesoderm differentiation and morphogenesis. This study reports an extended 2D gastruloid system for spatially modeling human mesoderm development.},

We adopt methods from ab initio cell simulation, in a method called Proseg (probabilistic segmentation), to rapidly infer morphologically plausible cell boundaries. Benchmarking applied to datasets generated by three commercial platforms shows superior performance and computational efficiency of Proseg when compared to existing methods. We show that improved accuracy in cell segmentation aids greatly in detection of difficult-to-segment tumor-infiltrating immune cells such as neutrophils and T cells. Last, through improvements in our ability to delineate subsets of tumor-infiltrating T cells, we show that CXCL13-expressing CD8+ T cells tend to be more closely associated with tumor cells than their CXCL13-negative counterparts in data generated from samples from patients with renal cell carcinoma. Proseg is a segmentation approach for single-cell spatially resolved transcriptomics data that uses unsupervised probabilistic modeling of the spatial distribution of transcripts to accurately segment cells without the need for multimodal staining.},

  abstract     = {Bioluminescence is an attractive alternative to fluorescence for live-cell imaging; however, its low intensity has prevented widespread adoption. Specialized microscopes compensate by sacrificing spatial resolution, field of view and dynamic range—constraints imposed by the highest-sensitivity camera to date: the electron-multiplying charge-coupled device. Recently, quanta image sensor (QIS) technology has emerged for low-light imaging. Here, we show that a commercial QIS camera has exceptional sensitivity; however, its sensor dimensions necessitate a microscope designed to maximize its properties. We introduce a Keplerian-telescope-inspired microscope setup that, with the QIS, results in modestly improved signal-to-noise ratios at substantially higher spatial resolution, field of view and dynamic range, relative to the state of the art. The telescopic design also confers modularity, enabling multimodal imaging with epifluorescence. The ‘QIScope’ makes bioluminescence a viable tool for technically challenging live-cell experiments such as monitoring intracellular and extracellular vesicles simultaneously and the dynamics of low-abundance proteins. Bioluminescence imaging with enhanced sensitivity, resolution and dynamic range is enabled by a camera based on quanta image sensor technology in combination with a dedicated unconventional microscope design. The capabilities of the QIScope are demonstrated in live imaging of extracellular vesicles or low-abundance proteins.},

This assumption is often inadequate, but space-variant deblurring techniques generally require impractical amounts of calibration and computation. We present an imaging pipeline that leverages symmetry to provide simple and fast spatially varying deblurring. Our ring deconvolution microscopy method utilizes the rotational symmetry of most microscopes and cameras, and naturally extends to sheet deconvolution in the case of lateral symmetry. We derive theory and algorithms for ring deconvolution microscopy and propose a neural network based on Seidel aberration coefficients as a fast alternative. We demonstrate improvements in speed and image quality as compared to standard deconvolution and existing spatially varying deblurring across a diverse range of microscope modalities, including miniature microscopy, multicolor fluorescence microscopy, multimode fiber micro-endoscopy and light-sheet fluorescence microscopy. Our approach enables near-isotropic, subcellular resolution in each of these applications. Ring deconvolution microscopy leverages symmetry to provide fast and straightforward spatially varying deblurring and offers improved speed and image quality compared to standard approaches across diverse microscopy modalities.},

Here, we introduce Dark sectioning, a method inspired by natural image dehazing for removing backgrounds that leverages dark channel prior and dual frequency separation to provide single-frame optical sectioning. Unlike denoising or deconvolution, Dark sectioning specifically targets and removes out-of-focus backgrounds, stably improving the signal-to-background ratio by nearly 10 dB and structural similarity index measure of images by approximately tenfold. Dark sectioning was validated using wide-field, confocal, two/three-dimensional structured illumination and one/two-photon microscopy with high-fidelity reconstruction. We further demonstrate its potential to improve the segmentation accuracy in deep tissues, resulting in better recognition of neurons in the mouse brain and accurate assessment of nuclei in prostate lesions or mouse brain sections. Dark sectioning is compatible with many other microscopy modalities, including light-sheet and light-field microscopy, as well as processing algorithms, including deconvolution and super-resolution optical fluctuation imaging. The Dark sectioning algorithm removes the background and provides single-frame optical sectioning in fluorescence microscopy.

Here we develop an extremely stable monomeric RFP named mScarlet3-H and determine its structure at a 1.5 Å resolution. mScarlet3-H exhibits remarkable resistance to high temperature, chaotropic conditions and oxidative environments, enabling efficient correlative light and electron microscopy imaging and rapid (less than 1 day) whole-organ tissue clearing. In addition, its high photostability allows long-term three-dimensional structured illumination microscopy imaging of mitochondrial dynamics with minimal photobleaching. It also facilitates dual-color live-cell stimulated emission depletion imaging with a high signal-to-noise ratio and strong specificity. Systematic benchmarking against high-performing RFPs established mScarlet3-H as a highly stable RFP for multimodality microscopy in cell cultures and model organisms, complementing green FPs for multiplexed imaging in zebrafish, mice and Nicotiana benthamiana. The red fluorescent protein mScarlet3-H is bright, photostable and very robust to high temperature, chaotropic conditions and oxidative environments. mScarlet3-H works well in correlative light and electron microscopy, tissue clearing and time-lapse super-resolution microscopy.},

  abstract     = {Organic fluorophores are the keystone of advanced biological imaging. The vast chemical space of fluorophores has been extensively explored in search of molecules with ideal properties. However, within the current molecular constraints, there appears to be a trade-off between high brightness, robust photostability, and tunable biochemical properties. Herein we report a general strategy to systematically boost the performance of donor-acceptor-type fluorophores, such as rhodamines, by leveraging SO2 and O-substituted azabicyclo[3.2.1] octane auxochromes. These bicyclic heterocycles give rise to a collection of ‘bridged’ dyes (BD) spanning the ultraviolet and visible range with top-notch quantum efficiencies, enhanced water solubility, and tunable cell-permeability. Notably, these azabicyclic fluorophores showed remarkable photostability compared to their tetramethyl or azetidine analogs while being completely resistant to oxidative photoblueing. Functionalized BD dyes are tailored for applications in single-molecule imaging, super-resolution imaging (STED and SIM) in fixed or live mammalian and plant cells, and live zebrafish imaging and chemogenetic voltage imaging. A suite of bridged rhodamine dyes (BriDyes) offers excellent brightness, solubility, photostability, and tunable cell permeability along with resistance to photoblueing, making them exceptional all-purpose dyes for fluorescence biomaging.},

Existing datasets capture limited pairs of proteins and cell lines, and existing protein localization prediction models either miss cell-type specificity or cannot generalize to unseen proteins. Here we present a method for Prediction of Unseen Proteins’ Subcellular localization (PUPS). PUPS combines a protein language model and an image inpainting model to utilize both protein sequence and cellular images. We demonstrate that the protein sequence input enables generalization to unseen proteins, and the cellular image input captures single-cell variability, enabling cell-type-specific predictions. Experimental validation shows that PUPS can predict protein localization in newly performed experiments outside the Human Protein Atlas used for training. Collectively, PUPS provides a framework for predicting differential protein localization across cell lines and single cells within a cell line, including changes in protein localization driven by mutations. Prediction of Unseen Proteins’ Subcellular localization (PUPS) combines a protein language model and an image inpainting model to utilize both protein sequence and cellular images for predicting protein localization on unseen proteins in a way that captures single-cell variability and cell-type specificity.},

Currently there is a paucity of algorithms to identify 3D genome features in sequential Oligopaints data. Here, we present FISHnet, a graph theory method based on optimization of network modularity to detect chromatin domains in pairwise distance matrices. FISHnet sensitively and specifically identifies domains and boundaries in both simulated and real single-allele imaging data and provides statistical tests for the identification of cell-type-specific domains-like folding patterns. Application of FISHnet across multiple published Oligopaints datasets confirms that nested domains consistent with TADs and subTADs are not an emergent property of ensemble Hi-C data but also observable on single alleles. We make FISHnet code freely available to the scientific community, thus enabling future studies aiming to elucidate the role of single-allele folding variation on genome function.

Here we introduce ReLiC, a scalable and high-throughput RNA-linked CRISPR approach to measure the responses of diverse RNA metabolic processes to knockout of 2,092 human genes encoding all known RNA-associated proteins. ReLiC relies on an iterative strategy to integrate genes encoding Cas9, single-guide RNAs (sgRNAs) and barcoded reporter libraries into a defined genomic locus. Combining ReLiC with polysome fractionation reveals key regulators of ribosome occupancy, uncovering links between translation and proteostasis. Isoform-specific ReLiC captures differential regulation of intron retention and exon skipping by SF3B complex subunits. Chemogenomic ReLiC screens decipher translational regulators upstream of messenger RNA (mRNA) decay and identify a role for the ribosome collision sensor GCN1 during treatment with the anti-leukemic drug homoharringtonine. Our work demonstrates ReLiC as a powerful framework for discovering and dissecting post-transcriptional regulatory networks in human cells. This work presents ReLiC, an RNA-linked CRISPR platform that enables dissection of RNA metabolic processes by targeting over 2,000 RNA-associated genes, revealing key regulators on RNA splicing, translation and decay.},

We previously reported GLORI, a chemical-assisted approach to achieve unbiased and precise m6A measurement. However, its lengthy reaction time and severe RNA degradation have limited its applicability, particularly for low-input samples. Here, we present two updated GLORI approaches that are ultrafast, mild and enable absolute m6A quantification from one to two orders of magnitude less than the RNA starting material: GLORI 2.0 is compatible with RNA from ~10,000 cells and enhances sensitivity for both transcriptome-wide and locus-specific m6A detection; GLORI 3.0 further utilizes a reverse transcription-silent carrier RNA to achieve m6A quantification from as low as 500–1,000 cells. Using limited RNA from mouse dorsal hippocampus, we reveal a high modification level in synapse-related gene sets. We envision that the updated GLORI methods will greatly expand the applicability of absolute quantification of m6A in biology. This work introduces GLORI 2.0 and 3.0, enabling sensitive m6A quantification from RNA inputs as low as a few hundred cells.},

Finally, we provide perspectives on key areas of technical need in which there are clear opportunities for innovation. Our goal is to guide microscope engineers and biomedical end users toward optimal imaging methods for specific investigational scenarios and to identify use cases in which additional innovations in high-resolution imaging could be helpful. This Review discusses current 2D and 3D microscopy methods for imaging three-dimensional cell cultures and emerging strategies to address key challenges.},

  abstract     = {Advances in computer vision and increasingly widespread video-based behavioral monitoring are currently transforming how we study animal behavior. However, there is still a gap between the prospects and practical application, especially in videos from the wild. In this Perspective, we aim to present the capabilities of current methods for behavioral analysis, while at the same time highlighting unsolved computer vision problems that are relevant to the study of animal behavior. We survey state-of-the-art methods for computer vision problems relevant to the video-based study of individualized animal behavior, including object detection, multi-animal tracking, individual identification and (inter)action understanding. We then review methods for effort-efficient learning, one of the challenges from a practical perspective. In our outlook on the emerging field of computer vision for animal behavior, we argue that the field should develop approaches to unify detection, tracking, identification and (inter)action understanding in a single, video-based framework. In this Perspective, Vogg et al. discuss the progress and challenges of using computer vision approaches in the behavioral analysis of primates in their natural environment.},

  abstract     = {Advances in electron microscopy, image segmentation and computational infrastructure have given rise to large-scale and richly annotated connectomic datasets, which are increasingly shared across communities. To enable collaboration, users need to be able to concurrently create annotations and correct errors in the automated segmentation by proofreading. In large datasets, every proofreading edit relabels cell identities of millions of voxels and thousands of annotations like synapses. For analysis, users require immediate and reproducible access to this changing and expanding data landscape. Here we present the Connectome Annotation Versioning Engine (CAVE), a computational infrastructure that provides scalable solutions for proofreading and flexible annotation support for fast analysis queries at arbitrary time points. Deployed as a suite of web services, CAVE empowers distributed communities to perform reproducible connectome analysis in up to petascale datasets (~1 mm3) while proofreading and annotating is ongoing. The Connectome Annotation Versioning Engine (CAVE) is a platform for proofreading, annotating and analyzing datasets reaching the petascale. Currently, CAVE is used for electron microscopy datasets, but it can potentially be used for other large-scale datasets.},

  abstract     = {Genetically modified rabies virus can map neural circuits retrogradely from genetically determined cells. However, similar tools for anterograde tracing are not available. Here, we describe a method for anterograde transsynaptic tracing from genetically determined neurons based on a rationally designed protein, ATLAS. Expression of ATLAS in neurons causes presynaptic release of a payload composed of an antibody-like protein, AMPA.FingR, which binds to the N terminus of GluA1, and a recombinase. In the synaptic cleft, AMPA.FingR binds to GluA1, causing the payload to be endocytosed into postsynaptic cells and delivered to the nucleus, where it triggers expression of a recombinase-dependent reporter. In mice, ATLAS mediates monosynaptic transneuronal tracing from random or genetically determined cells that is strictly anterograde, synaptic and nontoxic. Moreover, ATLAS-mediated tracing shows activity dependence, suggesting that it can label active circuits underlying specific behaviors. Finally, ATLAS is composed of modular components that can be independently replaced or modified. ATLAS is a tool for circuit tracing, demonstrated here in rodents. It allows anterograde transsynaptic tracing, starting from genetically defined neurons.},

  abstract     = {Subcellular diffusion in living systems reflects cellular processes and interactions. Recent advances in optical microscopy allow the tracking of this nanoscale diffusion of individual objects with unprecedented precision. However, the agnostic and automated extraction of functional information from the diffusion of molecules and organelles within the subcellular environment is labor intensive and poses a significant challenge. Here we introduce DeepSPT, a deep learning framework integrated in an analysis software, to interpret the diffusional two- or three-dimensional temporal behavior of objects in a rapid and efficient manner, agnostically. Demonstrating its versatility, we have applied DeepSPT to automated mapping of the early events of viral infections, identifying endosomal organelles, clathrin-coated pits and vesicles among others with F1 scores of 81%, 82% and 95%, respectively, and within seconds instead of weeks. The fact that DeepSPT effectively extracts biological information from diffusion alone illustrates that besides structure, motion encodes function at the molecular and subcellular level. DeepSPT is a deep learning framework for the automated temporal analysis of behavior in 2D and 3D single-particle tracking. After extensive validation, DeepSPT was shown to work on diverse subcellular tracking, mapping and classification applications.},

However, many features of the cell wall remain enigmatic, as it has been challenging to map its functional properties in live plants at subcellular resolution. Here, we introduce CarboTag, a modular toolbox for live functional imaging of plant walls. CarboTag uses a small molecular motif, a pyridine boronic acid, that directs its cargo to the cell wall. We designed a suite of cell wall imaging probes based on CarboTag in various colors for multiplexing. Additionally, we developed new functional reporters for live quantitative imaging of key cell wall characteristics: network porosity, cell wall pH and the presence of reactive oxygen species. CarboTag paves the way for dynamic and quantitative mapping of cell wall responses at subcellular resolution. A suite of nontoxic and permeable CarboTag probes in various colors enables live quantitative imaging of a range of plant cell wall characteristics and dynamic, high-resolution mapping of cell wall changes in response to growth or perturbations.},

  abstract     = {All multicellular systems produce and dynamically regulate extracellular matrices (ECMs) that play essential roles in both biochemical and mechanical signaling. Though the spatial arrangement of these extracellular assemblies is critical to their biological functions, visualization of ECM structure is challenging, in part because the biomolecules that compose the ECM are difficult to fluorescently label individually and collectively. Here, we present a cell-impermeable small-molecule fluorophore, termed Rhobo6, that turns on and red shifts upon reversible binding to glycans. Given that most ECM components are densely glycosylated, the dye enables wash-free visualization of ECM, in systems ranging from in vitro substrates to in vivo mouse mammary tumors. Relative to existing techniques, Rhobo6 provides a broad substrate profile, superior tissue penetration, non-perturbative labeling, and negligible photobleaching. This work establishes a straightforward method for imaging the distribution of ECM in live tissues and organisms, lowering barriers for investigation of extracellular biology. Rhobo6 is a cell-impermeable small-molecule fluorophore that displays reversible fluorogenic binding to glycans, making it a general, wash-free, and non-perturbative label for the extracellular matrix in living samples.},

We present ultrasensitive reweighted visible stimulated Raman scattering (URV-SRS), a label-free vibrational imaging technique for multiplexed nanoscopy of intracellular metabolites. We developed a visible SRS microscope with extensive pulse chirping to improve the detection limit to ~4,000 molecules and introduced a self-supervised multi-agent denoiser to suppress non-independent noise in SRS by over 7.2 dB, resulting in a 50-fold sensitivity enhancement over near-infrared SRS. Leveraging the enhanced sensitivity, we employed Fourier reweighting to amplify sub-100-nm spatial frequencies that were previously overwhelmed by noise. Validated by Fourier ring correlation, we achieved a lateral resolution of 86 nm in cell imaging. We visualized the reprogramming of metabolic nanostructures associated with virus replication in host cells and subcellular fatty acid synthesis in engineered bacteria, demonstrating its capability towards nanoscopic spatial metabolomics.

However, most existing models are limited by either autoencoding or autoregressive pretraining objectives, which makes them struggle to handle protein understanding and generation tasks concurrently. We propose a unified protein language model, xTrimoPGLM, to address these two types of tasks simultaneously through an innovative pretraining framework. Our key technical contribution is an exploration of the compatibility and the potential for joint optimization of the two types of objectives, which has led to a strategy for training xTrimoPGLM at an unprecedented scale of 100 billion parameters and 1 trillion training tokens. Our extensive experiments reveal that (1) xTrimoPGLM substantially outperforms other advanced baselines in 18 protein understanding benchmarks across four categories. The model also facilitates an atomic-resolution view of protein structures, leading to an advanced three-dimensional structural prediction model that surpasses existing language model-based tools. (2) xTrimoPGLM not only can generate de novo protein sequences following the principles of natural ones, but also can perform programmable generation after supervised fine-tuning on curated sequences. These results highlight the substantial capability and versatility of xTrimoPGLM in understanding and generating protein sequences, contributing to the evolving landscape of foundation models in protein science. Trained weight for the xTrimoPGLM model, and downstream datasets are available at https://huggingface.co/biomap-research . xTrimo protein general language model (xTrimoPGLM) is a unified pretraining framework and foundation model designed for various protein-related tasks, including protein understanding and generation or design.},

Because of differences in data acquisition strategies such as data-dependent, data-independent or parallel reaction monitoring, separate software packages employing different analysis concepts are used for peptide identification and quantification, even though the underlying information is principally the same. Here, we introduce CHIMERYS, a spectrum-centric search algorithm designed for the deconvolution of chimeric spectra that unifies proteomic data analysis. Using accurate predictions of peptide retention time, fragment ion intensities and applying regularized linear regression, it explains as much fragment ion intensity as possible with as few peptides as possible. Together with rigorous false discovery rate control, CHIMERYS accurately identifies and quantifies multiple peptides per tandem mass spectrum in data-dependent, data-independent or parallel reaction monitoring experiments. CHIMERYS is a spectrum-centric and data acquisition method-agnostic algorithm for the analysis of MS2 spectra. It is capable of deconvoluting any MS2 spectrum, regardless of whether it was acquired by DDA, DIA or PRM, thus unifying the analysis of bottom-up proteomics data.},

  abstract     = {Chemical exposures may affect human metabolism and contribute to the etiology of neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease. Identifying these small metabolites involves matching experimental spectra to reference spectra in databases. However, environmental chemicals or physiologically active metabolites are usually present at low concentrations in human specimens. The presence of noise ions can substantially degrade spectral quality, leading to false negatives and reduced identification rates. In response to this challenge, the Spectral Denoising algorithm removes both chemical and electronic noise. Spectral Denoising outperformed alternative methods in benchmarking studies on 240 tested metabolites. It improved high confident compound identifications at an average 35-fold lower concentrations than previously achievable. Spectral Denoising proved highly robust against varying levels of both chemical and electronic noise even with a greater than 150-fold higher intensity of noise ions than true fragment ions. For human plasma samples from patients with Alzheimer’s disease that were analyzed on the Orbitrap Astral mass spectrometer, Denoising Search detected 2.5-fold more annotated compounds compared to the Exploris 240 Orbitrap instrument, including drug metabolites, household and industrial chemicals, and pesticides.

  abstract     = {Exploring the genomic basis of transcriptional programs has been a long-standing research focus. Here we report a single-cell method, ChAIR, to map chromatin accessibility, chromatin interactions and RNA expression simultaneously. After validating in cultured cells, we applied ChAIR to whole mouse brains and delineated the concerted dynamics of epigenome, three-dimensional (3D) genome and transcriptome during maturation and aging. In particular, gene-centric chromatin interactions and open chromatin states provided 3D epigenomic mechanism underlying cell-type-specific transcription and revealed spatially resolved specificity. Importantly, the composition of short-range and ultralong chromatin contacts in individual cells is remarkably correlated with transcriptional activity, open chromatin state and genome folding density. This genomic property, along with associated cellular properties, differs in neurons and non-neuronal cells across different anatomic regions throughout the lifespan, implying divergent nuclear mechano-genomic mechanisms at play in brain cells. Our results demonstrate ChAIR’s robustness in revealing single-cell 3D epigenomic states of cell-type-specific transcription in complex tissues. This work introduces ChAIR, a droplet-based tri-omic tool that enables the simultaneous profiling of the transcriptome, chromatin accessibility and chromatin conformation in single cells.},

  abstract     = {Simulated single-cell data are essential for designing and evaluating computational methods in the absence of experimental ground truth. Here we present scMultiSim, a comprehensive simulator that generates multimodal single-cell data encompassing gene expression, chromatin accessibility, RNA velocity and spatial cell locations while accounting for the relationships between modalities. Unlike existing tools that focus on limited biological factors, scMultiSim simultaneously models cell identity, gene regulatory networks, cell–cell interactions and chromatin accessibility while incorporating technical noise. Moreover, it allows users to adjust each factor’s effect easily. Here we show that scMultiSim generates data with expected biological effects, and demonstrate its applications by benchmarking a wide range of computational tasks, including multimodal and multi-batch data integration, RNA velocity estimation, gene regulatory network inference and cell–cell interaction inference using spatially resolved gene expression data. Compared to existing simulators, scMultiSim can benchmark a much broader range of existing computational problems and even new potential tasks. scMultiSim is a comprehensive single-cell and spatial data simulator generating realistic multi-omics data based on modeling gene regulatory networks, cell–cell interactions and other biological and technical factors.},

  abstract     = {Differentiating sequencing errors from true variants is a central genomics challenge, calling for error suppression strategies that balance costs and sensitivity. For example, circulating cell-free DNA (ccfDNA) sequencing for cancer monitoring is limited by sparsity of circulating tumor DNA, abundance of genomic material in samples and preanalytical error rates. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) can overcome the low abundance of ccfDNA by integrating signals across the mutation landscape, but higher costs limit its wide adoption. Here, we applied deep (~120×) lower-cost WGS (Ultima Genomics) for tumor-informed circulating tumor DNA detection within the part-per-million range. We further leveraged lower-cost sequencing by developing duplex error-corrected WGS of ccfDNA, achieving 7.7 × 10−7 error rates, allowing us to assess disease burden in individuals with melanoma and urothelial cancer without matched tumor sequencing. This error-corrected WGS approach will have broad applicability across genomics, allowing for accurate calling of low-abundance variants at efficient cost and enabling deeper mapping of somatic mosaicism as an emerging central aspect of aging and disease. This work integrates duplex sequencing with cost-effective Ultima sequencing to enhance the accuracy of whole-genome circulating cell-free DNA profiling.},

  abstract     = {Maintenance of genome integrity is paramount to molecular programs in multicellular organisms. Throughout the lifespan, various endogenous and environmental factors pose persistent threats to the genome, which can result in DNA damage. Understanding the functional consequences of DNA damage requires investigating their preferred genomic distributions and influences on gene regulatory programs. However, such analysis is hindered by both the complex cell-type compositions within organs and the high background levels due to the stochasticity of damage formation. To address these challenges, we developed Paired-Damage-seq for joint analysis of oxidative and single-stranded DNA damage with gene expression in single cells. We applied this approach to cultured HeLa cells and the mouse brain as a proof of concept. Our results indicated the associations between damage formation and epigenetic changes. The distribution of oxidative DNA damage hotspots exhibits cell-type-specific patterns; this selective genome vulnerability, in turn, can predict cell types and dysregulated molecular programs that contribute to disease risks. This work presents an in situ labeling-by-repair strategy, Paired-Damage-seq, to achieve joint profiling of oxidative and single-stranded DNA damage alongside gene expression in single cells.},

  abstract     = {Three-dimensional (3D) genome organization becomes altered during development, aging and disease, but the factors regulating chromatin topology are incompletely understood and currently no technology can efficiently screen for new regulators of multi-scale chromatin organization. Here, we developed an image-based high-content screening platform (Perturb-tracing) that combines pooled CRISPR screens, a cellular barcode readout method (BARC-FISH) and chromatin tracing. We performed a loss-of-function screen in human cells, and visualized alterations to their 3D chromatin folding conformations, alongside perturbation-paired barcode readout in the same single cells. We discovered tens of new regulators of chromatin folding at different length scales, ranging from chromatin domains and compartments to chromosome territory. A subset of the regulators exhibited 3D genome effects associated with loop extrusion and A–B compartmentalization mechanisms, while others were largely unrelated to these known 3D genome mechanisms. Finally, we identified new regulators of nuclear architectures and found a functional link between chromatin compaction and nuclear shape. Altogether, our method enables scalable, high-content identification of chromatin and nuclear topology regulators that will stimulate new insights into the 3D genome. This work presents Perturb-tracing, integrating CRISPR screening with barcode readout and chromatin tracing for loss-of-function screens, enabling the identification of chromatin folding regulators at various length scales.},

Here we acquired and standardized a large morphology database of 20,158 mouse neurons and generated a potential connectivity map of single neurons based on their dendritic and axonal arbors. With such an anatomy–morphology–connectivity mapping, we defined neuron connectivity subtypes for neurons in 31 brain regions. We found that cell types defined by connectivity show distinct separation from each other. Within this context, we were able to characterize the diversity in secondary motor cortical neurons, and subtype connectivity patterns in thalamocortical pathways. Our findings underscore the importance of connectivity in characterizing the modularity of brain anatomy at the single-cell level. These results highlight that connectivity subtypes supplement conventionally recognized transcriptomic cell types, electrophysiological cell types and morphological cell types as factors to classify cell classes and their identities. This Resource presents a method to define connectivity types of neurons based on a spatially registered large database containing more than 20,000 neuronal reconstructions. A brain connectivity map is also generated using such connectivity features.},

HRA v.2.0 covers 4,499 unique anatomical structures, 1,195 cell types and 2,089 biomarkers (such as genes, proteins and lipids) from 33 ASCT+B tables and 65 3D Reference Objects linked to ontologies. New experimental data can be mapped into the HRA using (1) cell type annotation tools (for example, Azimuth), (2) validated antibody panels or (3) by registering tissue data spatially. This paper describes HRA user stories, terminology, data formats, ontology validation, unified analysis workflows, user interfaces, instructional materials, application programming interfaces, flexible hybrid cloud infrastructure and previews atlas usage applications.

Here, we benchmark feature selection methods for single-cell RNA sequencing integration using metrics beyond batch correction and preservation of biological variation to assess query mapping, label transfer and the detection of unseen populations. We reinforce common practice by showing that highly variable feature selection is effective for producing high-quality integrations and provide further guidance on the effect of the number of features selected, batch-aware feature selection, lineage-specific feature selection and integration and the interaction between feature selection and integration models. These results are informative for analysts working on large-scale tissue atlases, using atlases or integrating their own data to tackle specific biological questions.

However, methods often disagree, and no gold standard exists for comparing pairs of maps. Here, we evaluate 25 ways to compare contact maps using Micro-C and Hi-C data from two cell types and in silico-generated contact maps. We identify similarities and differences between the methods and quantify their robustness to common sources of biological and technical variation, including losses and gains of CTCF-binding sites, changes in contact intensity or patterns, and noise. We find that global comparison methods, such as mean squared error, are suitable for initial screening; however, biologically informed methods are necessary for identifying how maps diverge and for proposing specific functional hypotheses. We provide a reference guide, codebase, and thorough evaluation for rapidly comparing chromatin contact maps at scale to enable biological insights into 3D genome organization.

  abstract     = {The human genome contains instructions to transcribe more than 200,000 RNAs. However, many RNA transcripts are generated from the same gene, resulting in alternative isoforms that are highly similar and that remain difficult to quantify. To evaluate the ability to study RNA transcript expression, we profiled seven human cell lines with five different RNA-sequencing protocols, including short-read cDNA, Nanopore long-read direct RNA, amplification-free direct cDNA and PCR-amplified cDNA sequencing, and PacBio IsoSeq, with multiple spike-in controls, and additional transcriptome-wide N6-methyladenosine profiling data. We describe differences in read length, coverage, throughput and transcript expression, reporting that long-read RNA sequencing more robustly identifies major isoforms. We illustrate the value of the SG-NEx data to identify alternative isoforms, novel transcripts, fusion transcripts and N6-methyladenosine RNA modifications. Together, the SG-NEx data provide a comprehensive resource enabling the development and benchmarking of computational methods for profiling complex transcriptional events at isoform-level resolution. This analysis provides a collection of sequencing datasets generated from long-read and short-read RNA sequencing, serving as a valuable resource for transcriptome profiling.},

  abstract     = {High-density microelectrode arrays have opened new possibilities for systems neuroscience, but brain motion relative to the array poses challenges for downstream analyses. We introduce DREDge (Decentralized Registration of Electrophysiology Data), a robust algorithm for the registration of noisy, nonstationary extracellular electrophysiology recordings. In addition to estimating motion from action potential data, DREDge enables automated, high-temporal-resolution motion tracking in local field potential data. In human intraoperative recordings, DREDge’s local field potential-based tracking reliably recovered evoked potentials and single-unit spike sorting. In recordings of deep probe insertions in nonhuman primates, DREDge tracked motion across centimeters of tissue and several brain regions while mapping single-unit electrophysiological features. DREDge reliably improved motion correction in acute mouse recordings, especially in those made with a recent ultrahigh-density probe. Applying DREDge to recordings from chronic implantations in mice yielded stable motion tracking despite changes in neural activity between experimental sessions. These advances enable automated, scalable registration of electrophysiological data across species, probes and drift types, providing a foundation for downstream analyses of these rich datasets. DREDge is a software tool for motion correction of high-density electrophysiology recordings. It can handle action potential or local field potential data and is demonstrated on a variety of acute or chronic recordings from humans, nonhuman primates and mice.},

  abstract     = {Neural activity spans multiple time scales, from milliseconds to months. Its evolution can be recorded with chronic high-density arrays such as Neuropixels probes, which can measure each spike at tens of sites and record hundreds of neurons. These probes produce vast amounts of data that require different approaches for tracking neurons across recordings. Here, to meet this need, we developed UnitMatch, a pipeline that operates after spike sorting, based only on each unit’s average spike waveform. We tested UnitMatch in Neuropixels recordings from the mouse brain, where it tracked neurons across weeks. Across the brain, neurons had distinctive inter-spike interval distributions. Their correlations with other neurons remained stable over weeks. In the visual cortex, the neurons’ selectivity for visual stimuli remained similarly stable. In the striatum, however, neuronal responses changed across days during learning of a task. UnitMatch is thus a promising tool to reveal both invariance and plasticity in neural activity across days. UnitMatch tracks neurons in electrophysiological recordings across multiple recording sessions. UnitMatch relies on the spike waveform and allows tracking neurons even when their functional properties change such as during memory formation.},

  abstract     = {The phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) is a vital protein that maintains an inhibitory brake for cellular proliferation and growth. Accordingly, PTEN loss-of-function mutations are associated with a broad spectrum of human pathologies. Despite its importance, there is currently no method to directly monitor PTEN activity with cellular specificity within intact biological systems. Here we describe the development of a FRET-based biosensor using PTEN conformation as a proxy for the PTEN activity state, for two-photon fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy. We identify a point mutation that allows the monitoring of PTEN activity with minimal interference to endogenous PTEN signaling. We demonstrate imaging of PTEN activity in cell lines, intact Caenorhabditis elegans and in the mouse brain. Finally, we develop a red-shifted sensor variant that allows us to identify cell-type-specific PTEN activity in excitatory and inhibitory cortical cells. In summary, our approach enables dynamic imaging of PTEN activity in vivo with unprecedented spatial and temporal resolution. A first-in-class fluorescence lifetime-based FRET sensor for phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) enables the dynamic monitoring of PTEN activity in cultured cells and in vivo with high spatiotemporal resolution.},

Despite their importance, quantifying organelle morphology and motility remains challenging due to their complex architectures, rapid movements and the technical limitations of existing analysis tools. Here we introduce Nellie, an automated and unbiased pipeline for segmentation, tracking and feature extraction of diverse intracellular structures. Nellie adapts to image metadata and employs hierarchical segmentation to resolve sub-organellar regions, while its radius-adaptive pattern matching enables precise motion tracking. Through a user-friendly Napari-based interface, Nellie enables comprehensive organelle analysis without coding expertise. We demonstrate Nellie’s versatility by unmixing multiple organelles from single-channel data, quantifying mitochondrial responses to ionomycin via graph autoencoders and characterizing endoplasmic reticulum networks across cell types and time points. This tool addresses a critical need in cell biology by providing accessible, automated analysis of organelle dynamics. Nellie is a comprehensive automated pipeline for studying the structure and intracellular dynamics of diverse organelles that offers accurate segmentation, tracking and feature extraction on both 2D and 3D data.},

Here we develop a computational framework that enables the joint statistical analysis of transcriptional and mechanical signals in the context of spatial transcriptomics. To illustrate the application and utility of the approach, we use spatial transcriptomics data from the developing mouse embryo to infer the forces acting on individual cells, and use these results to identify mechanical, morphometric and gene expression signatures that are predictive of tissue compartment boundaries. In addition, we use geoadditive structural equation modeling to identify gene modules that predict the mechanical behavior of cells in an unbiased manner. This computational framework is easily generalized to other spatial profiling contexts, providing a generic scheme for exploring the interplay of biomolecular and mechanical cues in tissues.

Here we describe a deep-learning-based protein sequence design method called LigandMPNN that explicitly models all nonprotein components of biomolecular systems. LigandMPNN significantly outperforms Rosetta and ProteinMPNN on native backbone sequence recovery for residues interacting with small molecules (63.3% versus 50.4% and 50.5%), nucleotides (50.5% versus 35.2% and 34.0%) and metals (77.5% versus 36.0% and 40.6%). LigandMPNN generates not only sequences but also sidechain conformations to allow detailed evaluation of binding interactions. LigandMPNN has been used to design over 100 experimentally validated small-molecule and DNA-binding proteins with high affinity and high structural accuracy (as indicated by four X-ray crystal structures), and redesign of Rosetta small-molecule binder designs has increased binding affinity by as much as 100-fold. We anticipate that LigandMPNN will be widely useful for designing new binding proteins, sensors and enzymes.

However, gene expression data alone often fails to capture and identify changes in cellular pathways and complexes, as they are more discernible at the protein level. Moreover, analyzing scRNA-seq data presents further challenges due to inherent characteristics such as high noise levels and zero inflation. In this study, we propose an approach to address these limitations by integrating scRNA-seq datasets with a protein–protein interaction network. Our method utilizes a unique dual-view architecture based on graph neural networks, enabling joint representation of gene expression and protein–protein interaction network data. This approach models gene-to-gene relationships under specific biological contexts and refines cell–cell relations using an attention mechanism. Next, through comprehensive evaluations, we demonstrate that scNET better captures gene annotation, pathway characterization and gene–gene relationship identification, while improving cell clustering and pathway analysis across diverse cell types and biological conditions. scNET combines single-cell gene expression information with protein–protein interaction networks using a dual-view architecture based on graph neural networks to better characterize changes in cellular pathways and complexes across cellular conditions.},

Here we present cell2fate, a formulation of RNA velocity based on a linearization of the velocity ODE, which allows solving a biophysically more accurate model in a fully Bayesian fashion. As a result, cell2fate decomposes the RNA velocity solutions into modules, providing a biophysical connection between RNA velocity and statistical dimensionality reduction. We comprehensively benchmark cell2fate in real-world settings, demonstrating enhanced interpretability and power to reconstruct complex dynamics and weak dynamical signals in rare and mature cell types. Finally, we apply cell2fate to the developing human brain, where we spatially map RNA velocity modules onto the tissue architecture, connecting the spatial organization of tissues with temporal dynamics of transcription. Cell2fate improves RNA velocity analysis of single-cell and spatial transcriptomics data by module decomposition of realistic biophysical models of transcription dynamics.},

  abstract     = {Despite the importance of imaging in biological and medical research, a large body of informative and precious image data never sees the light of day. To ensure scientific rigor as well as the reuse of data for scientific discovery, image data need to be made FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable). Image data experts are working together globally to agree on common data formats, metadata, ontologies and supporting tools toward image data FAIRification. With this Perspective, we call on public funders to join these efforts to support their national scientists. What researchers most urgently need are openly accessible resources for image data storage that are operated under long-term commitments by their funders. Although existing resources in Australia, Japan and Europe are already collaborating to enable global image data sharing, these efforts will fall short unless more countries invest in operating and federating their own open data resources. This will allow us to harvest the enormous potential of existing image data, preventing substantial loss of unrealized value from past investments in imaging acquisition infrastructure. This Perspective provides a roadmap toward globally federated open data resources for bioimaging data.},

  abstract     = {Data from the first phase of the Human Tumor Atlas Network (HTAN) are now available, comprising 8,425 biospecimens from 2,042 research participants profiled with more than 20 molecular assays. The data were generated to study the evolution from precancerous to advanced disease. The HTAN Data Coordinating Center (DCC) has enabled their dissemination and effective reuse. We describe the diverse datasets, how to access them, data standards, underlying infrastructure and governance approaches, and our methods to sustain community engagement. HTAN data can be accessed through the HTAN Portal, explored in visualization tools—including CellxGene, Minerva and cBioPortal—and analyzed in the cloud through the NCI Cancer Research Data Commons. Infrastructure was developed to enable data ingestion and dissemination through the Synapse platform. The HTAN DCC’s flexible and modular approach to sharing complex cancer research data offers valuable insights to other data-coordination efforts and researchers looking to leverage HTAN data. This Perspective outlines the datasets, access methods, data standards, infrastructure, governance and community-engagement strategies of the Human Tumor Atlas Network.},

  abstract     = {A key challenge of the modern genomics era is developing empirical data-driven representations of gene function. Here we present the first unbiased morphology-based genome-wide perturbation atlas in human cells, containing three genome-wide genotype–phenotype maps comprising CRISPR–Cas9-based knockouts of &gt;20,000 genes in &gt;30 million cells. Our optical pooled cell profiling platform (PERISCOPE) combines a destainable high-dimensional phenotyping panel (based on Cell Painting) with optical sequencing of molecular barcodes and a scalable open-source analysis pipeline to facilitate massively parallel screening of pooled perturbation libraries. This perturbation atlas comprises high-dimensional phenotypic profiles of individual cells with sufficient resolution to cluster thousands of human genes, reconstruct known pathways and protein–protein interaction networks, interrogate subcellular processes and identify culture media-specific responses. Using this atlas, we identify the poorly characterized disease-associated TMEM251/LYSET as a Golgi-resident transmembrane protein essential for mannose-6-phosphate-dependent trafficking of lysosomal enzymes. In sum, this perturbation atlas and screening platform represents a rich and accessible resource for connecting genes to cellular functions at scale. An optical pooled cell profiling platform (PERISCOPE) based on Cell Painting and optical sequencing of molecular barcodes was used to develop the first unbiased genome-wide morphology-based perturbation atlas in human cells.},

  abstract     = {The dynamics of neuron populations commonly evolve on low-dimensional manifolds. Thus, we need methods that learn the dynamical processes over neural manifolds to infer interpretable and consistent latent representations. We introduce a representation learning method, MARBLE, which decomposes on-manifold dynamics into local flow fields and maps them into a common latent space using unsupervised geometric deep learning. In simulated nonlinear dynamical systems, recurrent neural networks and experimental single-neuron recordings from primates and rodents, we discover emergent low-dimensional latent representations that parametrize high-dimensional neural dynamics during gain modulation, decision-making and changes in the internal state. These representations are consistent across neural networks and animals, enabling the robust comparison of cognitive computations. Extensive benchmarking demonstrates state-of-the-art within- and across-animal decoding accuracy of MARBLE compared to current representation learning approaches, with minimal user input. Our results suggest that a manifold structure provides a powerful inductive bias to develop decoding algorithms and assimilate data across experiments. MARBLE uses geometric deep learning to map dynamics such as neural activity into a latent representation, which can then be used to decode the neural activity or compare it across systems.},

Realizing the potential of this technology requires computational pipelines that generalize across experimental protocols and map neuronal activity at the laminar and subpopulation-specific levels, beyond atlas-defined regions. Here, we present artficial intelligence-based cartography of ensembles (ACE), an end-to-end pipeline that employs three-dimensional deep learning segmentation models and advanced cluster-wise statistical algorithms, to enable unbiased mapping of local neuronal activity and connectivity. Validation against state-of-the-art segmentation and detection methods on unseen datasets demonstrated ACE’s high generalizability and performance. Applying ACE in two distinct neurobiological contexts, we discovered subregional effects missed by existing atlas-based analyses and showcase ACE’s ability to reveal localized or laminar neuronal activity brain-wide. Our open-source pipeline enables whole-brain mapping of neuronal ensembles at a high level of precision across a wide range of neuroscientific applications.

We focused the development of Cellpose3 on addressing these cases and here we demonstrate substantial out-of-the-box gains in segmentation and image quality for noisy, blurry and undersampled images. Unlike previous approaches that train models to restore pixel values, we trained Cellpose3 to output images that are well segmented by a generalist segmentation model, while maintaining perceptual similarity to the target images. Furthermore, we trained the restoration models on a large, varied collection of datasets, thus ensuring good generalization to user images. We provide these tools as ‘one-click’ buttons inside the graphical interface of Cellpose as well as in the Cellpose API.

Moreover, continuous high-resolution imaging inside living organisms has mostly been limited to a few hours, as regions of interest quickly move out of view due to sample movement and growth. Here, we present a self-driving, multiresolution light-sheet microscope platform controlled by custom Python-based software, to simultaneously observe and quantify subcellular dynamics in the context of entire organisms in vitro and in vivo over hours of imaging. We apply the platform to the study of developmental processes, cancer invasion and metastasis, and we provide quantitative multiscale analysis of immune–cancer cell interactions in zebrafish xenografts.

Single-molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) techniques, such as single-molecule tracking (SMT), enable in situ measurements in cells but have historically been limited by a necessary tradeoff between spatiotemporal resolution and throughput. Here we address these limitations using oblique line scan (OLS), a robust single-objective light-sheet-based illumination and detection modality that achieves nanoscale spatial resolution and sub-millisecond temporal resolution across a large field of view. We show that OLS can be used to capture protein motion up to 14 μm2 s−1 in living cells. We further extend the utility of OLS with in-solution SMT for single-molecule measurement of ligand–protein interactions and disruption of protein–protein interactions using purified proteins. We illustrate the versatility of OLS by showcasing two-color SMT, STORM and single-molecule fluorescence recovery after photobleaching. OLS paves the way for robust, high-throughput, single-molecule investigations of protein function required for basic research, drug screening and systems biology studies. Oblique line scan microscopy achieves nanoscale spatial and sub-millisecond temporal resolution across a large field of view, enabling improved and robust single-molecule biophysical measurements and single-molecule tracking in both cells and solution.},

This protein, called Melt (Membrane localization using temperature) oligomerizes and translocates to the plasma membrane when temperature is lowered. We generated a library of Melt variants with switching temperatures ranging from 30 °C to 40 °C, including two that operate at and above 37 °C. Melt was a highly modular actuator of cell function, permitting thermal control over diverse processes including signaling, proteolysis, nuclear shuttling, cytoskeletal rearrangements and cell death. Finally, Melt permitted thermal control of cell death in a mouse model of human cancer. Melt represents a versatile thermogenetic module for straightforward, non-invasive and spatiotemporally defined control of mammalian cells with broad potential for biotechnology and biomedicine.

Here we present spatial-Mux-seq, a multimodal spatial technology that allows simultaneous profiling of five different modalities: two histone modifications, chromatin accessibility, whole transcriptome and a panel of proteins at tissue scale and cellular level in a spatially resolved manner. We applied this technology to mouse embryos and mouse brains, generating detailed multimodal tissue maps that identified more cell types and states compared to unimodal data. This analysis uncovered spatiotemporal relationships among histone modifications, chromatin accessibility, gene expression and protein levels during neuron differentiation, and revealed a radial glia niche with spatially dynamic epigenetic signals. Collectively, the spatial multi-omics approach heralds a new era for characterizing tissue and cellular heterogeneity that single-modality studies alone could not reveal.

Using a two-proteome mix, we check for optimal parameters of quantification and show that fold change differences of 2 can still be successfully determined at single-cell-level inputs. Eventually, we apply our workflow to A549 cells, yielding a proteome coverage ranging from 1,801 to a maximum of &gt;5,300 protein groups from a single cell depending on cell size and search strategy used, which allows for the study of dependencies between cell size and cell cycle phase. Additionally, our workflow enables us to distinguish between in vitro analogs of two human blastocyst lineages: naive human pluripotent stem cells (epiblast) and trophectoderm-like cells. Our data harmoniously align with transcriptomic data, indicating that single-cell proteomics possesses the capability to identify biologically relevant differences within the blastocyst. An ultra-low-input single-cell proteomic workflow is optimized to yield maximum proteome coverage with high accuracy and precision on the Orbitrap Astral mass spectrometer.},

  abstract     = {Single-cell proteomics (SCP) promises to revolutionize biomedicine by providing an unparalleled view of the proteome in individual cells. Here, we present a high-sensitivity SCP workflow named Chip-Tip, identifying &gt;5,000 proteins in individual HeLa cells. It also facilitated direct detection of post-translational modifications in single cells, making the need for specific post-translational modification-enrichment unnecessary. Our study demonstrates the feasibility of processing up to 120 label-free SCP samples per day. An optimized tissue dissociation buffer enabled effective single-cell disaggregation of drug-treated cancer cell spheroids, refining overall SCP analysis. Analyzing nondirected human-induced pluripotent stem cell differentiation, we consistently quantified stem cell markers OCT4 and SOX2 in human-induced pluripotent stem cells and lineage markers such as GATA4 (endoderm), HAND1 (mesoderm) and MAP2 (ectoderm) in different embryoid body cells. Our workflow sets a benchmark in SCP for sensitivity and throughput, with broad applications in basic biology and biomedicine for identification of cell type-specific markers and therapeutic targets. Chip-Tip is a label-free quantification-based single-cell proteomics workflow for deep single-cell proteomics, which identifies over 5,000 proteins and 40,000 peptides in single HeLa cells.},

  abstract     = {In vivo lineage tracing holds great potential to reveal fundamental principles of tissue development and homeostasis. However, current lineage tracing in humans relies on extremely rare somatic mutations, which has limited temporal resolution and lineage accuracy. Here, we developed a generic lineage-tracing tool based on frequent epimutations on DNA methylation, enabled by our computational method MethylTree. Using single-cell genome-wide DNA methylation datasets with known lineage and phenotypic labels, MethylTree reconstructed lineage histories at nearly 100% accuracy across different cell types, developmental stages, and species. We demonstrated the epimutation-based single-cell multi-omic lineage tracing in mouse and human blood, where MethylTree recapitulated the differentiation hierarchy in hematopoiesis. Applying MethylTree to human embryos, we revealed early fate commitment at the four-cell stage. In native mouse blood, we identified ~250 clones of hematopoietic stem cells. MethylTree opens the door for high-resolution, noninvasive and multi-omic lineage tracing in humans and beyond. This work presents a computational tool MethylTree to infer cell lineages based on epimutations on DNA methylation.},

We introduce a highly scalable method for jointly profiling DNA and expression following nucleosome depletion (DEFND-seq). In DEFND-seq, nuclei are nucleosome-depleted, tagmented and separated into individual droplets for messenger RNA and genomic DNA barcoding. Once nuclei have been depleted of nucleosomes, subsequent steps can be performed using the widely available 10x Genomics droplet microfluidic technology and commercial kits. We demonstrate the production of high-complexity mRNA and gDNA sequencing libraries from thousands of individual nuclei from cell lines, fresh and archived surgical specimens for associating gene expression with both copy number and single-nucleotide variants. Building on a nucleosome-depletion strategy, DEFND-seq utilizes a droplet microfluidic platform to enable high-throughput co-profiling of DNA and RNA in single cells.},

  abstract     = {CD8+ T cells exhibit remarkable phenotypic diversity in inflammation and cancer. However, a comprehensive understanding of their clonal landscape and dynamics remains elusive. Here we introduce scAtlasVAE, a deep-learning-based model for the integration of large-scale single-cell RNA sequencing data and cross-atlas comparisons. scAtlasVAE has enabled us to construct an extensive human CD8+ T cell atlas, comprising 1,151,678 cells from 961 samples across 68 studies and 42 disease conditions, with paired T cell receptor information. Through incorporating information in T cell receptor clonal expansion and sharing, we have successfully established connections between distinct cell subtypes and shed light on their phenotypic and functional transitions. Notably, our approach characterizes three distinct exhausted T cell subtypes and reveals diverse transcriptome and clonal sharing patterns in autoimmune and immune-related adverse event inflammation. Furthermore, scAtlasVAE facilitates the automatic annotation of CD8+ T cell subtypes in query single-cell RNA sequencing datasets, enabling unbiased and scalable analyses. In conclusion, our work presents a comprehensive single-cell reference and computational framework for CD8+ T cell research. scAtlasVAE is a deep learning-based model for cross-atlas integration. Here it enables the development of a large-scale human CD8+ T cell atlas with integrated T cell receptor data.},

  abstract     = {Over a lifetime, hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) adjust their lineage output to support age-aligned physiology. In model organisms, stereotypic waves of hematopoiesis have been observed corresponding to defined age-biased HSC hallmarks. However, how the properties of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells change over the human lifespan remains unclear. To address this gap, we profiled individual transcriptome states of human hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells spanning gestation, maturation and aging. Here we define the gene expression networks dictating age-specific differentiation of HSCs and the dynamics of fate decisions and lineage priming throughout life. We additionally identifiy and functionally validate a fetal-specific HSC state with robust engraftment and multilineage capacity. Furthermore, we observe that classification of acute myeloid leukemia against defined transcriptional age states demonstrates that utilization of early life transcriptional programs associates with poor prognosis. Overall, we provide a disease-relevant framework for heterochronic orientation of stem cell ontogeny along the real time axis of the human lifespan. This Resource presents an atlas classifying the age-related changes in human hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells from gestation through aging.},

  abstract     = {The native membrane environment profoundly influences every aspect of membrane protein (MP) biology. Despite this, the most prevalent method of studying MPs uses detergents to disrupt and remove this vital membrane context, impeding our ability to decipher the local molecular context and its effect. Here we develop a membrane proteome-wide platform that enables rapid spatially resolved extraction of target MPs directly from cellular membranes into native nanodiscs that maintain the local membrane context, using a library of membrane-active polymers. We accompany this with an open-access database that quantifies the polymer-specific extraction efficiency for 2,065 unique mammalian MPs and provides the most optimized extraction condition for each. To validate, we demonstrate how this resource can enable rapid extraction and purification of target MPs from different organellar membranes with high efficiency and purity. Further, we show how the database can be extended to capture overexpressed multiprotein complexes by taking two synaptic vesicle MPs. We expect these publicly available resources to empower researchers across disciplines to efficiently capture membrane ‘nano-scoops’ containing a target MP and interface with structural, functional and bioanalytical approaches. This manuscript reports a high-throughput platform for nanoscale spatially resolved extraction of membrane proteins into native nanodiscs by using a library of membrane-active polymers while maintaining their local membrane context.},

We describe automatic assessment protocols for comparisons between prediction and experiment. Our analyses reveal some critical steps to be overcome to achieve good accuracy in modeling RNA structures: identification of helix-forming pairs and of non-Watson–Crick modules, correct coaxial stacking between helices and avoidance of entanglements. Three of the top four modeling groups in this round also ranked among the top four in the CASP15 contest.

Here we developed Moculus, a head-mounted virtual reality platform for mice that covers the entire visual field, and allows binocular depth perception and full visual immersion. This controllable environment, with three-dimensional (3D) corridors and 3D objects, in combination with 3D acousto-optical imaging, affords rapid visual learning and the uncovering of circuit substrates in one measurement session. Both the control and reinforcement-associated visual cue coding neuronal assemblies are transiently expanded by reinforcement feedback to near-saturation levels. This increases computational capability and allows competition among assemblies that encode behaviorally relevant information. The coding assemblies form partially orthogonal and overlapping clusters centered around hub cells with higher and earlier ramp-like responses, as well as locally increased functional connectivity. Moculus is a virtual reality headset for mice that allows realistic display of three-dimensional environments. The system improves performance in visual-learning tasks and can be combined with various microscopes to study neural circuitry.},

Here, we have developed vibrational fiber photometry as a low-invasive method for label-free monitoring of the biomolecular content of arbitrarily deep regions of the mouse brain in vivo through spontaneous Raman spectroscopy. Using a tapered fiber probe as thin as 1 µm at its tip, we elucidate the cytoarchitecture of the mouse brain, monitor molecular alterations caused by traumatic brain injury, as well as detect markers of brain metastasis with high accuracy. We view our approach, which introduces a deep learning algorithm to suppress probe background, as a promising complement to the existing palette of tools for the optical interrogation of neural function, with application to fundamental and preclinical investigations of the brain and other organs.

  abstract     = {Dissecting human neurobiology at high resolution and with mechanistic precision requires a major leap in scalability, given the need for experimental designs that include multiple individuals and, prospectively, population cohorts. To lay the foundation for this, we have developed and benchmarked complementary strategies to multiplex brain organoids by pooling cells from different pluripotent stem cell (PSC) lines either during organoid generation (mosaic models) or before single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) library preparation (downstream multiplexing). We have also developed a new computational method, SCanSNP, and a consensus call to deconvolve cell identities, overcoming current criticalities in doublets and low-quality cell identification. We validated both multiplexing methods for charting neurodevelopmental trajectories at high resolution, thus linking specific individuals’ trajectories to genetic variation. Finally, we modeled their scalability across different multiplexing combinations and showed that mosaic organoids represent an enabling method for high-throughput settings. Together, this multiplexing suite of experimental and computational methods provides a highly scalable resource for brain disease and neurodiversity modeling. This paper develops two approaches for multiplexing cortical organoids and SCanSNP, a method for deconvolving cell identities, to trace neurodevelopmental trajectories at scale.},

Here we introduce CelloType, an end-to-end model designed for cell segmentation and classification for image-based spatial omics data. Unlike the traditional two-stage approach of segmentation followed by classification, CelloType adopts a multitask learning strategy that integrates these tasks, simultaneously enhancing the performance of both. CelloType leverages transformer-based deep learning techniques for improved accuracy in object detection, segmentation and classification. It outperforms existing segmentation methods on a variety of multiplexed fluorescence and spatial transcriptomic images. In terms of cell type classification, CelloType surpasses a model composed of state-of-the-art methods for individual tasks and a high-performance instance segmentation model. Using multiplexed tissue images, we further demonstrate the utility of CelloType for multiscale segmentation and classification of both cellular and noncellular elements in a tissue. The enhanced accuracy and multitask learning ability of CelloType facilitate automated annotation of rapidly growing spatial omics data. CelloType is an end-to-end method for spatial omics data analysis that uses a transformer-based deep neural network for concurrent object detection, segmentation and classification and performs with high accuracy on diverse datasets.},

  abstract     = {Three-dimensional structured illumination microscopy (3D-SIM) provides excellent optical sectioning and doubles the resolution in all dimensions compared with wide-field microscopy. However, its much lower axial resolution results in blurred fine details in that direction and overall image distortion. Here we present 4Pi-SIM, a substantial revamp of I5S that synergizes 3D-SIM with interferometric microscopy to achieve isotropic optical resolution through interference in both the illumination and detection wavefronts. We evaluate the performance of 4Pi-SIM by imaging various subcellular structures across different cell types with high fidelity. Furthermore, we demonstrate its capability by conducting time-lapse volumetric imaging over hundreds of time points, achieving a 3D resolution of approximately 100 nm. Additionally, we illustrate its ability to simultaneously image in two colors and capture the rapid interactions between closely positioned organelles in three dimensions. These results underscore the great potential of 4Pi-SIM for elucidating subcellular architecture and revealing dynamic behaviors at the nanoscale. The 4Pi-SIM microscope combines the benefits of structured illumination microscopy with 4Pi geometry for improved axial resolution, offering isotropic, multicolor super-resolution imaging of dynamic processes in living cells.},

  abstract     = {To understand gene function, it is necessary to compare cells carrying the mutated target gene with normal cells. In most biomedical studies, the cells being compared are in different mutant and control animals and, therefore, do not experience the same epigenetic changes and tissue microenvironment. The experimental induction of genetic mosaics is essential to determine a gene cell-autonomous function and to model the etiology of diseases caused by somatic mutations. Current technologies used to induce genetic mosaics in mice lack either accuracy, throughput or barcoding diversity. Here we present the iFlpMosaics toolkit comprising a large set of new genetic tools and mouse lines that enable recombinase-dependent ratiometric induction and single-cell clonal tracking of multiple fluorescently labeled wild-type and Cre-mutant cells within the same time window and tissue microenvironment. The labeled cells can be profiled by multispectral imaging or by fluorescence-activated flow cytometry and single-cell RNA sequencing. iFlpMosaics facilitate the induction and analysis of genetic mosaics in any quiescent or progenitor cell, and for any given single or combination of floxed genes, thus enabling a more accurate understanding of how induced genetic mutations affect the biology of single cells during tissue development, homeostasis and disease. iFlpMosaics are a compendium of mouse lines and genetic tools for tissue-agnostic generation and analysis of genetic mosaics.},

We introduce SurfDock, a deep-learning method that addresses this challenge by integrating protein sequence, three-dimensional structural graphs and surface-level features into an equivariant architecture. SurfDock employs a generative diffusion model on a non-Euclidean manifold, optimizing molecular translations, rotations and torsions to generate reliable binding poses. Our extensive evaluations across various benchmarks demonstrate SurfDock’s superiority over existing methods in docking success rates and adherence to physical constraints. It also exhibits remarkable generalizability to unseen proteins and predicted apo structures, while achieving state-of-the-art performance in virtual screening tasks. In a real-world application, SurfDock identified seven novel hit molecules in a virtual screening project targeting aldehyde dehydrogenase 1B1, a key enzyme in cellular metabolism. This showcases SurfDock’s ability to elucidate molecular mechanisms underlying cellular processes. These results highlight SurfDock’s potential as a transformative tool in structural biology, offering enhanced accuracy, physical plausibility and practical applicability in understanding protein–ligand interactions. SurfDock is a method for predicting protein–ligand complex structures by leveraging multimodal protein information and generative diffusion frameworks. Its results can be generalized to unseen proteins and real-world settings.},

We address this issue by deriving a topographic map of a tissue slice—analogous to a map of elevation in a landscape—using a quantity called the isodepth. Contours of constant isodepths enclose domains with distinct cell type composition, while gradients of the isodepth indicate spatial directions of maximum change in expression. We develop GASTON (gradient analysis of spatial transcriptomics organization with neural networks), an unsupervised and interpretable deep learning algorithm that simultaneously learns the isodepth, spatial gradients and piecewise linear expression functions that model both continuous gradients and discontinuous variation in gene expression. We show that GASTON accurately identifies spatial domains and marker genes across several tissues, gradients of neuronal differentiation and firing in the brain, and gradients of metabolism and immune activity in the tumor microenvironment. Gene expression topography analysis by GASTON portrays domain organization and spatial gradients of gene expression and cell type composition using spatially resolved transcriptomics data.},

Here, we present an extensive study of foundation models pre-trained on DNA sequences, named Nucleotide Transformer, ranging from 50 million up to 2.5 billion parameters and integrating information from 3,202 human genomes and 850 genomes from diverse species. These transformer models yield context-specific representations of nucleotide sequences, which allow for accurate predictions even in low-data settings. We show that the developed models can be fine-tuned at low cost to solve a variety of genomics applications. Despite no supervision, the models learned to focus attention on key genomic elements and can be used to improve the prioritization of genetic variants. The training and application of foundational models in genomics provides a widely applicable approach for accurate molecular phenotype prediction from DNA sequence.

This avalanche of data surrounding pluripotency and the process of lineage specification has meant it has become increasingly difficult to define specific cell types or states in vivo, and compare these with in vitro differentiation. Here we utilize a set of deep learning tools to integrate and classify multiple datasets. This allows the definition of both mouse and human embryo cell types, lineages and states, thereby maximizing the information one can garner from these precious experimental resources. Our approaches are built on recent initiatives for large-scale human organ atlases, but here we focus on material that is difficult to obtain and process, spanning early mouse and human development. Using publicly available data for these stages, we test different deep learning approaches and develop a model to classify cell types in an unbiased fashion at the same time as defining the set of genes used by the model to identify lineages, cell types and states. We used our models trained on in vivo development to classify pluripotent stem cell models for both mouse and human development, showcasing the importance of this resource as a dynamic reference for early embryogenesis. This Resource uses deep learning-based tools to build a dynamic transcriptomic reference for mouse and human preimplantation development.},

The usefulness of embryo models hinges on their molecular, cellular and structural fidelities to their in vivo counterparts. To authenticate human embryo models, single-cell RNA sequencing has been utilized for unbiased transcriptional profiling. However, an organized and integrated human single-cell RNA-sequencing dataset, serving as a universal reference for benchmarking human embryo models, remains unavailable. Here we developed such a reference through the integration of six published human datasets covering development from the zygote to the gastrula. Lineage annotations are contrasted and validated with available human and nonhuman primate datasets. Using stabilized Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection, we constructed an early embryogenesis prediction tool, where query datasets can be projected on the reference and annotated with predicted cell identities. Using this reference tool, we examined published human embryo models, highlighting the risk of misannotation when relevant references are not utilized for benchmarking and authentication. This resource integrates different human embryo datasets to create a transcriptional reference map of human embryonic development from zygote to gastrula.},

  abstract     = {Behavioral neuroscience faces two conflicting demands: long-duration recordings from large neural populations and unimpeded animal behavior. To meet this challenge we developed ONIX, an open-source data acquisition system with high data throughput (2 GB s−1) and low closed-loop latencies (&lt;1 ms) that uses a 0.3-mm thin tether to minimize behavioral impact. Head position and rotation are tracked in three dimensions and used to drive active commutation without torque measurements. ONIX can acquire data from combinations of passive electrodes, Neuropixels probes, head-mounted microscopes, cameras, three-dimensional trackers and other data sources. We performed uninterrupted, long (~7 h) neural recordings in mice as they traversed complex three-dimensional terrain, and multiday sleep-tracking recordings (~55 h). ONIX enabled exploration with similar mobility as nonimplanted animals, in contrast to conventional tethered systems, which have restricted movement. By combining long recordings with full mobility, our technology will enable progress on questions that require high-quality neural recordings during ethologically grounded behaviors. ONIX is a data acquisition system for recording freely behaving mice. It can accommodate a variety of recording technologies, while maintaining minimal impact on animal behavior.},

Here we report multiplexed, line-scanning, structured illumination microscopy, which can tolerate motion of up to 50 μm s−1 while achieving 150-nm and 100-nm lateral resolutions in its linear and nonlinear forms, respectively. We continuously imaged the dynamics of spinules in dendritic spines and axonal boutons volumetrically over thousands of frames and tens of minutes in head-fixed mouse brains during sleep–wake cycles. Super-resolution imaging of axonal boutons revealed spinule dynamics on a scale of seconds. Simultaneous two-color imaging further enabled analyses of the spatial distributions of diverse PSD-95 clusters and opened up possibilities to study their correlations with the structural dynamics of dendrites in the brains of head-fixed awake mice. A variant of structured illumination microscopy called MLS-SIM allows super-resolution imaging of neuronal structures such as spinules, spines and boutons in awake mice.},

  abstract     = {Biomedical image analysis is fundamental for biomedical discovery. Holistic image analysis comprises interdependent subtasks such as segmentation, detection and recognition, which are tackled separately by traditional approaches. Here, we propose BiomedParse, a biomedical foundation model that can jointly conduct segmentation, detection and recognition across nine imaging modalities. This joint learning improves the accuracy for individual tasks and enables new applications such as segmenting all relevant objects in an image through a textual description. To train BiomedParse, we created a large dataset comprising over 6 million triples of image, segmentation mask and textual description by leveraging natural language labels or descriptions accompanying existing datasets. We showed that BiomedParse outperformed existing methods on image segmentation across nine imaging modalities, with larger improvement on objects with irregular shapes. We further showed that BiomedParse can simultaneously segment and label all objects in an image. In summary, BiomedParse is an all-in-one tool for biomedical image analysis on all major image modalities, paving the path for efficient and accurate image-based biomedical discovery. BiomedParse is a foundation model for image analysis that uses a joint learning approach to jointly conduct segmentation, detection and recognition and offer state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of datasets and nine modalities.},

  abstract     = {In situ hybridization (ISH) is a powerful tool for investigating the spatial arrangement of nucleic acid targets in fixed samples. ISH is typically visualized using fluorophores to allow high sensitivity and multiplexing or with colorimetric labels to facilitate covisualization with histopathological stains. Both approaches benefit from signal amplification, which makes target detection effective, rapid and compatible with a broad range of optical systems. Here, we introduce a unified technical platform, termed ‘pSABER’, for the amplification of ISH signals in cell and tissue systems. pSABER decorates the in situ target with concatemeric binding sites for a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated oligonucleotide, enabling the localized deposition of fluorescent or colorimetric substrates. We demonstrate that pSABER effectively labels DNA and RNA targets in cultured cells and FFPE specimens. Furthermore, pSABER can achieve fivefold signal amplification over conventional signal amplification by exchange reaction (SABER) and can be serially multiplexed using solution exchange. Therefore, by linking nucleic acid detection to robust signal amplification capable of diverse readouts, pSABER will have broad utility in research and clinical settings. pSABER combines the power of signal amplification by exchange reaction (SABER) with the deposition of fluorescent or colorimetric substrates by horseradish peroxidase to enable enhanced signals for in situ hybridization in cells and tissues.},

However, we lack profiling tools for spatial transcriptomics that are easy to adopt, low cost and scalable in terms of sample size and number. Here, we describe a method, Array-seq, to repurpose classical oligonucleotide microarrays for spatial transcriptomics profiling. We generate Array-seq slides from microarrays carrying custom-design probes that contain common sequences flanking unique barcodes at known coordinates. Then we perform a simple, two-step reaction that produces mRNA capture probes across all spots on the microarray. We demonstrate that Array-seq yields spatial transcriptomes with high detection sensitivity and localization specificity using histological sections from mouse tissues as test systems. Moreover, we show that the large surface area of Array-seq slides yields spatial transcriptomes (i) at high throughput by profiling multi-organ sections, (ii) in three dimensions by processing serial sections from one sample, and (iii) across whole human organs. Thus, by combining classical DNA microarrays and next-generation sequencing, we have created a simple and flexible platform for spatiomolecular studies of small-to-large specimens at scale. Array-seq repurposes microarray slides for high-sensitivity, scalable spatial transcriptomics.},

Dynamic nanoscale observations of DNA structural features are necessary for understanding these interactions. Here we introduce graphene energy transfer with vertical nucleic acids (GETvNA), a method to investigate DNA–protein interactions that exploits the vertical orientation adopted by double-stranded DNA on graphene. This approach enables the dynamic study of DNA conformational changes via energy transfer from a probe dye to graphene, achieving spatial resolution down to the Ångström scale at subsecond temporal resolution. We measured DNA bending induced by adenine tracts, bulges, abasic sites and the binding of endonuclease IV. In addition, we observed the translocation of the O6-alkylguanine DNA alkyltransferase on DNA, reaching single base-pair resolution and detecting preferential binding to adenine tracts. This method promises widespread use for dynamical studies of nucleic acids and nucleic acid–protein interactions with resolution so far reserved for traditional structural biology techniques. Graphene energy transfer with vertical nucleic acids (GETvNA) is a general approach enabling dynamical observations of DNA structural changes and DNA–protein interactions with spatial resolution down to the Ångström scale.},

  abstract     = {Disorder and flexibility in protein structures are essential for biological function but can also contribute to diseases, such as neurodegenerative disorders. However, characterizing protein folding on a proteome-wide scale within biological matrices remains challenging. Here we present a method using a bifunctional chemical probe, named TME, to capture in situ, enrich and quantify endogenous protein disorder in cells. TME exhibits a fluorescence turn-on effect upon selective conjugation with proteins with free cysteines in surface-exposed and flexible environments—a distinctive signature of protein disorder. Using an affinity-based proteomic approach, we identify both basal disordered proteins and those whose folding status changes under stress, with coverage to proteins even of low abundance. In lymphoblastoid cells from individuals with Parkinson’s disease and healthy controls, our TME-based strategy distinguishes the two groups more effectively than lysate profiling methods. High-throughput TME fluorescence and proteomics further reveal a universal cellular quality-control mechanism in which cells adapt to proteostatic stress by adopting aggregation-prone distributions and sequestering disordered proteins, as illustrated in Huntington’s disease cell models. This article reports a method based on a bifunctional chemical probe called TME and a workflow named RUBICON to capture, enrich and profile endogenous disordered proteins in cells. The method enables a proteome-wide analysis of protein disorder via high-throughput fluorescence and mass spectrometry-based proteomics.},

Existing solutions have relied on biochemical and physical strategies applied to the specimen and are often complex and challenging. Here, we develop spIsoNet, an end-to-end self-supervised deep learning-based software to address map anisotropy and particle misalignment caused by the preferred-orientation problem. Using preferred-orientation views to recover molecular information in under-sampled views, spIsoNet improves both angular isotropy and particle alignment accuracy during 3D reconstruction. We demonstrate spIsoNet’s ability to generate near-isotropic reconstructions from representative biological systems with limited views, including ribosomes, β-galactosidases and a previously intractable hemagglutinin trimer dataset. spIsoNet can also be generalized to improve map isotropy and particle alignment of preferentially oriented molecules in subtomogram averaging. Therefore, without additional specimen-preparation procedures, spIsoNet provides a general computational solution to the preferred-orientation problem. spIsoNet is an end-to-end self-supervised deep learning-based software to address the reconstruction and misalignment challenge in single-particle cryo-EM caused by the preferred-orientation problem. spIsoNet can also improve map isotropy and particle alignment of preferentially oriented molecules during subtomogram averaging in cryogenic electron tomography.},

  abstract     = {Designing proteins with improved functions requires a deep understanding of how sequence and function are related, a vast space that is hard to explore. The ability to efficiently compress this space by identifying functionally important features is extremely valuable. Here we establish a method called EvoScan to comprehensively segment and scan the high-fitness sequence space to obtain anchor points that capture its essential features, especially in high dimensions. Our approach is compatible with any biomolecular function that can be coupled to a transcriptional output. We then develop deep learning and large language models to accurately reconstruct the space from these anchors, allowing computational prediction of novel, highly fit sequences without prior homology-derived or structural information. We apply this hybrid experimental–computational method, which we call EvoAI, to a repressor protein and find that only 82 anchors are sufficient to compress the high-fitness sequence space with a compression ratio of 1048. The extreme compressibility of the space informs both applied biomolecular design and understanding of natural evolution. EvoScan combines EvolvR mutagenesis and phage selection to explore the protein sequence space in different dimensions, identifying anchor points with critical mutations. Next, EvoAI, a deep learning-based method, uses these anchor points to accurately reconstruct the protein sequence space and design new proteins.},

Comparing the abundance of these epegRNAs across screen samples identified negative selection phenotypes for 7,996 nonsense mutations targeted to 1,149 essential genes and for synonymous mutations that disrupted splice site motifs at 3′ exon boundaries. Rigorous evaluation of codon-matched controls demonstrated that these phenotypes were highly specific to the intended edit. Altogether, we established a prime editing approach for multiplexed, functional characterization of genetic variants with simple readouts.

Conversely, random gene sets correctly yield zero confidence in 87% of cases. Other LLMs (GPT-3.5, Gemini Pro, Mixtral Instruct and Llama2 70b) vary in function recovery but are falsely confident for random sets. In gene clusters from omics data, GPT-4 identifies common functions for 45% of cases, fewer than functional enrichment but with higher specificity and gene coverage. Manual review of supporting rationale and citations finds these functions are largely verifiable. These results position LLMs as valuable omics assistants.

Such atlases can serve as a reference for analyzing and interpreting current and future data. However, it has become apparent that atlasing approaches differ, and the impact of these differences are often unclear. Here we review the current atlasing literature and present considerations for building and using atlases. Importantly, we find that no one-size-fits-all protocol for atlas building exists, but rather we discuss context-specific considerations and workflows, including atlas conceptualization, data collection, curation and integration, atlas evaluation and atlas sharing. We further highlight the benefits of integrated atlases for analyses of new datasets and deriving biological insights beyond what is possible from individual datasets. Our overview of current practices and associated recommendations will improve the quality of atlases to come, facilitating the shift to a unified, reference-based understanding of single-cell biology.

  abstract     = {Recent innovations in differentiating cardiomyocytes from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) have unlocked a viable path to creating in vitro cardiac models. Currently, hiPSC-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) remain immature, leading many in the field to explore approaches to enhance cell and tissue maturation. Here, we systematically analyzed 300 studies using hiPSC-CM models to determine common fabrication, maturation and assessment techniques used to evaluate cardiomyocyte functionality and maturity and compiled the data into an open-access database. Based on this analysis, we present the diversity of, and current trends in, in vitro models and highlight the most common and promising practices for functional assessments. We further analyzed outputs spanning structural maturity, contractile function, electrophysiology and gene expression and note field-wide improvements over time. Finally, we discuss opportunities to collectively pursue the shared goal of hiPSC-CM model development, maturation and assessment that we believe are critical for engineering mature cardiac tissue. This Perspective analyzes the most common maturation and assessment techniques for in vitro hiPSC-derived cardiomyocyte models and makes recommendations for standardizations in this field.},
