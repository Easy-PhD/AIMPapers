  abstract     = {Understanding the structural dynamics of ligands and their interaction with catalytic centres under reaction conditions remains a fundamental challenge, yet it is essential for catalyst design. Here we reveal an in situ transformation of Ni–Fe hydroxide into a stable superoxo-hydroxide phase, which is accompanied by the formation of lattice O–O (Olatt–Olatt) ligands, as demonstrated using operando 18O-labelling spectroelectrochemistry and machine-learning-assisted global optimization. By correlating the intrinsic activity of Fe with the Olatt–Olatt concentration across a series of Fe-incorporated transition-metal hydroxides and oxides, we demonstrate that Olatt–Olatt triggers Fe activation for oxygen evolution electrocatalysis—a finding further supported by first-principles calculations. Oxygen production proceeds via an adsorbate evolution mechanism, and the enhanced reaction kinetics stem from the lowered activation energy at surface Fe sites in the newly formed superoxo-hydroxide structure. This work offers a strategic framework for designing high-performance Fe-incorporated electrocatalysts and underscores the pivotal role of ligand dynamics in activating catalytic centres. While the ligand coordination microenvironment surrounding catalytic centres influences reactivity, dynamic oxygen reconstruction during water oxidation electrocatalysis complicates structure-based mechanistic insights. Now the in situ formation of lattice O–O ligands has been shown to activate Fe centres in metal oxides and hydroxides, thereby enhancing their oxygen evolution reaction activity.},

However, the current solid-phase peptide synthesis (SPPS) faces sluggish reaction rates and low yields when incorporating sterically hindered amino acids, owing to the poor kinetics of the two-phase acyl-transfer process from solution to solid. Here we introduce an immobilized ribosome-mimicking molecular reactor to facilitate on-resin proximity-induced intra(inter)-reactor acyl transfers. This strategy bypasses the two-phase acyl-transfer mechanism in conventional SPPS and boosts coupling efficiency in the solid-phase synthesis of N-methylated and/or α,α-disubstituted amino acid(s)-containing sterically hindered peptides, including cyclosporin A and alamethicin F analogues. The ribosome-mimicking molecular reactor SPPS can be integrated into existing SPPS platforms using commercially available resins and reagents, and displays high compatibility with standard synthesizers, enabling the automated synthesis of pharmaceutically important, sterically hindered difficult peptides. Current solid-phase peptide synthesis methods struggle to incorporate sterically hindered amino acids. Now researchers have developed a ribosome-mimicking molecular reactor that bypasses two-phase acyl transfer to boost the coupling efficiency of peptides containing N-methylated and/or α,α-disubstituted amino acids.},

  abstract     = {Among all enzymatic metallocofactors, those found in nitrogenases, the P and L or M clusters, stand out for their intricate structures. They are assembled by proteins of the Nif gene cluster from Fe2S2 rhombs—the smallest building blocks in FeS cluster chemistry—through a sequence of reactions constructing a Fe8S8 precursor. To advance our understanding of how enzymes selectively build such elaborate inorganic molecules, here we parallel the biosynthetic pathway by reporting the rational stepwise assembly of [Fe8S8]m+ (m = 2, 4, 6) clusters from [Fe2S2]2+ rhombs within an extensive cyclic synthetic network. A [Fe8S8]4+ cluster of unique topology is identified, for which we coin the term ‘interlocked’ double cubane. As a molecular analogue of the NifB K cluster, a proposed precursor to both the P and L or M clusters, its preparation and the characterization of all related intermediates, offers fundamental insights into the molecular mechanisms governing the assembly of both biogenic and synthetic FeS clusters. Elucidating the nature of the metallocofactors in nitrogenase enzymes, and preparing synthetic analogues of these clusters, is a classic target for bioinorganic chemists. Now the transformation of [Fe2S2]2+ rhombs to [Fe8S8]n+ clusters has been achieved through a series of redox- and ligand-substitution reactions.},

  abstract     = {Azoles are important synthetic targets due to their diverse applications in areas ranging from human health to food security. Accordingly, access to N-functionalized azoles is an essential goal in modern synthetic chemistry. Surprisingly, however, the relied-upon azole N-alkylation strategies fundamentally limit the structural diversity of these important compounds that can be synthesized and studied. Here we introduce an approach to prepare a broad array of important but difficult-to-access N-alkyl azole compounds. We accomplish this through the introduction of a base-catalysed hydroazolation of readily accessible alkenylthianthrenium electrophiles. This strategy circumvents the classical challenge of azole alkylation regiocontrol through an unusual reversible C–N-bond-forming step that exploits the thermodynamic differences between azole N-alkylation isomers. This reaction furnishes a class of versatile azolothianthrenium building blocks that provides a general platform to investigate diverse N-alkyl azole molecules. More broadly, the distinctive approach outlined through this project is poised to impact the design and development of diverse regioselective alkylation reactions. Azoles are important synthetic targets due to their diverse applications in areas ranging from human health to food security. Now it has been shown that the hydroazolation of alkenylthianthrenium salts provides a modular platform to access diverse, densely functionalized N-alkyl azole compounds with high N-regioselectivity.},

  abstract     = {Aggregation of microtubule-associated protein tau into conformationally distinct fibrils underpins neurodegenerative tauopathies. Fluorescent probes (fluoroprobes) such as thioflavin T have been essential tools for studying tau aggregation; however, most of them do not discriminate between amyloid fibril conformations (polymorphs). This gap is due, in part, to a lack of high-throughput methods for screening large, diverse chemical collections. Here we leverage advances in protein-adaptive differential scanning fluorimetry to screen the Aurora collection of 300+ fluoroprobes against multiple synthetic fibril polymorphs, including those formed from tau, α-synuclein and islet amyloid polypeptide. This screen—coupled with excitation-multiplexed bright-emission recording (EMBER) imaging and orthogonal secondary assays—revealed pan-fibril-binding chemotypes, as well as fluoroprobes selective for fibril subsets. One fluoroprobe recognized tau pathology in ex vivo brain slices from Alzheimer’s disease and rodent models. We propose that these scaffolds represent entry points for developing fibril-selective ligands. Amyloid fibrils can adopt a range of distinct conformations, yet it is challenging to rapidly discriminate between these polymorphs. Now methods have been developed to screen large, diverse libraries of turn-on fluorescent dyes to rapidly identify probes that recognize fibril subsets.},

Although commonly utilized as nitrogen nucleophiles, their application as alkyl sources for constructing (sp3)C–C(sp3) bonds remains a notable challenge. Here we present an approach integrating nitrogen-atom deletion into the aza-Michael reaction, thereby redirecting the classical pathway from (sp3)C–N bond formation to (sp3)C–C(sp3) bond construction. Leveraging commercially available O-diphenylphosphinylhydroxylamine as an efficient nitrogen-deletion reagent, this method enables a wide variety of primary aliphatic amines to serve as alkyl sources in couplings with structurally diverse electron-deficient olefins. This Giese-type reaction proceeds under mild conditions, achieves completion within 10 min and exhibits broad functional-group compatibility. By bridging two foundational transformations—the aza-Michael reaction and the Giese-type reaction—this approach interlinks their product spaces through a unified precursor library, substantially enhancing synthetic utility. Primary aliphatic amines are abundant building blocks but underutilized as alkyl sources in C–C bond formation. Now it has been shown that integrating nitrogen-atom deletion into the aza-Michael reaction redirects the classical pathway from (sp3)C–N bond formation to Giese-type (sp3)C–C(sp3) bond construction.},

Here we report two-dimensional vertical ladder polymer cathode materials that feature layered nanosheets with rich intralayer pores and structural defects alongside weak interlayer interactions. This structural design allows lithium ions to migrate vertically across the intrinsic pores and/or defects accompanied by horizontal intercalation, thus establishing a cross-flow pathway for lithium storage. Such an effective ion-transport method enables flash charging of an ultrahigh-power polymer cathode to ~70% state-of-charge within 30 s at a high current density. Even operated at −50 °C, the polymer cathode achieves 3-min charging to ~55% state-of-charge. Furthermore, we propose an organic–inorganic hybrid strategy that overall improves the electrode-level specific energy at high rates for meeting practical metrics. This work demonstrates the potential of organic electrodes for high-power output under extreme operational conditions. Electrochemical energy-storage devices require rapid charge–discharge profiles, but the dense electrode packing required to achieve high energy densities results in sluggish ion-transport kinetics. Now a two-dimensional vertical ladder polymer cathode has been shown to achieve promising performance and tolerance by using a cross-flow lithium migration pathway.},

We use this approach to quantitatively characterize fatty-acyl-dependent transport of phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylserine lipids between the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria, the nucleus or lysosomes. Further experiments revealed the relative contributions of various biosynthesis pathways to the phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylserine lipid compositions in the mitochondria, nucleus and lysosomes. Lysosome-specific photocatalytic labelling revealed the impact of the mTOR kinase pathway on lysosomal lipid metabolism. Together, this subcellularly localized photocatalytic labelling of lipids quantitatively deciphers the subcellular lipid composition and transport, enhancing our understanding of lipid metabolism in living organisms.

  abstract     = {Metal–sulfur active sites play a central role in catalytic processes such as hydrogenation and dehydrogenation, yet the majority of active sites in these compounds reside on the surfaces and edges of catalyst particles, limiting overall efficiency. Here we present a strategy to embed metal–sulfur active sites into metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) by converting bridging or terminal chloride ligands into hydroxide and subsequently into sulfide groups through post-synthetic modification. We apply this method to two representative MOF families: one featuring one-dimensional metal–chloride chains and another containing discrete multinuclear metal clusters. Crystallographic and spectroscopic analyses confirm structural integrity and sulfide incorporation, and the transformation is monitored by in situ total scattering methods. The sulfided MOFs display enhanced catalytic activity in the selective hydrogenation of nitroarenes using molecular hydrogen. Density functional theory calculations indicate that sulfur incorporation promotes homolytic metal–ligand bond cleavage and facilitates H2 activation. This work establishes an approach to construct MOFs featuring accessible metal–sulfide sites. Metal–sulfur motifs are commonly found in enzymatic active sites and heterogeneous catalysis, but they remain underexplored in porous solids. Now, sulfur-based ligands have been incorporated into metal–organic frameworks through post-synthetic modifications. The resulting sulfide MOFs exhibit enhanced catalytic performance in the selective hydrogenation of nitroarenes compared with their parent MOFs containing terminal or bridging chloride and hydroxyl groups.},

  abstract     = {The flexible and modular design of synthetic cells, comprising lipid vesicles capable of imitating the structure and function of living cells, facilitates their application as drug delivery devices. The ability to control the synthesis of biomolecules within synthetic cells using a tissue-penetrating stimulus opens up additional levels of functionality that has the potential to improve biological potency and circumvent drug leakage from preloaded vesicles. To this end, we have designed spherical nucleic acids comprising DNA promoter sequences decorating magnetic nanoparticle cores. These spherical nucleic acids allowed us to harness the heat dissipated from magnetic hyperthermia (a clinically approved anticancer therapy) to regulate cell-free protein synthesis and release cargo on demand. Furthermore, this magnetic regulation of biosynthesis was achieved using clinically tolerable magnetic field strengths and frequencies. We then deployed an opaque blocking material that is impenetrable by current activation methods to highlight the potential of this technology for targeting and controlling the in situ synthesis of biomolecules using tissue-penetrating magnetic fields deep within the body. The programmability of synthetic cells, comprising lipid vesicles that are capable of imitating the structure and function of living cells, facilitates their application as drug delivery devices. Now, magnetic hyperthermia has been used to control the on-demand synthesis and release of biomolecules from within synthetic cells.},

  abstract     = {High-entropy metal-containing nanomaterials have garnered interest in diverse fields such as electrocatalysis and energy conversion. Their synthesis typically requires high temperatures (&gt;1,000 K) to facilitate homogeneous mixing and rapid transformation of metal precursors. However, current state-of-the-art approaches typically involve complex reaction environments and require specialized equipment and operations. Herein we demonstrate a versatile flame synthesis process to fabricate high-entropy metallic single atoms and/or nanoparticles supported on soot-like carbon via blending organometallic precursors into fuel (namely, paraffin wax) and subsequent burning. The high flame temperature (~1,800 K) enables strong metal–carbon association with tailorable chemistry and homogeneous bonding between dissimilar metallic elements (up to 25 metals studied), regardless of their thermodynamic compatibility. Additionally, we show high-performance electrosynthesis of hydrogen peroxide to highlight this approach as a promising method for electrocatalyst development. High-entropy nanomaterials, which incorporate multiple homogeneously dispersed elements, are promising for energy conversion, but typically require complex, high-temperature synthesis. Now a scalable flame synthesis method has been shown to produce tunable, high-entropy nanomaterials under facile conditions, enabling the design of advanced electrocatalysts for hydrogen peroxide production and other relevant applications.},

  abstract     = {Current methods of processing accumulated polyolefin waste typically require harsh conditions, precious metals or high metal loadings to achieve appreciable activities. Here we examined supported, single-site organonickel catalysts for polyolefin upcycling. Chemisorption of Ni(COD)2 (COD, 1,5-cyclooctadiene) onto Brønsted acidic sulfated alumina (AlS) yields a highly electrophilic Ni(I) precatalyst, AlS/Ni(COD)2, which is converted under H2 to the active AlS/NiIIH catalyst. This single-site system exhibits unique hydrogenolysis selectivity that favours cleaving branched polyolefin C–C linkages, enabling the hydrogenolytic separation of polyethylene and isotactic polypropylene (iPP) mixtures. Moreover, AlS/NiIIH remains highly selective and active for hydrogenolysis of iPP admixed with polyvinyl chloride, and the spent catalyst can be repeatedly regenerated by AlEt3 treatment. Experimental mechanistic analysis and density functional theory modelling reveal a turnover-limiting C–C scission pathway featuring β-alkyl transfer and strong olefin binding. These results highlight the potential of nickel-based systems for the selective upcycling of complex plastic waste streams. Selective chemical upcycling of polyolefin mixtures remains challenging due to the structural similarity of their backbones. Now it has been shown that a single-site nickel catalyst can preferentially and efficiently cleave branched C–C bonds, enabling the hydrogenolytic separation of isotactic polypropylene from mixtures containing both isotactic polypropylene and polyethylene.},

  abstract     = {The growing demand for fluorochemicals has increased the production of toxic hydrogen fluoride (HF)—a widely used fluorination agent—from mineral fluorspar (CaF2). Although potassium fluoride (KF) is a safer alternative fluorination agent, its production still involves HF as an intermediate. Simultaneously, the disposal of fluoropolymer waste, especially polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF), poses environmental challenges. We present a mechanochemical protocol that decomposes PVDF to generate KF as a nucleophilic fluorinating agent. As an advantage over traditional batch reactions, mechanochemical protocols can be performed quickly, and with or without modest volumes of solvents. We show that KF produced using this method can be used to efficiently construct S–F, C(sp2)–F and C(sp3)–F bonds, providing a sustainable solution to fluorine resource depletion and hazardous HF usage. Our approach also addresses fluoropolymer waste disposal and reduces reliance on natural fluorspar resources, marking a notable advancement in fluorine chemistry and paving the way for safer and eco-friendly fluorination techniques. The production of fluorination agents generally involves the formation of toxic hydrogen fluoride. Now, a mechanochemical protocol to decompose the fluoropolymer polyvinylidene fluoride has been developed, generating potassium fluoride as a fluorinating agent. This approach provides a safer and sustainable fluorination strategy for efficient S–F, C(sp2)–F and C(sp3)–F bond formation.},

  abstract     = {Catalytic hydrogenation is essential in synthetic chemistry, with ongoing innovations aimed at enhancing the selectivity and efficiency of these reactions. The hydrogenation of multisubstituted allenes, however, presents a long-standing challenge due to the difficulty of controlling multiple selectivity factors simultaneously. Here we introduce a series of chiral pincer cobalt catalysts featuring multiple metal–ligand cooperative functionalities. These catalysts feature an ‘N–H’ moiety as an outer-sphere binding site and an N-heterocycle group as a hemilabile basic site, enabling the use of structurally diverse tridentate ligands for selective hydrogenation of functionalized allenes. This design liberates a coordination site for H2 activation and enhances selectivity control through the structural tuning of the N-heterocycle group. The catalysts exhibit exceptional chemo-, regio-, enantio- and Z/E-selectivities, along with broad functional group tolerance, enabling access to all possible semihydrogenation products of multisubstituted allenes. Mechanistic studies uncover a distinctive redox-neutral Co(I) catalytic cycle that facilitates heterolytic cleavage of H2, assisted by the basic N-heterocycle on the ligand. The hydrogenation of multisubstituted allenes presents a long-standing challenge due to the difficulty in simultaneously controlling multiple selectivity parameters. Now a class of pincer cobalt catalysts featuring multiple metal–ligand cooperation functionalities has been developed that enables the regio- and stereodivergent hydrogenation of allenes to provide all possible multisubstituted alkene products.},

However, it remains challenging to design a synthetic system featuring dynamic covalent bonds with secondary structural folding and full recycling capabilities. Here we present a synthetic covalent polymer, constructed from biologically relevant units (amino acids and disulfides), that can reversibly adapt between disordered and helical conformations and can recycle itself to the original small molecules. This dual dynamic feature arises from the subtle synergy of noncovalent bonds (H bonds) and dynamic covalent bonds within a coupled chemical equilibrium, of which thermodynamics is found to follow a nonlinear van’t Hoff equation with nonzero heat capacity change. The covalent polymers show conformational dynamics between structured helices and disordered coils and the ability to convert back to the original monomers. This system demonstrates how dual dynamic function can control helical and recyclable polymer formation. Covalent polymers with helical conformations offer an adaptive scaffold for smart materials, but polymer-to-monomer deconstruction is inhibited by the covalent backbone. Now it has been shown that poly(disulfide)s can be folded into helices driven by side-chain hydrogen-bonding self-assembly, resulting in a synthetic helical polymer that can be fully recycled.},

Real-time observation of chemical bonding at the single-molecule level offers insights into transient intermediates that are normally inaccessible via ensemble measurements. Protein nanopores, with their unique geometries, can be tailored into nanoreactors. Molecular bond-making and -cleavage at the reactive site of a protein nanopore’s interior wall can be visualized by monitoring ionic current changes. Therefore, nanopore-based techniques can enhance the understanding of complex binding kinetics and reaction mechanisms. In this Review we summarize recent advances in using biological nanopores as both single-molecule nanoreactors and single-molecule biosensors. The discussion covers the kinetics of single-molecule reactions under nanopore confinement, the strategies for designing biological nanopores and the latest progress in revealing reaction intermediates and pathways at the single-molecule level. Finally, we emphasize unresolved challenges and anticipate future developments in this rapidly evolving field. Real-time single-molecule observation provides insights into transient intermediates that are normally inaccessible using ensemble measurements.

However, catalytic N2 to NH3 conversion by side-on bound metal–N2 molecular complexes is relevant to both the industrial and biological nitrogen-fixation processes. Here, using a uranium triamidoamine complex, we report catalytic N2 to NH3 conversion involving side-on bound N2 binding. Stoichiometric reactions reveal stepwise reduction of N2 from free N2 to bridging side-on bound forms and subsequently to bridging nitrides, uniquely accessing four different states of side-on bound N2 for the same molecular system. This reveals the roles of N2, N22−, N23−, N24− and N3− in the catalytic conversion of N2 to NH3 when involving side-on bridging N2. The catalytic conversion of nitrogen to ammonia by molecular complexes typically involves the reduction and protonation of end-on metal–N2 compounds. Now, a uranium complex has been shown to catalyse the conversion of N2 to ammonia through the formation of a side-on bound dinitrogen complex. Four different states of side-on bound dinitrogen and the cleavage to nitride have been observed.},

  abstract     = {Organoboron compounds are important intermediates in organic synthesis, commonly used in metal-catalysed cross-coupling reactions. Their unique reactivity also allows modifications of their carbon framework with preservation of the valuable boryl group. Traditionally, these homologation reactions have been confined to the formation of alkyl boron compounds via C(sp3) insertion into a C–B bond. However, recent advancements in C(sp2)-insertive homologation highlight the potential of these reactions in synthesizing complex alkenes, despite current limitations in scope and control of the alkene geometry. Here we demonstrate a catalytic C(sp2)-insertive homologation for the regio- and diastereoselective synthesis of complex trisubstituted diborylalkenes from simple alkylboranes and alkynyl boronic esters. Our work demonstrates a broad reaction scope and application of the resulting products in modular and stereoselective synthesis of highly substituted alkenes. Furthermore, we provide evidence supporting a unique mechanism responsible for the excellent stereoselectivity observed in the reaction. Homologation reactions of organoboron compounds, while common, have rarely been used in stereoselective synthesis of highly substituted alkenes. Now a catalytic diastereoselective homologation of alkylboranes into trisubstituted alkenes has been developed, with key catalytic intermediates elucidated in a detailed mechanistic study.},

This requires electronic excitations, excitons, with net spin. Here we report a molecular diradical where two trityl radical groups are coupled via a meta-linked fluorene bridge. The singlet exciton is at lower energy than the triplet because electron transfer from one of the radical non-bonding orbitals to the other is spin allowed, set by the charging energy for the double occupancy of the non-bonding level, the Hubbard U. Both excitons give efficient photoluminescence at 640 and 700 nm with near unity efficiency. The ground state exchange energy is low, 60 µeV, allowing control of ground state spin populations. We demonstrate spin-selective intersystem crossing and show coherent microwave control. We report up to 8% photoluminescence contrast at microwave resonance. This tuning of the singlet Mott–Hubbard exciton against the ‘bandgap’ exciton provides a new design platform for spin–optical materials. Controlling electron spin states with light is vital for quantum technologies but requires electronic excitations with net spin. Now a molecular diradical with two trityl radical groups coupled via a meta-linked fluorene bridge has been developed that features luminescent singlet and triplet excitons. The spins in the ground state can be written and read using photons, giving rise to broad magnetic and microwave modulation of the photoluminescence.},

The optical properties of these materials make them promising candidates in light-emitting devices. However, developing their general design principles remains challenging. Here we report an antisolvent incorporation approach that transforms a broad range of two-dimensional tin iodide perovskites into 0D structures. This approach accommodates diverse organic cations and antisolvent molecules and is extendable to germanium and lead analogues. We show that enhancing the structural rigidity in Sn-based octahedra—modulated by organic packing—increases the radiative recombination rate while decreasing the non-radiative recombination rate, achieving near-unity photoluminescence quantum yield. Ge- and Sn-based structures exhibit large Stokes shifts and microsecond-scale triplet lifetimes due to localized excited states, while their Pb-based counterpart shows faster recombination via triplet–singlet mixing, supported by theoretical calculations. This work offers a versatile synthetic platform for 0D metal halides and deepens our current understanding of excited-state dynamics in halide perovskites. Zero-dimensional metal halides exhibit intriguing photophysical properties; however, developing their general design principles remains challenging. Now it has been shown that two-dimensional perovskites can be converted into zero-dimensional octahedral metal halides through solvent incorporation. The resulting materials feature near-unity photoluminescence quantum yields. Structural rigidity and the choice of metal cation are key parameters to tune the exciton recombination dynamics.},

Lipidomic analysis has identified a growing number of lipid species, including PUFAs with diverse structural variations and biofunctions, yet their structure–function relationships are still largely unknown. In this context, an efficient synthesis of PUFAs would be highly desirable. However, no practical methodology exists for their preparation, in contrast to peptides and nucleic acids, for which diverse molecules are accessible through a well-established solid-phase synthesis. To address this, we have developed an efficient and expedited method to access a wide array of PUFAs by full solid-phase synthesis. The method allows the synthesis of various PUFAs and analogues through rapid and facile operations. Moreover, within our PUFA library, we have discovered an artificial fatty acid, antiefin, that has a high anti-inflammatory effect in vivo. Therefore, our practical synthetic pathway to PUFAs, a crucial class of lipids, is expected to make an important contribution to lipid science. Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) are attracting considerable interest because of their diverse structures and properties. Now a method to access a wide array of PUFAs by full solid-phase synthesis has been developed and used to discover an anti-inflammatory fatty acid.},

  abstract     = {Chiral catalysts that can engage multiple substrates, via distinct ground-state activation modes, to deliver enantioenriched products with high levels of fidelity are often described as ‘privileged’. Achieving generality in excited-state processes remains challenging, and efforts to identify privileged chiral photocatalysts are being intensively pursued. Aluminium–salen complexes are emergent contenders on account of their well-defined photophysical properties. Here we report the development of an enantioselective energy transfer (EnT) catalysis-enabled photocyclization of acrylanilides to expand the activation repertoire of Al–salen photocatalysts. This approach allows reactivity and enantioselectivity to be simultaneously regulated by an inexpensive, commercial chiral Al–salen complex upon irradiation at λ = 400 nm. Diverse cyclic products can be forged with high levels of enantioselectivity (up to 96:4 e.r.). Establishing this dichotomy in excited-state activation modes serves to consolidate the privileged status of chiral Al–salen complexes in enantioselective photocatalysis and to complement their ubiquity in ground-state regimes. Photocatalysts that can engage a range of substrates and regulate reactivity and enantioselectivity are highly desirable. Now, an enantioselective energy transfer catalysis-enabled photocyclization of acrylanilides has been developed. Reactivity and enantioselectivity are simultaneously regulated by a commercial chiral Al–salen complex upon irradiation, enabling the formation of diverse cyclic products with high levels of enantioselectivity.},

Here we develop an ATP-driven platform for C-terminal activation and peptide ligation based on MccB, a bacterial ancestor of ubiquitin-activating (E1) enzymes. We show that MccB can act on non-native substrates to generate an O-AMPylated electrophile that reacts with exogenous nucleophiles to form diverse C-terminal functional groups including thioesters, a versatile class of biological intermediates that have been exploited for protein C-terminal bioconjugation. By mining the natural diversity of the MccB family, we identify both epitope-specific and more promiscuous MccBs. We show that epitope-specific MccB activity can be directed toward specific proteins of interest to enable high-yield, ATP-driven protein bioconjugation, and promiscuous MccB activity can be deployed for the synthesis of peptide thioester substrates for bioconjugation. Our method mimics the chemical logic of biological peptide bond synthesis for high-yield in vitro manipulation of protein structure with molecular precision. In living systems, ATP provides an energetic driving force for protein synthesis and modification. Now, an engineered enzymatic tool has been developed for high-yield, ATP-driven protein bioconjugation through versatile thioester intermediates.

Using scanning probe methods, we show that this design achieves strong electronic coupling between the porphyrin and the GNR. For transition metal porphyrins, pronounced exchange coupling between distant metal centres is mediated by the π-electron system. Such a hybrid d and π electron ribbon system introduces spin–orbit coupling and magnetic anisotropy to carbon nanomaterials, and holds great promise for coherent electrical control of electron spins. Graphene nanoribbons with zigzag edges are key candidates for spintronic applications due to their tunable bandgaps and spin-polarized edge states.

  abstract     = {Efficient sunlight-to-energy conversion requires materials that can generate long-lived charge carriers upon illumination. However, the targeted design of semiconductors possessing intrinsically long lifetimes remains a key challenge. Here using a series of transition metal oxides, we establish a link between carrier lifetime and electronic configuration in transition metal-based semiconductors. We identify a subpicosecond relaxation mechanism via metal-centred ligand field states that compromise quantum yields in open d-shell transition metal oxides (for example, Fe2O3, Co3O4, Cr2O3 and NiO), which is more reminiscent of molecular complexes than crystalline semiconductors. We found that materials with spin-forbidden ligand field transitions could partially mitigate this relaxation pathway, explaining why Fe2O3 achieves higher photoelectrochemical activity than other visible light-absorbing transition metal oxides. However, achieving high yields of long-lived charges requires transition metal oxides with d0 or d10 electronic configurations (for example, TiO2 and BiVO4), where ligand field states are absent. These trends translate to transition metal-containing semiconductors beyond oxides, enabling the design of photoabsorbers with better-controlled recombination channels in photovoltaics, photocatalysis and communication devices. Efficient sunlight-to-fuel conversion requires materials that produce long-lived charges, but increasing carrier lifetimes in visible-light-active photocatalysts has proven difficult. Now it has been shown that rapid charge deactivation via metal-centred states prevents long lifetimes and limits photocatalytic performance. These insights bridge solid-state and molecular photochemistry, informing strategies for improved photocatalyst design.},

In particular, C–H functionalization chemistry that could be ideally suited to increase structural diversity through late-stage functionalization is currently absent from DEL synthesis. Here we present a general C–H functionalization of electron-rich arenes on DNA. The development of a selenoxide reagent is key to achieving the regio- and chemoselective formation of arylselenonium salts in aqueous media. The introduction of arylselenonium salts offers a versatile linchpin on DNA conjugates, which gives access to a multitude of analogues through diverse subsequent reactions, including transition-metal-mediated and photochemical transformations for the formation of C–C, C–I and C–S bonds. C–H functionalization is a key reaction in organic synthesis.

  abstract     = {Post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation and acetylation are often minor structural modifications that can have profound effects on protein structure and thus broaden protein functions. Nevertheless, studying these effects directly is often out of reach because no general chemistry exists to introduce small modifications selectively; either a large, stable linker structure is selectively installed on protein residues, or a small substituent is introduced at the risk of low selectivity due to the use of reactive, indiscriminate molecules. Here we report a C–H functionalization reaction of tyrosine residues to access peptides and proteins modified by small structural changes including single-atom substitutions. A rationally designed selenoxide introduces a versatile selenonium linchpin featuring a Ctyr–Se bond that can be used for further transformations at specific tyrosine residues. Key to the advance is the interplay of water-resistant, intramolecular chalcogen and hydrogen bonding of the selenoxide reagent, which allows chemo- and site-selective electrophilic aromatic substitution of tyrosine residues in aqueous solutions. Proteins with small structural modifications at specific sites are valuable, yet challenging to access by chemical methods. Now, tyrosine-selective single-atom modifications on proteins have been achieved by C–H functionalization using a rationally designed selenoxide to introduce a versatile selenonium linchpin for further transformations.},

  abstract     = {The site-specific modification of amines has been a highly sought-after objective in organic synthesis. Despite the rapid advancement of carbon–hydrogen (C–H) bond functionalization methods, effective strategies for carbon–carbon (C–C) bond functionalization of amines remain elusive. Here we report a borane-catalysed method for the selective insertion of alkynes into alkyl C–C bonds of amines, resulting in the ring expansion of cyclic amines and chain elongation of acyclic amines. This approach begins with the cleavage of C–H bonds in amines, then transitioning to C–C bond functionalization upon reaction with alkynes. This method is effective with amines lacking an activating or leaving group and is suitable for late-stage functionalization of pharmaceuticals through C–C bond modification. Furthermore, by coupling this reaction with hydrolysis and hydrogenation steps, successive alkyne insertions are achieved, enabling modular and iterative alkyl growth of amines. The functionalization of carbon–carbon bonds in amines remains an important challenge in organic synthesis. Now a borane-catalysed method has been developed that enables the insertion of alkynes into the alkyl C–C bonds of amines, providing a versatile approach for the ring expansion of cyclic amines and chain elongation of acyclic amines.},

  abstract     = {Organic electrode materials offer a versatile, sustainable approach for next-generation lithium-ion batteries but are limited by low working voltages and poor cycling stability. Here we report a solid-solvation-structure design strategy to improve both the voltage and stability of organic electrode materials in all-solid-state batteries. As a proof of concept, we incorporate halide electrolytes as solid solutes and tetrachloro-o-benzoquinone as a solid solvent to form homogeneous solid cathode solutions. Systematic optimization of the inner solvation configuration enables tetrachloro-o-benzoquinone to achieve a high working voltage (3.6 V vs. Li+/Li) at room temperature within an asymmetric solid solvation sheath. Moreover, the equilibrium redox pathway and electrostatically driven self-healing interfaces revealed rapid redox kinetics and stable performance over 7,500 cycles in all-solid-state batteries under low stack pressures. This work demonstrates that organic electrode materials can serve as viable, durable and cost-effective alternatives to transition metal oxides in all-solid-state batteries. Organic electrode materials offer a versatile and sustainable route for lithium-ion batteries, but their application is hindered by low working voltages and poor cycling stability. Now, it has been shown that dissolving halide electrolytes into organic electrodes effectively tunes the working voltage and enhances the electrochemical performance of all-solid-state batteries.},

By combining recent deep-learning methods with a large and diverse training set of all-atom protein simulations, we here develop a bottom–up CG force field with chemical transferability, which can be used for extrapolative molecular dynamics on new sequences not used during model parameterization. We demonstrate that the model successfully predicts metastable states of folded, unfolded and intermediate structures, the fluctuations of intrinsically disordered proteins and relative folding free energies of protein mutants, while being several orders of magnitude faster than an all-atom model. This showcases the feasibility of a universal and computationally efficient machine-learned CG model for proteins.

By viewing a biocatalytically installed alcohol as an exploitable motif rather than a structural endpoint, a number of abiotic skeletal rearrangements were designed, resulting in substantial structural divergence from the original drimane ring system of sclareolide. Using this approach, the syntheses of four terpenoid natural products, namely, merosterolic acid B, cochlioquinone B, (+)-daucene and dolasta-1(15),8-diene, were achieved.

Controlling π-conjugation by designing proper conjugated moieties is one of the commonest strategies for achieving desired semiconducting properties in conjugated materials. Despite significant advancements in the field, the reversible formation of extended conjugation to in situ switch the nature of macromolecules between semiconductors and insulators remains elusive. Here we disclose a generic strategy for developing polymeric structures that incorporate molecular switch units. These units enable the controlled activation and deactivation of linear conjugation in response to acid–base or electronic stimuli. This is achieved by copolymerizing non-π-conjugated lactone-functionalized xanthene moieties with traditional π-conjugated building blocks. With 2,6-dihydroxynaphthalene as an ‘electro-acid’, the electrochromic-like properties of these polymers were explored, demonstrating an effective in situ conversion of the non-conjugated, colourless polymers into conjugated, coloured polymers. Despite advances in polymer science, reversible formation and control of linear conjugation in polymer backbones remain elusive. Now, copolymerizing lactone-functionalized xanthene units with π-conjugated building blocks has been shown to produce polymers capable of reversible, stimuli-responsive conjugation switching, enabling tunable semiconducting behaviour and offering a promising strategy for designing smart, responsive polymeric materials.},

  abstract     = {Dynamic kinetic resolution (DKR) is an efficient chiral induction strategy that transforms both enantiomers of the substrate racemates into the same optically enriched product. Typically, the absolute configurations of the products should be determined by the chiral catalyst. Here we report an adaptive DKR strategy that forges diverse azapolycycles with high stereochemical selectivities by taking full advantage of the dynamic interconversion of diastereomeric aminoalkyl cyclopalladated complexes. Notably, this innovative adaptive DKR model achieves alterations of absolute configurations at the contiguous stereocentres with the same chiral diphosphine-ligated palladium catalyst by changing the ring sizes of the annulation products. Moreover, a concise and efficient total synthesis of martinellic acid was carried out by using the adaptive DKR process as the key chirality forging and scaffold establishment step, which further demonstrated the efficacy of this strategy. In drug development, altering the ring sizes and editing the stereochemistry of chiral heterocycle scaffolds in lead compounds are effective but challenging. Now an adaptive dynamic kinetic resolution strategy has been developed that enables the integration of multi-contiguous stereocentres and the assembly of complex polycycles such as martinellic acid.},

  abstract     = {Functional group interconversions are particularly sought after by medicinal chemists as a means to enable both lead optimization and library diversification. Here we report SO2 insertion into the C–N bond of primary amines, enabling the direct synthesis of primary sulfonamides without preactivation and effectively inverting the nitrogen’s properties (acidity, hydrogen bonding and so on). The key to this transformation is the implementation of an anomeric amide as a dual-function reagent that both serves to cleave the initial C–N bond and delivers a nitrogen atom to the product after SO2 incorporation. The process tolerates a wide array of functionalities and can be run in an automated fashion, thus allowing libraries of amines to be viable progenitors to highly desirable sulfonamides. Mechanistic studies support an isodiazene radical chain mechanism that generates an intermediate sulfinate that reacts with the anomeric amide to forge the S–N bond. Our protocol was used to conduct a high-throughput library diversification campaign, was applied to the synthesis and modification of approved active pharmaceutical ingredients and was used to enable a net CO-to-SO2 isosteric replacement approach. Despite recent advances in primary sulfonamide synthesis, approaches using primary amines as starting points for direct sulfonamide construction remain elusive. Now a formal SO2 insertion into the C–N bond of primary amines has been developed, using an anomeric amide reagent for both C–N cleavage and S–N bond formation.},

  abstract     = {RNA-driven condensation plays a central role in organizing and regulating ribonucleoprotein granules within cells. Disruptions to this process—such as the aberrant aggregation of repeat-expanded RNA—are associated with numerous neurological disorders. Here we study the role of biomolecular condensates in irreversible RNA aggregation. We find that physiologically relevant and disease-associated repeat RNAs spontaneously undergo an age-dependent percolation transition inside multi-component condensates to form nanoscale clusters. Homotypic RNA clusters drive the emergence of multi-phasic condensate structures, with an RNA-rich solid core surrounded by an RNA-depleted fluid shell. The timescale of RNA clustering is determined by sequence, secondary structure and repeat length. Importantly, G3BP1, the core scaffold of stress granules, introduces heterotypic buffering to homotypic RNA–RNA interactions and prevents RNA clustering in an ATP-independent manner. Our work suggests that biomolecular condensates can act as sites for RNA aggregation and highlights the chaperone-like function of RNA-binding proteins against aberrant RNA phase transitions. Pathological aggregation of repeat-expanded RNA is implicated in neurodegeneration. Now results demonstrate that biomolecular condensates can promote irreversible clustering of GC-rich repeat RNAs facilitated by RNA percolation, leading to an emergent liquid-to-solid phase transition. This aberrant RNA self-assembly can be counteracted by RNA-binding proteins and anti-sense oligonucleotides that enforce heterotypic buffering.},

However, other than the requirement for small or unfoldable cargo and an intact HOPS complex, little is known about how ZF5.3 traverses the limiting endocytic membrane. Here we characterize the requirements for efficient endosomal escape. We confirm that ZF5.3 remains folded at high temperatures and at pH values between 5.5 and 7.5. At lower pH, ZF5.3 unfolds cooperatively upon protonation of Zn(II)-binding His side chains whose pKa matches that of the late endolysosomal lumen. pH-induced unfolding of ZF5.3 is essential for endosomal escape, as an analogue that remains folded at low pH fails to efficiently reach the cytosol. Once unfolded, ZF5.3 interacts in a pH-dependent manner with bis(monoacylglycero)phosphate, a lipid present in the inner leaflet of late endolysosomal membranes. These data provide a biophysical model for HOPS-dependent endosomal escape. ZF5.3 is a mini-protein that escapes endosomes efficiently. Work to understand the underlying mechanism now reveals that ZF5.3 unfolds at pH values lower than 5.5 through protonation of Zn(II)-bound His residues. Unfolding promotes pH-dependent interactions with a unique lipid present in late endolysosomal membranes and is essential for endosomal escape.},

This spatiotemporally controlled ECM assembly can be used to develop coacervate-based polymer assembly strategies to generate biomimetic materials that can emulate the complex structures and biophysical cues of the ECM. Inspired by the tropoelastin structure, here we develop a designer minimalistic model consisting of alternating hydrophobic moieties and covalent crosslinking domains. By increasing the valence and enhancing the interaction strength of the hydrophobic moieties, we can control the degree of the assembly to enhance the propensity for phase separation and thus emulate the extracellular coacervation process of tropoelastin, including droplet formation, coalescence and maturation. The subsequent covalent-bonding-triggered coacervate–hydrogel transition with enhanced assembly order stabilizes the phase-separated structure in the form of a heterogeneous hydrogel, thereby mimicking covalent crosslinking-derived elastin fibrillation. Furthermore, the heterogeneous hydrogel network establishes a biomimetic matrix that can effectively promote the mechanosensing of adherent stem cells. The extracellular matrix (ECM) is assembled through liquid–liquid phase separation and directed phase transition. Now—inspired by tropoelastin—a designer minimalistic model incorporating alternating hydrophobic moieties and crosslinking domains can template the assembly of a biomimetic matrix that mimics the ECM, promoting the mechanosensing of stem cells.},

Here we report a family of ten ultramicroporous zirconium-based metal–organic frameworks assembled from isophthalate-based octatopic or hexatopic carboxylate linkers with high coordination density and Zr6 nodes with relatively low connectivity (4, 6 and 8). The diverse inorganic node geometry, ligand connectivity, structural topology, framework stability and ultramicroporosity of the resultant metal–organic frameworks underscore the pivotal role of linker geometry and functionality in tailoring the adsorptive properties of the material. These ultramicroporous solids hold promise for the separation of industrially relevant hydrocarbons. We show that HIAM-802 and HIAM-601 exhibit high-efficiency separation of hexane isomers based on branching by molecular exclusion. We validated their separation capabilities through breakthrough experiments and further clarified the underlying adsorption mechanisms by density functional theory calculations. Ultramicroporous solids hold great promise for hydrocarbon separation, but uncovering their design principles remains challenging. Now, a series of ultramicroporous zirconium metal–organic frameworks with tunable microporosity and pore structure have been prepared by combining isophthalate-based octatopic or hexatopic organic linkers and Zr6 nodes; these materials can separate hexane isomers as a function of branching.},

In this context, as an N-containing carbonyl compound, the transformations of formamides, wherein C=O cleavage occurring with simultaneous incorporation of ‘O’ and aminomethine moieties to highly functionalized amines, remain a formidable challenge. Here we disclosed a dirhodium/Xantphos or dirhodium–palladium dual catalysed reaction of diazo compounds and allylic substrates in dimethyl formamide, giving various α-aminoketones and cyclopentenone derivatives efficiently featured with extensively reorganized structure, wherein a carbenic carbon was formally inserted into C=O bond and α-group of the carbene was shifted to the residual aminomethine moiety. Mechanistic studies revealed that three or six domino steps are involved in this catalytic process, including epoxidation, dyotropic type rearrangement, allylic alkylation, Claisen rearrangement, isomerization and Nazarov cyclization. C=O cleavage of formamides and full transfer of the resulting fragments into final products are highly appealing, particularly in multi-component reactions for the synthesis of structurally complex molecules.

A central challenge has been to develop brighter, more specific and high-affinity aptamer–ligand systems for cellular imaging. Here we report an ultrabright fluorophore for the Mango II system discovered using a structure-informed, fragment-based small-molecule microarray approach. This dye—termed SALAD1 (structure-informed, array-enabled LigAnD 1)—exhibits subnanomolar aptamer affinity and 3.5-fold brighter fluorescence than Mango II-TO1–biotin pair, a widely used fluorogenic system. Performance was improved by modulating RNA-dye molecular recognition without altering the fluorophore’s π-system. High-resolution X-ray structures reveal the binding mode for SALAD1, which exhibits improved pocket occupancy, a more defined binding pose and a unique bonding interaction with potassium. SALAD1 is cell-permeable and facilitates improved in-cell confocal RNA imaging. This work introduces an additional RNA-activated fluorophore demonstrating how fragment-based ligand discovery can be used to create high-performance ligands for RNA targets. Fluorogenic RNA aptamers such as Mango are powerful tools for RNA imaging.

  abstract     = {Information propagation by sequence-specific, template-catalysed molecular assembly is a key process facilitating life’s biochemical complexity, yielding thousands of sequence-defined proteins from only 20 distinct building blocks. However, exploitation of catalytic templating is rare in non-biological contexts, particularly in enzyme-free environments, where even the template-catalysed formation of dimers is challenging. Typically, product inhibition—the tendency of products to bind to templates more strongly than individual monomers—prevents catalytic turnover. Here we present a rationally designed enzyme-free system in which a DNA template catalyses, with weak product inhibition, the production of sequence-specific DNA dimers. We demonstrate selective templating of nine different dimers with high specificity and catalytic turnover, then we show that the products can participate in downstream reactions, and finally that the dimerization can be coupled to covalent bond formation. Most importantly, our mechanism demonstrates a design principle for constructing synthetic molecular templating systems, a first step towards applying this powerful motif in non-biological contexts to construct many complex molecules and materials from a small number of building blocks. Information-bearing templates that catalyse the assembly of complex macromolecules are a central motif of natural biochemistry, but their power remains largely unexplored in synthetic contexts. Enzyme-free templating of DNA dimerization has now been demonstrated, using DNA nanotechnology to ensure that the templates are effective information-propagating catalysts.},

Here we show that tuning the structure of interfacial water using highly concentrated NaClO4 electrolytes enhances CO electroreduction to C2H4. Increasing the NaClO4 concentration from 0.01 to 10 molal increased the CO reduction rate 18-fold, achieving a Faradaic efficiency of 91% for multi-carbon products at −1.43 V versus the normal hydrogen electrode. Temperature-dependent CO reduction, combined with surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy, revealed that changes in the interfacial H2O structure correspond to variations in the apparent activation enthalpy and entropy for the reduction of CO to C2H4. At higher ionic strength, increases in activation entropy were linked to disrupted hydrogen bonding and the emergence of non-hydrogen-bonded water modes, suggesting that disordered interfacial H2O layers facilitate CO reduction to C2H4. These findings offer valuable insights into how manipulating the structure of interfacial water can enhance the reduction of CO to multi-carbon products. The structure of interfacial water plays a key role in the electrochemical reduction of CO to multi-carbon products on copper electrodes. Now it is shown that highly concentrated electrolytes modulate the structure of interfacial water and can increase the apparent activation entropy, thus altering reaction kinetics and selectivity.},

However, present efforts achieve only methylamine selectivities below 10% due to the ineffective N–O bond activation of the N-methylhydroxylamine intermediate. Here we design a copper electrocatalyst with abundant low-coordination sites to enable the conversion of nitromethane to methylamine with 99% selectivity and 97% Faradaic efficiency at a low potential. The low-coordination copper sites induce a large dipole moment upon N-methylhydroxylamine adsorption to promote N‒O hydrogenolysis. Altering the pH changes the rate-determining step, resulting in a pH-dependent volcano trend for methylamine production. We demonstrate ampere-level production of 1.5 mol of methylamine alongside easy product purification, gram-scale synthesis of deuterated methylamine and drugs, and hydrogenolysis of other N‒O bonds. This work offers a promising, general approach to alkyl N–O bond hydrogenolysis that could compete with traditional thermochemical routines. Nitromethane electroreduction offers a sustainable route for methylamine synthesis, but poor N–O activation yields low selectivity. Now N-methylhydroxylamine adsorption on low-coordination copper has been shown to induce a large dipole moment and promote N–O bond cleavage. This strategy can be generalized for the hydrogenolysis of other N(alkyl)–O molecules.},

  abstract     = {RNA replication is considered a key process in the origins of life. However, both enzymatic and non-enzymatic RNA replication cycles are impeded by the ‘strand separation problem’, a form of product inhibition arising from the extraordinary stability of RNA duplexes and their rapid reannealing kinetics. Here we show that RNA trinucleotide triphosphates can overcome this problem by binding to and kinetically trapping dissociated RNA strands in a single-stranded form, while simultaneously serving as substrates for replication by an RNA polymerase ribozyme. When combined with coupled pH and freeze–thaw cycles, this enabled exponential replication of both (+) and (−) strands of double-stranded RNAs, including a fragment of the ribozyme itself. Subjecting random RNA sequence pools to open-ended replication yielded either defined replicating RNA sequences or the gradual emergence of diverse sequence pools. The latter derived from partial ribozyme self-replication alongside generation of new RNA sequences, and their composition drifted towards hypothesized primordial codons. These results unlock broader opportunities to model primordial RNA replication. Models of abiotic RNA replication suffer from inherent product inhibition arising from the high stability of RNA duplexes. Now, it has been shown that RNA trinucleotide substrates undergoing simple physicochemical cycles can overcome this problem, enabling open-ended replication of defined and random RNA sequences by a polymerase ribozyme.},

The presence of two or multiple stereogenic centres in one monomer offers a new dimension to fine-tune the polymer performance. However, it is still a formidable challenge in synthetic polymer chemistry to achieve precise stereocontrol and sequence control over the polymer microstructure. Here we report a stereo- and sequence-controlled polymerization of 5H-1,4-benzodioxepin-3(2H)-one-based monomers with two stereogenic centres (M) to furnish a series of isoenriched AB diblock polymers P(cis-M)-b-P(trans-M) and ABA triblock polymers P(trans-M)-b-P(cis-M)-b-P(trans-M). Notably, P(cis-M2)900-b-P(trans-M2)38 delivered impressive toughness and ductility, comparable to the commodity plastic isotactic polypropylene; the ABA triblock P(trans-M2)26-b-P(cis-M2)900-b-P(trans-M2)26 appeared to be softer and resembled low-density polyethylene. These various materials could fully convert to the monomer M. The establishment of stereo- and sequence-controlled polymerization not only provides an effective and robust strategy to tailor polymer properties on the molecular level, but also delivers various chemically recyclable materials that can be converted back to monomers. Achieving precise stereocontrol and sequence control over polymer microstructure is a formidable challenge in synthetic polymer chemistry. Catalyst modification has now enabled the stereo- and sequence-controlled polymerization of BDPO-based monomers (M) to afford isoenriched block polymers P(cis-M)-b-P(trans-M), which have tunable properties and can be converted back to monomers.},

However, the substrate selectivity and catalytic stereoselectivity of α-hydroxy-β-keto acid synthases are poorly understood, greatly hindering their synthetic application in generating diverse carbon frameworks. We here report the discovery of two new α-hydroxy-β-keto acid synthases CsmA and BbmA, which show different substrate selectivities in catalysing carbon–carbon coupling reactions between two β-keto acids. Four crystal structures of CsmA or BbmA complexed with thiamine diphosphate and their substrates were determined, clearly revealing their structural bases of substrate selectivity and catalytic stereoselectivity. Substrate scope expansion enables us to generate 120 α-hydroxy-β-keto acids together with 240 NaBH4-reduction products. Furthermore, we applied CsmA and BbmA into enzymatic total synthesis, generating 36 γ-butyrolactone-containing furanolides. These results provide new structural insights into the catalyses of α-hydroxy-β-keto acid synthases and highlight their great potential in carboligation catalysis and synthetic applications. Some thiamine diphosphate-dependent enzymes are powerful biocatalysts, forming carbon–carbon bonds between two α-keto acids, but their catalytic properties have been poorly understood. Now the substrate selectivity and catalytic stereoselectivity of two representative enzymes, CsmA and BbmA, have been fully characterized.

  abstract     = {Molecular nanographenes (NGs) are nanoscale graphene fragments obtained by organic synthetic protocols. Here we report the bottom-up synthesis of two spiro-NGs formed by two substituted hexa-peri-hexabenzocoronenes (HBCs), spiro-NG and F-spiro-NG. The X-ray crystal structure of the deca-tert-butyl-functionalized spiro-NG shows a bilayer disposition of the HBCs in face-to-face contact. By contrast, F-spiro-NG, which features tert-butyl substituents on one HBC unit, and fluorine on the other HBC unit, is an electron donor–acceptor bilayer NG. The structural assembly of the donor and acceptor graphenic layers enables an electron-transfer process that leads to the formation of a zwitterionic open shell, paramagnetic species constituted by a radical cation and a radical anion located in the donor and the acceptor HBCs, respectively. Magnetic and spectroelectrochemical experiments, together with theoretical calculations, support the persistent/dominant charge-separated nature of F-spiro-NG. Furthermore, photoconductivity measurements show a significant increase of the charge carrier mobility in the case of F-spiro-NG (Σμ = 6 cm2 V−1 s−1) compared with spiro-NG. Non-planar nanographenes are materials with promising prospects for chiroptical and optoelectronic applications. Now bilayer molecular nanographenes composed of two hexa-peri-haxabenzocoronene units linked by a spirocycle have been synthesized. Modulation of the electronic properties of one of the benzocoronene units enables an electron-transfer process between the donor and acceptor moieties, leading to the formation of zwitterionic open-shell bilayer spironanographenes.},

However, current commercial production methods depend largely on gas- or solution-phase processes involving sophisticated initiators, catalysts and additives that require additional purification and cost. Here we introduce an ultraclean photo-melt-bulk polymerization strategy that enables the precise synthesis of high-molecular-weight polydienes without the need for solvents, catalysts or initiators. Using UV irradiation, we can generate long-lived biradicals in muconate derivatives that facilitate controlled chain propagation with minimal termination. This approach also simplifies the synthesis of ABA triblock co-polymers and allows for efficient random co-polymerization, yielding a plastic with excellent mechanical properties and processability. Furthermore, the inherently weaker carbon–carbon bonds in these polymers allow for facile depolymerization into monomers with high yields, providing an efficient pathway for chemical recycling. This work highlights a simple, yet effective polymerization method that aligns with the principles of green chemistry and advances the development of recyclable polymeric materials. Polydienes are essential in industry but rely on a complex synthesis involving catalysts and solvents. Now it is shown that photo-melt-bulk polymerization enables the solvent- and catalyst-free synthesis of controlled high-molecular-weight polydienes by combining chain growth and the coupling of stable biradicals, advancing sustainable materials development.},

  abstract     = {The development of [2 + 2] cyclases containing benzophenone triplet sensitizers highlights the potential of engineered enzymes as a platform for stereocontrolled energy transfer photocatalysis. However, the suboptimal photophysical features of benzophenone necessitates the use of ultraviolet light, limits photochemical efficiency and restricts the range of chemistries accessible. Here we engineer an orthogonal Methanococcus jannaschii tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase/tRNA pair for encoding thioxanthone triplet sensitizers into proteins, which can efficiently harness visible light to drive photochemical conversions. Initially, we developed an enantioselective [2 + 2] cyclase that is orders of magnitude more efficient than our previously developed photoenzymes (kcat = 13 s−1, &gt;1,300 turnovers). To demonstrate that thioxanthone-containing enzymes can enable more challenging photochemical conversions, we developed a second oxygen-tolerant enzyme that can steer selective C–H insertions of excited quinolone substrates to afford spirocyclic β-lactams with high selectivity (99% e.e., 22:1 d.r.). This photoenzyme also suppresses a competing substrate decomposition pathway observed with small-molecule sensitizers, underscoring the ability of engineered enzymes to control the fate of excited-state intermediates. Recent studies have shown that energy transfer photoenzymes can be engineered to promote stereocontrolled [2 + 2] cycloadditions; however, existing systems rely on ultraviolet light and display limited photochemical efficiencies. A generation of thioxanthone-containing photoenzymes now harnesses visible light to drive challenging photochemical conversions with high efficiencies and selectivities.},

However, these reactions are extremely sensitive to moisture and oxygen, require the use of highly purified reagents, must be run at low temperatures, and use hazardous and difficult-to-handle alkyl lithium initiators. Together, these drawbacks limit the practicality of these polymerizations and impede their widespread usage. On this basis, the development of a user-friendly anionic polymerization process for methacrylates is a grand challenge. Here we report an anionic polymerization of methacrylates mediated by CO2 that can be run at elevated temperatures and uses an easy-to-handle solid initiator. The reversible addition of CO2 to the enolate chain end efficiently tempers the reactivity of the anion, giving polymers with narrow molar mass distributions and excellent molecular weight targeting at elevated temperatures. Our scalable and more user-friendly CO2-mediated method improves the accessibility and safety of anionic polymerizations and facilitates the production of a variety of polymeric materials. Dangerous initiators and low reaction temperatures required for controlled anionic polymerization limit its widespread implementation. Now it has been shown that safe-to-handle, solid, CO2-protected initiators allow for a one-pot polymerization set-up.

  abstract     = {Selective formation of multicomponent structures via the self-assembly of numerous building blocks is ubiquitous in biological systems but challenging to emulate synthetically. More components introduce additional possibilities for kinetic intermediates with trap-state ability, hampering access to desired products. In covalent chemistry, templates, reagents and catalysts are applied to create alternative pathways for desired product formation. Analogously, we enlist exo-templating to mould the formation of large, multicomponent supramolecular structures. Specifically, a charged ring docks at 1,5-dioxynaphthalene stations within exo-functionalized building blocks to promote formation of cuboctahedral Pd12L24 nanospheres via exoskeletal templating. With the exo-templating ring present, nanosphere formation occurs via small Pdx–Ly oligomers, while in the absence of the ring a Pdx–Ly polymer resting state rapidly evolves, from which nanosphere formation occurs slowly. We demonstrate a form of kinetic templating—via intermediate destabilization—resembling properties observed in catalysis. Importantly, unlike typically employed endo-templates, we demonstrate that exo-templating is particularly suited for larger, complex, self-assembled structures. Non-covalent and covalent chemistry can be controlled by using synthetic tools, such as templates. However, selective multicomponent self-assembly remains challenging because of the many kinetic intermediates with trap-state abilities, hampering access to desired products. Now exo-templating via pseudorotaxane formation has been shown to reduce pathway complexity in the multicomponent self-assembly of M12L24 nanospheres.},

Despite its importance in synthetic chemistry, naturally occurring enzymatic HDA reactions are rare and limited to a single heteroatom. Here we report Abx(−)F, a bifunctional vicinal oxygen chelate (VOC)-like protein that catalyses dehydration and dual-oxa Diels–Alder reactions to stereoselectively form the oxygen-bridged tricyclic acetal of (–)-anthrabenzoxocinone ((−)-ABX).

The crystal structure of Abx(−)F and NMR complex structures of Abx(−)F with its substrate analogue and (−)-ABX define the reaction’s structural basis. Mutational analysis identifies Asp17 as a general base that mediates dehydration, forming an o-quinone methide intermediate for stereoselective dual-oxa HDA. This work establishes the molecular and structural basis of a polyheteroatomic Diels–Alderase, paving the way for designing polyheteroatomic DA enzymatic tools. The hetero-Diels–Alder reaction is a powerful strategy for constructing six-membered heterocycles, yet natural enzymatic hetero-Diels–Alder reactions are limited to a single heteroatom.

Strong π-accepting ligands have been shown to stabilize molecular complexes with TMs in formal negative oxidation states. By contrast, organic-ligand-free TM anions remain rare, limited to intermetallic compounds based on third-row TMs such as gold or platinum. Here we report the synthesis of air-stable lanthanide–nickel molecular intermetallic complexes featuring a ligand-free Ni2− confined within fullerenes, namely, Tb2Ni@C82. The charged Tb2Ni lanthanide nickelide cluster forms metal-only Lewis pairs, featuring strongly polarized Tb–Ni covalent bonds with short bond lengths in the range of 2.50–2.57 Å. X-ray absorption spectroscopy supports the −2 oxidation state of Ni with 3d104s2 electron count, in line with the spectroscopic and magnetic measurements, and theoretical study. This finding opens up an efficient way to stabilize intermetallic clusters with elusive nucleophilic TM anions by confining them inside molecular carbon cages. Although transition metal-based complexes featuring metal atoms in formally negative oxidation states are known, their stabilization without an organic ligand remains challenging.

  abstract     = {The deamination reaction is important to both fundamental organic chemistry and biochemistry. Traditional chemical methods of deamination rely on the use of aryldiazonium salts under harsh acidic conditions, which limits the application scope for most biological substrates. Here we present an N-nitrosation strategy for deamination under mild conditions that DNA and RNA biological macromolecules can tolerate. Cooperative catalysis combining a carbonyl organocatalyst with a Lewis acid catalyst facilitates the formation of a carbon–nitro intermediate from a primary amine, which, on rearrangement into N-nitrosamine, leads to the selective deamination of unsubstituted canonical DNA/RNA bases under mild conditions. We used this approach to deaminate adenine into hypoxanthine, read as guanine by reverse transcriptases or DNA polymerases, while N6-methyladenosine sites resist deamination and remain identified as adenine. This reactivity enables a chemically mild, low-input detection method for sequencing of adenosine methylation at base resolution, named chemical cooperative catalysis-assisted N6-methyladenosine sequencing. Nucleobase deamination can be used to map N6-methyladenosine in RNA, but existing deamination methods are harsh, limiting applications. Now a method for the N-nitrosation of RNA based on organocatalyst and Lewis acid co-catalysis has been shown to enable sensitive N6-methyladenosine mapping with minimal background noise and high detection efficiency.},

  abstract     = {Quantum-confined nanoclusters can be described by the jellium model, which emphasizes closed-shell electron configurations, but an open-shell variation with jellium aromaticity has been proposed. Such clusters are termed superatoms because they behave like an atom, and they exhibit unusual properties. Superatoms feature metal–metal bonding; hence, since their discovery 40 years ago, superatoms have exclusively involved main group or transition metals, with actinides only considered computationally as dopants owing to actinide–actinide bonding being exceedingly rare. Here we report trithorium nanoclusters exhibiting three-centre-one-electron actinide–actinide bonding. Experimental and computational analysis demonstrates Robin–Day Class III 6d-orbital valence delocalization in these clusters. These S = 1/2 clusters are paramagnetic, but in external applied magnetic fields they exhibit exalted diamagnetism, evidencing actinide open-shell jellium aromaticity superatom character. Exalted diamagnetism is not normally associated with a single unpaired electron, but with a 1S1 magic number, the valence delocalization enables exalted diamagnetism, which is aromaticity, via superatom ring currents. Superatoms are metal clusters that collectively behave like an atom, but they usually require metal–metal bonding and thus they are based on main group or transition metals. Now it has been shown that trithorium nanoclusters with delocalized three-centre-one-electron thorium–thorium bonding exhibit exalted diamagnetism. This unveils actinide superatoms that exhibit open-shell jellium aromaticity.},

Here we introduce ChemBench, an automated framework for evaluating the chemical knowledge and reasoning abilities of state-of-the-art LLMs against the expertise of chemists. We curated more than 2,700 question–answer pairs, evaluated leading open- and closed-source LLMs and found that the best models, on average, outperformed the best human chemists in our study. However, the models struggle with some basic tasks and provide overconfident predictions. These findings reveal LLMs’ impressive chemical capabilities while emphasizing the need for further research to improve their safety and usefulness. They also suggest adapting chemistry education and show the value of benchmarking frameworks for evaluating LLMs in specific domains. Large language models are increasingly used for diverse tasks, yet we have limited insight into their understanding of chemistry. Now ChemBench—a benchmarking framework containing more than 2,700 question–answer pairs—has been developed to assess their chemical knowledge and reasoning, revealing that the best models surpass human chemists on average but struggle with some basic tasks.},

Through a series of heterologous biosynthesis, functional genetics and enzymatic reconstitution experiments, we show that this previously described synthetic functional group is biologically assembled by a set of enzymes from both primary and secondary metabolism, including a flavin-dependent S-hydroxylase that hydroxylates the sulfur atom of a thiocarboxylic acid. Although public databases so far include no parallel for the sulfenicin biosynthetic gene cluster, enzymes catalysing the production of acylsulfenic acid are widely distributed in bacterial genomes, implying that this labile functional group may similarly have a broad distribution among specialized metabolites.

Here we report the low-temperature synthesis and characterization of a molecular praseodymium complex in the formal +5 oxidation state, [Pr5+(NPtBu3)4][X−] (where tBu = tert-butyl and X− = tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)borate or hexafluorophosphate).

An inverted ligand field drives this unique electronic structure, which establishes a critical link in understanding the bonding of high-valent metal complexes across the periodic table. The most common oxidation state for lanthanide elements is +3, and, beyond cerium, examples of these elements exhibiting higher oxidation states remain scarce.

In particular, proteins use hydration frustration—control over the dehydration of hydrophilic residues and the hydration of hydrophobic residues—to amplify their chemical or binding activity. Here we uncover that single-polymer-chain nanoparticles formed by random heteropolymers comprising four or more components can display similar levels of hydration frustration. We categorize these nanoparticles into three types based on whether either hydrophobic or hydrophilic residues, or both types, display frustrated states. We propose a series of physicochemical rules that determine the state of these nanoparticles. We demonstrate the generality of these rules in atomistic and simplified Monte Carlo models of single-polymer-chain nanoparticles with different backbones and residues. Our work provides insights into the design of single-chain nanoparticles, an emerging polymer modality that achieves the ease and cost of fabrication of polymeric material with the functionality of biological proteins. Native proteins use hydration frustration—regulating the dehydration of hydrophilic residues and the hydration of hydrophobic residues—to enhance their activity. Now it has been shown that single-polymer-chain nanoparticles made from random heteropolymers can exhibit similar hydration frustration, following design rules orthogonal to those of proteins.},

By leveraging the inherently porous structure and surface chemistry of metal–organic frameworks, we demonstrated the ability to regulate biomolecular organization within the protocells and integrate proteins into the membrane, thereby imitating both integral and peripheral membrane proteins. These membranized coacervates were further engineered into artificial-organelle-incorporated protocells and tissue-like assemblies capable of signal processing and protocell-to-protocell communication. Our findings highlight the potential of designing artificial systems with spatially controlled biomolecular organization to mimic natural cellular functions, paving the way for the assembly of membranized coacervates into prototissues. Building protocells with intricate cellular organization and cell–cell interactions is a crucial step in attempts to replicate cytomimetic functions. Now it has been shown that interfacial assembly of porous metal–organic frameworks on protocell coacervates facilitates complex biomolecular organization, regulated protocell communications and structured protocell assembly.},

  abstract     = {Metal–ligand bonding interactions for f-element compounds are typically highly polarized with only minor covalent character. Whereas the 5d/6d orbitals are known to be chemically accessible for dative bonding, recent quantum chemical and spectroscopic analyses have indicated appreciable 4f/5f-orbital involvement in certain metal–ligand bonds. However, 4f-orbital covalency has not been compellingly linked to distinctive modes of chemical reactivity via rigorous comparative study and mechanistic investigation. Here a series of MIV–cyclopropenyl complexes (M = Ti, Zr, Ce, Hf, Th) are described, wherein the cerium congener exhibits a 4f-covalent Ce=Cα interaction, causing a ring-opening isomerization reaction through a single-crystal-to-single-crystal transformation. The results provide evidence for 4f-orbital covalency by demonstrating its expression in the reactivity of an f-element complex within an isostructural series of tetravalent d- and f-block metal complexes. They also provide new directions for the study of orbital covalency effects of molecular compounds in solid-state chemical transformations. Computational and spectroscopic studies of molecular lanthanide complexes have implicated 4f orbitals in metal–ligand bonding interactions. Now, a comparative study of isostructural d-block, actinide and lanthanide complexes has shown that 4f-orbital covalency enables ring-opening isomerization in a Ce(IV)–cyclopropenyl complex in the solid state, a reaction not observed for the other complexes studied.},

However, controllable methods for chemically divergent modifications of azaarene frameworks using common substrates are challenging, despite the potential to maximize structural diversity and complexity. Here we report the tunable skeletal editing of quinolines through Brønsted acid-catalysed multicomponent reactions of quinoline N-oxides, dialkyl acetylenedicarboxylates and water to generate nitrogen-containing heteroaromatic compounds together with linear compounds in a modular fashion. Specifically, in a one-pot procedure, after cyclization and sequential rearrangement processes, the quinoline N-oxides are easily converted into unique 2-substituted indolines. These then undergo acid-promoted fragmentation to give indoles, base-facilitated ring-opening to afford 2-alkenylanilines and oxidative cyclization to yield isoquinolinones. Catalytic asymmetric skeletal editing of quinolines is also realized, providing enantioenriched benzazepines bearing quaternary stereocentres, and late-stage skeletal modification of quinoline cores in several drugs is demonstrated. Switchable skeletal editing is valuable in drug discovery, but controllable methods for chemodivergent modifications of azaarenes are challenging. Now transformations of quinolines have been achieved by leveraging cyclizative rearrangement strategies, enabling the construction of four different frameworks, including the enantioselective skeletal editing of quinolines into benzazepines.},

  abstract     = {Synthetic organic chemists continually draw inspiration from biocatalytic processes to innovate synthetic methodologies beyond existing catalytic platforms. Within this context, although 1,2-amino migration represents a viable biochemical process, it remains underutilized within the synthetic organic chemistry community. Here we present a biomimetic 1,2-amino migration accomplished through the synergistic combination of biocatalytic mechanism and photoredox catalysis. This platform enables the modular synthesis of γ-substituted β-amino acids by utilizing abundant α-amino-acid derivatives and readily available organic molecules as coupling partners. This mild method features excellent substrate and functionality compatibility, affording a diverse range of γ-substituted β-amino acids (more than 80 examples) without the need for laborious multistep synthesis. Mechanistic studies, supported by both experimental observations and theoretical analysis, indicate that the 1,2-amino migration mechanism involves radical addition to α-vinyl-aldimine ester, 3-exo-trig cyclization and a subsequent rearrangement process. We anticipate that this transformation will serve as a versatile platform for the highly efficient construction of unnatural γ-substituted β-amino acids. Enzyme-catalysed 1,2-amino migration represents a viable biochemical process that is currently underutilized within the synthetic organic chemistry community. Building upon this biocatalytic mechanism, a biomimetic photoredox-catalysed 1,2-amino migration method has been developed. By integrating photoredox-catalysed conditions, this approach enables the modular synthesis of a diverse library of γ-substituted β-amino acids.},

  abstract     = {Nucleophilic substitution at tetravalent (sp3) carbon is a fundamental transformation in organic synthesis, essential for creating carbon–carbon and carbon–heteroatom bonds. While the mechanism of the SN2 reaction is well understood, achieving stereochemical control in SN1-type reactions remains extremely challenging due to the complexity of successive carbocation intermediates. Here we present a strategy for preparing complex molecular skeletons via stereospecific SN1 at a quaternary stereocentre in acyclic systems. By leveraging neighbouring group participation, we facilitate the selective formation of a unique cyclopropylcarbinyl cation intermediate that undergoes selective nucleophilic substitution with high diastereoselectivity and complete inversion of configuration at a distant position from the original carbocation via molecular rearrangement. This methodology has been applied to generate homoallylic tertiary fluorides, bromides, chlorides, ethers, thiocyanates and azides, demonstrating its applicability in accessing diverse functional groups with exceptional diastereoselectivities. This transformation opens new avenues for constructing complex molecular architectures through precise stereocontrol of C–C bond cleavage at a quaternary stereocentre in acyclic systems. Achieving stereochemical control in SN1-type nucleophilic substitution reactions is challenging due to the complexity of the successive carbocation intermediates. Now a strategy using neighbouring group participation to form cyclopropylcarbinyl cations enables the preparation of complex molecular skeletons via stereospecific SN1 at a quaternary stereocentre in acyclic systems.},

  abstract     = {In the traditional view, spin pairing occurs between two electrons in a chemical bond where the bonding interaction compensates for the penalty of electrostatic repulsion. It is a mystery whether spin pairing can occur between two non-bonded electrons within a molecular entity. Unveiling this type of spin entanglement (that is, pairing between two spatially segregated spins) at the molecular scale is a long-standing challenge. Clar’s goblet, proposed by Erich Clar in 1972, provides an ideal platform to verify this unusual property. Here we report the solution-phase synthesis of Clar’s goblet and experimental elucidation of its spin properties. Magnetic studies reveal that the two spins are spatially segregated with an average distance of 8.7 Å and antiferromagnetically coupled in the ground state with an ΔES–T of −0.29 kcal mol−1. Our results provide insight into the spin entanglement in Clar’s goblet and may inspire the design of correlated molecular spins for quantum information technologies. In 1972, Erich Clar envisioned Clar’s goblet, a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon featuring two unpaired electrons that are spin-paired. However, synthesizing it in a solution phase remains challenging. Now a derivative of Clar’s goblet has been prepared in solution, and spin entanglement at the molecular scale has been demonstrated experimentally.},

  abstract     = {Membranization of membraneless coacervates and condensates is emerging as a promising strategy to resolve their inherent susceptibility to fusion, ripening and environmental variations. Yet current membranization agents by design are largely limited to a subclass or a specific kind of coacervate or condensate systems. Here we develop a library of condensate-amphiphilic block polymers that can efficiently form a polymeric layer on the droplet interface for a wide spectrum of synthetic coacervates and biomolecular condensates. Condensate-amphiphilic block polymers are designed with a condenophilic block firmly anchored to the condensed phase, a condenophobic block extended to the dilute phase and a self-association block to promote membrane formation. Critical to our design is the condenophilic block of phenylboronic acid and amidoamine that target the disparate chemistry of condensed droplets via multivalent affinities. The condensate-amphiphilic block polymer membranes render the droplets mechanically robust against fusion, regulate interfacial properties such as permeability and stiffness, and substantially improve droplet tolerance to challenging conditions of temperature, salinity, pH and organic solvents. Membranization of membraneless coacervates and condensates offers a solution to their inherent instability, but current strategies are system specific. Now, it has been shown that condensate-amphiphilic block polymers provide robust and versatile membranization for a wide range of coacervates and condensates, substantially enhancing their mechanical stability and tolerance to extreme conditions.},

  abstract     = {Methyltransferases are a broad class of enzymes that catalyse the transfer of methyl groups onto a wide variety of substrates and functionalities. In their most striking variant, bifunctional methyltransferase–cyclases both transfer a methyl group onto alkenes and induce cyclization (methylcyclization). Although recent years have seen substantial advances in the methylation of alkenes, especially hydromethylation, the reactivity demonstrated by bifunctional methyltransferase–cyclases in nature has yet to be developed into a synthetically viable method. Here we report a silver(I)-mediated electrophilic methylcyclization that rivals selectivities found in enzymes while not being limited by their inherent substrate specificity. Our method benefits from the use of commercial reagents, is applicable to a wide range of substrates, including heterocycles, and affords unique structures that are difficult to access via conventional synthetic methods. Furthermore, computational studies have been utilized to unravel the underlying mechanism and ultimately support a stepwise cationic reaction pathway with a rate-limiting methyltransfer. Bifunctional methyltransferase–cyclases both transfer a methyl group to alkenes and induce cyclization—a process called methylcyclization. Now a non-enzymatic silver(I)-mediated electrophilic methylcyclization has been reported.

  abstract     = {Criegee intermediates are highly reactive species that play a pivotal role in the chemistry of the atmosphere, substantially impacting global climate and air quality. They are formed through the reaction of ozone with alkenes and considerably influence the formation of hydroxyl radicals and aerosols through their unimolecular decomposition and their reaction with key atmospheric components, respectively. However, their interaction with water vapour, a major atmospheric component, remains inadequately characterized. Here, using both time-dependent laser-induced fluorescence experiments and full-dimensional dynamics calculations, we investigate the reaction of syn-CH3CHOO, a prevalent Criegee intermediate, with water vapour. Our results reveal a much higher reaction rate than previously estimated, challenging the conventional notion that unimolecular decomposition dominates syn-CH3CHOO removal. Notably, we uncover a complex mechanism involving a roaming process that enhances reactivity. Our findings necessitate a revised assessment of reactions involving syn-mono- and di-substituted Criegee intermediates with water, which are crucial for accurately estimating the OH budget derived from these intermediates. The reaction between Criegee intermediates and water vapour greatly impacts atmospheric chemistry and climate, yet its dynamics remain poorly understood. Now it has been shown that syn-CH3CHOO reacts with water vapour at rates much higher than previously estimated, through a roaming mechanism that enhances reactivity and challenges conventional understanding of atmospheric OH radical production.},

  abstract     = {Propane dehydrogenation is an energy-intensive industrial reaction that requires high temperatures (550–750 °C) to overcome thermodynamic barriers. Here we overcome these limits and demonstrate that near-ambient propane dehydrogenation can be achieved through photo-thermo-catalysis in a water-vapour environment. We reduce the reaction temperature to 50–80 °C using a single-atom catalyst of copper supported on TiO2 and a continuous-flow fixed-bed reactor. The mechanism differs from conventional propane dehydrogenation in that hydrogen is produced from the photocatalytic splitting of water vapour, surface-bound hydroxyl radicals extract propane hydrogen atoms to form propylene without over-oxidation, and water serves as a catalyst. This route also works for the dehydrogenation of other small alkanes. Moreover, we demonstrate sunlight-driven water-catalysed propane dehydrogenation operating at reaction temperatures as low as 10 °C. We anticipate that this work will be a starting point for integrating solar energy usage into a wide range of high-temperature industrial reactions. Propane dehydrogenation is challenging to perform under mild conditions due to the reaction’s endothermic nature. Now, near-ambient propane dehydrogenation has been shown using copper single-atom catalysts supported on titanium oxide under light illumination and a water vapour environment.},

We wondered whether other biomolecules (such as glycans) could be designed to perform catalytic functions, expanding the portfolio of synthetic functional oligomers. Here we report a glycan foldamer inspired by the natural Sialyl Lewis X antigen that acts as catalyst in a chemical reaction. This glycan-based catalyst benefits from structural rigidity and modular adaptability, incorporating a substrate-recognition motif alongside a catalytic active site. Leveraging the inherent ability of carbohydrates to engage in CH–π interactions with aromatic substrates, we demonstrate the recruitment and functionalization of a tryptophan via a Pictet–Spengler transformation. Our modular glycan catalyst accelerates the reaction kinetics, enabling the modification of tryptophan-containing peptides in aqueous environments. Our findings pave the way for the development of glycan-based catalysts and suggest the possibility of catalytic capabilities of glycans in biological contexts.

Here we present the development of a cell-permeable small-molecule DNA G-quadruplex (G4) binder, termed G4switch, that can be reversibly toggled on and off by visible light. We have biophysically characterized the light-mediated control of G4 binding in vitro, followed by cellular, genomic mapping of G4switch to G4 targets in chromatin to confirm G4-selective, light-dependent binding in a cellular context. By deploying G4switch in living cells, we show spatiotemporal control over the expression of a set of G4-containing genes and G4-associated cell proliferation. Our studies demonstrate a chemical tool and approach to interrogate the dynamics of key biological processes directly at the molecular level in cells. Dynamic gene expression is crucial for coordinating diverse cellular activities, but challenging to modulate with high spatiotemporal precision.

  abstract     = {Tauopathies are a class of neurodegenerative disorders that feature tau protein aggregates in the brain. Misfolded tau has the capacity to seed the fibrillization of soluble tau, leading to the prion-like spread of aggregates. Within these filaments, tau protomers always exhibit a cross-β amyloid structure. However, distinct cross-β amyloid folds correlate with specific diseases. An understanding of how these conformations impact seeding activity remains elusive. Identifying the minimal epitopes required for transcellular propagation of tau aggregates represents a key step towards more relevant models of disease progression. Here we implement a diversity-oriented peptide macrocyclization approach towards miniature tau, or ‘mini-tau’, proteomimetics that can seed the aggregation of tau in engineered cells and primary neurons. Structural elucidation of one such seed-competent macrocycle reveals remarkable conformational congruence with core folds from patient-derived extracts of tau. The ability to impart β-arch form and function through peptide stapling has broad-ranging implications for the minimization and mimicry of pathological tau and other amyloid proteins that drive neurodegeneration. Molecules that recapitulate the structure and prion-like activity of misfolded tau hold promise as more relevant models of pathological tau propagation. Now, the macrocyclization of short tau fragments affords proteomimetics that seed tau aggregation in cells and adopt a β-arch conformation resembling those found in filaments from patient-derived extracts.},

  abstract     = {Transition metal oxides often undergo dynamic surface reconstruction under oxygen evolution reaction conditions to form the active state, which differs in response to the electrolyte pH. The resulting pH dependency of catalytic activity is commonly observed but poorly understood. Herein we track Co oxidation state changes at different pH-directed (hydr)oxide/electrolyte interfaces using operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy characterizations. Combined with in situ electrochemical analyses, we establish correlations between Co redox dynamics, the flat band potential and Co oxidation state changes to explain the pH dependency of the oxygen evolution activity. Alkaline environments provide a low flat band potential that yields a low-potential Co redox transformation, which favours surface reconstruction. Neutral and acidic environments afford an anodic shift of the Co redox transformation that increases the catalytic overpotential. The larger overpotential in neutral environments is attributable to poor Co atom polarizability and slow Co oxidation state changes. These findings reveal that interfacial Co oxidation state changes directly determine the pH dependency of the oxygen evolution reaction activity. Transition metal oxides serve as important electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction, although Co-based oxides typically undergo pH-dependent dynamic surface reconstruction under catalytic conditions. Now the correlations between Co redox dynamics, flat band potential and Co oxidation state changes have been established to explain the pH dependency of oxygen evolution activity.},

Concerted proton-electron transfer (CPET) can provide kinetic advantages over stepwise processes (electron transfer (ET)/proton transfer (PT) or PT/ET), so understanding how to distinguish and modulate these processes is important for their associated applications. Here, we examined PCET from the excited state of a ruthenium complex under high pressures. At lower buffer or quencher concentrations, a stepwise PT/ET mechanism was observed. With increasing pressure, PT slowed and ET sped up, indicating a merging of the two steps. In contrast, CPET at higher concentrations of buffer or quencher showed no pressure dependence of the reaction rate. This is because the simultaneous transfer of electrons and protons circumvents changes in charges and, consequently, in solvent electrostriction during the transition state. Our findings demonstrate that pressure can serve as a tool to monitor charge changes along PCET pathways, aiding in the identification of its mechanisms. Chemical energy conversion and storage rely on the selective movement of protons and electrons, thus understanding these processes is important for applications. Now experiments at elevated pressures are shown to identify excited-state proton-coupled electron transfer mechanisms and to facilitate merging proton transfer with subsequent electron transfer steps towards a concerted pathway.},

However, signal attenuation from line broadening caused by fast relaxation and signal overlap often limits the application of NMR to large macromolecular systems. Here we leverage the slow relaxation properties of 13C nuclei attached to 19F in aromatic 19F–13C spin pairs as well as the spin–spin coupling between the fluorinated 13C nucleus and the hydrogen atom at the meta-position to record two-dimensional 1H–13CF correlation spectra with transverse relaxation-optimized spectroscopy selection on 13CF. To accomplish this, we synthesized [4-19F13Cζ; 3,5-2H2ε] Phe, engineered for optimal relaxation properties, and adapted a residue-specific route to incorporate this residue globally into proteins and a site-specific 4-19F Phe encoding strategy. This approach resulted in narrow linewidths for proteins ranging from 30 kDa to 180 kDa, enabling interaction studies with small-molecule ligands without requiring specialized 19F-compatible probes. Correlating aromatic carbons attached to fluorine with meta-position hydrogens in fluorine-labelled phenylalanines can yield two-dimensional correlations with narrow linewidths in large proteins. Adapting phenylalanine-tRNA synthetase increases the incorporation rate, while expanding the genetic code enables site-specific incorporation of fluorinated phenylalanine.

However, gold redox chemistry bears the challenge to overcome the high redox potential of Au(I)/Au(III) (1.41 V). The classical strategy of gold redox catalysis applies strong external chemical oxidants which inevitably results in low atom economy and substrate limitations due to incompatibility with functional groups. Here we report a bidentate N-ligand (for example, Phen, Bpy) assisted gold redox catalysis using H2O2 as oxidant, which proved to be generally applicable for many forms of coupling reactions. In addition, C(sp2)–C(sp2) bicyclization coupling (cross-coupling of two cyclized substrates) is accessible under our conditions. Mechanistic studies reveal a redox elimination process in which a bidentate N-ligand is crucial for the catalytic cycle. The formation of alkynyl-AuIII–OH and vinyl-AuIII–OH species is the key process for the synergistic π-bond activation and AuI oxidation. Gold redox catalysis is an attractive synthetic method but challenging due to the high redox potential of Au(I)/Au(III). Now, a bidentate N-ligand-assisted gold redox catalysis using H2O2 as oxidant has been developed.

Here we conducted a systematic comparative metabolomics investigation of drug metabolism modes by evaluating the impacts of human gut commensal bacteria on 127 G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR)-targeted drugs. For the most extensively metabolized drugs in our screen, we elucidated both conventional and unconventional drug transformations and the corresponding activities of generated metabolites. Comparisons of drug metabolism by a gut microbial community versus individual species revealed both taxon intrinsic and collaborative processes that influenced the activity of the metabolized drugs against target GPCRs. We also observed iloperidone inactivation by generating unconventional metabolites. The human gut commensal bacteria mixture incorporated sulfur in the form of a thiophene motif, whereas Morganella morganii used a cascade reaction to incorporate amino-acid-derived tricyclic systems into the drug metabolites. Our results reveal a broad impact of human gut commensal bacteria on GPCR-targeted drug structures and activities through diverse microbiota-mediated biotransformations. Gut microbiota play a critical role in drug metabolism. Now, by exploring the human gut microbial metabolism of G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR)-targeting drugs, uncommon pathways and biotransformations are elucidated, revealing how the activity of the metabolized drugs against target GPCRs is modulated.},

  abstract     = {The plasticity of living cell membranes relies on complex metabolic networks fueled by cellular energy. These metabolic processes exert direct control over membrane properties such as lipid composition and morphological plasticity, which are essential for cellular functions. Despite notable progress in the development of artificial systems mimicking natural membranes, the realization of synthetic membranes capable of sustaining metabolic cycles remains a challenge. Here we present an abiotic phospholipid metabolic network that generates and maintains dynamic artificial cell membranes. Chemical coupling agents drive the in situ synthesis of transiently stable non-canonical phospholipids, leading to the formation and maintenance of phospholipid membranes. We find that phospholipid metabolic cycles can drive lipid self-selection, favouring the enrichment of specific lipid species. Moreover, we demonstrate that controlling lipid metabolism can induce reversible membrane phase transitions, facilitating lipid mixing between distinct populations of artificial membranes. Our work demonstrates that a simple lipid metabolic network can drive dynamic behaviour in artificial membranes, offering insights into mechanisms for engineering functional synthetic compartments. Cell membrane plasticity is governed by metabolic processes that regulate lipid composition and morphology, features that are challenging to control in synthetic systems. Using transiently stable phospholipid mimics, it is now shown that an abiotic phospholipid metabolism can generate and maintain dynamic artificial cell membranes, driving lipid enrichment and membrane phase transitions.},

  abstract     = {The mechanistic understanding of light-driven charge separation and charge-carrier transport within the frameworks of π-conjugated molecules is imperative to mimic natural photosynthesis and derive synthetic materials for solar energy conversion. In this regard, since the late 1980s, the distance and solvent dependence of stepwise (incoherent) charge-carrier hopping versus single-step (coherent) superexchange transport (tunnelling) have been studied in detail. Here we introduce structurally highly defined cofacially stacked donor–acceptor perylene bisimide arrays, which offer a high resemblance to natural systems. Similarity is achieved through controlling energy and electron transfer processes via intermolecular interactions between the π-stacked perylene bisimide subunits. Selective excitation of the donor induces electron transfer to the acceptor unit in polar solvents, facilitated by a ‘through-stack’ wire-like charge hopping mechanism with a low attenuation factor β = 0.21 Å−1, which suggests through-stack as being equally supportive for long-distance sequential electron transfer compared to the investigated ‘through-bond’ transfer along π-conjugated bridges. Understanding the distance dependence and mechanistic behaviour of light-driven charge separation is crucial to advance artificial photosynthesis and solar energy conversion. It has now been shown that donor–bridge–acceptor null-coupled perylene bisimide arrays are good candidates for generating long-lived excitons and display ‘through-stack’ photoinduced electron transfer through pronounced π-orbital overlap.},

However, the mechanisms that regulate the electrochemical equilibrium of condensates and their impacts on emergent physicochemical functions remain unknown. Here we demonstrate that the electrochemical environments and the physical and chemical activities of biomolecular condensates, dependent on the electrochemical potential of condensates, are regulated by aging-associated intermolecular interactions and interfacial effects. Our findings reveal that enhanced dense-phase interactions during condensate maturation continuously modulate the ion distribution between the two phases. Moreover, modulating the interfacial regions of condensates can affect the apparent pH within the condensates. To directly probe the interphase and interfacial electric potentials of condensates, we have designed and implemented electrochemical potentiometry and second harmonic generation-based approaches. Our results suggest that the non-equilibrium nature of biomolecular condensates might play a crucial role in modulating the electrochemical activities of living systems. The mechanisms that regulate the electrochemical equilibrium of condensates are not well understood. Now it has been shown that the aging process of biomolecular condensates can dynamically modulate the electrochemical equilibrium between phases, thereby affecting the physicochemical functions of condensates. This process potentially provides an active mechanism modulating intracellular ion flux.},

While incorporation of comonomers that generate backbone radicals under certain conditions can induce degradation of the polymer chain, such strategies yield complex oligomer mixtures. Here we report aromatization-driven C–C bond cleavage as a viable and powerful strategy to endow the degradability into carbon backbones using acrylic polymers as a model example. The key to this new strategy is the efficient, living, alternating addition copolymerization of acrylates with simple, commercially available and biorenewable coumarin using a frustrated Lewis pair cooperative catalyst. The resulting acrylic copolymers are strong, transparent thermoplastics with key thermal, optical, mechanical properties comparable or superior to poly(methyl methacrylate). Under strong base, alternating copolymers can completely degrade at room temperature through efficient cleavage of main-chain C–C bonds utilizing aromatization as a thermodynamic driving force, to generate pure, pharmaceutically valuable molecules, thus affording durable, robust yet fully degradable carbon-backbone acrylic polymers. Degradation of carbon-backbone polymers, which make up most plastics, remains a formidable challenge owing to their strong and inert main-chain C–C bonds. Now it has been shown that aromatization-driven C–C bond cleavage is a viable strategy to endow full degradability into carbon backbones under mild conditions.},

  abstract     = {1,5-Disubstituted bicyclo[2.1.1]hexanes are bridged scaffolds with well-defined exit vectors that are becoming increasingly popular building blocks in medicinal chemistry because they are saturated bioisosteres of ortho-substituted phenyl rings. Here we have developed a Lewis-acid-catalysed [2 + 2] photocycloaddition to obtain these motifs as enantioenriched scaffolds, providing an efficient approach for their incorporation in a variety of drug analogues. Retention of the biological activity of the bicyclo[2.1.1]hexane-containing analogues in the specific proteins targeted by the original drugs has confirmed the suitability of this moiety to serve as a bioisostere of ortho-substituted phenyl rings. Moreover, we have studied the potential of the different enantiomers of the drug analogues to selectively induce cytotoxicity in a panel of tumour cell lines, observing markedly differential effects for the two enantiomers and a substantial improvement over the corresponding sp2-based drugs. This showcases that the control of the absolute configuration and tridimensionality of the drug analogue has a large impact on its biological properties. The incorporation of saturated bioisosteres of phenyl rings has emerged as an appealing strategy in drug-discovery programmes. However, stereocontrolled access to these sp3-hybridized skeletons remains elusive. Now, the enantioselective synthesis of bicyclo[2.1.1]hexanes has been achieved through a Lewis-acid-catalysed [2 + 2] photocycloaddition, making it possible to obtain different drug analogues with improved properties.},

  abstract     = {The removal of SO2 from flue gas remains a challenge. Adsorption-based separation of SO2 using porous materials has been proposed as a more energy-efficient and cost-effective alternative to more traditional methods such as cryogenic distillations. Here we report a flexible hydrogen-bonded organic framework (HOF-NKU-1) that enables the sieving of SO2 through the guest-adaptive response and shape-memory effect of the material. HOF-NKU-1 exhibits a high selectivity of 7,331 for the separation of SO2/CO2 and a high SO2 storage density of 3.27 g cm−3 within the pore space at ambient conditions. The hydrophobic nature of HOF-NKU-1 enables high dynamic SO2 uptake and SO2 recovery, even in conditions of 95% humidity. The SO2/CO2 separation mechanism is studied through combinatorial gas sorption isotherms, breakthrough experiments and single-crystal diffraction studies, paving the way for the development of multifunctional shape-memory porous materials in the future. The efficient removal of SO2 from flue gas remains a considerable challenge. Now a flexible hydrogen-bonded organic framework has been developed that exhibits high selectivity for SO2 capture from flue gas mixtures, enabled by the material’s guest-adaptive behaviour and shape-memory properties.},

  abstract     = {Skeletal editing of heterocyclic building blocks offers an appealing way to expand the accessible chemical space by diversifying molecular scaffolds for drug discovery. Despite the recent boom in this area, catalytic strategies that directly introduce fluorine into the backbone of small-ring heterocycles remain rare owing to the challenges of strain-induced ring cleavage and defluorination. Here we describe a copper-catalysed approach for skeletal expansion of oxygen heterocycles by reaction with a difluorocarbene species generated in situ to induce carbon atom insertion. The α,α-difluoro-oxetane products are potential surrogates of oxetane, β-lactone and carbonyl pharmacophores on the basis of their computed molecular properties and electrostatic potential maps. The utility of this approach is highlighted by synthesis of various drug-like molecules and fluorinated isosteres of biologically active compounds. Experimental and computational investigations provide insight into the mechanism and the unique role of the copper catalyst in promoting both ring-opening and cyclization steps of the reaction. Catalytic methods to introduce fluorine into the backbone of small-ring heterocycles are challenging due to the problems of strain-induced ring cleavage and defluorination. Now, a copper catalyst mediates insertion of an in situ-generated difluorocarbene into oxygen heterocycles, affording ring-expanded fluorinated pharmacophores. Experimental and computational studies provide insights into the mechanism.},

  abstract     = {Transfer hydrogenation is widely practised across all segments of chemical industry, yet its application to aryl halide reductive cross-coupling is undeveloped because of competing hydrogenolysis. Here, exploiting the distinct reactivity of PdI species, an efficient catalytic system for the reductive cross-coupling of activated aryl bromides with aryl iodides via formate-mediated hydrogen transfer is described. These processes display orthogonality with respect to Suzuki and Buchwald–Hartwig couplings, as pinacol boronates and anilines are tolerated and, owing to the intervention of chelated intermediates, are effective for challenging 2-pyridyl systems. Experimental and computational studies corroborate a unique catalytic cycle for reductive cross-coupling where the PdI precatalyst, [Pd(I)(PtBu3)]2, is converted to the dianionic species, [Pd2I4][NBu4]2, from which aryl halide oxidative addition is more facile. Rapid, reversible Pd-to-Pd transmetallation delivers mixtures of iodide-bridged homo- and hetero-diarylpalladium dimers. The hetero-diarylpalladium dimers are more stable and have lower barriers to reductive elimination, promoting high levels of cross-selectivity. Transfer hydrogenation is challenging to apply to aryl halide reductive cross-couplings because of competing hydrogenolysis. Now aryl halide cross-couplings mediated by sodium formate have been developed.

  abstract     = {Cyclic crown ethers bind metal cations to form host–guest complexes. Lesser-known inverse crowns are rings of metal cations that encapsulate anionic entities, enabling multiple deprotonation reactions, often with unusual selectivity. Self-assembly of a cycle of metal cations around the multiply charged carbanion during the deprotonation reaction is the driving force for this reactivity. Here we report the synthesis of a pre-assembled inverse crown featuring Na+ cations and a redox-active Mg0 centre. Reduction of N2O followed by N2 release and subsequent encapsulation of O2− demonstrates its reduce-and-capture functionality. Calculations reveal that this essentially barrier-free process involves a rare N2O2− dianion, embedded in the metalla-cycle. The inverse crown can adapt itself for binding larger anions like N2O22− through a self-reorganization process involving ring expansion. The redox-active inverse crown combines the advantages of a strong reducing agent with anion stabilizing properties provided by the ring of metal cations, leading to high reactivity and selectivity. Following the building principles of crown ethers for cation encapsulation, inverse crowns are rings of metals that bind anions. Now a redox-active inverse crown ether featuring Na+ cations and Mg0 has been shown to reduce epoxides, N2O, S8 or O2 by combining anion complexation by the ring of metal cations with the reducing power of Mg0.},

  abstract     = {Dry reforming of methane is a well-studied reaction for syngas production from CO2 and CH4. While the reaction is normally performed at a feed ratio of one, the envisioned future feedstocks contain far more CO2 and thus require extensive separation to use the desired CH4. Here we develop a three-step tandem electro-thermocatalytic CH4 reforming reaction for converting CO2-rich natural gas. The combination of the tandem CH4 reforming process with the reverse water–gas shift reaction and an oxygen-ion-conducting electrolysis-membrane reactor, in which water electrolysis shifts the equilibrium of the reverse water–gas shift reaction, promotes syngas production and increases the apparent CH4 reducibility. The catalyst, formed from the in situ exsolution of Rh nanoparticles on a CeO2–x support, provides substantial Ce3+–VO–Rhδ+ interfacial active sites for high catalytic performances. This tandem system used up to four CO2 molecules per CH4 molecule, afforded high CH4 and CO2 conversions and yielded high selectivity for CO and H2 production. Although dry reforming of methane can convert CO2 to valuable chemicals, the reaction requires near-equivalent amounts of CH4. Now it has been demonstrated that an electro-thermocatalytic CH4 reforming process, when combined with the reverse water–gas shift and H2O electrolysis reactions, can efficiently catalyse CO2-rich natural gas into syngas.},

  abstract     = {Energy transfer between different mechanical degrees of freedom in atom–molecule collisions has been studied and largely understood. However, systems involving spins remain less explored. In this study, we directly observed energy transfer from atomic hyperfine to molecular rotation in the 87Rb ( $$| {F}_{a},{M}_{{F}_{a}}\rangle =| 2,2\rangle$$ ) + 40K87Rb (X1Σ+, rotational state N = 0) ⟶ Rb ( $$| 1,1\rangle$$ ) + KRb (N = 0, 1, 2) collision with state-to-state precision. We also performed quantum scattering calculations that rigorously included the coupling between spin and rotational degrees of freedom at short range under the assumption of rigid-rotor KRb monomers moving along a single potential energy surface. The calculated product rotational state distribution deviates from the observations even after extensive tuning of the atom–molecule potential energy surface. In addition, our ab initio calculations indicate that spin–rotation coupling is enhanced close to a conical intersection that is energetically accessible at short range. This, together with the deviation, suggests that vibrational degrees of freedom and conical intersections play an important part in the coupling. Our observations confirm that spin is coupled to mechanical rotation at short range and establish a benchmark for future theoretical studies. Observing spin-changing atom–molecule collisions with quantum-state precision provides clues of short-range interactions. Now it is shown that the outcomes of the KRb + Rb collision only align with a statistical model after assuming the non-conservation of mechanical angular momentum. The observations also contradict coupled-channel calculations that neglect vibrations and conical intersections.},

However, oxide materials rarely work effectively as catalysts in the absence of transition metal sites. Here we report a Ba–Si orthosilicate oxynitride–hydride as a transition-metal-free catalyst for efficient ammonia synthesis via an anion-vacancy-mediated mechanism. The facile desorption of H− and N3− anions plus the flexibility of the crystal structure can accommodate a high density of electrons at vacancy sites, where N2 can be captured and directly activated to ammonia through hydrogenation processes. The ammonia synthesis rates reach 40.1 mmol g−1 h−1 at 300 °C by loading ruthenium nanoparticles. Although not found to dissociate N2, Ru instead facilitates the formation of anion vacancies at the Ru–support interface. This demonstrates a new route for anion-vacancy-mediated heterogeneous catalysis. N2 reduction to ammonia typically requires transition metal catalysts, proceeding via a strong metal–nitrogen interaction. Now a Ba–Si orthosilicate oxynitride–hydride has been shown to function as a transition-metal-free catalyst for ammonia synthesis through an anion-vacancy-mediated mechanism, where electrons at the vacancy sites facilitate N2 activation.},

Here we show that van der Waals interactions enable the construction of robust three-dimensional frameworks, referred to as van der Waals open frameworks (WaaFs). The key to successful synthesis of WaaFs is the use of octahedral metal–organic polyhedra with size larger than 2 nm as building blocks and their packing into a sparse diamond network with large extrinsic porosity. The well-defined faces composed of multiple planar moieties increase the intermolecular contact area to achieve an interaction energy above 400 kJ mol−1. We show that the WaaFs exhibit high thermal stability and high specific surface area as well as framework assembly with a reversible nature. In reticular chemistry, the formation of strong chemical bonds between molecular components is typically considered a core prerequisite for synthesizing open-framework materials. Now a series of robust frameworks have been assembled through van der Waals interactions; the stacking of polyhedral molecular building blocks results in the formation of three-dimensional open diamond networks.},

However, boron-containing four-membered rings are less studied owing to limited preparative approaches. Their inherent ring strain makes their synthesis thermodynamically unfavourable and hinders the exploration of their properties and applications. Here we report a triplet energy transfer catalysis for crafting air-stable benzoboretenes through intramolecular coupling of boron–carbon-centred diradicals. In addition, by modulating substrate π-conjugation structures and excitation energies, boron–carbon-centred diradicals can undergo formal 1,6- and 1,5-cyclization to deliver dihydroborinine and dihydrocyclopropaborole derivatives, respectively. The metal-free neutral reaction conditions ensure a broad reaction scope, resulting in structurally diverse boracycles that are stable enough to be purified via column chromatography. Further modification of the boracycles enables the facile synthesis of oxaborabicycles and dihydroborinine-fused polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons with unique optoelectronic properties. Boron-containing four-membered rings are less studied than five- and six-membered boron rings owing to limited preparative approaches.

However, its application with large or highly polar guests remains challenging. In this study, we addressed some of these limitations using palladium-based octahedron-shaped M6L4 (Td) coordination cages as crystalline sponges. The key to facilitate the crystallization of the cage is the addition of large aromatic polysulfonates (‘sticker’ anions); the symmetry mismatch between the cage and the sticker (D2h) results in a low-symmetry space group (P $$\bar{1}$$ ), preventing guest disorder and leading to the formation of guest-accessible channels in the crystal. Guests can be encapsulated either before or after cage crystallization. The size and host–guest properties of the cavity enable analysis of a broad range of compounds, including water-soluble molecules, large amphiphilic molecules (molecular weight of ~1,200) and molecular aggregates. We have demonstrated the versatility of the cage–sticker strategy through its application to a triaugmented triangular-prism-shaped M9L6 cage, extending the guest scope to medium-sized pharmaceutical molecules. The crystalline sponge method enables the structural characterization of non-crystalline compounds through encapsulation in a porous material. Now it is shown that palladium-based coordination cages in combination with polysulfonate anions form low-symmetry crystals that can be used as crystalline sponges to determine the structure of a wide variety of compounds, including large amphiphilic molecules.},

Since its initial experimental realization, borophene has proven to be a versatile 2D material due to its high polymorphism and amenability to heterostructure integration. Nevertheless, several synthetic challenges have hindered the practical utilization of borophene, primarily due to its high chemical reactivity and interlayer charge transfer with growth substrates. Here we discuss emerging synthesis strategies for borophene, ranging from on-surface synthesis using elemental and molecular boron sources to substrate segregation growth techniques and solution-based reactions. We also focus on the surface and interface engineering of borophene with the aim of tailoring chemical reactivity and electronic properties. Finally, we highlight the remaining unresolved synthetic challenges for borophene and suggest future directions for accelerating fundamental science and applied technology for boron in the 2D limit. Borophene is a two-dimensional allotrope of boron that features anisotropic metallicity, polymorphism and amenability to heterostructure integration. This Review highlights recent progress in borophene research and outlines prospective pathways for accelerating the fundamental science and applications of borophene.},

  abstract     = {Lithium–sulfur batteries promise high energy density storage but show poor stabilities owing to uncontrolled polysulfide dissolution. Although limiting polysulfide solvation to establish quasi-solid-state sulfur reaction can decouple electrode reactions from the electrolyte volume, this approach suffers from slow reaction kinetics. Here we propose a surface-localized polysulfide-solvation strategy to mediate the reaction of ‘quasi-solid’ polysulfide by leveraging an organic phase mediator with a weakly solvating electrolyte. This electrolyte restricts polysulfide dissolution globally while the phase mediator complexes with the surface polysulfide, promoting polysulfide solvation at the surface and facilitating fast surface-localized solution-phase sulfur reactions. Lithium–sulfur batteries using surface-localized phase mediation show excellent rate performance with 494 mA h g−1-sulfur at 16 C and stabilized cycling for 300 cycles with 90.2% capacity retention. The strategy enables steady operation of a 2.4 Ah 331 Wh kg−1 pouch cell. Our work highlights the advantages of surface phase mediation in controlling electrode reaction pathways and kinetics via electrolyte rational design. Lithium–sulfur batteries are a promising electrochemical energy storage technology; however, they are limited by the dissolution of polysulfide intermediates. Now, it has been shown that sparingly solvating electrolytes containing a phase mediator can avoid polysulfide dissolution and accelerate surface-localized solution-phase sulfur reaction to improve battery performances.},

  abstract     = {Open-shell systems based on first-row transition metals and their involvement in various catalytic processes are well explored. By comparison, mononuclear open-shell complexes of precious transition metals remain underdeveloped. This is particularly true for IrII complexes, as there is very limited information available regarding their application in catalysis. Here we show that a family of IrII metalloradicals, featuring a C6H3-2,6-(OP(tBu)2)2 (POCOP) pincer ligand, effectively catalyses olefin isomerization—a key step in alkane metathesis—exhibiting up to 20 times higher activity than their IrI counterparts. Computational studies reveal that the IrII/IrIV redox cycling enables faster kinetics than the traditional IrI/IrIII pathway owing to reduced barriers for the oxidative addition and reductive elimination steps. Thus, this study presents a redox catalyst involving an IrII/IrIV pair, highlighting the capabilites of precious-metal systems that extend beyond traditional redox cycles. These findings emphasize the need for expanding catalytic design principles, especially for platinum-group metals. The chemistry of precious-metal-based open-shell mononuclear complexes remains underdeveloped. Now it has been shown that iridium metalloradicals enable Ir(II)/Ir(IV) redox cycles and catalyse olefin isomerization more efficiently than their more commonly used closed-shell analogues, which typically operate through Ir(I)/Ir(III) or Ir(III)/Ir(V) cycles.},

However, due to the inertness of the CAr–NO2 bond, the direct denitrative substitution reaction with unactivated nitroarenes remains challenging. Chemists rely on sequential reduction and diazotization followed by the Sandmeyer reaction or the nucleophilic aromatic substitution of activated nitroarenes to realize nitro group transformations. Here we develop a general denitrative chlorination reaction under visible-light irradiation, in which the chlorine radical replaces the nitro moiety through the cleavage of the CAr–NO2 bond. This practical method works with a wide range of unactivated nitro(hetero)arenes and nitroalkenes, is not sensitive to air or moisture and can proceed smoothly on a decagram scale. This transformation differs fundamentally from previous nucleophilic aromatic substitution reactions under thermal conditions in both synthesis and mechanism. Density functional theory calculations reveal the possible pathway for the substitution reaction. Due to the inert CAr–NO2 bond, direct denitrative substitution reactions with unactivated nitroarenes are challenging. Now, using visible-light irradiation, a strategy has been developed to enable direct aromatic denitrative chlorination. Chlorine radicals can replace the NO2 moiety in a wide range of unactivated nitroarenes as well as nitroalkenes.},

Past work has characterized specific chemical reactions that might lead to biological molecules. Here we establish an experimental model of chemical evolution to investigate general processes by which chemical systems continuously change. We used water as a chemical reactant, product and medium. We leveraged oscillating water activity at near-ambient temperatures to cause ratcheting of near-equilibrium reactions in mixtures of organic molecules containing carboxylic acids, amines, thiols and hydroxyl groups. Our system (1) undergoes continuous change with transitions to new chemical spaces while not converging throughout the experiment; (2) demonstrates combinatorial compression with stringent chemical selection; and (3) displays synchronicity of molecular populations. Our results suggest that chemical evolution and selection can be observed in organic mixtures and might ultimately be adapted to produce a broad array of molecules with novel structures and functions. Origins-of-life research has focused on specific chemical reactions that might lead to biological molecules. Now an experimental model of chemical evolution based on oscillating water activity has been established.

  abstract     = {The emergence of bacterial antimicrobial resistance threatens to undermine the utility of antibiotic therapy in medicine. This threat can be addressed, in part, by reinventing existing antibiotic classes using chemical synthesis. Here we present the discovery of BT-33, a fluorinated macrobicyclic oxepanoprolinamide antibiotic with broad-spectrum activity against multidrug-resistant bacterial pathogens. Structure–activity relationships within the macrobicyclic substructure reveal structural features that are essential to the enhanced potency of BT-33 as well as its increased metabolic stability relative to its predecessors clindamycin, iboxamycin and cresomycin. Using X-ray crystallography, we determine the structure of BT-33 in complex with the bacterial ribosome revealing that its fluorine atom makes an additional van der Waals contact with nucleobase G2505. Through variable-temperature 1H NMR experiments, density functional theory calculations and vibrational circular dichroism spectroscopy, we compare macrobicyclic homologues of BT-33 and a C7 desmethyl analogue and find that the C7 methyl group of BT-33 rigidifies the macrocyclic ring in a conformation that is highly preorganized for ribosomal binding. Antibiotic resistance can be addressed by reinventing classes of antibiotics through chemical synthesis. Here BT-33—a fully synthetic antibiotic—affords broad-spectrum activity against the bacterial ribosome. X-ray crystallography, theoretical calculations and structure–activity relationship studies reveal the structural features that contribute to the enhanced antibacterial activity and metabolic stability of BT-33.},

Here we design and synthesize two 3D COFs, designated as JUC-644 and JUC-645, through a methodology that relies on using eight-connected building blocks with reduced symmetry. Their structures are solved using continuous rotation electron diffraction and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, which reveal a unique linkage with a double chain structure, a rare phenomenon in COFs. We deconstruct these structures into [4 + 3(+ 2)]-c nets, which leads to six different topologies. Furthermore, JUC-644 demonstrates high adsorption capacity for C3H8 and n-C4H10 (11.28 and 10.45 mmol g−1 at 298 K and 1 bar, respectively), surpassing most known porous materials, with notable selectivity for C3H8/C2H6 and n-C4H10/C2H6. This approach opens avenues for designing intricate architectures and shows the potential of COFs in C2H6 recovery from natural gas liquids. Three-dimensional covalent organic frameworks hold great potential for diverse applications, but their structural diversity is constrained by the synthetic approaches available. Now it is shown that ‘eight-connected’ building blocks with reduced symmetry enable the synthesis of such frameworks with rare topologies and enhanced gas adsorption performance.},

  abstract     = {Perovskite solar cells represent a promising class of photovoltaics that have achieved exceptional levels of performance within a short time. Such high efficiencies often depend on the use of molecule-based selective contacts that form highly ordered molecular assemblies. Although this high degree of ordering usually benefits charge-carrier transport, it is disrupted by structure deformation and phase transformation when subjected to external stresses, which limits the long-term operational stability of perovskite solar cells. Here we demonstrate a molecular contact with an orthogonal π-skeleton that shows better resilience to external stimuli than commonly used conjugated cores. This molecular design yields a disordered, amorphous structure that is not only highly stable but also demonstrates exceptional charge selectivity and transport capability. The perovskite solar cells fabricated with this orthogonal π-skeleton molecule exhibited enhanced long-term durability in accelerated-ageing tests. This orthogonal π-skeleton functionality opens new opportunities in molecular design for applications in organic electronics. Perovskite solar cells often rely on ordered molecular contacts for favourable charge-carrier transport, and any organizational disruption reduces device efficiency. Now a contact featuring an orthogonal π-skeleton has been shown to afford a high resilience to external stimuli plus long-term durability in accelerated-ageing tests.},

  abstract     = {The cyclopentadienyl anion is a π-aromatic five-membered ring ligand that is widely used in organometallic chemistry. By replacing the CH groups in cyclopentadiene with isoelectronic group-15 elements, an inorganic analogue can be obtained. In this line, Pn5 (Pn = P, Sb) rings have been stabilized in a triple-decker sandwich structure, prepared via high-temperature reactions, and an example of a Bi5− ring stabilized in a cobalt-based inverse-sandwich-type complex has been reported. Here we report the synthesis and structural characterization of two complexes, [Cp–V(cyclo-Sb5)V–Cp]2− and [Cp–Nb(cyclo-Bi5)Nb–Cp]2−, which are stabilized by [K(18-crown-6)]+ or [K(2.2.2-crypt)]+ cations at room temperature under mild conditions. Our bonding analysis through various quantum-chemical methods reveals that V‒V and Nb‒Nb bonds pass through the centre of the E5 rings (E = Sb, Nb). In contrast to free cyclo-E5 (E = Sb, Bi) the cyclo-E5 moieties between Cp–E units do not possess any aromatic character because the M‒M (M = V, Nb) bond passes through the centre of the ring. Although several inorganic analogues of cyclopentadiene have been reported with group-15 elements, examples featuring the heavier elements Sb and Bi remain scarce. Now, a Bi5 ring has been stabilized between two Nb(cyclopentadienyl) units, forming a triple-decker sandwich structure; the bonding analysis indicates that a Nb–Nb bond goes through the centre of the Bi5 plane.},

  abstract     = {Monocyclic π-aromatic compounds are ubiquitous throughout almost all fields of natural sciences—as synthons in industrial processes, as ligands of metal complexes for catalysis or sensing and as bioactive molecules. Planar organocycles stand out through their specific way of overcoming electron deficiency by a non-localizable set of (4n + 2)π electrons. By contrast, all-metal aromatic monocycles are still rare, as metal atoms prefer to form clusters with multiply bonded atoms instead. This limits the knowledge and potential of corresponding compounds in chemical syntheses or for innovative materials. Here we report the successful generation of Bi5−, the heaviest analogue of (C5H5)−. Its use as a ligand in [{IMesCo}2(µ,η5:η5-Bi5)] (1) was realized by reacting (TlBi3)2− with [(IMes)2CoCl] (where IMes is bis(1,3-(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl))imidazol-2-ylidene) in ortho-difluorobenzene. Compound 1 is mixed-valence Co0/CoI as verified by µ-SQUID measurements and density functional theory, and embeds the planar Bi5− cycle in an inverse-sandwich-type manner. Capturing Bi5− represents a landmark in the chemistry of all-metal aromatic molecules and defines a new era for aromatic compounds. All-metal aromatic monocycles are still rare, in contrast to their ubiquitous organic counterparts, because metal atoms tend to form clusters with multiply bonded atoms instead. Now a planar aromatic Bi5− ring has been synthesized as part of a mixed-valence Co0/CoI inverse-sandwich-type complex.},

  abstract     = {The mutual neutralization of hydronium and hydroxide ions is a fundamental chemical reaction. Yet, there is very limited direct experimental evidence about its intrinsically non-adiabatic mechanism. Chemistry textbooks describe the products of mutual neutralization in bulk water as two water molecules; however, this reaction has been suggested as a possible mechanism for the recently reported spontaneous formation of OH radicals at the surface of water microdroplets. Here, following three-dimensional-imaging of the coincident neutral products of reactions of isolated D3O+ and OD−, we can reveal the non-adiabatic pathways for OD radical formation. Two competing pathways lead to distinct D2O + OD + D and 2OD + D2 product channels, while the proton-transfer mechanism is substantially suppressed due to a kinetic isotope effect. Analysis of the three-body momentum correlations revealed that the D2O + OD + D channel is formed by electron transfer at a short distance of ~4 Å with the formation of the intermediate unstable neutral D3O ground state, while 2OD + D2 products are obtained following electron transfer at a distance of ~10 Å via an excited state of the neutral D3O. The mutual neutralization of hydronium and hydroxide ions is a reaction of fundamental interest that has recently been implicated in the generation of high concentrations of hydroxyl radicals at the surface of water microdroplets. Using three-dimensional imaging of the coincident neutral products of the reaction of D3O+ and OD−, two competing pathways for OH radical formation have now been experimentally observed.},

Despite the potential value in transforming peptides and peptidomimetics with N-CH2F, the very existence of this structure has been controversial. Here we report the preparation of N-CH2F amides and carbamates via simple and robust chemical methods. The syntheses of N-CH2F amides were achieved via successive acylation and fluorination of imines and directly used in the modification of drugs, peptides and heteroaryl amides without racemization or epimerization. The use of triethylamine is the key to the separation of N-CH2F amides. The stability of nine structurally diverse N-CH2F amides was tested in eight different media, showing that most compounds remained 60–100% intact for 24 h. The monofluoromethyl (CH2F) motif is valuable as it can mimic CH3 and CH2OH motifs frequently found in bioactive molecules, but the synthesis of N-CH2F amides is challenging. Now the synthesis of numerous N-CH2F amides has been achieved via successive acylation and fluorination of imines, enriching pathways for N-methylation of biomolecules.},

  abstract     = {The exploration of ligated metal clusters’ chemical space is challenging, partly owing to an insufficiently targeted access to reactive clusters. Now, dynamic mixtures of clusters, defined as living libraries, are obtained through organometallic precursor chemistry. The libraries are populated with interrelated clusters, including transient and highly reactive ones, as well as more accessible but less reactive species. Their evolutions upon perturbation with substrate molecules are monitored and chemical information is gained without separation of the clusters. Here we prepared a library of all-hydrocarbon ligated Cu/Zn clusters and developed a bias-free computational framework suited to analyse the full compositional space that yields a reliable structural model for each cluster. This methodology enables efficient searches for structure–reactivity relationships relevant for catalysis with mixed-metal clusters: when treating the library with CO2 or 3-hexyne and H2, we discovered [Cu11Zn6](Cp*)8(CO2)2(HCO2) bearing a formate species related to CO2 reduction and [Cu9Zn7](Cp*)6(Hex)3(H)3 bearing C6 species related to alkyne semi-hydrogenation. Understanding ligated metal clusters’ reactivities is challenging. Now, a methodology has been developed to explore dynamic mixtures of metal clusters. Interrelated cluster populations are constructed through organometallic precursor chemistry. Structural information on mixed-metal systems is obtained with a bias-free computational framework, and reactivities towards CO2 and alkynes are investigated in situ.},

  abstract     = {Proton pump inhibitors have become top-selling drugs worldwide. Serendipitously discovered as prodrugs that are activated by protonation in acidic environments, proton pump inhibitors inhibit stomach acid secretion by covalently modifying the gastric proton pump. Despite their widespread use, alternative activation mechanisms and potential target proteins in non-acidic environments remain poorly understood. Employing a chemoproteomic approach, we found that the proton pump inhibitor rabeprazole selectively forms covalent conjugates with zinc-binding proteins. Focusing on DENR, a protein with a C4 zinc cluster (that is, zinc coordinated by four cysteines), we show that rabeprazole is activated by the zinc ion and subsequently conjugated to zinc-coordinating cysteines. Our results suggest that drug binding, activation and conjugation take place rapidly within the zinc coordination sphere. Finally, we provide evidence that other proton pump inhibitors can be activated in the same way. We conclude that zinc acts as a Lewis acid, obviating the need for low pH, to promote the activation and conjugation of proton pump inhibitors in non-acidic environments. Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are prodrugs that are activated by protonation in the highly acidic environment of the stomach lining. Now, coordination of PPIs to protein-bound zinc ions is revealed as another pathway to PPI activation. Acting as a Lewis acid, the zinc ion facilitates conjugation of the drug to zinc-coordinating cysteine residues.},

However, polyolefins are difficult to efficiently recycle or break down and are now a persistent global contaminant. Broadly replacing polyolefins with bio-derived and degradable polyethylene-like materials is an important yet challenging endeavour towards sustainable plastics. Here we report a solution for circular bio-based polyethylene-like materials synthesized by acceptorless dehydrogenative polymerization from linear and branched diols and their catalytic closed-loop recycling. The polymerization and depolymerization processes utilize earth-abundant manganese complexes as catalysts. These materials exhibit a wide range of mechanical properties, encompassing thermoplastics to plastomers to elastomers. The branched diols, produced through a thiol–ene click reaction, can be polymerized to plastics with significantly enhanced tensile properties, toughness and adhesive properties. These materials could be depolymerized back to monomers through hydrogenation and were separatable with a monomer recovery of up to 99%, unaffected by the presence of dyes and additives. Overall, this system establishes a route to more sustainable plastics. Bio-based polyethylene-like materials with tunable thermal and mechanical properties have been synthesized from plant-derived diols using an acceptorless dehydrogenative polymerization strategy. Now it has been shown that this atom-economical and mass-economical approach employing non-precious metal catalysts enables closed-loop recycling and advances sustainable solutions for the circular plastic economy.},

  abstract     = {Molecular spin qubits have the advantages of synthetic flexibility and amenability to be tailored to specific applications. Among them, chromophore–radical systems have emerged as appealing qubit candidates. These systems can be initiated by light to form triplet–radical pairs that can result in the formation of quartet states by spin mixing. For a triplet–radical pair to undergo spin mixing, the molecular bridge joining the spin centres must permit effective spin communication, which has previously been ensured using covalent, π-conjugated linkers. Here we used perylenediimides and nitroxide radicals designed to self-assemble in solution via hydrogen bonding and observed, using electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy, the formation of quartet states that can be manipulated coherently using microwaves. This unprecedented finding that non-covalent bonds can enable spin mixing advances supramolecular chemistry as a valuable tool for exploring, developing and scaling up materials for quantum information science. Molecular approaches in quantum information science are highly promising, but the synthesis and scale-up of suitable covalently linked moieties represent major challenges. Here it is demonstrated that efficient spin mixing between photogenerated spin centres is possible through hydrogen bonds, advancing supramolecular chemistry as a valuable tool to address these challenges.},

  abstract     = {Developing new generic methodologies for organizing molecules into nano- to mesoscale structures of precise shapes and sizes is a research topic at the forefront of modern chemistry. Creating hierarchical molecular assembly, especially at the mesoscale, is important to realize functions reminiscent of those manifested by biomolecular assemblies in the mesoscopic regime. However, this is challenging due to the difficulty in maintaining stringent controllability over the organization of molecules at higher hierarchical levels, wherein weak non-directional intermolecular interactions rather than strong directional interactions typically play a predominant role. Recent studies have revealed that secondary nucleation, often experienced by one-dimensional assemblies such as supramolecular polymers that grow with spontaneous nucleation, is effective in the hierarchical construction of higher-order structures. Here we illustrate how secondary nucleation can be combined with the well-established precision synthesis of supramolecular polymers to realize precise control over hierarchical structures in the mesoscopic regime. We present a roadmap for creating hierarchical supramolecular polymers by exploiting secondary nucleation–elongation processes and discuss future prospects for the field. Mastering the synthesis of hierarchical molecular assemblies at the mesoscale—mimicking the precision of biomolecular assembly—has been challenging due to the lack of well-defined methodologies for controlling non-covalent interactions at multiple levels. In this Review, secondary nucleation is presented as a promising strategy for constructing mesoscale hierarchical structures.},

  abstract     = {Biomolecular condensates composed of proteins and RNA are one approach by which cells regulate post-transcriptional gene expression. Their formation typically involves the phase separation of intrinsically disordered proteins with a target mRNA, sequestering the mRNA into a liquid condensate. This sequestration regulates gene expression by modulating translation or facilitating RNA processing. Here we engineer synthetic condensates using a fusion of an RNA-binding protein, the human Pumilio2 homology domain (Pum2), and a synthetic intrinsically disordered protein, an elastin-like polypeptide (ELP), that can bind and sequester a target mRNA transcript. In protocells, sequestration of a target mRNA largely limits its translation. Conversely, in Escherichia coli, sequestration of the same target mRNA increases its translation. We characterize the Pum2–ELP condensate system using microscopy, biophysical and biochemical assays, and RNA sequencing. This approach enables the modulation of cell function via the formation of synthetic biomolecular condensates that regulate the expression of a target protein. Formation of biomolecular condensates composed of proteins and RNA facilitates the regulation of gene expression by modulating translation or facilitating RNA processing. Now, synthetic ribonucleoprotein granules created with engineered intrinsically disordered proteins selectively sequester mRNA and enhance protein translation in cells. These highly liquid-like condensates exchange biomolecules across the cell and facilitate target mRNA and ribosome partitioning.},

  abstract     = {Controlling reaction outcomes through external influences is a central goal in chemistry. Vibrational coupling between molecular vibrations and cavity modes is rapidly emerging as a distinct strategy compared with conventional thermochemical and photochemical methods; however, insight into the fundamental mechanisms remains limited. Here we investigate how vibrational weak and strong coupling in plasmonic nanocavities modifies the thermal dehydration of copper sulfate pentahydrate. We demonstrate that light–matter coupling reduces the onset temperature for dehydration by up to 14 °C, and we attribute this effect to enhanced radiative energy transport that is mediated by resonant electromagnetic modes, eliminating temperature gradients in the coupled system. Our findings provide direct evidence of localized energy transfer leading to modified chemical behaviour in specific regions of high optical density of states. This work establishes a mechanism for modifying thermally driven chemical processes using optical cavities, with implications for the development of catalytic systems that exploit these tailored interactions to achieve targeted reaction control. Vibrational weak and strong light–matter coupling in infrared nanocavities modifies chemical processes. Now it has been shown that this coupling can control thermally driven reactions through enhanced radiative energy transport.},

However, the ability to design protein activity through precise protein–solvent cooperative interactions has not yet been demonstrated. Here we report the design of 14 membrane receptors that catalyse G protein nucleotide exchange through diverse engineered allosteric pathways mediated by cooperative networks of intraprotein, protein–ligand and –solvent molecule interactions. Consistent with predictions, the designed protein activities correlated well with the level of plasticity of the networks at flexible transmembrane helical interfaces. Several designs displayed considerably enhanced thermostability and activity compared with related natural receptors. The most stable and active variant crystallized in an unforeseen signalling-active conformation, in excellent agreement with the design models. The allosteric network topologies of the best designs bear limited similarity to those of natural receptors and reveal an allosteric interaction space larger than previously inferred from natural proteins. The approach should prove useful for engineering proteins with novel complex protein binding, catalytic and signalling activities. Solvent-mediated interaction networks control a wide range of protein functions, but their design has been neglected owing to a lack of accurate computational tools. Now it is shown that allosteric signalling membrane proteins can be engineered through such networks, revealing a broader space of designable protein interactions and functions.},

However, the design and synthesis of complex structures in a predictable manner remains challenging. Here we report the preparation of a series of isomeric pillar-layered MOFs, and we show that their three-dimensional topology can be controlled by altering the layer stacking. This enables variability on the backbone structure, as well as diverse spatial arrangements of pillars and the partitioning of pore space into several kinds of cages packing in distinct sequences. These sequence-controlled MOFs (SC-MOF-1–6) showcase ultrahigh benzene capture capacities at low-pressure and high volumetric and gravimetric uptake performances in high-pressure methane storage. We provide the construction principles of the SC-MOFs and predict nearly 2,000 possible SC-networks with sophisticated composition sequences at the atomic level by using a Python script.

Here we report a gram-scale, seven-step synthesis of ibogaine from pyridine. Key features of this strategy enabled the synthesis of three additional iboga alkaloids, as well as an enantioselective total synthesis of (+)-ibogaine and the construction of four analogues. Biological testing revealed that the unnatural enantiomer of ibogaine does not produce ibogaine-like effects on cortical neuron growth, while (−)-10-fluoroibogamine exhibits exceptional psychoplastogenic properties and is a potent modulator of the serotonin transporter. This work provides a platform for accessing iboga alkaloids and congeners for further biological study. Preliminary clinical trials suggest that ibogaine and its active metabolite noribogaine have powerful anti-addictive properties, Now, a strategy for the scalable, asymmetric total synthesis of ibogaine has been developed that also provides access to iboga analogues.

  abstract     = {Amyloid fibrils are highly stable misfolded protein assemblies that play an important role in several neurodegenerative and systemic diseases. Although structural information of the amyloid state is now abundant, mechanistic details about the misfolding process remain elusive. Inspired by the Φ-value analysis of protein folding, we combined experiments and molecular simulations to resolve amino-acid contacts and determine the structure of the transition-state ensemble—the rate-limiting step—for fibril elongation of PI3K-SH3 amyloid fibrils. The ensemble was validated experimentally by Tanford β analysis and computationally by free energy calculations. Although protein folding proceeds on funnel-shaped landscapes, here we find that the energy landscape for the misfolding reaction consists of a large ‘golf course’ region, defined by a single energy barrier and transition state, accessing a sharply funnelled region. Thus, misfolding occurs by rare, successful monomer–fibril end collisions interspersed by numerous unsuccessful binding attempts. Taken together, these insights provide a quantitative and highly resolved description of a protein misfolding reaction. Amyloid fibrils grow through the recruitment of soluble monomer to the fibril end that propagates the fibril structure. Here the transition state, the rate-limiting conformation, of such a reaction has been characterized by Φ-value analysis. An energy landscape model has been developed and fibril growth rates predicted from first principles.},

  abstract     = {The substitution of an aromatic ring with a C(sp3)-rich bicyclic hydrocarbon, known as bioisosteric replacement, plays a crucial role in modern drug discovery. Substituted bicyclo[1.1.1]pentanes (BCPs) are particularly noteworthy owing to their uniquely three-dimensional stereochemical complexity. 1,3-Difunctionalized BCPs have been widely used as bioisosteres for para-substituted phenyl rings, and they have been incorporated into numerous lead pharmaceutical candidates. 2-Substituted BCPs (substituted at the bridge position) can function as alternatives to ortho- or meta-substituted arene rings; however, the general and efficient construction of these scaffolds remains challenging, particularly if performed in an enantioselective manner. Here we present an approach for synthesizing enantioenriched 2-substituted BCPs by a nitrogen-atom insertion-and-deletion strategy, involving a chiral Brønsted acid-catalytic enantioselective cycloaddition of bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes with imines and nitrogen deletion of resulting aza-bicyclo[2.1.1]hexanes (aza-BCHs) with generally good enantiopurity retention. Mechanistic experiments verify the radical pathway. Chiral BCPs have been readily incorporated into medicinally relevant molecules, and a drug analogue has been successfully prepared enantioselectively. Substituted bicyclo[1.1.1]pentanes (BCPs) are widely used as bioisosteres for para-substituted phenyl rings, providing improved pharmacological profiles for drug candidates, but strategies for the preparation of chiral BCPs remain limited. Now a route to chiral bridge-substituted BCPs has been developed via a nitrogen-atom insertion-and-deletion strategy, enabling a practical avenue towards chiral BCP bioisosteres of lomitapide.},

Engineered DNA polymerases have recently emerged as attractive tools for RNA labelling, offering distinct advantages over conventional RNA polymerases. Here, through semi-rational designs, we engineered a DNA polymerase variant and used it to precisely incorporate a diverse range of modifications, including base modifications, 2′-ribose modifications and backbone modifications, into desired positions within RNA. We achieved efficiencies exceeding 85% in the majority of modification cases, demonstrating success in introducing 2′-O-methyl, phosphorothioate, N4-acetylcytidine and a fluorophore to specific sites in eGFP and Firefly luciferase messenger RNA. Our mRNA products with N4-acetylcytidine, 2′-O-methyl and/or phosphorothioate have demonstrated the ability to enhance stability and affect protein production. This method presents a promising tool for the comprehensive functionalization of RNA, enabling the introduction of plentiful modifications irrespective of RNA lengths and sequences. The demand for large, position-specific modified RNA molecules is high across diverse fields. Now a DNA polymerase has been engineered to enable the efficient and flexible synthesis of such molecules using a pause–restart strategy.

Through extensive 1H nuclear magnetic resonance titration experiments and computational density functional theory studies, a library of chalcogen-bonding (ChB) and halogen-bonding (XB) mechanically interlocked [2]rotaxane molecules, including seminal examples of all-ChB and mixed ChB/XB [2]rotaxanes, are shown to function as either Lewis-acidic or Lewis-basic multidentate hosts for selective halide anion and metal cation binding. Notably, the exploitation of the inherent amphoteric character of an atom for the strategic purpose of either cation or anion recognition constitutes the inception of a previously unexplored area of supramolecular host–guest chemistry. The importance of charged species in numerous biological and environmental processes has stimulated the development of host molecules for their selective recognition.

  abstract     = {Understanding the hydrogenation pathway in electrochemical CO2 reduction is important for controlling product selectivity. The Eley–Rideal mechanism involving proton-coupled electron transfer directly from solvent water is often considered to be the primary hydrogen transfer route. However, in principle, hydrogenation can also occur via the Langmuir–Hinshelwood mechanism using surface-adsorbed *H. Here, by performing CO2 reduction with Cu in H2O–D2O mixtures, we present evidence that the Langmuir–Hinshelwood mechanism is probably the dominant hydrogenation route. From this, we estimate the extent to which each mechanism contributes towards the formation of six important CO2 reduction products. Through computational simulations, we find that the formation of C–H bonds and O–H bonds is governed by the Langmuir–Hinshelwood and Eley–Rideal mechanism, respectively. We also show that promoting the Eley–Rideal pathway could be crucial towards selective multicarbon product formation and suppressing hydrogen evolution. These findings introduce important considerations for the theoretical modelling of CO2 reduction pathways and electrocatalyst design. CO2 electroreduction to higher-value carbons can occur through adsorbed hydrogen or through proton-coupled electron transfer from water. Understanding the impact of each route on product selectivity is challenging. Now H/D isotopic labelling reveals the contribution of each mechanism towards product formation and shows that adsorbed hydrogen dominates the reaction.},

  abstract     = {Supramolecular networks are abundantly present in nature and, like crystalline materials, often develop from an initial nucleation site, followed by growth based on directional interactions between components. Traditionally, the binding strength and directionality of interactions is thought to dictate nucleation and crystal growth, whereas structural flexibility favours defects. Usually, macromonomers present multiple binding sites with relative intramolecular flexibility, but the effects of such flexibility on regulating network formation have been given little attention. Here we introduce the concept of ‘interface flexibility’ and demonstrate its critical importance in the nucleation and growth of supramolecular networks. As a model system, we use trisymmetric DNA-based macromonomers, which organize into hexagonal networks through weak π–π interactions at their tips. The directional nature and low spatial tolerance of π–π interactions mean that small shifts in orientation have a large effect on effective valency. We show that too much interface flexibility disrupts network formation, regardless of affinity. Tuning the interface flexibility greatly expands the available design space for synthetic supramolecular materials. Supramolecular ordered networks are formed through directional interactions of uniform macromonomer building blocks. Now it has been shown that, rather than intermolecular affinity, the flexibility of the binding interface (‘interface flexibility’) dominates the mechanism of self-assembly. This study provides an intuitive understanding of the role of interface flexibility in supramolecular self-assembly.},

A recent proliferation of synthetic strategies and advanced characterization tools has propelled broad interest in leveraging these catalysts in diverse areas of chemistry beyond thermal heterogeneous catalysis, including but not limited to organic synthesis, electrochemistry, photochemistry and environmental chemistry. This Perspective aims to arm researchers in this area with the methodological framework and fundamental principles to accurately assess the degree of uniformity of heterogeneous catalyst active sites, and to link the synthesis, structure and function of atomically dispersed catalysts to one another. A paedagogical discussion of catalyst structural dynamics and active-site-specific characterization is supplemented with recent case studies that illustrate these fundamentals. This analysis shows how progress can be guided by requiring that the characterization of active sites is connected to their kinetic behaviour in the form of turnover rates and by leveraging the thermokinetic factors that control active site structures and their dynamics. Atomically dispersed heterogeneous catalysts impact diverse areas of chemistry through the design of active sites with molecular precision, but this vision is not fully realized.

Metal–organic cages are excellent hosts for various guests, but they generally incorporate rigid structural units that hinder dynamic adaptation to specific guests. Here we report a conformationally adaptable pseudo-cubic cage that can dynamically increase its cavity volume to fit guests with differing sizes. This pseudo-cube incorporates a tetramine subcomponent with 2,6-naphthalene arms that cooperatively adopt a non-planar conformation, enabling the cage faces to switch between endo and exo states. A wide range of guest molecules were observed to bind within the cavity of this cage, spanning a range of sizes from 46% to 154% of the cavity volume of the empty cage. Experimental and computational evidence characterizes the flipping of cage faces from endo to exo, expanding the cavity upon binding of larger guests. Synthetic nanocages that can adapt the size and shape of their cavity in response to a given guest have potential applications in various areas, including chemical purification. Now a flexible, pseudo-cubic metal–organic cage has been developed that is able to dynamically expand its cavity from 46% to 154% of its initial volume by flipping its cage faces.},

Natural vesicles are composed of a lipid layer that forms a membrane for the enclosure of substances inside. Here we report a coacervate vesicle formed by the liquid–liquid phase separation of cholesterol-modified DNA and histones. Unlike a phospholipid-based membrane-bounded vesicle, a coacervate vesicle lacks a membrane structure on the surface and is organized with a high-density liquid layer and a water-filled cavity. Through a straightforward coacervation process, we demonstrate that various biological agents, including virus particles, mRNA, cytokines and peptides, can be innocuously and directly enriched in the liquid phase. In contrast to the droplet-like coacervates that are prone to aggregation challenges, coacervate vesicles display superior kinetic stability, positioning them as a versatile delivery vehicle for biopharmaceuticals. We validate that incorporating oncolytic viruses into these coacervate vesicles endows them with potent oncolytic efficacy and elicits robust anti-tumour immune responses in mouse models. Natural vesicles typically consist of a lipid membrane enclosing substances. Now a coacervate vesicle formed by liquid–liquid phase separation of cholesterol-modified DNA and histones has been developed. Unlike traditional vesicles, these lack a membrane and feature a high-density liquid layer around a water-filled cavity, offering enhanced kinetic stability and potential as a biopharmaceutical delivery system.},

Transition-metal catalysis has the potential to greatly expand the scope of nucleophilic substitution reactions of alkyl electrophiles; unfortunately, in the case of alkyl amines as nucleophiles, only one success has been described so far: the selective mono-alkylation of primary amines to form secondary amines. Here, using photoinduced copper catalysis, we report the synthesis of tertiary alkyl amines from secondary amines and unactivated alkyl electrophiles, two readily available coupling partners. Utilizing an array of tools, we have analysed the mechanism of this process; specifically, we have structurally characterized the three principal copper-based intermediates that are detected during catalysis and provided support for the key steps of the proposed catalytic cycle, including the coupling of a copper(II)–amine intermediate with an alkyl radical to form a C–N bond. Alkyl amines are found in a wide array of bioactive compounds, making strategies for their synthesis very important. Now, a method has been developed to synthesize tertiary alkyl amines via photoinduced, copper-catalysed nucleophilic substitution of unactivated alkyl halides by secondary alkyl amines, with key copper intermediates elucidated in a detailed mechanistic study.},

  abstract     = {The chemistry of low-valent bismuth compounds has recently unlocked new concepts in catalysis and unique electronic structure fundamentals. In this work, we describe the synthesis and characterization of a highly reduced bismuth salt featuring a cationic core based on three contiguous Bi(I) centres. The triatomic bismuth-based core exhibits an electronic configuration that mimics the canonical description of the archetypical carbon-based π-allyl cation. Structural, spectroscopic and theoretical analyses validate the unique π-delocalization between the bismuth’s highly diffused 6p orbitals, resulting in a bonding situation in which the three bismuth atoms are interconnected by two bonds, formally possessing a 1.5 bond order each. This electronic situation defines this complex as the heaviest and stable π-allyl cation of the periodic table. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the newly synthesized complex is able to act as a synthon for the transfer of a Bi(I) cation to forge other low-valent organobismuth complexes. Heavier analogues of unsaturated organic molecules are of interest because of their bonding situation and their potential use in synthesis. Now, a Bi(I)-based allyl cation, which can be seen as a heavy congener of all-carbon π-allyl cations, has been reported. This complex serves as a synthon for Bi(I) transfer, enabling access to low-valent organobismuth compounds.},

  abstract     = {The biosynthesis of the lincosamide antibiotics lincomycin A and celesticetin involves the pyridoxal-5′-phosphate (PLP)-dependent enzymes LmbF and CcbF, which are responsible for bifurcation of the biosynthetic pathways. Despite recognizing the same S-glycosyl-l-cysteine structure of the substrates, LmbF catalyses thiol formation through β-elimination, whereas CcbF produces S-acetaldehyde through decarboxylation-coupled oxidative deamination. The structural basis for the diversification mechanism remains largely unexplored. Here we conduct structure–function analyses of LmbF and CcbF. X-ray crystal structures, docking and molecular dynamics simulations reveal that active-site aromatic residues play important roles in controlling the substrate binding mode and the reaction outcome. Furthermore, the reaction selectivity and oxygen-utilization of LmbF and CcbF were rationally engineered through structure- and calculation-based mutagenesis. Thus, the catalytic function of CcbF was switched to that of LmbF, and, remarkably, both LmbF and CcbF variants gained the oxidative-amidation activity to produce an unnatural S-acetamide derivative of lincosamide. The reaction mechanisms of the pyridoxal phosphate (PLP)-dependent enzymes LmbF and CcbF—involved in the biosynthesis of the antibiotic lincosamide—are characterized here. Structure–function analyses reveal structural features responsible for S-alkyl moiety diversification in lincosamides. Using structure- and calculation-based enzyme engineering, the selectivity profiles of these enzymes are designed to generate an unnatural lincosamide derivative.},

  abstract     = {Lithium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide-based liquid electrolytes are promising for realizing high coulombic efficiency and long cycle life in next-generation Li-metal batteries. However, the role of anions in the formation of the solid–electrolyte interphase remains unclear. Here we combine electrochemical analyses and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements, both with and without sample washing, together with computational simulations, to propose the reaction pathways of electrolyte decomposition and correlate the interphase component solubility with the efficacy of passivation. We discover that not all the products derived from interphase-forming reactions are incorporated into the resulting passivation layer, with a notable portion present in the liquid electrolyte. We also find that the high-performance electrolytes can afford a sufficiently passivating interphase with minimized electrolyte decomposition, by incorporating more anion-decomposition products. Overall, this work presents a systematic approach of coupling electrochemical and surface analyses to paint a comprehensive picture of solid–electrolyte interphase formation, while identifying the key attributes of high-performance electrolytes to guide future designs. Li-metal batteries often utilize liquid electrolytes that yield a solid–electrolyte interphase on electrodes; however, the role of anions in interphase formation remains unclear. Now it has been shown that anion-decomposition products provide varying contributions to interphase formation and that high-performance electrolytes balance effective interfacial passivation with minimized degradation.},

  abstract     = {In nature, peptides are enzymatically modified to constrain their structure and introduce functional moieties. De novo peptide structures could be built by combining enzymes from different pathways, but determining the rules of their use is difficult. We present a biophysical model to combine enzymes sourced from bacterial ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptide (RiPP) gene clusters. Using a pipeline to evaluate more than 1,000 peptides, the model was parameterized under uniform conditions in Escherichia coli for enzymes from different classes (graspetide, spliceotide, pantocin, cyanobactin, glycocin, lasso peptide and lanthipeptide). Synthetic leader peptides with recognition sequences for up to three enzymes were designed to modify core sequences sharing no identity to natural RiPPs. Empirically, RiPPs with the desired modifications constituted 7–67% of the total peptides produced, and 6 of our 8 peptide designs were successfully modified. This work is an example of the design of enzyme-modified peptides and libraries, using a framework that can be expanded to include new enzymes and chemical moieties. Combining enzymes from different pathways in nature could enable de novo peptide design, but determining enzyme-specificity rules is non-trivial. Here a biophysical model combining enzymes sourced from bacterial ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptide (RiPP) gene clusters was generated to formalize enzyme-specificity rules and create peptide scaffolds with defined post-translational modifications.},

  abstract     = {sp2-carbon-linked covalent organic frameworks (sp2c-COFs) are crystalline porous polymers with repeat organic units linked by sp2 carbons, and have attracted increasing interest due to their robust skeleton and tunable semiconducting properties. Single-crystalline sp2c-COFs with well-defined structures can represent an ideal platform for investigating fundamental physics properties and device performance. However, the robust olefin bonds inhibit the reversible-reaction-based crystal self-correction, thus yielding polycrystalline or amorphous polymers. Here we report an imine-to-olefin transformation strategy to form single-crystal sp2c-COFs. The isolated single crystals display rectangular nanotube-like domains with sizes up to approximately 24 μm × 0.8 μm × 0.8 μm, and permanent pore distribution around 1.1 nm. The highly conjugated olefin linkage endows the crystals with enhanced electronic connectivity which determines a remarkable room-temperature metal-free ferromagnetism (8.6 × 10−3 emu g−1). Our protocol is robust and generally applicable for the synthesis of single-crystalline sp2c-COFs for future spin-electron devices. Olefin-linked covalent organic frameworks are materials with potential application as organic semiconductors, but their synthesis remains challenging. Now, single-crystal sp2-carbon-linked covalent organic frameworks have been prepared through an imine-to-olefin transformation strategy; the resulting materials feature enhanced room-temperature metal-free ferromagnetism.},

  abstract     = {Heterocycle skeletal editing has recently emerged as a powerful tactic for achieving heterocycle-to-heterocycle transmutation without the need for multistep de novo heterocycle synthesis. However, the enantioselective skeletal editing of heteroarenes through single-atom logic remains challenging. Here we report the enantiodivergent dearomative skeletal editing of indoles and pyrroles via an asymmetric carbon-atom insertion, using trifluoromethyl N-triftosylhydrazones as carbene precursors. This strategy provides a straightforward methodology to access enantiomerically enriched six-membered N-heterocycles containing a trifluoromethylated quaternary stereocentre from planar N-heteroarenes. The synthetic utility of this enantiodivergent methodology was demonstrated by a broad evaluation of reaction scope, product derivatization and concise syntheses of drug analogues. Mechanistic studies reveal that the excellent asymmetric induction arises from the initial cyclopropanation step. The asymmetric single-atom insertion strategy is expected to have a broad impact on the field of single-atom skeletal editing and catalytic asymmetric dearomatization of aromatic compounds. Skeletal editing has emerged as an appealing strategy for scaffold-hopping-based drug discovery, but the enantioselective single-atom skeletal editing of N-heteroarenes is challenging.

  abstract     = {Understanding the dynamics of membrane protein–ligand interactions within a native lipid bilayer is a major goal for drug discovery. Typically, cell-based assays are used, however, they are often blind to the effects of protein modifications. In this study, using the archetypal G protein-coupled receptor rhodopsin, we found that the receptor and its effectors can be released directly from retina rod disc membranes using infrared irradiation in a mass spectrometer. Subsequent isolation and dissociation by infrared multiphoton dissociation enabled the sequencing of individual retina proteoforms. Specifically, we categorized distinct proteoforms of rhodopsin, localized labile palmitoylations, discovered a Gβγ proteoform that abolishes membrane association and defined lipid modifications on G proteins that influence their assembly. Given reports of undesirable side-effects involving vision, we characterized the off-target drug binding of two phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitors, vardenafil and sildenafil, to the retina rod phosphodiesterase 6 (PDE6). The results demonstrate differential off-target reactivity with PDE6 and an interaction preference for lipidated proteoforms of G proteins. In summary, this study highlights the opportunities for probing proteoform–ligand interactions within natural membrane environments. G protein-coupled receptors and their effectors can now be released directly from a lipid bilayer using infrared irradiation for proteoform-level characterization by native top-down mass spectrometry. This represents a critical development for drug discovery, as the direct role of post-translational modifications in protein–protein and protein–drug interactions can be characterized.},

Application to the silica–water interface revealed the emergence of unexpected surface reaction pathways with water. With ab initio molecular dynamics and metadynamics simulations, we uncovered a surface reconstruction, triggered by deprotonation of surface hydroxylated groups, that led to unconventional five-coordinated silicon species. The results help demystify the multimodal chemistry of aqueous silica discovered decades ago, bringing in fresh information that modifies the current understanding. Our study will provide new opportunities for future in-depth physical and chemical characterizations of other oxide–water interfaces. Water–oxide interfaces are ubiquitous in nature, yet a molecular-level understanding of these complex environments is still lacking. Now, using in situ nonlinear optical spectroscopy, unconventional reaction pathways have been revealed during the structural evolution of a silicon oxide surface in liquid water, resolving long-standing controversies and providing new microscopic insights.},

  abstract     = {Hard ticks feed on their host for multiple days. To ensure firm attachment, they secrete a protein-rich saliva that eventually forms a solid cement cone. The underlying mechanism of this liquid-to-solid transition is currently not understood. This study focuses on the phase transitions of a disordered glycine-rich protein (GRP) found in tick saliva. We show that GRP undergoes liquid–liquid phase separation via simple coacervation to form biomolecular condensates in salty environments. Cation–π and π–π interactions mediated by periodically placed arginine and aromatic amino-acid residues are the primary driving forces that promote phase separation. Interestingly, GRP condensates exhibit ageing by undergoing liquid-to-gel transition over time and exhibit adhesive properties, similar to the naturally occurring cement cone. Finally, we provide evidence for protein-rich condensates in natural tick saliva. Our findings provide a starting point to gain further insights into the bioadhesion of ticks, to develop novel tick control strategies, and towards achieving biomedical applications such as tissue sealants. Ticks adhere firmly to their host by secreting a protein-rich saliva that eventually forms a solid bioadhesive, but the mechanism underlying this phase transition is not understood. Now it has been shown that a disordered glycine-rich protein present in tick saliva undergoes liquid–liquid phase separation, followed by a liquid-to-gel transition, and exhibits adhesive properties.},

Here we report the preparation of uniform single-crystal meso-MOF nanoparticles with ordered mesopore channels in microporous frameworks with definite arrangements, through a cooperative assembly method co-mediated by strong and weak acids. These nanoparticles feature a truncated octahedron shape with variable size and well-defined two-dimensional hexagonally structured (p6mm) columnar mesopores. Notably, the match between the crystallization kinetics of MOFs and the assembly kinetics of micelles is critical for forming the single-crystal meso-MOFs. On the basis of this strategy, we have constructed a library of meso-MOFs with tunable large pore sizes, controllable mesophases, various morphologies and multivariate components. The imbalance in structural tension between crystalline materials and surfactant micelles makes the synthesis of crystalline mesoporous metal–organic frameworks (meso-MOFs) challenging.

It is unknown how the earliest forms of life were compartmentalized. Several models have suggested a role for single-chain lipids such as fatty acids, but the membranes formed are often unstable, particularly when made from shorter alkyl chains (≤C8) that were probably more prevalent on prebiotic Earth. Here we show that the amino acid cysteine can spontaneously react with two short-chain (C8) thioesters to form diacyl lipids, generating protocell-like membrane vesicles. The three-component reaction takes place rapidly in water using low concentrations of reactants. Silica can catalyse the formation of protocells through a simple electrostatic mechanism. Several simple aminothiols react to form diacyl lipids, including short peptides. The protocells formed are compatible with functional ribozymes, suggesting that coupling of multiple short-chain precursors may have provided membrane building blocks during the early evolution of cells. It is unknown what lipids formed the membranes of early life forms. Now it has been shown that protocell vesicles can assemble from diacylcysteines, which form spontaneously from cysteine and short-chain thioesters. Silica catalyses membrane formation, and protocells formed from diacylcysteine lipids are compatible with ribozyme activity.},

However, the similar physical properties of these molecules and the inherent trade-off among adsorption capacity, selectivity, diffusion kinetic and host–guest binding interactions in molecular sieving adsorbents makes their separation challenging. Here we report the separation of propylene/propane mixtures through a crystalline porous material (HAF-1) that features channels and shrinkage throats—the latter defined as narrower channels that connect the main channels and a molecular pocket—where the throat aperture is between the kinetic diameters of propylene and propane. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction and computational simulation reveal that the shrinkage channels and hanging molecular pockets are key to ensure high sieving efficiency and high propylene adsorption capacity. Dynamic breakthrough experiments show that HAF-1 enables the achievement of high-purity (≥99.7%) propylene with a productivity of 33.9 l kg−1 by just one adsorption–desorption circle from propylene/propane mixtures. Propylene and propane have similar physicochemical properties, and thus their separation is challenging. Now, as an alternative to energy-intensive cryogenic distillation methods, a molecular sieving adsorbent with high propylene adsorption capacity has been shown to sieve propylene from propylene/propane mixtures to yield high-purity propylene.},

  abstract     = {The transition of chemistry into biology is poorly understood. Key questions include how the inherently divergent nature of chemical reactions can be curtailed, and whether Darwinian principles from biology extend to chemistry. Addressing both questions simultaneously, we now show that the evolutionary principle of competitive exclusion, which states that a single niche can be stably occupied by only one species, also applies to self-replicating chemical systems, and that this principle diminishes the tendency of chemistry to diversify. Specifically, we report two systems in which three different self-replicator quasi-species emerge in a largely stochastic fashion from a mixture of two building blocks (resources). Competitive exclusion leads to the selection of only a single quasi-species when all replicators rely to the same extent on both resources. When one of the quasi-species preferentially uses one resource and another quasi-species specializes in the other (resource partitioning), these replicator quasi-species effectively occupy different niches and were found to coexist in an evolutionary stable steady state. It is unclear whether Darwinian principles extend to chemistry and if they can direct chemistry to produce specific products. Now it has been shown that competition between self-replicating molecules can result in the survival of the fittest product or coexistence of a small subset of products, depending on how resources are partitioned between the replicators.},

Here we report an approach to transient amide bond formation and use it to harness chemical energy and convert it to mechanical motion by integrating dissipative self-assembly and the Marangoni effect in a source–sink system. Droplets are formed through dissipative self-assembly following the reaction of octylamine with 2,3-dimethylmaleic anhydride. The resulting amides are hydrolytically labile, making the droplets transient, which enables them to act as a source of octylamine. A sink for octylamine was created by placing a drop of oleic acid at the air–water interface. This source–sink system sets up a gradient in surface tension, which gives rise to a macroscopic Marangoni flow that can transport the droplets in solution with tunable speed. Carbodiimides can fuel this motion by converting diacid waste back to anhydride. This study shows how fuelling at the molecular level can, via assembly at the supramolecular level, lead to liquid flow at the macroscopic level. The use of molecules as fuels to achieve function is largely unexplored. Now it has been shown that fuelled dissipative self-assembly can yield transient droplets that release a surfactant, driving the macroscopic transport of these droplets.},

The transient nature of condensates and the multiple localizations of clients, however, have rendered it challenging to determine compartment-specific PPIs. Here we developed a condensation-enhanced, spatially directed, metabolic incorporation-assisted photocrosslinking strategy—termed DenseMAP—for spatiotemporally resolved dissection of the direct protein interactome within condensates. By leveraging our condensation-enhanced photocrosslinker and the spatially directed biotin tagging, DenseMAP enabled stress-granule-specific interactome mapping of the N6-methyladenosine readers YTHDF1 and YTHDF2, and uncovered the functional role of phosphorylation on the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein in regulating virus replication. Further applying DenseMAP for direct interactome mapping of the subcompartmental scaffold protein NPM1 deciphered nucleolar granular component proteome, and unveiled the critical role of SUMOylation in controlling nucleolar proteome homeostasis. DenseMAP provides a platform technology for analysing functional PPI networks within subcellular and subcompartmental condensates under diverse physiological and/or pathological settings. Now a generalizable method that couples spatially directed tagging with condensation-enhanced crosslinking—termed DenseMAP—has been developed for profiling the spatiotemporal protein interactome within biomolecular condensates. By linking the information between protein interactions and subcellular locations, DenseMAP has uncovered regulatory mechanisms in subcellular and subcompartmental condensates.},

Ozonolysis is one of the most canonical transformations that converts alkenes into molecules bearing carbon–oxygen motifs via C=C bond cleavage. Despite its extensive use in both industrial and laboratory settings, the aza version—cleavage of alkenes to form carbon–nitrogen bonds—remains elusive. Here we report the conversion of alkenes into valuable amines via complete C=C bond disconnection. This process, which we have termed ‘triazenolysis’, is initiated by a (3 + 2) cycloaddition of triazadienium cation to an alkene. The triazolinium salt formed accepts hydride from borohydride anion and spontaneously decomposes to create new C–N motifs upon further reduction. The developed reaction is applicable to a broad range of cyclic alkenes to produce diamines, while various acyclic C=C bonds may be broken to generate two separate amine units. Computational analysis provides insights into the mechanism, including identification of the key step and elucidating the significance of Lewis acid catalysis. Ozonolysis reactions convert alkenes into carbon–oxygen compounds via C=C bond cleavage. Now the cleavage of alkenes to form carbon–nitrogen bonds—the aza version of ozonolysis, termed triazenolysis—has been developed.

  abstract     = {Molecular catalysts offer tunable active and peripheral sites, rendering them ideal model systems to explore fundamental concepts in catalysis. However, hydrophobic designs are often regarded as detrimental for dissolution in aqueous electrolytes. Here we show that established cobalt terpyridine catalysts modified with hydrophobic perfluorinated alkyl side chains can assemble at the gas–liquid–solid interfaces on a gas diffusion electrode. We find that the self-assembly of these perfluorinated units on the electrode surface results in a catalytic system selective for electrochemical CO2 reduction to CH4, whereas every other cobalt terpyridine catalyst reported previously was only selective for CO or formate. Mechanistic investigations suggest that the pyridine units function as proton shuttles that deliver protons to the dynamic hydrophobic pocket in which CO2 reduction takes place. Finally, integration with fluorinated carbon nanotubes as a hydrophobic conductive scaffold leads to a Faradaic efficiency for CH4 production above 80% at rates above 10 mA cm−2—impressive activities for a molecular electrocatalytic system. Although molecular complexes can serve as well-defined model catalysts for CO2 electroreduction, few compounds reduce CO2 beyond two electrons. Now, hydrophobic molecular cobalt terpyridine complexes, containing perfluorinated alkyl side chains, have been shown to assemble at the gas–liquid–solid interface and to electrocatalytically reduce CO2 to methane with high efficiencies.},

In theory, the BODIPY core skeleton has several sites that could be decorated with different substituents. However, due to the lack of general and efficient asymmetric synthetic methods, this potential diversity of chiral BODIPYs has not been exploited. Here we demonstrate a modular enantioselective assembly of multi-substituted boron-stereogenic BODIPYs in high efficiency with excellent enantioselectivities. Key to the success is the Pd-catalysed desymmetric Suzuki cross-coupling, enabling the precise discrimination of the two α C–Cl bonds of the designed prochiral BODIPY scaffold, giving access to a wide range of highly functionalized boron-stereogenic BODIPYs.

  abstract     = {Carbonyl desaturation is a fundamental reaction widely practised in organic synthesis. While numerous methods have been developed to expand the scope of this important transformation, most of them necessitate multi-step protocols or suffer from the use of high loadings of metal or strong oxidizing conditions. Moreover, approaches that can achieve precise stereochemical control of the desaturation process are extremely rare. Here we report a biocatalytic platform for desymmetrizing desaturation of cyclohexanones to generate diverse cyclohexenones bearing a remote quaternary stereogenic centre, by reengineering ‘ene’-reductases to efficiently mediate dehydrogenation, the reverse process of their native activity. This ‘ene’-reductase-based desaturation system operates under mild conditions with air as the terminal oxidant, tolerates oxidation-sensitive or metal-incompatible functional groups and, more importantly, exhibits unparalleled stereoselectivity compared with those achieved with small-molecule catalysts. Mechanistic investigations suggest that the reaction proceeded through α-deprotonation followed by a rate-determining β-hydride transfer. Expanding the biocatalysis toolbox for selective desaturation is of great value. Now ‘ene’-reductases have been repurposed to mediate dehydrogenation, the reverse process of their native activity. The developed biocatalytic desaturation platform enables desymmetrizing desaturation of cyclohexanones for the synthesis of diverse cyclohexenones that bear a remote quaternary stereogenic centre.},

  abstract     = {Infinite-layer transition metal oxides with two-dimensional oxygen coordination exhibit intriguing electronic and magnetic properties due to strong in-plane orbital hybridization. The synthesis of this distinctive structure has primarily relied on kinetically controlled reduction of oxygen-rich phases featuring three-dimensional polyhedral oxygen coordination. Here, using in situ atomic-resolution electron microscopy, we scrutinize the intricate atomic-scale mechanisms of oxygen conduction leading to the transformation of SrFeO2.5 to infinite-layer SrFeO2. The oxygen release is highly anisotropic and governed by the lattice reorientation aligning the fast diffusion channels towards the outlet, which is facilitated by cooperative yet shuffle displacements of iron and oxygen ions. Accompanied with the oxygen release, the three-dimensional to two-dimensional reconfiguration of oxygen is facilitated by the lattice flexibility of FeOx polyhedral layers, adopting multiple discrete transient states following the sequence determined by the least energy-costing pathways. Similar transformation mechanism may operate in cuprate and nickelate superconductors, which are isostructural with SrFeO2. Understanding the structural rearrangements of infinite-layer transition metal oxides at the atomic level remains challenging. Now in situ electron microscopy has been used to monitor the formation of infinite-layer SrFeO2 through an oxygen deintercalation process; lattice flexibility of the FeOx polyhedral layers facilitates the phase transformation.},

  abstract     = {Pluripotent cells can yield different cell types determined by the specific sequence of differentiation signals that they encounter as the cell activates or deactivates functions and retains memory of previous inputs. Here, we achieved pluripotency in synthetic cells by incorporating three dormant apo-metalloenzymes such that they could differentiate towards distinct fates, depending on the sequence of specific metal ion transport with ionophores. In the first differentiation step, we selectively transported one of three extracellular metal ion cofactors into pluripotent giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs), which resulted in elevation of intracellular pH, hydrogen peroxide production or GUV lysis. Previously added ionophores suppress transport with subsequent ionophores owing to interactions among them in the membrane, as corroborated by atomistic simulations. Consequently, the addition of a second ionophore elicits a dampened response in the multipotent GUV and a third ionophore results in no further response, reminiscent of a terminally differentiated GUV. The pluripotent GUV can differentiate into five final fates, depending on the sequence in which the three ionophores are added. The sequence of specific differentiation signals determines the fate of a pluripotent cell. Here pluripotency was introduced into synthetic cells by loading them with three dormant apo-metalloenzymes, which were activated through selective metal ion transport by one of three ionophores. Depending on the sequence of metal ion intake, the synthetic cells differentiated towards five distinct fates.},

  abstract     = {Amino alcohols are vital in natural products, pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals, and as key building blocks for various applications. Traditional synthesis methods often rely on polar bond retrosynthetic analysis, requiring extensive protecting group manipulations that complicate direct access. Here we show a streamlined approach using a serine-derived chiral carboxylic acid in stereoselective electrocatalytic decarboxylative transformations, enabling efficient access to enantiopure amino alcohols. Unlike conventional strategies, this radical method is both modular and general, offering stereoselective and chemoselective synthesis of diverse substituted amino alcohols. For example, aryl, alkenyl, alkyl and acyl fragments can be coupled efficiently with the serine-derived chiral acid under electrocatalytic decarboxylative conditions. We demonstrate its utility through the rapid synthesis of medicinally important compounds, as well as useful building blocks, highlighting its ability to simplify complex synthetic pathways through entirely different bond disconnections. This electrocatalytic method is robust and scalable, as demonstrated in a 72-gram-scale flow reaction. Amino alcohols are essential in pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals and other applications. Now, using a serine-derived chiral carboxylic acid, an electrocatalytic decarboxylative transformation enables efficient and stereoselective access to diverse amino alcohols. This method is scalable, modular and could offer rapid synthesis of medicinal compounds and key building blocks.},

They feature either a singlet or a triplet ground state, depending on the electronic properties of the substituents. Triplet nitrenes are highly reactive and their isolation in the condensed phase under ambient conditions is challenging. Here we report the synthesis and isolation of a triplet arylnitrene supported by a bulky hydrindacene ligand. The arylnitrene is fully characterized by various spectroscopic and structural techniques including electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy and single-crystal X-ray diffraction. Its high stability is largely attributed to the steric hindrance and effective electron delocalization provided by the supporting ligand. Electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy in conjunction with highly correlated wavefunction-based ab initio calculations provides support for a triplet ground state nitrene with axial zero-field splitting D = 0.92 cm–1 and vanishing rhombicity E/D = 0.002. Triplet nitrenes are highly reactive species and thus their isolation and characterization are challenging. Now, a bulky hydrindacene ligand has been used to stabilize a triplet arylnitrene synthesized through photolysis of an azide precursor under mild conditions. The triplet nitrene has been fully characterized by various techniques including single-crystal X-ray diffraction, electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy and theoretical calculations.},

  abstract     = {In hybrid metal halide perovskites, chiroptical properties typically arise from structural symmetry breaking by incorporating a chiral A-site organic cation within the structure, which may limit the compositional space. Here we demonstrate highly efficient remote chirality transfer where chirality is imposed on an otherwise achiral hybrid metal halide semiconductor by a proximal chiral molecule that is not interspersed as part of the structure yet leads to large circular dichroism dissymmetry factors (gCD) of up to 10−2. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the transfer of stereochemical information from the chiral proximal molecule to the inorganic framework is mediated by selective interaction with divalent metal cations. Anchoring of the chiral molecule induces a centro-asymmetric distortion, which is discernible up to four inorganic layers into the metal halide lattice. This concept is broadly applicable to low-dimensional hybrid metal halides with various dimensionalities (1D and 2D) allowing independent control of the composition and degree of chirality. Hybrid metal halide semiconductors typically rely on chiral A-site ammonium cations for chiral induction in the lattice. Now it has been shown that chirality in low-dimensional achiral metal halide semiconductors can be induced by non-ammonium, non-A-site chiral molecules through remote stereocontrol of the inorganic framework.},

  abstract     = {Benzene reduction by molecular complexes remains an important synthetic challenge, requiring harsh reaction conditions involving group I metals. Reductions of benzene, to date, typically result in a loss of aromaticity, although the benzene tetra-anion, a 10π-electron system, has been calculated to be stable and aromatic. Due to the lack of sufficiently potent reductants, four-electron reduction of benzene usually requires the use of group I metals. Here we demonstrate the four-electron reduction of benzene and some of its derivatives using a samarium(ii) alkyl reagent, with no requirement for group I metals. Whereas organosamarium(ii) typically reacts through one-electron processes, the compounds reported here feature a rare two-electron process. Combined experimental and computational results implicate a transient samarium(i) intermediate involved in this reduction process, which ultimately provides the benzene tetra-anion. The remarkably strong reducing power of this samarium(ii) alkyl implies a rich reactivity, providing scope for its application as a reducing agent. Benzene reduction by molecular complexes remains a considerable synthetic challenge, and typically requires harsh reaction conditions involving group I metals. Now it has been shown that a highly polar organometallic samarium alkyl complex enables the reduction of benzene to its tetra-anion without the need for a group I metal.},

  abstract     = {Understanding the emergence of complex biochemical systems, such as protein translation, is a great challenge. Although synthetic approaches can provide insight into the potential early stages of life, they do not address the equally important question of why the complex systems of life would have evolved. In particular, the intricacies of the mechanisms governing the transfer of information from nucleic acid sequences to proteins make it difficult to imagine how coded protein synthesis could have emerged from a prebiotic soup. Here we discuss the use of intellectual frameworks in studying the emergence of life. We discuss how one such framework, namely the RNA world theory, has spurred research, and provide an overview of its limitations. We suggest that the emergence of coded protein synthesis could be broken into experimentally tractable problems by treating it as a molecular bricolage—a complex system integrating many different parts, each of which originally evolved for uses unrelated to its modern function—to promote a concrete understanding of its origin. It has been challenging to rationalize the emergence of complex biochemical systems because many parts with different functions needed to come together. This Perspective proposes a molecular bricolage—an evolutionary tinkering involving parts that initially evolved for unrelated functions—to provide an intellectual framework to study the origin of protein translation.},
