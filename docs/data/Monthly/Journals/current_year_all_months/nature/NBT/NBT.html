  abstract     = {Porphyrins and their derivatives find extensive applications in medicine, food, energy and materials. In this study, we produced porphyrin compounds by combining Rhodobacter sphaeroides as an efficient cell factory with enzymatic catalysis. Genome-wide CRISPRi-based screening in R. sphaeroides identifies hemN as a target for improved coproporphyrin III (CPIII) production, and exploiting phosphorylation of PrrA further improves the production of bioactive CPIII to 16.5 g L−1 by fed-batch fermentation. Subsequent screening and engineering high-activity metal chelatases and coproheme decarboxylase results in the synthesis of various metalloporphyrins, including heme and the anti-tumor agent zincphyrin. After pilot-scale fermentation (200 L) and setting up the purification process for CPIII (purity &gt;95%), we scaled up the production of heme and zincphyrin through enzymatic catalysis in a 5-L bioreactor, with CPIII achieving respective enzyme conversion rates of 63% and 98% and yielding 10.8 g L−1 and 21.3 g L−1, respectively. Our strategy offers a solution for high-yield bioproduction of heme and other valuable porphyrins with substantial industrial and medical applications. Porphyrins are produced at scale through metabolic engineering and optimization of CPIII purification.},

We use a high-throughput growth-coupled selection assay and a directed evolution approach to rapidly identify origin of replication mutations that influence copy number and screen for mutants that improve Agrobacterium-mediated transformation (AMT) efficiency. By introducing these mutations into binary vectors within the plasmid backbone used for AMT, we observe improved transient transformation of Nicotiana benthamiana in four diverse tested origins (pVS1, RK2, pSa and BBR1). For the best-performing origin, pVS1, we isolate higher-copy-number variants that increase stable transformation efficiencies by 60–100% in Arabidopsis thaliana and 390% in the oleaginous yeast Rhodosporidium toruloides. Our work provides an easily deployable framework to generate plasmid copy number variants that will enable greater precision in prokaryotic genetic engineering, in addition to improving AMT efficiency. Agrobacterium-mediated transformation of plants and fungi is enhanced by plasmid copy number variants.},

Here we introduce Droplet Hi-C, which uses a commercial microfluidic device for high-throughput, single-cell chromatin conformation profiling in droplets. Using Droplet Hi-C, we mapped the chromatin architecture of the mouse cortex and analyzed gene regulatory programs in major cortical cell types. In addition, we used this technique to detect copy number variations, structural variations and extrachromosomal DNA in human glioblastoma, colorectal and blood cancer cells, revealing clonal dynamics and other oncogenic events during treatment. We refined the technique to allow joint profiling of chromatin architecture and transcriptome in single cells, facilitating exploration of the links between chromatin architecture and gene expression in both normal tissues and tumors. Thus, Droplet Hi-C both addresses critical gaps in chromatin analysis of heterogeneous tissues and enhances understanding of gene regulation. Chromatin organization is measured in single cells using droplet microfluidics.},

Here, we introduce targeted recognition of antigen–MHC complex reporter for MHC I (TRACeR-I), a generalizable platform for targeting peptides on polymorphic HLA-A*, HLA-B* and HLA-C* allotypes while overcoming the cross-reactivity challenges of TCRs. Our TRACeR–MHC I co-crystal structure reveals a unique antigen recognition mechanism, with TRACeR forming extensive contacts across the entire peptide length to confer single-residue specificity at the accessible positions. We demonstrate rapid screening of TRACeR-I against a panel of disease-relevant HLAs with peptides derived from human viruses (human immunodeficiency virus, Epstein–Barr virus and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2), and oncoproteins (Kirsten rat sarcoma virus, paired-like homeobox 2b and New York esophageal squamous cell carcinoma 1). TRACeR-based bispecific T cell engagers and chimeric antigen receptor T cells exhibit on-target killing of tumor cells with high efficacy in the low nanomolar range. Our platform empowers the development of broadly applicable MHC I-targeting molecules for research, diagnostic and therapeutic applications. A protein platform rapidly develops peptide-focused major histocompatibility complex class I binders with high specificity.},

Targeting peptide–MHCII with T cell antigen receptors (TCRs) and TCR-like antibodies has shown promise for autoimmune diseases and microbiome tolerance. To develop a general targeting approach, we introduce targeted recognition of antigen–MHC complex reporter for MHCII (TRACeR-II) for the rapid development of peptide-specific MHCII binders. TRACeR-II binders have a small helical bundle scaffold and use a single loop to recognize peptide–MHCII, which offers versatility and enables structural modeling of the interactions to target MHCII antigens. We demonstrate rapid generation of TRACeR-II binders to multiple molecules with affinities in the low-nanomolar to low-micromolar range, comparable to best-in-class TCRs and antibodies. Through computational protein design, we created specific binding sequences in silico from only the sequence of a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 peptide. TRACeR-II provides a straightforward approach to target antigen–MHCII without relying on combinatorial selection on complementarity-determining region loops. Specific binders to peptide–MHC class II are rapidly generated without laborious screening.},

ReChb shares 53% sequence identity with the closest Cas12a ortholog but no longer requires a T-rich PAM and can achieve genome editing in human cells at sites inaccessible to the natural FnCas12a or the engineered and PAM-flexible enAsCas12a. Furthermore, ReChb can be triggered not only by double-stranded DNA but also by single-stranded RNA and DNA targets, leading to non-specific collateral cleavage of all three nucleic acid substrates with similar efficiencies. Finally, tertiary and quaternary structures of ReChb obtained by cryogenic electron microscopy reveal the molecular details underlying its expanded biophysical activities. Overall, ReChb expands the application space of Cas12a nucleases and underscores the potential of ASR for enhancing CRISPR technologies. ReChb is a Cas12a nuclease with expanded target access and substrate recognition.},

Prime editing has been applied to install and evaluate genetic variants, but previous approaches have been limited by the variable efficiency of prime editing guide RNAs. Here we present a high-throughput prime editing sensor strategy that couples prime editing guide RNAs with synthetic versions of their cognate target sites to quantitatively assess the functional impact of endogenous genetic variants. We screen over 1,000 endogenous cancer-associated variants of TP53—the most frequently mutated gene in cancer—to identify alleles that impact p53 function in mechanistically diverse ways. We find that certain endogenous TP53 variants, particularly those in the p53 oligomerization domain, display opposite phenotypes in exogenous overexpression systems. Our results emphasize the physiological importance of gene dosage in shaping native protein stoichiometry and protein–protein interactions, and establish a framework for studying genetic variants in their endogenous sequence context at scale. Prime editing sensor libraries evaluate diverse genetic variants in their endogenous genomic contexts.},

The system uses barcoded guide RNAs loaded within DNA-free eVLP-packaged cargos to uniquely label each eVLP variant in a library, enabling the identification of desired variants following selections for desired properties. We applied this system to mutate and select eVLP capsids with improved eVLP production properties or transduction efficiencies in human cells. By combining beneficial capsid mutations, we developed fifth-generation (v5) eVLPs, which exhibit a 2–4-fold increase in cultured mammalian cell delivery potency compared to previous-best v4 eVLPs. Analyses of v5 eVLPs suggest that these capsid mutations optimize packaging and delivery of desired ribonucleoprotein cargos rather than native viral genomes and substantially alter eVLP capsid structure. These findings suggest the potential of barcoded eVLP evolution to support the development of improved eVLPs. Engineered virus-like particles are improved through directed evolution.},

The library includes markers mapping to protein-binding interfaces and markers reporting on structural changes that accompany PPI changes. Integrating the marker library with LiP–MS data allows for global profiling of protein–protein interactions (PPIs) from unfractionated lysates. We apply FLiP–MS to Saccharomyces cerevisiae and probe changes in protein complex dynamics after DNA replication stress, identifying links between Spt-Ada-Gcn5 acetyltransferase activity and the assembly state of several complexes. FLiP–MS enables protein complex dynamics to be probed on any perturbation, proteome-wide, at high throughput, with peptide-level structural resolution and informing on occupancy of binding interfaces, thus providing both global and molecular views of a system under study.

Although promising, existing RNA-editing tools generally suffer from a trade-off between efficacy and specificity, and off-target editing remains an unsolved problem. Here we describe the development of an optimized RNA-editing platform by rational protein engineering, CasRx-based Programmable Editing of RNA Technology (xPERT). We demonstrate that the topological rearrangement of a CasRx K940L mutant by circular permutation results in a robust scaffold for the tethering of a deaminase domain. We benchmark our tool against the REPAIR system and show that xPERT exhibits strong on-target activity like REPAIRv1 but low off-target editing like REPAIRv2. Our xPERT platform can be used to alter RNA sequence information without risking genome damage, effect temporary cellular changes and customize protein function. Site-specific and efficient RNA editing is achieved with a CasRx editor.},

Here, we expand the specimens at least tenfold, label them with conventional fluorophores and image them with conventional light microscopes, acquiring videos in which we analyze fluorescence fluctuations. One-step nanoscale expansion (ONE) microscopy enables the visualization of the shapes of individual membrane and soluble proteins, achieving around 1-nm resolution. We show that conformational changes are readily observable, such as those undergone by the ~17-kDa protein calmodulin upon Ca2+ binding. ONE is also applied to clinical samples, analyzing the morphology of protein aggregates in cerebrospinal fluid from persons with Parkinson disease, potentially aiding disease diagnosis. This technology bridges the gap between high-resolution structural biology techniques and light microscopy, providing new avenues for discoveries in biology and medicine.

Here we develop dCas9-mediated high-throughput recruitment (HT-recruit), a pooled screening method for quantifying effector function at endogenous target genes and test effector function for a library containing 5,092 nuclear protein Pfam domains across varied contexts. We also map context dependencies of effectors drawn from unannotated protein regions using a larger library tiling chromatin regulators and transcription factors. We find that many effectors depend on target and DBD contexts, such as HLH domains that can act as either activators or repressors. To enable efficient perturbations, we select context-robust domains, including ZNF705 KRAB, that improve CRISPRi tools to silence promoters and enhancers. We engineer a compact human activator called NFZ, by combining NCOA3, FOXO3 and ZNF473 domains, which enables efficient CRISPRa with better viral delivery and inducible control of chimeric antigen receptor T cells. Improved effectors for CRISPRi/CRISPRa are developed following high-throughput screening of transcriptional domains.},

We show that disease-associated mutations are enriched in PIONEER-predicted protein–protein interfaces and explore their impact on disease prognosis and drug responses. We identify 586 significant protein–protein interactions (PPIs) enriched with PIONEER-predicted interface somatic mutations (termed oncoPPIs) from analysis of approximately 11,000 whole exomes across 33 cancer types and show significant associations of oncoPPIs with patient survival and drug responses. PIONEER, implemented as both a web server platform and a software package, identifies functional consequences of disease-associated alleles and offers a deep learning tool for precision medicine at multiscale interactome network levels.

Here we report a metabolizable binary supracluster (BSCgal) that combines gold nanoclusters as radiosensitizing adjuvants with small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting the immunosuppressive mediator galectin-1 (Gal-1). BSCgal comprises reversibly crosslinked cationic gold nanoclusters and siRNA complexes in a polymer matrix that biodegrades over weeks, facilitating clearance (90.3% in vivo clearance at 4 weeks) to reduce toxicity. The particle size well above the renal filtration threshold facilitates passive delivery to tumors. Using mouse models of head and neck cancer, we show that BSCgal augments the radiodynamic and immunotherapeutic effects of SABR at the primary and metastatic tumors by promoting tumor-inhibitory leukocytes, upregulating cytotoxic granzyme B and reducing immunosuppressive cell populations. It outperforms SABR plus Gal-1 antagonists, chemoradiation drug cisplatin or PD-1 inhibitor. This work presents a translatable strategy to converge focal radiosensitization with targeted immune checkpoint silencing for personalized radioimmunotherapy.

Here we introduce Self-amplified and CRISPR-aided Operation to Profile EVs (SCOPE), a platform for EV mRNA detection. SCOPE leverages CRISPR-mediated recognition of target RNA using Cas13 to initiate replication and signal amplification, achieving a sub-attomolar detection limit while maintaining single-nucleotide resolution. As a proof of concept, we designed probes for key mutations in KRAS, BRAF, EGFR and IDH1 genes, optimized protocols for single-pot assays and implemented an automated device for multi-sample detection. We validated SCOPE’s ability to detect early-stage lung cancer in animal models, monitored tumor mutational burden in patients with colorectal cancer and stratified patients with glioblastoma. SCOPE can expedite readouts, augmenting the clinical use of EVs in precision oncology. SCOPE detects low-abundance extracellular vesicle mRNA with high sensitivity for clinical applications.},

We generate and functionally evaluate 2,476 SNVs in the epidermal growth factor receptor gene (EGFR), including 99% of all possible variants in the canonical tyrosine kinase domain. We determined resistance profiles of 95% of all possible EGFR protein variants encoded in the whole tyrosine kinase domain against the common tyrosine kinase inhibitors afatinib, osimertinib and osimertinib in the presence of the co-occurring substitution T790M, in PC-9 cells.

  abstract     = {Mutational scanning connects genetic variants to phenotype, enabling the interrogation of protein functions, interactions and variant pathogenicity. However, current methodologies cannot efficiently engineer customizable sets of diverse genetic variants in endogenous loci across cellular contexts in high throughput. Here, we combine cytosine and adenine base editors and a prime editor to assess the pathogenicity of a broad spectrum of variants in the epithelial growth factor receptor gene (EGFR). Using pooled base editing and prime editing guide RNA libraries, we install tens of thousands of variants spanning the full coding sequence of EGFR in multiple cell lines and assess the role of these variants in tumorigenesis and resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Our EGFR variant scan identifies important hits, supporting the robustness of the approach and revealing underappreciated routes to EGFR activation and drug response. We anticipate that multimodal precision mutational scanning can be applied broadly to characterize genetic variation in any genetic element of interest at high and single-nucleotide resolution. Thousands of rare oncogene variants are evaluated using multimodal gene editing screens.},

  abstract     = {Lipid nanoparticle (LNP) delivery of clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR) ribonucleoproteins (RNPs) could enable high-efficiency, low-toxicity and scalable in vivo genome editing if efficacious RNP–LNP complexes can be reliably produced. Here we engineer a thermostable Cas9 from Geobacillus stearothermophilus (GeoCas9) to generate iGeoCas9 variants capable of &gt;100× more genome editing of cells and organs compared with the native GeoCas9 enzyme. Furthermore, iGeoCas9 RNP–LNP complexes edit a variety of cell types and induce homology-directed repair in cells receiving codelivered single-stranded DNA templates. Using tissue-selective LNP formulations, we observe genome-editing levels of 16‒37% in the liver and lungs of reporter mice that receive single intravenous injections of iGeoCas9 RNP–LNPs. In addition, iGeoCas9 RNPs complexed to biodegradable LNPs edit the disease-causing SFTPC gene in lung tissue with 19% average efficiency, representing a major improvement over genome-editing levels observed previously using viral or nonviral delivery strategies. These results show that thermostable Cas9 RNP–LNP complexes can expand the therapeutic potential of genome editing. An engineered clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat ribonucleoprotein delivered in lipid nanoparticles efficiently edits cells in vivo.},

  abstract     = {Modern cell therapies are designed to harness natural biology to treat a range of complex diseases. The field of immunology has shown that B cells exhibit multiple unique features, including a natural propensity to interact with and regulate other immune cells, a high capacity to produce proteins, and a long cellular lifespan, which are being creatively applied in engineered B cell (eB cell) therapies. In recent years, advances in genome editing technologies and animal modeling have facilitated rapid progress in our ability to study eB cells and execute proof-of-concept studies, thus enabling the first clinical trials of eB cell therapies. In this review, we provide an overview of recent developments in eB cell therapies, including early clinical studies. We discuss challenges to clinical implementation, and promising directions for leveraging B cell biology in future applications for cancer and chronic disease. Recent developments in B cell engineering expand our ability to study human disease and drive progress toward new B cell therapies, balancing challenges in clinical implementation with emerging opportunities.},

To address this gap, we held a DREAM Challenge where competitors trained models on a dataset of millions of random promoter DNA sequences and corresponding expression levels, experimentally determined in yeast. For a robust evaluation of the models, we designed a comprehensive suite of benchmarks encompassing various sequence types. All top-performing models used neural networks but diverged in architectures and training strategies. To dissect how architectural and training choices impact performance, we developed the Prix Fixe framework to divide models into modular building blocks. We tested all possible combinations for the top three models, further improving their performance. The DREAM Challenge models not only achieved state-of-the-art results on our comprehensive yeast dataset but also consistently surpassed existing benchmarks on Drosophila and human genomic datasets, demonstrating the progress that can be driven by gold-standard genomics datasets. A benchmarking competition improves tools that predict how regulatory regions control gene expression.},

Publicly available pipelines to predict clinical neoantigens do not allow direct integration of mass spectrometry immunopeptidomics data, which can uncover antigenic peptides derived from various canonical and noncanonical sources. To address this, we present an end-to-end clinical proteogenomic pipeline, called NeoDisc, that combines state-of-the-art publicly available and in-house software for immunopeptidomics, genomics and transcriptomics with in silico tools for the identification, prediction and prioritization of tumor-specific and immunogenic antigens from multiple sources, including neoantigens, viral antigens, high-confidence tumor-specific antigens and tumor-specific noncanonical antigens. We demonstrate the superiority of NeoDisc in accurately prioritizing immunogenic neoantigens over recent prioritization pipelines. We showcase the various features offered by NeoDisc that enable both rule-based and machine-learning approaches for personalized antigen discovery and neoantigen cancer vaccine design. Additionally, we demonstrate how NeoDisc’s multiomics integration identifies defects in the cellular antigen presentation machinery, which influence the heterogeneous tumor antigenic landscape. The neoantigen discovery pipeline NeoDisc incorporates mass spectrometry immunopeptidomics data.},

We introduce sylph, a species-level metagenome profiler that estimates genome-to-metagenome containment average nucleotide identity (ANI) through zero-inflated Poisson k-mer statistics, enabling ANI-based taxa detection. On the Critical Assessment of Metagenome Interpretation II (CAMI2) Marine dataset, sylph was the most accurate profiling method of seven tested. For multisample profiling, sylph took &gt;10-fold less central processing unit time compared to Kraken2 and used 30-fold less memory. Sylph’s ANI estimates provided an orthogonal signal to abundance, allowing for an ANI-based metagenome-wide association study for Parkinson disease (PD) against 289,232 genomes while confirming known butyrate–PD associations at the strain level. Sylph took &lt;1 min and 16 GB of random-access memory to profile metagenomes against 85,205 prokaryotic and 2,917,516 viral genomes, detecting 30-fold more viral sequences in the human gut compared to RefSeq. Sylph offers precise, efficient profiling with accurate containment ANI estimation even for low-coverage genomes.

  abstract     = {Optical pooled screening offers a broader-scale alternative to enrichment-based perturbation screening, using fluorescence microscopy to correlate phenotypes and perturbations across single cells. Previous methods work well in large, transcriptionally active cell lines, because they rely on cytosolic detection of endogenously expressed barcoded transcripts; however, they are limited by reliable cell segmentation, cytosol size, transcriptional activity and cell density. Nuclear In-Situ Sequencing (NIS-Seq) expands this technology by creating bright sequencing signals directly from nuclear genomic DNA to screen nucleated cells at high density and high library complexity. By inserting an inverted phage promoter downstream of the single guide RNA (sgRNA), many RNA copies of the sgRNA can be generated and sequenced independently of cellular transcription. In this study, we benchmarked NIS-Seq across eight cell types from two species and performed four genome-scale optical perturbation screens, identifying key players of inflammation-related cellular pathways. Finally, we performed a small-scale pooled optical screen in primary human macrophages from blood of healthy donors and demonstrated barcode identification in lentivirally transduced human skin tissue. An optical pooled screening method can correlate phenotypes and perturbations in any nucleated cell type.},

  abstract     = {High-throughput phenotypic screens using biochemical perturbations and high-content readouts are constrained by limitations of scale. To address this, we establish a method of pooling exogenous perturbations followed by computational deconvolution to reduce required sample size, labor and cost. We demonstrate the increased efficiency of compressed experimental designs compared to conventional approaches through benchmarking with a bioactive small-molecule library and a high-content imaging readout. We then apply compressed screening in two biological discovery campaigns. In the first, we use early-passage pancreatic cancer organoids to map transcriptional responses to a library of recombinant tumor microenvironment protein ligands, uncovering reproducible phenotypic shifts induced by specific ligands distinct from canonical reference signatures and correlated with clinical outcome. In the second, we identify the pleotropic modulatory effects of a chemical compound library with known mechanisms of action on primary human peripheral blood mononuclear cell immune responses. In sum, our approach empowers phenotypic screens with information-rich readouts to advance drug discovery efforts and basic biological inquiry. Phenotypic screens in organoids and primary cells are scaled up using perturbation pooling.},

Here, to address this challenge, we exploited the safety, tumor tropism and ease of genetic manipulation of non-pathogenic Escherichia coli (E. coli) to deliver key immune-activating cytokines to tumors via surface display on the outer membrane of E. coli K-12 DH5α. Non-pathogenic E. coli expressing murine decoy-resistant IL18 mutein (DR18) induced robust CD8+ T and natural killer (NK) cell-dependent immune responses and suppressed tumor progression in immune-competent colorectal carcinoma and melanoma mouse models. E. coli K-12 DH5α engineered to display human DR18 potently activated mesothelin-targeting chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) NK cells and enhance their trafficking into tumors, which extended survival in an NK cell treatment-resistant mesothelioma xenograft model by enhancing TNF signaling and upregulating NK activation markers. Our live bacteria-based immunotherapeutic system safely and effectively induces potent anti-tumor responses in treatment-resistant solid tumors, motivating further evaluation of this approach in the clinic.

  abstract     = {Bacteriophage genome editing can enhance the efficacy of phages to eliminate pathogenic bacteria in patients and in the environment. However, current methods for editing phage genomes require laborious screening, counterselection or in vitro construction of modified genomes. Here, we present a scalable approach that uses modified bacterial retrons called recombitrons to generate recombineering donor DNA paired with single-stranded binding and annealing proteins for integration into phage genomes. This system can efficiently create genome modifications in multiple phages without the need for counterselection. The approach also supports larger insertions and deletions, which can be combined with simultaneous counterselection for &gt;99% efficiency. Moreover, we show that the process is continuous, with more edits accumulating the longer the phage is cultured with the host, and multiplexable. We install up to five distinct mutations on a single lambda phage genome without counterselection in only a few hours of hands-on time and identify a residue-level epistatic interaction in the T7 gp17 tail fiber. Phage genomes are readily engineered using retron recombineering.},

  abstract     = {Protein denoising diffusion probabilistic models are used for the de novo generation of protein backbones but are limited in their ability to guide generation of proteins with sequence-specific attributes and functional properties. To overcome this limitation, we developed ProteinGenerator (PG), a sequence space diffusion model based on RoseTTAFold that simultaneously generates protein sequences and structures. Beginning from a noised sequence representation, PG generates sequence and structure pairs by iterative denoising, guided by desired sequence and structural protein attributes. We designed thermostable proteins with varying amino acid compositions and internal sequence repeats and cage bioactive peptides, such as melittin. By averaging sequence logits between diffusion trajectories with distinct structural constraints, we designed multistate parent–child protein triples in which the same sequence folds to different supersecondary structures when intact in the parent versus split into two child domains. PG design trajectories can be guided by experimental sequence–activity data, providing a general approach for integrated computational and experimental optimization of protein function. ProteinGenerator simultaneously generates protein sequences and structures using sequence space diffusion.},

  abstract     = {Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPS cells) have important biomedical applications. We identified differentiation conditions that generate HSCs defined by robust long-term multilineage engraftment in immune-deficient NOD,B6.Prkdcscid Il2rgtm1Wjl/SzJ KitW41/W41 mice. We guided differentiating iPS cells, as embryoid bodies in a defined culture medium supplemented with retinyl acetate, through HOXA-patterned mesoderm to hemogenic endothelium specified by bone morphogenetic protein 4 and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Removal of VEGF facilitated an efficient endothelial-to-hematopoietic transition, evidenced by release into the culture medium of CD34+ blood cells, which were cryopreserved. Intravenous transplantation of two million thawed CD34+ cells differentiated from four independent iPS cell lines produced multilineage bone marrow engraftment in 25–50% of immune-deficient recipient mice. These functionally defined, multipotent CD34+ hematopoietic cells, designated iPS cell-derived HSCs (iHSCs), produced levels of engraftment similar to those achieved following umbilical cord blood transplantation. Our study provides a step toward the goal of generating HSCs for clinical translation. Human hematopoietic cells derived from pluripotent cells repopulate multiple blood lineages in mice.},

In this Review, we highlight the importance of GRN research in agriculture and explore how cutting-edge biotechnology, interdisciplinary approaches and computational modeling techniques are addressing the challenges in the field. We discuss how integrating diverse datasets at different resolutions empowers us to unravel the complex genetic networks governing crop responses to climate change, pests and diseases. By harnessing the power of GRNs, we have the potential to transform crop improvement strategies, develop stress-tolerant varieties and ensure global food security. We provide insights into the current opportunities and challenges of GRN research in agriculture, bridging the gap between scientific advancements and the pressing need for sustainable agricultural practices. Gene regulatory networks are crucial for understanding complex gene regulation in plants and could advance crop improvement for more sustainable and climate-resilient agricultural practices.},

The recent application of single-cell assays to many individuals should enable the study of how donor-level variation in one cell type is linked to that in other cell types. Here we introduce a computational approach called single-cell interpretable tensor decomposition (scITD) to identify common axes of interindividual variation by considering joint expression variation across multiple cell types. scITD combines expression matrices from each cell type into a higher-order matrix and factorizes the result using the Tucker tensor decomposition. Applying scITD to single-cell RNA-sequencing data on 115 persons with lupus and 83 persons with coronavirus disease 2019, we identify patterns of coordinated cellular activity linked to disease severity and specific phenotypes, such as lupus nephritis. scITD results also implicate specific signaling pathways likely mediating coordination between cell types. Overall, scITD offers a tool for understanding the covariation of cell states across individuals, which can yield insights into the complex processes that define and stratify disease. Unsupervised analysis of single-cell RNA-sequencing data across cell types and individuals predicts disease severity.},

DRAGEN outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in speed and accuracy across all variant types (single-nucleotide variations, insertions or deletions, short tandem repeats, structural variations and copy number variations) and incorporates specialized methods for analysis of medically relevant genes. We demonstrate the performance of DRAGEN across 3,202 whole-genome sequencing datasets by generating fully genotyped multisample variant call format files and demonstrate its scalability, accuracy and innovation to further advance the integration of comprehensive genomics. Overall, DRAGEN marks a major milestone in sequencing data analysis and will provide insights across various diseases, including Mendelian and rare diseases, with a highly comprehensive and scalable platform.

  abstract     = {CRISPR–Cas9-mediated homology-directed repair (HDR) can introduce desired mutations at targeted genomic sites, but achieving high efficiencies is a major hurdle in many cell types, including cells deficient in DNA repair activity. In this study, we used genome-wide screening in Fanconi anemia patient lymphoblastic cell lines to uncover suppressors of CRISPR–Cas9-mediated HDR. We found that a single exonuclease, TREX1, reduces HDR efficiency when the repair template is a single-stranded or linearized double-stranded DNA. TREX1 expression serves as a biomarker for CRISPR–Cas9-mediated HDR in that the high TREX1 expression present in many different cell types (such as U2OS, Jurkat, MDA-MB-231 and primary T cells as well as hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells) predicts poor HDR. Here we demonstrate rescue of HDR efficiency (ranging from two-fold to eight-fold improvement) either by TREX1 knockout or by the use of single-stranded DNA templates chemically protected from TREX1 activity. Our data explain why some cell types are easier to edit than others and indicate routes for increasing CRISPR–Cas9-mediated HDR in TREX1-expressing contexts. Homologous recombination in CRISPR–Cas9 genome editing is increased by blocking an exonuclease activity.},

Here, we develop an efficient, rapid and cost-effective method for generating chemically modified pegRNA (125–145 nt) and engineered pegRNA (epegRNA) (170–190 nt). We use an optimized splint ligation approach and achieve approximately 90% production efficiency for these RNAs, referred to as L-pegRNA and L-epegRNA. L-epegRNA demonstrates enhanced editing efficiencies across various cell lines and human primary cells with improvements of up to more than tenfold when using RNP delivery and several hundredfold with RNA delivery of PE, compared to epegRNA produced by in vitro transcription. L-epegRNA-mediated RNP delivery also outperforms plasmid-encoded PE in most comparisons. Our study provides a solution to obtaining high-quality pegRNA and epegRNA with desired chemical modifications, paving the way for the use of PE in therapeutics and various other fields.

  abstract     = {Sequence-specific recognition of double-stranded nucleic acids is essential for molecular diagnostics and in situ imaging. Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats and Cas systems rely on protospacer-adjacent motif (PAM)-dependent double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) recognition, limiting the range of targetable sequences and leading to undesired off-target effects. Using single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer analysis, we discover the enzymatic activity of bacteriophage λ exonuclease (λExo). We show binding of 5′-phosphorylated single-stranded DNA (pDNA) to complementary regions on dsDNA and DNA–RNA duplexes, without the need for a PAM-like motif. Upon binding, the λExo–pDNA system catalytically digests the pDNA into nucleotides in the presence of Mg2+. This process is sensitive to mismatches within a wide range of the pDNA-binding region, resulting in exceptional sequence specificity and reduced off-target effects in various applications. The absence of a requirement for a specific motif such as a PAM sequence greatly broadens the range of targets. We demonstrate that the λExo–pDNA system is a versatile tool for molecular diagnostics, DNA computing and gene imaging applications. A λ exonuclease system exhibits protospacer-adjacent motif-independent DNA-binding specificity, enabling diagnostic and imaging applications.},

  abstract     = {Protein and vaccine therapies based on mRNA would benefit from an increase in translation capacity. Here, we report a method to augment translation named ligation-enabled mRNA–oligonucleotide assembly (LEGO). We systematically screen different chemotopological motifs and find that a branched mRNA cap effectively initiates translation on linear or circular mRNAs without internal ribosome entry sites. Two types of chemical modification, locked nucleic acid (LNA) N7-methylguanosine modifications on the cap and LNA + 5 × 2′ O-methyl on the 5′ untranslated region, enhance RNA–eukaryotic translation initiation factor (eIF4E–eIF4G) binding and RNA stability against decapping in vitro. Through multidimensional chemotopological engineering of dual-capped mRNA and capped circular RNA, we enhanced mRNA protein production by up to tenfold in vivo, resulting in 17-fold and 3.7-fold higher antibody production after prime and boost doses in a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 vaccine setting, respectively. The LEGO platform opens possibilities to design unnatural RNA structures and topologies beyond canonical linear and circular RNAs for both basic research and therapeutic applications. mRNA cap designs boost translation &gt;10-fold, with potential benefits for RNA therapies.},

We uncover codon usage as a previously unrecognized contributor to efficient genetic code expansion using non-native codons. Relying only on conventional Escherichia coli strains with native ribosomes, we develop a plasmid-based codon compression strategy that minimizes context dependence and improves ncAA incorporation at quadruplet codons. We confirm that this strategy is compatible with all known genetic code expansion resources, which allowed us to identify 12 mutually orthogonal transfer RNA (tRNA)–synthetase pairs. Enabled by these findings, we evolved and optimized five tRNA–synthetase pairs to incorporate a broad repertoire of ncAAs at orthogonal quadruplet codons. Lastly, we extend these resources to an in vivo biosynthesis platform that can readily create &gt;100 new-to-nature peptide macrocycles bearing up to three unique ncAAs. Our approach will accelerate innovations in multiplexed genetic code expansion and the discovery of chemically diverse biomolecules. Noncanonical amino acids are efficiently incorporated into proteins by optimizing mRNA codon usage.},

Here we report a multimodal optical pooled CRISPR screening method, which we call CRISPRmap. CRISPRmap combines in situ CRISPR guide-identifying barcode readout with multiplexed immunofluorescence and RNA detection. Barcodes are detected and read out through combinatorial hybridization of DNA oligos, enhancing barcode detection efficiency. CRISPRmap enables in situ barcode readout in cell types and contexts that were elusive to conventional optical pooled screening, including cultured primary cells, embryonic stem cells, induced pluripotent stem cells, derived neurons and in vivo cells in a tissue context. We conducted a screen in a breast cancer cell line of the effects of DNA damage repair gene variants on cellular responses to commonly used cancer therapies, and we show that optical phenotyping pinpoints likely pathogenic patient-derived mutations that were previously classified as variants of unknown clinical significance. Optical pooled CRISPR screening is improved by combinatorial oligo hybridization for barcode detection.},

However, it has thus far been restricted to relatively low-plex phenotypic readouts in cancer cell lines in culture due to limitations associated with in situ sequencing of perturbation barcodes. Here, we develop PerturbView, an OPS technology that leverages in vitro transcription to amplify barcodes before in situ sequencing, enabling screens with highly multiplexed phenotypic readouts across diverse systems, including primary cells and tissues. We demonstrate PerturbView in induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neurons, primary immune cells and tumor tissue sections from animal models. In a screen of immune signaling pathways in primary bone marrow-derived macrophages, PerturbView uncovered both known and novel regulators of NF-κB signaling. Furthermore, we combine PerturbView with spatial transcriptomics in tissue sections from a mouse xenograft model, paving the way to in situ screens with rich optical and transcriptomic phenotypes. PerturbView broadens the scope of OPS to a wide range of models and applications. Optical pooled screening is enhanced by amplification of barcodes before in situ sequencing.},

  abstract     = {Population-scale databases have expanded to millions of protein-coding variants, yet insight into their mechanistic consequences has lagged. Here we present PROD-ATAC, a high-throughput method for discovering the effects of protein-coding variants on chromatin regulation. A pooled variant library is expressed in a disease-agnostic cell line, and single-cell assay for transposase-accessible chromatin resolves each variant’s effect on the chromatin landscape. Using PROD-ATAC, we characterized the effects of more than 100 oncofusions (cancer-causing chimeric proteins) and controls and revealed that chromatin remodeling is common to fusions spanning an enormous range of fusion frequencies. Furthermore, fusion-induced dysregulation can be context agnostic, as observed mechanisms often overlapped with cancer and cell-type-specific prior knowledge. We also showed that gain-of-function activity is common among oncofusions. This work begins to outline a global map of fusion-induced chromatin alterations. We suggest that there might be convergent mechanisms among disparate oncofusions and shared modes of dysregulation among fusions present in tumors at different frequencies. PROD-ATAC is generalizable to any set of protein-coding variants. The effects of oncofusions and other protein variants on chromatin remodeling are identified by PROD-ATAC.},

  abstract     = {The identification of protein homologs in large databases using conventional methods, such as protein sequence comparison, often misses remote homologs. Here, we offer an ultrafast, highly sensitive method, dense homolog retriever (DHR), for detecting homologs on the basis of a protein language model and dense retrieval techniques. Its dual-encoder architecture generates different embeddings for the same protein sequence and easily locates homologs by comparing these representations. Its alignment-free nature improves speed and the protein language model incorporates rich evolutionary and structural information within DHR embeddings. DHR achieves a &gt;10% increase in sensitivity compared to previous methods and a &gt;56% increase in sensitivity at the superfamily level for samples that are challenging to identify using alignment-based approaches. It is up to 22 times faster than traditional methods such as PSI-BLAST and DIAMOND and up to 28,700 times faster than HMMER. The new remote homologs exclusively found by DHR are useful for revealing connections between well-characterized proteins and improving our knowledge of protein evolution, structure and function. Protein homologs in large databases are rapidly identified with an alignment-free pipeline.},

  abstract     = {T cell alloreactivity against minor histocompatibility antigens (mHAgs)—polymorphic peptides resulting from donor–recipient (D–R) disparity at sites of genetic polymorphisms—is at the core of the therapeutic effect of allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT). Despite the crucial role of mHAgs in graft-versus-leukemia (GvL) and graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) reactions, it remains challenging to consistently link patient-specific mHAg repertoires to clinical outcomes. Here we devise an analytic framework to systematically identify mHAgs, including their detection on HLA class I ligandomes and functional verification of their immunogenicity. The method relies on the integration of polymorphism detection by whole-exome sequencing of germline DNA from D–R pairs with organ-specific transcriptional- and proteome-level expression. Application of this pipeline to 220 HLA-matched allo-HCT D–R pairs demonstrated that total and organ-specific mHAg load could independently predict the occurrence of acute GvHD and chronic pulmonary GvHD, respectively, and defined promising GvL targets, confirmed in a validation cohort of 58 D–R pairs, for the prevention or treatment of post-transplant disease recurrence. The success of hematopoietic cell transplants is predicted by profiling minor histocompatibility antigens.},

  abstract     = {Monoclonal antibodies are increasingly used to prevent and treat viral infections and are pivotal in pandemic response efforts. Antibody-secreting cells (ASCs; plasma cells and plasmablasts) are an excellent source of high-affinity antibodies with therapeutic potential. Current methods to study antigen-specific ASCs either have low throughput, require expensive and labor-intensive screening or are technically demanding and therefore not widely accessible. Here we present a straightforward technology for the rapid discovery of monoclonal antibodies from ASCs. Our approach combines microfluidic encapsulation of single cells into an antibody capture hydrogel with antigen bait sorting by conventional flow cytometry. With our technology, we screened millions of mouse and human ASCs and obtained monoclonal antibodies against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 with high affinity (&lt;1 pM) and neutralizing capacity (&lt;100 ng ml−1) in 2 weeks with a high hit rate (&gt;85% of characterized antibodies bound the target). By facilitating access to the underexplored ASC compartment, the approach enables efficient antibody discovery and immunological studies into the generation of protective antibodies. Antigen-specific antibodies secreted by plasma cells are rapidly identified using microfluidics and fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS).},

  abstract     = {Although chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapies have demonstrated promising clinical outcomes, durable remissions remain limited. To extend the efficacy of CAR T cells, we develop a CAR enhancer (CAR-E), comprising a CAR T cell antigen fused to an immunomodulatory molecule. Here we demonstrate this strategy using B cell maturation antigen (BCMA) CAR T cells for the treatment of multiple myeloma, with a CAR-E consisting of the BCMA fused to a low-affinity interleukin 2 (IL-2). This selectively induces IL-2 signaling in CAR T cells upon antigen–CAR binding, enhancing T cell activation and antitumor activity while reducing IL-2-associated toxicities. We show that the BCMA CAR-E selectively binds CAR T cells and increases CAR T cell proliferation, clearance of tumor cells and development of memory CAR T cells. The memory cells retain the ability to re-expand upon restimulation, effectively controlling tumor growth upon rechallenge. Mechanistic studies reveal the involvement of both CAR and IL-2 receptor endodomains in the CAR-E mechanism of action. The CAR-E approach avoids the need for specific engineering and enables CAR T cell therapy with lower cell doses. Chimeric antigen receptor T cell efficacy is enhanced with an interleukin 2-recruiting molecule.},

  abstract     = {Raman spectroscopy using surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) nanoprobes represents an ultrasensitive and high-precision technique for in vivo imaging. Clinical translation of SERS nanoprobes has been hampered by biosafety concerns about the metal substrates used to enhance Raman signals. We report a set of small molecules with bis-thienyl-substituted benzobisthiadiazole structures that enhance Raman signal through self-stacking rather than external substrates. In our technique, called stacking-induced charge transfer-enhanced Raman scattering (SICTERS), the self-stacked small molecules form an ordered spatial arrangement that enables three-dimensional charge transfer between neighboring molecules. The Raman scattering cross-section of SICTERS nanoprobes is 1350 times higher than that of conventional SERS gold nanoprobes of similar particle size. SICTERS outperforms SERS in terms of in vivo imaging sensitivity, resolution and depth. SICTERS is capable of noninvasive Raman imaging of blood and lymphatic vasculatures, which has not been achieved by SERS. SICTERS represents an alternative technique to enhance Raman scattering for guiding the design of ultrasensitive substrate-free Raman imaging probes. The sensitivity of in vivo Raman imaging is improved with self-stacked small molecules.},

Here, we develop click editing, a genome writing platform that couples the advantageous properties of DDPs with RNA-programmable nickases to permit the installation of a range of edits, including substitutions, insertions and deletions. Click editors (CEs) leverage the ‘click’-like bioconjugation ability of HUH endonucleases with single-stranded DNA substrates to covalently tether ‘click DNA’ (clkDNA) templates encoding user-specifiable edits at targeted genomic loci. Through iterative optimization of the modular components of CEs and their clkDNAs, we demonstrate the ability to install precise genome edits with minimal indels in diverse immortalized human cell types and primary fibroblasts with precise editing efficiencies of up to ~30%. Editing efficiency can be improved by rapidly screening clkDNA oligonucleotides with various modifications, including repair-evading substitutions. Click editing is a precise and versatile genome editing approach for diverse biological applications. Click editing uses DNA polymerases, HUH endonucleases and oligonucleotide templates for genome modification.},

Retrons are common in bacterial genomes, and thousands of unique retrons have been predicted bioinformatically. However, few have been characterized experimentally. We add to the corpus of experimentally studied retrons, finding 62 empirically determined, natural RT-DNAs that are not predictable from the retron sequence alone. We synthesize &gt;100 previously untested retrons to identify the natural sequence of RT-DNA they produce, quantify their RT-DNA production and test the relative efficacy of editing using retron-derived donors to edit bacterial, phage and human genomes. We observe large diversity in RT-DNA production and editing rates across retrons, finding that top-performing editors are drawn from a subset of the retron phylogeny and outperform those used in previous studies, reaching precise editing rates of up to 40% in human cells.

We compared the epigenomic and transcriptional signatures between idSCs, myoblasts and satellite cells and used these signatures to identify core signaling pathways and genes that confer idSC functionality. Finally, from human muscle biopsies, we successfully generated satellite cell-like cells in vitro.

Here we describe a versatile method, called Tracking-seq, for in situ identification of off-target effects that is broadly applicable to common genome-editing tools, including Cas9, base editors and prime editors. Through tracking replication protein A (RPA)-bound single-stranded DNA followed by strand-specific library construction, Tracking-seq requires a low cell input and is suitable for in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo genome editing, providing a sensitive and practical genome-wide approach for off-target detection in various scenarios. We show, using the same guide RNA, that Tracking-seq detects heterogeneity in off-target effects between different editor modalities and between different cell types, underscoring the necessity of direct measurement in the original system. The off-target effects of any CRISPR-based genome editor are identified with Tracking-seq.},

However, inferring the exact developmental trajectory is challenging. Previous studies showed age-associated DNA methylation (DNAm) changes in specific genomic regions, termed clock-like differential methylation loci (ClockDML). Age-associated DNAm could either result from or result in chromatin accessibility changes at ClockDML. As cells undergo mitosis, the heterogeneity of chromatin accessibility on clock-like loci is reduced, providing a measure of mitotic age. In this study, we developed a method, called EpiTrace, that counts the fraction of opened clock-like loci from scATAC-seq data to determine cell age and perform lineage tracing in various cell lineages and animal species. It shows concordance with known developmental hierarchies, correlates well with DNAm-based clocks and is complementary with mutation-based lineage tracing, RNA velocity and stemness predictions. Applying EpiTrace to scATAC-seq data reveals biological insights with clinically relevant implications, ranging from hematopoiesis, organ development, tumor biology and immunity to cortical gyrification. EpiTrace infers cell mitotic age and evolution from single-cell ATAC-seq data.},

Most strain-comparison methods quantify differences in single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and are insensitive to structural changes. However, recombination is an important driver of phenotypic diversification in many species, including human pathogens. We introduce SynTracker, a tool that compares microbial strains using genome synteny—the order of sequence blocks in homologous genomic regions—in pairs of metagenomic assemblies or genomes. Genome synteny is a rich source of genomic information untapped by current strain-comparison tools. SynTracker has low sensitivity to SNPs, has no database requirement and is robust to sequencing errors. It outperforms existing tools when tracking strains in metagenomic data and is particularly suited for phages, plasmids and other low-data contexts. Applied to single-species datasets and human gut metagenomes, SynTracker, combined with an SNP-based tool, detects strains enriched in either point mutations or structural changes, providing insights into microbial evolution in situ. The evolution of microbial strains is revealed by analyzing structural variation.},

The enzymatic synthesis of RNA oligonucleotides is made possible by controlled incorporation of reversible terminator nucleotides with a common 3′-O-allyl ether blocking group using new CID1 poly(U) polymerase mutant variants. We achieved an average coupling efficiency of 95% and demonstrated ten full cycles of liquid phase synthesis to produce natural and therapeutically relevant modified sequences. We then qualitatively assessed the platform on a solid phase, performing enzymatic synthesis of several N + 5 oligonucleotides on a controlled-pore glass support. Adoption of an aqueous-based process will offer key advantages including the reduction of solvent use and sustainable therapeutic oligonucleotide manufacturing.

Here, we performed unbiased functional mapping of tumor-infiltrating NK (TINK) cells using in vivo adeno-associated virus (AAV)–SB (Sleeping Beauty)-CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats) screens in four solid tumor mouse models. In parallel, we characterized single-cell transcriptomic landscapes of TINK cells, which identified previously unexplored subpopulations of NK cells and differentially expressed TINK genes. As a convergent hit, CALHM2-knockout (KO) NK cells showed enhanced cytotoxicity and tumor infiltration in mouse primary NK cells and human chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-NK cells. CALHM2 mRNA reversed the CALHM2-KO phenotype. CALHM2 KO in human primary NK cells enhanced their cytotoxicity, degranulation and cytokine production. Transcriptomics profiling revealed CALHM2-KO-altered genes and pathways in both baseline and stimulated conditions. In a solid tumor model resistant to unmodified CAR-NK cells, CALHM2-KO CAR-NK cells showed potent in vivo antitumor efficacy. These data identify endogenous genetic checkpoints that naturally limit NK cell function and demonstrate the use of CALHM2 KO for engineering enhanced NK cell-based immunotherapies.

Here we show that tumor evolution can be reproducibly redirected to engineer therapeutic opportunity, regardless of the exact ensemble of pre-existing genetic heterogeneity. We develop a selection gene drive system that is stably introduced into cancer cells and is composed of two genes, or switches, that couple an inducible fitness advantage with a shared fitness cost. Using stochastic models of evolutionary dynamics, we identify the design criteria for selection gene drives. We then build prototypes that harness the selective pressure of multiple approved tyrosine kinase inhibitors and employ therapeutic mechanisms as diverse as prodrug catalysis and immune activity induction. We show that selection gene drives can eradicate diverse forms of genetic resistance in vitro. Finally, we demonstrate that model-informed switch engagement effectively targets pre-existing resistance in mouse models of solid tumors. These results establish selection gene drives as a powerful framework for evolution-guided anticancer therapy. Selection gene drives re-engineer tumors to suppress drug resistance.},

Focusing on colorectal cancer, we generated miniature tissues consisting of long-lived gut-shaped human colon epithelia (‘mini-colons’) that stably integrate cancer cells and their native tumor microenvironment in a format optimized for real-time, high-resolution evaluation of cellular dynamics. We demonstrate the potential of this system through several applications: a comprehensive evaluation of drug effectivity, toxicity and resistance in anticancer therapies; the discovery of a mechanism triggered by cancer-associated fibroblasts that drives cancer invasion; and the identification of immunomodulatory interactions among different components of the tumor microenvironment. Similar approaches should be feasible for diverse tumor types. Organoid avatars of colorectal cancer and its microenvironment model immune interactions and drug efficacy.},

We identified 1,917 medically relevant genes expressing multiple isoforms in the frontal cortex where 1,018 had multiple isoforms with different protein-coding sequences. Of these 1,018 genes, 57 are implicated in brain-related diseases including major depression, schizophrenia, Parkinson’s disease and Alzheimer disease. Our study also uncovered 53 new RNA isoforms in medically relevant genes, including several where the new isoform was one of the most highly expressed for that gene. We also reported on five mitochondrially encoded, spliced RNA isoforms. We found 99 differentially expressed RNA isoforms between cases with Alzheimer disease and controls. The landscape of RNA isoforms in human cortex is revealed by deep long-read RNA sequencing.},

Live, tagged APCs can be directly purified for deconvolution by sequencing, enabling TCRs with unknown specificity to be queried against barcoded peptide libraries in a pooled screening context. TCR-MAP accurately captures self-reactivities or viral reactivities with high throughput and sensitivity for both MHC class I-restricted and class II-restricted TCRs. We elucidate problematic cross-reactivities of clinical TCRs targeting the cancer/testis melanoma-associated antigen A3 and discover targets of myocarditis-inciting autoreactive T cells in mice. TCR-MAP has the potential to accelerate T cell antigen discovery efforts in the context of cancer, infectious disease and autoimmunity.

  abstract     = {Cas9 can cleave DNA in both blunt and staggered configurations, resulting in distinct editing outcomes, but what dictates the type of Cas9 incisions is largely unknown. In this study, we developed BreakTag, a versatile method for profiling Cas9-induced DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) and identifying the determinants of Cas9 incisions. Overall, we assessed cleavage by SpCas9 at more than 150,000 endogenous on-target and off-target sites targeted by approximately 3,500 single guide RNAs. We found that approximately 35% of SpCas9 DSBs are staggered, and the type of incision is influenced by DNA:gRNA complementarity and the use of engineered Cas9 variants. A machine learning model shows that Cas9 incision is dependent on the protospacer sequence and that human genetic variation impacts the configuration of Cas9 cuts and the DSB repair outcome. Matched datasets of Cas9 and engineered variant incisions with repair outcomes show that Cas9-mediated staggered breaks are linked with precise, templated and predictable single-nucleotide insertions, demonstrating that a scission-based gRNA design can be used to correct clinically relevant pathogenic single-nucleotide deletions. The genome-wide landscape of Cas-induced double-strand breaks and end structures is profiled at nucleotide resolution.},

Simultaneous application of two or more different BEs, such as an adenine BE (which converts A·T base pairs to G·C) and a cytosine BE (which converts C·G base pairs to T·A), is not feasible because guide RNA crosstalk results in non-orthogonal editing, with all BEs modifying all target loci. Here we engineer both adenine BEs and cytosine BEs that can be orthogonally multiplexed by using RNA aptamer–coat protein systems to recruit the DNA-modifying enzymes directly to the guide RNAs. We generate four multiplexed orthogonal BE systems that enable rates of precise co-occurring edits of up to 7.1% in the same DNA strand without enrichment or selection strategies. The addition of a fluorescent enrichment strategy increases co-occurring edit rates up to 24.8% in human cells. These systems are compatible with expanded protospacer adjacent motif and high-fidelity Cas9 variants, function well in multiple cell types, have equivalent or reduced off-target propensities compared with their parental systems and can model disease-relevant point mutation combinations. Multiplexed orthogonal base editing systems introduce different point mutations at two loci simultaneously.},

This 7-year community effort used cloud computing to benchmark 31 subclonal reconstruction algorithms on 51 simulated tumors. Algorithms were scored on seven independent tasks, leading to 12,061 total runs. Algorithm choice influenced performance substantially more than tumor features but purity-adjusted read depth, copy-number state and read mappability were associated with the performance of most algorithms on most tasks. No single algorithm was a top performer for all seven tasks and existing ensemble strategies were unable to outperform the best individual methods, highlighting a key research need. All containerized methods, evaluation code and datasets are available to support further assessment of the determinants of subclonal reconstruction accuracy and development of improved methods to understand tumor evolution. Benchmarking of tumor subclonal reconstruction algorithms finds that interalgorithm variability overwhelms intertumor variability and identifies key quality metrics.},

By simultaneous 3D excitation and detection, the excitation intensity can be reduced below 1 mW mm−2, with 15-fold higher signal-to-background ratio over sLFM. We imaged subcellular dynamics over 25,000 timeframes in optically challenging environments in different species, such as migrasome delivery in mouse spleen, retractosome generation in mouse liver and 3D voltage imaging in Drosophila. Moreover, csLFM facilitates high-fidelity, large-scale neural recording with reduced crosstalk, leading to high orientation selectivity to visual stimuli, similar to two-photon microscopy, which aids understanding of neural coding mechanisms.

We show here that the type II CRISPR–Cas9 systems directed by CRISPR RNA and trans-activating CRISPR RNA dual RNAs show RuvC domain-dependent trans-cleavage activity for both ssDNA and ssRNA substrates. Cas9 possesses sequence preferences for trans-cleavage substrates, preferring to cleave T- or C-rich ssDNA substrates. We find that the trans-cleavage activity of Cas9 can be activated by target ssDNA, double-stranded DNA and ssRNA. The crystal structure of Cas9 in complex with guide RNA and target RNA provides a structural basis for the binding of target RNA to activate Cas9. Based on the trans-cleavage activity of Cas9 and nucleic acid amplification technology, we develop the nucleic acid detection platforms DNA-activated Cas9 detection and RNA-activated Cas9 detection, which are capable of detecting DNA and RNA samples with high sensitivity and specificity.

  abstract     = {Recruiting the endogenous editing enzyme adenosine deaminase acting on RNA (ADAR) with tailored guide RNAs for adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) RNA base editing is promising for safely manipulating genetic information at the RNA level. However, the precision and efficiency of editing are often compromised by bystander off-target editing. Here, we find that in 5′-UAN triplets, which dominate bystander editing, G•U wobble base pairs effectively mitigate off-target events while maintaining high on-target efficiency. This strategy is universally applicable to existing A-to-I RNA base-editing systems and complements other suppression methods such as G•A mismatches and uridine (U) depletion. Combining wobble base pairing with a circularized format of the CLUSTER approach achieves highly precise and efficient editing (up to 87%) of a disease-relevant mutation in the Mecp2 transcript in cell culture. Virus-mediated delivery of the guide RNA alone realizes functional MeCP2 protein restoration in the central nervous system of a murine Rett syndrome model with editing yields of up to 19% and excellent bystander control in vivo. Using G•U wobble base pairs at specific loci increases RNA base-editing precision and efficiency.},

  abstract     = {Innate immune cells, including natural killer cells, macrophages and γδ T cells, are gaining prominence as promising candidates for cancer immunotherapy. Unlike conventional T cells, these cells possess attributes such as inherent antitumor activity, rapid immune responses, favorable safety profiles and the ability to target diverse malignancies without requiring prior antigen sensitization. In this Review, we examine the engineering strategies used to enhance their anticancer potential. We discuss challenges associated with each cell type and summarize insights from preclinical and clinical work. We propose strategies to address existing barriers, providing a perspective on the advancement of innate immune engineering as a powerful modality in anticancer treatment. The unique attributes of innate immune cells position them as attractive candidates for cancer immunotherapy, with engineering strategies to enhance their antitumor potential, offering notable therapeutic promise.},

  abstract     = {Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy stands as a transformative advancement in immunotherapy, triumphing against hematological malignancies and, increasingly, autoimmune disorders. After a decade of relatively modest results for solid tumors, recent clinical trials and patient reports have also started to yield promising outcomes in glioblastoma and other challenging solid tumor entities. This Perspective seeks to explore the reasons behind these latest achievements and discusses how they can be sustained and expanded through different strategies involving CAR engineering and synthetic biology. Furthermore, we critically analyze how these breakthroughs can be leveraged to maintain momentum and broaden the therapeutic impact of CAR T cells across a variety of solid tumor landscapes. Recent clinical trials testing CAR T cells on solid tumors have yielded promising outcomes that can be enhanced with further CAR engineering.},

However, they are often excluded from at-scale studies because of challenges with variant calling and representation, as well as a lack of a genome-wide standard. Here, to promote the development of TR methods, we created a catalog of TR regions and explored TR properties across 86 haplotype-resolved long-read human assemblies. We curated variants from the Genome in a Bottle (GIAB) HG002 individual to create a TR dataset to benchmark existing and future TR analysis methods. We also present an improved variant comparison method that handles variants greater than 4 bp in length and varying allelic representation. The 8.1% of the genome covered by the TR catalog holds ~24.9% of variants per individual, including 124,728 small and 17,988 large variants for the GIAB HG002 ‘truth-set’ TR benchmark. We demonstrate the utility of this pipeline across short-read and long-read technologies. A truth-set catalog of human tandem repeats allows benchmarking of variant analysis tools.},

Here, we implement a CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats) interference (CRISPRi)-based reversible gene circuit platform in plants. We create a toolkit of engineered repressible promoters of different strengths and construct NOT and NOR gates in Arabidopsis thaliana protoplasts. We determine the optimal processing system to express single guide RNAs from RNA Pol II promoters to introduce NOR gate programmability for interfacing with host regulatory sequences. The performance of a NOR gate in stably transformed Arabidopsis plants demonstrates the system’s programmability and reversibility in a complex multicellular organism. Furthermore, cross-species activity of CRISPRi-based logic gates is shown in Physcomitrium patens, Triticum aestivum and Brassica napus protoplasts. Layering multiple NOR gates together creates OR, NIMPLY and AND logic functions, highlighting the modularity of our system. Our CRISPRi circuits are orthogonal, compact, reversible, programmable and modular and provide a platform for sophisticated spatiotemporal control of gene expression in plants.

Here we introduce decryptE, a proteome-wide approach that measures the full dose–response characteristics of drug-induced protein expression changes that informs cellular drug MoA. Assaying 144 clinical drugs and research compounds against 8,000 proteins resulted in more than 1 million dose–response curves that can be interactively explored online in ProteomicsDB and a custom-built Shiny App. Analysis of the collective data provided molecular explanations for known phenotypic drug effects and uncovered new aspects of the MoA of human medicines. We found that histone deacetylase inhibitors potently and strongly down-regulated the T cell receptor complex resulting in impaired human T cell activation in vitro and ex vivo. This offers a rational explanation for the efficacy of histone deacetylase inhibitors in certain lymphomas and autoimmune diseases and explains their poor performance in treating solid tumors. Proteome-wide measurements of dose–response curves for 144 drugs reveal drug mechanisms of action.},

We evaluate a set of 20 diverse computational metrics to assess the quality of enzyme sequences produced by three contrasting generative models: ancestral sequence reconstruction, a generative adversarial network and a protein language model. Focusing on two enzyme families, we expressed and purified over 500 natural and generated sequences with 70–90% identity to the most similar natural sequences to benchmark computational metrics for predicting in vitro enzyme activity. Over three rounds of experiments, we developed a computational filter that improved the rate of experimental success by 50–150%. The proposed metrics and models will drive protein engineering research by serving as a benchmark for generative protein sequence models and helping to select active variants for experimental testing. Metrics that predict the success of folding and the activity of designed protein sequences are developed and experimentally validated.},

  abstract     = {Multiplexed genetic perturbations are critical for testing functional interactions among coding or non-coding genetic elements. Compared to double-stranded DNA cutting, repressive chromatin formation using CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) avoids genotoxicity and is more effective for perturbing non-coding regulatory elements in pooled assays. However, current CRISPRi pooled screening approaches are limited to targeting one to three genomic sites per cell. We engineer an Acidaminococcus Cas12a (AsCas12a) variant, multiplexed transcriptional interference AsCas12a (multiAsCas12a), that incorporates R1226A, a mutation that stabilizes the ribonucleoprotein–DNA complex via DNA nicking. The multiAsCas12a-KRAB fusion improves CRISPRi activity over DNase-dead AsCas12a-KRAB fusions, often rescuing the activities of lentivirally delivered CRISPR RNAs (crRNA) that are inactive when used with the latter. multiAsCas12a-KRAB supports CRISPRi using 6-plex crRNA arrays in high-throughput pooled screens. Using multiAsCas12a-KRAB, we discover enhancer elements and dissect the combinatorial function of cis-regulatory elements in human cells. These results instantiate a group testing framework for efficiently surveying numerous combinations of chromatin perturbations for biological discovery and engineering. An engineered Cas12a enables higher-order combinatorial functional genomic screens using CRISPR interference.},

In this study, we developed a system for bidirectional epigenetic editing, called CRISPRai, in which we apply activating (CRISPRa) and repressive (CRISPRi) perturbations to two loci simultaneously in the same cell. We developed CRISPRai Perturb-seq by coupling dual perturbation gRNA detection with single-cell RNA sequencing, enabling study of pooled perturbations in a mixed single-cell population. We applied this platform to study the genetic interaction between two hematopoietic lineage transcription factors, SPI1 and GATA1, and discovered novel characteristics of their co-regulation on downstream target genes, including differences in SPI1 and GATA1 occupancy at genes that are regulated through different modes. We also studied the regulatory landscape of IL2 (interleukin-2) in Jurkat T cells, primary T cells and chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells and elucidated mechanisms of enhancer-mediated IL2 gene regulation. CRISPRai facilitates investigation of context-specific genetic interactions, provides new insights into gene regulation and will enable exploration of non-coding disease-associated variants. CRISPRai simultaneously activates and represses two genes in single cells.},

  abstract     = {Environmental concerns are driving interest in postpetroleum synthetic textiles produced from microbial and fungal sources. Bacterial cellulose (BC) is a promising sustainable leather alternative, on account of its material properties, low infrastructure needs and biodegradability. However, for alternative textiles like BC to be fully sustainable, alternative ways to dye textiles need to be developed alongside alternative production methods. To address this, we genetically engineer Komagataeibacter rhaeticus to create a bacterial strain that grows self-pigmenting BC. Melanin biosynthesis in the bacteria from recombinant tyrosinase expression achieves dark black coloration robust to material use. Melanated BC production can be scaled up for the construction of prototype fashion products, and we illustrate the potential of combining engineered self-pigmentation with tools from synthetic biology, through the optogenetic patterning of gene expression in cellulose-producing bacteria. With this study, we demonstrate that combining genetic engineering with current and future methods of textile biofabrication has the potential to create a new class of textiles. Genetic engineering of material-producing bacteria creates pigmented products.},

  abstract     = {Cancer immunotherapy with autologous chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells faces challenges in manufacturing and patient selection that could be avoided by using ‘off-the-shelf’ products, such as allogeneic CAR natural killer T (AlloCAR-NKT) cells. Previously, we reported a system for differentiating human hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells into AlloCAR-NKT cells, but the use of three-dimensional culture and xenogeneic feeders precluded its clinical application. Here we describe a clinically guided method to differentiate and expand IL-15-enhanced AlloCAR-NKT cells with high yield and purity. We generated AlloCAR-NKT cells targeting seven cancers and, in a multiple myeloma model, demonstrated their antitumor efficacy, expansion and persistence. The cells also selectively depleted immunosuppressive cells in the tumor microenviroment and antagonized tumor immune evasion via triple targeting of CAR, TCR and NK receptors. They exhibited a stable hypoimmunogenic phenotype associated with epigenetic and signaling regulation and did not induce detectable graft versus host disease or cytokine release syndrome. These properties of AlloCAR-NKT cells support their potential for clinical translation. Off-the-shelf CAR-NKT cells for cancer immunotherapy are advanced toward clinical translation.},

By exploiting the distinct transcriptomic profile of tumor-reactive T cells relative to bystander cells, we build and benchmark TRTpred, an antigen-agnostic in silico predictor of tumor-reactive TCRs. We integrate TRTpred with an avidity predictor to derive a combinatorial algorithm of clinically relevant TCRs for personalized T cell therapy and benchmark it in patient-derived xenografts. Tumor-reactive T cell receptors are predicted based on single-cell RNA sequencing and single-cell T cell receptor sequencing.},

  abstract     = {Over the past three decades, biological nanopore sequencing has grown from a research curiosity to a mature technology to sequence nucleic acids at the single-molecule level. Now, recent achievements suggest that nanopores might be able to sequence proteins soon. In this Perspective, we analyze the different approaches that have been proposed to measure proteins and peptides using nanopores. We predict that, more likely than not, nanopores will be capable of identifying full-length proteins at the single-molecule level and with single-amino acid resolution, paving the way to single-molecule protein sequencing. This would allow several applications in proteomics that are at present challenging, including measuring the heterogeneity of post-translational modifications, quantifying low-abundance proteins and characterizing protein splicing.

Here we introduce the covariance environment (COVET), a representation that leverages the gene–gene covariate structure across cells in the niche to capture the multivariate nature of cellular interactions within it. We define a principled optimal transport-based distance metric between COVET niches that scales to millions of cells. Using COVET to encode spatial context, we developed environmental variational inference (ENVI), a conditional variational autoencoder that jointly embeds spatial and single-cell RNA sequencing data into a latent space. ENVI includes two decoders: one to impute gene expression across the spatial modality and a second to project spatial information onto single-cell data. ENVI can confer spatial context to genomics data from single dissociated cells and outperforms alternatives for imputing gene expression on diverse spatial datasets. Using gene–gene covariance structure to represent cellular neighborhoods improves the integration of single-cell RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptomics data.},

  abstract     = {Single-cell RNA sequencing has been widely used to investigate cell state transitions and gene dynamics of biological processes. Current strategies to infer the sequential dynamics of genes in a process typically rely on constructing cell pseudotime through cell trajectory inference. However, the presence of concurrent gene processes in the same group of cells and technical noise can obscure the true progression of the processes studied. To address this challenge, we present GeneTrajectory, an approach that identifies trajectories of genes rather than trajectories of cells. Specifically, optimal transport distances are calculated between gene distributions across the cell–cell graph to extract gene programs and define their gene pseudotemporal order. Here we demonstrate that GeneTrajectory accurately extracts progressive gene dynamics in myeloid lineage maturation. Moreover, we show that GeneTrajectory deconvolves key gene programs underlying mouse skin hair follicle dermal condensate differentiation that could not be resolved by cell trajectory approaches. GeneTrajectory facilitates the discovery of gene programs that control the changes and activities of biological processes. Gene dynamics of concurrent biological processes are unraveled by considering gene trajectories instead of cell trajectories.},

Here we present LINGER (Lifelong neural network for gene regulation), a machine-learning method to infer GRNs from single-cell paired gene expression and chromatin accessibility data. LINGER incorporates atlas-scale external bulk data across diverse cellular contexts and prior knowledge of transcription factor motifs as a manifold regularization. LINGER achieves a fourfold to sevenfold relative increase in accuracy over existing methods and reveals a complex regulatory landscape of genome-wide association studies, enabling enhanced interpretation of disease-associated variants and genes. Following the GRN inference from reference single-cell multiome data, LINGER enables the estimation of transcription factor activity solely from bulk or single-cell gene expression data, leveraging the abundance of available gene expression data to identify driver regulators from case-control studies. Accuracy of gene regulatory network inference is increased by combining multiome single-cell and atlas-scale bulk data.},

Here we test the therapeutic potential of ds-cRNAs in a mouse model of imiquimod-induced psoriasis. We find that genetic supplementation of ds-cRNAs leads to inhibition of PKR, resulting in alleviation of downstream interferon-α and dsRNA signals and attenuation of psoriasis phenotypes. Delivery of ds-cRNAs by lipid nanoparticles to the spleen attenuates PKR activity in examined splenocytes, resulting in reduced epidermal thickness. These findings suggest that ds-cRNAs represent a promising approach to mitigate excessive PKR activation for therapeutic purposes.

Starfysh improves the characterization of spatial dynamics in complex tissues using histology images and enables the comparison of niches as spatial hubs across tissues. Integrative analysis of primary estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer, triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) and metaplastic breast cancer (MBC) tissues led to the identification of spatial hubs with patient- and disease-specific cell type compositions and revealed metabolic reprogramming shaping immunosuppressive hubs in aggressive MBC.

We applied the method to screen thousands of tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL)-derived TCRs from multiple patients and identified dozens of CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell-derived TCRs with potent tumor reactivity, including TCRs that recognized patient-specific neoantigens.

Here, we report that this system can lead to frequent concatemeric insertions of the viral vector genome at the target site that are difficult to detect. Such errors can cause adverse and unreliable phenotypes that are antithetical to the goal of precision genome engineering. The concatemeric knockins occurred regardless of locus, vector concentration, cell line or cell type, including human pluripotent and hematopoietic stem cells. Although these highly abundant errors were found in more than half of the edited cells, they could not be readily detected by common analytical methods. We describe strategies to detect and thoroughly characterize the concatemeric viral vector insertions, and we highlight analytical pitfalls that mask their prevalence. We then describe strategies to prevent the concatemeric inserts by cutting the vector genome after transduction. This approach is compatible with established gene editing pipelines, enabling robust genetic knockins that are safer, more reliable and more reproducible.

In some cases, such as anticoagulant drugs or immunotherapeutics, it is important to be able to quickly reverse the drug’s action. Here, we report a general strategy to achieve on-demand reversibility by designing a supramolecular drug (a noncovalent assembly of two cooperatively interacting drug fragments held together by transient hybridization of peptide nucleic acid (PNA)) that can be reversed with a PNA antidote that outcompetes the hybridization between the fragments. We demonstrate the approach with thrombin-inhibiting anticoagulants, creating very potent and reversible bivalent direct thrombin inhibitors (Ki = 74 pM). The supramolecular inhibitor effectively inhibited thrombus formation in mice in a needle injury thrombosis model, and this activity could be reversed by administration of the PNA antidote.

We developed SVision-pro, a neural-network-based instance segmentation framework that represents genome-to-genome-level sequencing differences visually and discovers SV comparatively between genomes without any prerequisite for inference models. SVision-pro outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, in particular, the resolving of complex SVs is improved, with low Mendelian error rates, high sensitivity of low-frequency SVs and reduced false-positive rates compared with SV merging approaches. SVision-pro enables pairwise genome comparison and improves de novo and somatic structural variant calling.},

  abstract     = {The identification of patient-derived, tumor-reactive T cell receptors (TCRs) as a basis for personalized transgenic T cell therapies remains a time- and cost-intensive endeavor. Current approaches to identify tumor-reactive TCRs analyze tumor mutations to predict T cell activating (neo)antigens and use these to either enrich tumor infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) cultures or validate individual TCRs for transgenic autologous therapies. Here we combined high-throughput TCR cloning and reactivity validation to train predicTCR, a machine learning classifier that identifies individual tumor-reactive TILs in an antigen-agnostic manner based on single-TIL RNA sequencing. PredicTCR identifies tumor-reactive TCRs in TILs from diverse cancers better than previous gene set enrichment-based approaches, increasing specificity and sensitivity (geometric mean) from 0.38 to 0.74. By predicting tumor-reactive TCRs in a matter of days, TCR clonotypes can be prioritized to accelerate the manufacture of personalized T cell therapies. Tumor-reactive T cell receptors are rapidly identified from lymphocyte scRNA-seq data.},

State-of-the-art tools to assess genome annotations measure the completeness of a gene repertoire but are blind to other errors, such as gene overprediction or contamination. We introduce OMArk, a software package that relies on fast, alignment-free sequence comparisons between a query proteome and precomputed gene families across the tree of life. OMArk assesses not only the completeness but also the consistency of the gene repertoire as a whole relative to closely related species and reports likely contamination events. Analysis of 1,805 UniProt Eukaryotic Reference Proteomes with OMArk demonstrated strong evidence of contamination in 73 proteomes and identified error propagation in avian gene annotation resulting from the use of a fragmented zebra finch proteome as a reference. This study illustrates the importance of comparing and prioritizing proteomes based on their quality measures. A new tool checks the quality of gene annotations in genome sequences.},

Here we develop RESTART v3, which uses near-cognate tRNAs to improve the readthrough efficiency of pseudouridine-modified PTCs. We show an average of ~5-fold (range: 2.1- to 9.5-fold) higher editing efficiency than RESTART v2 in cultured cells and achieve functional PTC readthrough in disease cell models of cystic fibrosis and Hurler syndrome. Furthermore, RESTART v3 enables accurate incorporation of the original amino acid for nearly half of the PTC sites, considering the naturally occurring frequencies of sense-to-nonsense codons, without affecting normal termination codons. Although off-target sites were detected, we did not observe changes to the coding information or the expression level of transcripts, and the overall natural tRNA abundance remained constant. Disease-related premature stop codons are efficiently corrected by harnessing near-cognate tRNAs.},

However, DSF applications remain limited by protein incompatibilities with existing DSF dyes. Here we overcome this obstacle with the development of a protein-adaptive DSF platform (paDSF) that combines a dye library ‘Aurora’ with a streamlined procedure to identify protein–dye pairs on demand. paDSF was successfully applied to 94% (66 of 70) of proteins, tripling the previous compatibility and delivering assays for 66 functionally and biochemically diverse proteins, including 10 from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. We find that paDSF can be used to monitor biological processes that were previously inaccessible, demonstrated for the interdomain allostery of O-GlcNAc transferase. The chemical diversity and varied selectivities of Aurora dyes suggest that paDSF functionality may be readily extended. paDSF is a generalizable tool to interrogate protein stability, dynamics and ligand binding.

EMRNA integrates deep learning-based detection of nucleotides, three-dimensional backbone tracing and scoring with consideration of sequence and secondary structure information, and full-atom construction of the RNA structure. We validated EMRNA on 140 diverse RNA maps ranging from 37 to 423 nt at 2.0–6.0 Å resolutions, and compared EMRNA with auto-DRRAFTER, phenix.map_to_model and CryoREAD on a set of 71 cases. EMRNA achieves a median accuracy of 2.36 Å root mean square deviation and 0.86 TM-score for full-length RNA structures, compared with 6.66 Å and 0.58 for auto-DRRAFTER. EMRNA also obtains a high residue coverage and sequence match of 93.30% and 95.30% in the built models, compared with 58.20% and 42.20% for phenix.map_to_model and 56.45% and 52.3% for CryoREAD.

Here we present SIMPLE-seq, a scalable, base resolution method for joint analysis of 5mC and 5hmC from thousands of single cells. Based on orthogonal labeling and recording of ‘C-to-T’ mutational signals from 5mC and 5hmC sites, SIMPLE-seq detects these two modifications from the same molecules in single cells and enables unbiased DNA methylation dynamics analysis of heterogeneous biological samples. We applied this method to mouse embryonic stem cells, human peripheral blood mononuclear cells and mouse brain to give joint epigenome maps at single-cell and single-molecule resolution. Integrated analysis of these two cytosine modifications reveals distinct epigenetic patterns associated with divergent regulatory programs in different cell types as well as cell states. SIMPLE-seq measures both 5-methylcytosine and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine at base resolution in single cells.},

We created Borderlands Science (BLS), a citizen science activity that is seamlessly integrated within a popular commercial video game played by tens of millions of gamers. This integration is facilitated by a novel game-first design of citizen science games, in which the game design aspect has the highest priority, and a suitable task is then mapped to the game design. BLS crowdsources a multiple alignment task of 1 million 16S ribosomal RNA sequences obtained from human microbiome studies. Since its initial release on 7 April 2020, over 4 million players have solved more than 135 million science puzzles, a task unsolvable by a single individual. Leveraging these results, we show that our multiple sequence alignment simultaneously improves microbial phylogeny estimations and UniFrac effect sizes compared to state-of-the-art computational methods. This achievement demonstrates that hyper-gamified scientific tasks attract massive crowds of contributors and offers invaluable resources to the scientific community. Gamification of the multiple sequence alignment problem improves microbial phylogeny estimates.},

We demonstrated that induction of a gliogenic switch in a subset of progenitors enabled the rapid derivation of astroglial cells, which account for 25–31% of the cell population within 8–10 weeks of differentiation. Intracerebral transplantation of these organoids reliably generated a diverse repertoire of cortical neurons and anatomical subclasses of human astrocytes. Spatial transcriptome profiling identified layer-specific expression patterns among distinct subclasses of astrocytes within organoid transplants. Using an in vivo acute neuroinflammation model, we identified a subpopulation of astrocytes that rapidly activates pro-inflammatory pathways upon cytokine stimulation. Additionally, we demonstrated that CD38 signaling has a crucial role in mediating metabolic and mitochondrial stress in reactive astrocytes. This model provides a robust platform for investigating human astrocyte function. Transplantation of glia-enriched organoids into the mouse brain enables the study of astrocyte subtypes.},

Here, we describe precise RNA-mediated insertion of transgenes (PRINT), an approach for site-specifically primed reverse transcription that directs transgene synthesis directly into the genome at a multicopy safe-harbor locus. PRINT uses delivery of two in vitro transcribed RNAs: messenger RNA encoding avian R2 retroelement-protein and template RNA encoding a transgene of length validated up to 4 kb. The R2 protein coordinately recognizes the target site, nicks one strand at a precise location and primes complementary DNA synthesis for stable transgene insertion. With a cultured human primary cell line, over 50% of cells can gain several 2 kb transgenes, of which more than 50% are full-length. PRINT advantages include no extragenomic DNA, limiting risk of deleterious mutagenesis and innate immune responses, and the relatively low cost, rapid production and scalability of RNA-only delivery. Transgenes are inserted into human cells by 2-RNA delivery of a retroelement protein and template.},
