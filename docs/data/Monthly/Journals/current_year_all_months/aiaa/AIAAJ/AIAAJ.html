  abstract     = {The broadcloth material used in parachute manufacturing is generally a thin, woven, permeable textile. The small length scales of fibers, pores, and gaps in fabric are challenging to spatially resolve in a full-scale parachute simulation. In this work, simulations are performed using a 3D reconstruction of the broadcloth material used in the Mars 2020 mission, and simulation results using the detailed reconstructed geometry are compared to a simplified model proposed in a previous work. Furthermore, results from simulations under Earth ambient lab conditions are compared to experimental permeability test data to validate the choice of parameters for this reduced-order model. Simulations under ASPIRE SR03 flight-relevant conditions are also performed to study permeability in a rarefied flow regime. It is observed that flow through the material is similar to a developing pipe flow, and under low-density conditions, significant slip velocity is present inside pores. For all conditions investigated, the pressure drag is the primary contributor to the total drag force. Drag and mass flow rate discrepancies are observed between models, motivating future work to investigate the sensitivity of system-level parachute FSI simulations to the assumed permeability model and associated parameters.},

  abstract     = {Coordinated experimental and computational studies were conducted on the ROTEX-T, a cone–flare geometry used in a successful flight-test experiment, with the objectives of explaining the origins of the largest differences between computational and experimental results, assessing code-to-code, facility-to-facility, and ground-to-flight differences, and further illuminating the flight-test results. Background-oriented schlieren, infrared thermography, high-speed self-aligned focusing schlieren, and focused laser differential interferometry measurements were made in two wind tunnels. The surface heat flux and Stanton number distributions were calculated. Separation and reattachment locations, as well as flow state at each, were determined. Computational results were obtained using the VULCAN-CFD and SU2 codes in steady-state mode, and direct numerical simulation (DNS). The nominally steady axisymmetric flow was found to be globally unstable to stationary three-dimensional disturbances concentrated in the reattachment region. Without adding external noise, the disturbance amplitudes computed by DNS were found to be high in the separation bubble, and thus the flow was transitional. The separation location predicted computationally is consistently upstream of the experimental observation. This difference is caused by tunnel noise, whose effect is not incorporated into the computations. Despite this, the computed density field and shape of the separation bubble closely matched that observed experimentally. The maximum vertical density gradient was confirmed as an accurate, very useful definition of the boundary-layer edge. Computed laminar heating rates before separation agreed well with experiment; transitional heating rates after reattachment from experiments were between laminar and turbulent computations. Reattachment location and the flow state upon reattachment were assessed for the flight data. At flight-matched Reynolds numbers, flight trends align with the ground-test results, indicating a transitional shock-wave/boundary-layer interaction.‡‡‡},

  abstract     = {The premise of over-the-wing mounted rotors is that a favorable aerodynamic effect is achieved by interaction with the lifting wing, which also acts as noise shield. A physics-based low-order model is proposed that accounts for aerodynamic interactions in the prediction of the aeroacoustic footprint of the installed rotor. The nonuniform inflow of the rotor disk is modeled by an analytical description of the inviscid potential effects of the wing’s circulation, given as a function of the blade sectional coordinates. Furthermore, the ingestion of the separated boundary layer is considered at large angles of attack. The related steady inflow distortion serves as input to an aeroacoustic noise prediction chain that computes the unsteady loading on the blades and the resulting tonal noise emission by helicoidal surface theory. The model is validated by measurements from a single over-the-wing mounted rotor for a wide range of angle of attack, advance ratios, and rotor positions over the wing’s chord. The predictions and experimental data show an equivalent increase in the tonal components relative to the isolated rotor, and a minimization of the tonal noise for a midchord rotor position, for emission directions around the rotor disk plane over the wing’s suction side.},

  abstract     = {A semi-analytical model is proposed that incorporates aerodynamic interactions between the rotor- and wing-induced flowfields. Predictions are validated through experiments performed with an array of five rotors above an airfoil, where the angle of attack, advance ratio, and chordwise rotor position are varied. At moderate angles of attack, the propulsive thrust is reduced due to the acceleration induced by the wing’s circulation. Around the stall angle of the isolated wing, the rotors re-energize the boundary layer when operated in low-thrust conditions. By increasing the thrust, a pronounced region of reverse flow between the rotors and wing adversely affects the leading-edge separation delay over the wing that occurs for lower thrust settings. However, in this condition, the wing–rotor-array system exhibits increased thrust compared to the attached flow condition due to the rotors ingesting low-momentum flow. In addition, the rotor-induced flow over the wing augments suction, while the pressure side is subjected to a pressure increase, ascribed to flow entrainment from the rotors. After comparison with the experimental observations, it is confirmed that the model predictions accurately describe the lift and thrust performance trends, aside from a discrepancy in the lift force when the rotors are operated in low-thrust conditions.},

The analysis is focused on the physics of the second-mode instability at high enthalpy and the role of high-temperature effects. Although the stability solvers considering thermochemical nonequilibrium were best at estimating the measured second-mode frequency ( for shot 2990, for shot 3019), they overpredicted the most amplified frequency by approximately 16–23%. A moderate spread in the predicted most amplified frequency was also observed between the different solvers. The solvers estimated a most amplified frequency range of approximately 1450–1550 kHz for shot 2990 and approximately 1525–1650 kHz for shot 3019. There was also significant inconsistency observed in predicting the peak -factor magnitude, ranging from for shot 2990 and from for shot 3019.},

  abstract     = {This research introduces a novel structure for a doubly curved shallow shell, termed the “single-variable-edge and variable-thickness doubly curved shallow shell” (SVEVT-DCSS). The shell is constructed from a functionally graded carbon nanotube/fiber/polymer multiscale laminated composite with three distinct carbon nanotube distribution patterns: uniform distribution (UD), FG-O, and FG-X. These distributions are modeled using the Halpin–Tsai micromechanical approach and an orthotropic micromechanical model. Employing the theory of elasticity and the Von Karman–Donnell geometrical nonlinearity assumption, the governing equations for the mechanical behavior of the shell, which rests on a Winkler–Pasternak elastic foundation and is subjected to a thermomechanical environment, are formulated. By applying Galerkin’s method to these equations, the dynamic characteristics of the shell are determined. The nonlinear dynamic responses of the SVEVT-DCSS are analyzed with a focus on both periodic and chaotic behavior. Furthermore, the accuracy and reliability of the results are validated through comparisons with existing literature and finite element method simulations. The findings, presented through numerical tables and graphical figures, demonstrate the significant potential of this novel shell structure for practical engineering applications, contributing to advancements in aerospace, civil, and mechanical engineering.},

The Newmark- method is utilized to calculate the dynamic characteristics of the rotor system. The influence of the positions and normal forces of the dampers on the critical speed, vibration, strain energy distribution, and sensitivity of the rotor is analyzed. The results show that the vibration suppression is related to both the equivalent damping coefficient and the equivalent dynamic stiffness of the DFD. The influence of the DFD on the strain energy distribution of the rotor is notable. The parameter selection of DFDs should balance vibration suppression and strain energy distribution in a rotor system. The installation position of DFDs significantly modulates rotor dynamic behavior. The parameter design of DFDs must be guided by rotor strain energy distribution while incorporating speed-dependent adaptation to ensure vibration suppression across operational states. This study is of great significance for exploring the optimal control strategy of the DFD-rotor system.},

This paper proposes a novel nonlinear unsteady aerodynamic ROM formulated as a highly compact multi-input Volterra series. Orthogonal matching pursuit is used to obtain a set of optimally sparse nonlinear multi-input ROM coefficients from unsteady aerodynamic training data. The framework is exemplified in an aeroelastic setting using the benchmark supercritical wing, considering forced response, flutter, and limit cycle oscillation. The simple and efficient optimal sparsity multi-input ROM framework performs with high accuracy compared to the full-order aeroelastic model, requiring only a fraction of the hundreds of thousands of possible multi-input terms to be identified and allowing a 98% reduction in the number of training samples.},

Schlieren imaging, nitric oxide planar laser-induced fluorescence (NO-PLIF) imaging, and pressure transducer techniques are employed to visualize flow structures and conduct parametric measurements. Numerical simulations are conducted to shed light on the flow structures and elucidate the underlying mechanisms as well. The results indicate that NO-PLIF imaging can effectively capture the spatially resolved structures surrounding the jet exit. Both the Mach disk height and barrel shock width are positively correlated with the jet momentum ratio and angle of attack . Furthermore, the pressure plateau and peak distribution upstream and downstream of the sonic orifice are also significantly influenced by and . Specifically, peak pressure increases with an increase in , while it drops for a larger .

Nonetheless, these models have some limitations in simulating flows with adverse pressure gradients due to the inclusion of various assumptions, such as the eddy viscosity hypothesis. As a result, many researchers have focused their efforts on improving turbulence models, including parameter calibration. In this paper, a progressive neural network framework is utilized to modify the dissipation coefficients of the shear-stress transport (SST) model into a function of physical quantities. Firstly, the zero pressure gradient flat plate case is employed to obtain the calibrated model SST-FP. Subsequently, the flow with a turbulent separation bubble is adopted to progressively acquire the calibrated model SST-TSB. The enhanced model performs well in predicting the mean velocity profile, friction coefficient, and other variables of training cases, owing to joint corrections on the and equations. Furthermore, verification research demonstrates that the SST-TSB model mitigates the potential damage to the wall-law prediction. It can also adapt the forecast properly in circumstances where the original model predicts larger or smaller separation zones, avoiding the drawbacks that Bayesian inference and other methods have when applied to parameter calibration.},

In this paper, the phenomenon of wave dispersion that causes this effect is exploited through time reversibility to focus waves both spatially and temporally and hence amplify the peak response at a chosen position. Harmonic finite element analysis is first undertaken to determine the wave bearing characteristics of a simplified representation of a wing leading edge. Transient analysis is then performed on the structure with an attached ice layer to focus disturbances of bandwidths up to 50 kHz at different chosen points. The amplitude of the peak shear stress between the ice and substrate is bandwidth dependent and predicted to be up to 30 times higher than due to a comparable pulse input. Predicted peak accelerations are successfully validated experimentally for a limited bandwidth of 10 kHz.},

  abstract     = {Hierarchical structure design can improve the structural efficiency of lightweight sandwich structures, and the potential for multifunctional design is also considerable. By constructing fishbone-shaped Carbon Fiber Reinforced Plastic (CFRP) arrays onto the grid walls and introducing Absorbent Honeycomb Sandwich Structure (AHS) as its small-scale configuration, Hierarchical Grid Hybrid Absorber (HGHA) is proposed. By deriving the equivalent models of absorbent honeycomb, its Electromagnetic (EM) and mechanical properties are decoupled. The high relative permittivity and dielectric loss of AHS, combined with the local strong E-filed excited by the CFRP arrays, broaden the absorption band towards lower frequency and significantly reduce the reflection loss (RL), respectively. After optimization, HGHA achieves broadband (2–18 GHz), wide-angle (0–60°), and efficient (average ) EM wave absorption. Furthermore, honeycomb provide efficient lateral support for the grid walls, changing its failure mode from elastic buckling to plastic microbuckling. Thus, the specific compressive strength and specific energy absorption of HGHA is improved by 99.3% and 173%, respectively, compared to grid sandwich structure. It demonstrates that HGHA is competitive among radar absorbing structures and composite sandwich structures, providing a novel solution for the lightweight, high-efficiency, and multifunctional design of aircraft structures.},

The jet speed and temperature ratio are significantly higher than most laboratory facilities. At these high-speed and high-temperature conditions, compressibility effects become important. It is, therefore, possible that high-performance aircraft could emit a new noise component that has not been observed before. In the case of laboratory jets, turbulent mixing noise is generated by the shearing motion of the jet flow. The details of the process are discussed in this paper and others. In addition, this paper reports the identification of a new noise component from high-performance aircraft. This new noise component contains a significant fraction of infrasound. Infrasound at high intensity could lead to body cavity resonance. It becomes a health hazard. How this noise component is related to the early experimental observations of Mach wave radiation from shock-tube-generated jets, first reported by Oertel, and subsequent analysis based on the Euler equation by Tam and Hu are examined. The existence of the new noise component, which is the dominant component at an inlet angle larger than 140 deg, is confirmed by spectral data, directivity data, and as-measured sound pulse data.},

  abstract     = {Bistable deployable composite booms (Bi-DCBs) have broad application prospects in space deployable structures due to unique bistable characteristics, efficient stowage, lightweight, and excellent mechanical properties. However, the contrasting structural requirements (i.e., stiffness, stability) and operational requirements (i.e., lightweight, compact, and stowage) pose challenges to engineering design. To overcome this issue, this paper proposes a many-objective optimization formulation for the Bi-DCB, leveraging the respective advantages of the analytical and surrogate models, aiming to achieve a balance between multiple objectives, thereby obtaining the optimal comprehensive performance. In this formulation, the cross-sectional radius, cross-sectional angle, and length are selected as design variables while ensuring that the Bi-DCB does not fail during operation. Based on these, an optimization model is established with the objectives to minimize the linear density and the longitude-sectional polar radius at the endpoint and to maximize the average strain energy and the natural frequency. To verify optimal results, benchmark testing and performance evaluation are conducted using different algorithms, and the Pareto front containing 112 solutions is ultimately found, all superior to the initial sample in four objectives. These solutions achieve a good balance and coordination among multiple objectives, providing optimal performance schemes for the design of the Bi-DCB.},

  abstract     = {This study uses direct numerical simulations (DNSs) with PyFR (www.pyfr.org) to investigate the impact of freestream disturbances on the performance of nonconventional triangular airfoils for Martian rotorcraft. First, triangular airfoils optimized for steady uniform freestream conditions at a 12 deg angle of attack are subjected to unsteady upstream conditions containing freestream eddies with various target turbulence intensities and characteristic length scales. Results show that the freestream eddies lead to a breakdown of coherent suction-side vortices and a reduction of aerodynamic forces, with the magnitude of this effect increasing with higher turbulence intensities and larger length scales. Building on this, DNSs are then used to optimize triangular airfoils at a 12 deg angle of attack for unsteady upstream conditions containing freestream eddies. The new designs still leverage an unsteady vortex roll-up mechanism to generate lift. However, their shapes are different from those obtained when optimizing for steady uniform inflow conditions, with their apexes closer to the trailing edge. This downstream apex position allows for the smaller and weaker vortices that result from the interaction of the freestream eddies with the separated shear layer to cover a larger suction surface area. Taken together, the results demonstrate the importance of considering freestream disturbances when designing nonconventional airfoils for use on a Martian rotorcraft.},

  abstract     = {Numerical simulations show great potential to reduce the need for costly physical flight testing during takeoff and landing, thereby decreasing the time-to-market for future aircraft. In order to validate computational fluid dynamics results, we often perform wind-tunnel experiments. However, most simulations in the literature are performed at free-air conditions, neglecting confinement effects, and therefore the wind-tunnel data must be corrected based on empirical methods. In the present work, we compare free-air and in-tunnel simulations of NASA’s high-lift configuration of the Common Research Model (CRM-HL) and quantify sensitivities for steady Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS)-based methods and unsteady scale-resolving hybrid RANS/large-eddy simulations (HRLESs). Uncertainties associated with the choice of turbulence model, initialization strategies, and boundary conditions are covered. The present study provides valuable lessons learned and contributes toward best practices for in-tunnel simulations. For maximum lift prediction, RANS-based methods lead to nonphysical flow-separation patterns considering both free-air and in-tunnel configurations. We show consistency between in-tunnel and free-air HRLESs in terms of statistical and unsteady characteristics and reasonable agreement with wind-tunnel data. However, in-tunnel simulations increase the levels of complexity considerably and require long initial transients (independent of the initialization strategy). In order to explain persisting differences between simulation and experiment, we require better characterization of wind-tunnel flow conditions.},

In the LES, the new mechanisms for ethanol, n-heptane, and Jet A match available experimental data well, whereas the C1 mechanism slightly underpredicts the flame size.

Both the plate and stiffeners are modeled using the first-order shear deformation theory. Functionally graded material (FGM) properties vary continuously in the thickness direction using the power law. Compared to Finite Element Method (FEM), the Ritz method is beneficial while applying the skin-stiffener compatibility conditions, as the stiffeners can be placed arbitrarily and do not have to share nodes with the base structure finite element model. Such an approach would be efficient during shape optimization studies, as remeshing of the structure would not be required for changes in geometry. Orthogonal Jacobi polynomials as trial functions make the Ritz analysis robust, as they do not suffer matrix ill-conditioning-induced numerical issues when higher-order polynomials are required to accurately obtain the complex buckling mode shapes for curvilinearly stiffened panels. Stiffener displacements are approximated independently using one-dimensional trial functions, and compatibility is explicitly satisfied at the integration points along the stiffener path, which saves the computational cost by reducing the integration order. Accuracy of the proposed method is verified using several literature examples and commercial FEM software. Parametric studies on buckling response of the studied model with variation in the FGM power law index are conducted.},

The configuration examined is a panel located downstream of a compression ramp. First, the ramp is exposed to Mach 4 flow, and the frequency content of pressure fluctuations in the turbulent boundary layer upstream and downstream of the compression corner is compared. It is found that intermediate frequencies that may influence fluid-structure interaction propagate into the downstream boundary layer. Next, the coupling mechanism between turbulence and structural responses is studied. Changes in turbulence caused by structural deformations are examined, followed by an investigation into the aeroelastic effects of modified turbulence on a flexible panel. One-way coupling exists between turbulence and structural responses because structural deformations significantly affect turbulence properties, but variations in turbulence have minor effects on structural responses. Finally, the role of turbulence in fluid-structure interaction is determined. Pressure fluctuation histories of varying intensity are applied to panels of varying thickness. A threshold is established indicating when boundary layer turbulence causes moderate structural deformations. The findings of the paper provide guidelines for designing control surfaces of hypersonic vehicles subjected to turbulent shock wave-boundary layer interaction effects.},

A macroscopic numerical method for laser ablation under high-speed flow conditions was developed based on carbon/carbon (C/C) materials. The model includes both oxidation and sublimation processes of C/C materials. For the first time, mass injection effects on ablation characteristics were introduced. Numerical simulations of laser ablation on a flat plate model were conducted under Mach 6 and static conditions. The temperature evolution in the ablation zone was analyzed. Changes in flow characteristics due to ablation injection and high-speed airflow were examined in detail. Additionally, the impact of these flow changes on ablation characteristics was investigated. Results indicate that the airflow significantly affects temperature responses at different wall positions. The isotherms in the ablation zone bend downstream. The total ablation rate at Mach 6 is 5.3% higher than in static conditions. Local flow characteristics are altered by both ablation injection and high-speed flow, creating a high-pressure zone. This zone evolves continuously, leading to pressure variations at different wall locations. These local pressure changes significantly affect the sublimation rate of the wall, thereby influencing the ablation rate.},

  abstract     = {Aerobots are expected to play a key role in future missions to explore the atmospheres of Venus and other planetary bodies. Proposed missions to Venus involve lowering instruments on tethers toward the inhospitable surface from balloons at altitudes on the order of 50 km. Accurately capturing the viscoelastic behavior of the tethers in system design models is essential for managing response and loads during dynamic events (deployment, gusts, flight control) and following long-term aging in extreme environments. The behavior of materials likely to be used in tethers, such as Kevlar, is well-described by a fractional derivative viscoelastic model. One of the shortcomings of such models is the challenge of numerical time integration of the system equations of motion. In this work, fractional derivative behavior is approximated using a multi-anelastic displacement fields (multi-ADF) model. The multi-ADF model augments the instantaneous displacement field with multiple discrete internal displacement fields that individually evolve following first-order relaxation processes. Notably, while the fractional derivative model is nonlocal in time, requiring the entire history for evaluation, the first-order version is local, essentially capturing the history in the present values of internal state variables. A multi-ADF finite element model of a tether with an instrument gondola is developed, and a Newmark time integration scheme is used to obtain the dynamic response of the system during a drop test. The multi-ADF model is shown to be very accurate for creep, dynamics, and gondola-drop simulations, and it runs in a small fraction of the time required by a direct fractional-derivative model.},

  abstract     = {The accurate modeling of hypersonic environments, including coupled ablation, is a challenging problem due to the complex flow physics, numerical accuracy, and robustness required for these simulations. The simulation mesh needs to be designed carefully, and structured high-aspect ratio stretched grids are typically used to properly capture the high wall-normal gradients. The mesh generation process proves to be a cumbersome and time-consuming process for realistic and complex vehicles, creating a severe bottleneck to the current CFD workflow. This work highlights the development of the Cartesian Higher-Order Adaptive Multi-Physics Solver (CHAMPS) near-body Cartesian grid solver, capable of automatic volume mesh generation, and its accurate and robust use in simulating coupled ablation for steady-state graphite ablation by interfacing with the Kentucky Aerothermodynamics and Thermal Response System Material Response (KATS-MR) solver. Validation on a Mach 8.7 cylinder and a Mach 22.88 axisymmetric Mars 2020 capsule showcases the challenges associated with shock-capturing on non-shock-aligned Cartesian grids. A verification study of the CHAMPS–KATS coupled ablation framework is performed for steady-state graphite ablation on a Mach 25.2, 9 deg blunt cone, followed by the validation of the solver for a blunt cone in the NASA Ames Interaction Heating Facility arcjet.},

  abstract     = {We present a nonintrusive surrogate model to emulate time-dependent flow problems. Our approach enhances spatial mode decomposition using proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) to spectral model decomposition via spectral POD (SPOD), along with mapping of the spectrum in each case onto a common spectral domain. This alignment enables the collapse of fundamental frequencies in different cases into a single frequency. To emulate a new flowfield, we apply the kriging method to predict the SPOD coefficients for the target case, followed by flowfield reconstruction using the inverse Fourier transform. In our examples of flow past circular and square cylinders, we demonstrate the limitations of emulation based on POD or SPOD without a common spectral domain, as they fail to predict the fundamental frequency accurately. However, our proposed approach employing SPOD in the rescaled spectral domain successfully predicts the velocity spectrum and achieves a good predictability for time-dependent lift and mean drag. Moreover, we underscore the necessity of unbiased training data for the method’s efficacy. This study proposes a robust, nonintrusive surrogate modeling strategy to capture time-dependent features of flow problems, which is crucial for design purposes where time dependency between parameters is significant.},

The results demonstrated that the lift–drag ratio can be increased by about 21.8% without drag penalty after plasma actuation. Meanwhile, the time-averaged flowfield indicated that the separation region area around the flap is reduced by the plasma actuator. Moreover, the leading-edge stagnation point deflects toward the lower surface of the airfoil, which is similar to the effect of increasing the angle of attack and leads to the increment of the lift. In addition, the controlling mechanisms of the plasma actuator are uncovered based on the instantaneous flowfield results. It is of great importance that two flow structures produced by the interaction between the plasma actuator and the separated shear layer at different times play an important role in suppressing the separation flow by promoting the mixing between the main flow and the flow near the wall surface, and transferring the momentum from the leading edge of the flap to the trailing edge of the flap. The different characteristics of the separated shear layer at different times is the main reason for the generation of different flow structures of the plasma actuator.},

  abstract     = {The haystack phenomenon is a hallmark of turbulence–propeller interaction and a major source of unsteady thrust and aerodynamic noise in aircraft and underwater applications. This phenomenon is characterized by distinct broadband spectral humps in the unsteady thrust and noise at blade passing frequency harmonics. These humps tend to shift to higher frequencies under certain conditions, known as blue-shifting. Understanding the mechanics behind the haystack is crucial for developing effective flow and noise control strategies. This work introduces a theoretical model to predict unsteady thrust caused by these interactions. This model is validated through comparisons with numerical simulations under various inflow conditions, including single-frequency gusts and broadband turbulence. In addition, we examine the mechanisms of the haystack, with a focus on the influence of key parameters. Beyond its predictive capabilities, the model reveals certain flow structures ingested by the rotor that are related to the unsteady thrust and finally addresses the mechanisms of the blue-shifting phenomenon. This research not only deepens our understanding of the fluid mechanics underlying the haystacks but also provides valuable insights for designing the next generation of low-noise propellers, thereby contributing directly to quieter and more sustainable green aviation.},

  abstract     = {This paper describes a new computational strategy for complex aerodynamic flows that involve multiple powered devices, such as flow control actuators or power systems. A complete computational domain contains all the relevant physical regions, including the inner regions of all the powered devices. The proposed strategy aims to reduce the exorbitant computational resources required to resolve fine flow features within most of the devices. The approach involves modifying an existing computational fluid model by introducing a grid generation step and a boundary condition module. The grid generation step employs a predetermined strategy that is performed prior to the simulation step, resulting in a grid system that includes only a few of the devices. The flow computation is then performed by incorporating special boundary conditions replicated over all the powered devices and continually updated in the course of the time-stepping process. This approach demonstrates high computational efficiency, as exemplified by its application to a wing of a rotorcraft equipped with numerous flow control actuators in hover mode. The results obtained using this replication approach closely match those obtained using a complete computational domain, but with approximately 50% fewer computational resources. Excluding many actuators from the computational domain is particularly advantageous for flows with disparate length scales and time scales, enabling practical computations over sufficiently long times.},

Numerical simulations, performed using a lattice Boltzmann solver ProLB, are validated against these experimental data. While the geometry is relatively simple, this is still a challenging case to accurately predict numerically, particularly the boundary-layer separation bubble that occurs upstream of the spoiler. The flow is characterized by an arch-type broadband wake without any coherent vortex shedding. There is a horseshoe vortex that originates upstream of the spoiler and wraps around both sides of the spoiler. Inboard of the horseshoe vortex there are a pair of ground vortices with the opposite sign vorticity to the horseshoe vortex. A combination of band-filtered on-surface pressures and three-dimensional numerical beamforming was used to determine the noise sources. As well as the broadband bluff body wake and the horseshoe vortex, the beamforming showed that the ground edge vortices and the spoiler side edges were the dominant acoustic sources.},

Blade-resolved models provide greater design freedom, enabling 5% higher mass reductions than conventional parameterizations at equal torque.

However, a variety of problems could emerge as hydrogen flames are prone to thermodiffusive instabilities. In this work, transported probability density function (TPDF) simulations are carried out in conjunction with a direct numerical simulation dataset of lean premixed turbulent hydrogen/air flames. This provides a clean evaluation of the models for conditional molecular diffusion, including the micromixing in composition space and the molecular transport in physical space. It is found that the mixing formulations ignoring the localness in composition space are incapable of reproducing the overall combustion process. Applying the mechanical-to-scalar timescale ratio indicated by the mixing frequency of hydrogen is superior to a constant ratio, implying that hydrogen is the controlling species for scalar mixing. More interestingly, it is found that the superequilibrium phenomenon cannot be captured regardless of the treatment for micromixing if the molecular transport in physical space is ignored, highlighting the importance of spatial transport due to molecular diffusion, which is typically ignored in TPDF simulations. This study demonstrates the capability of the TPDF method to reproduce the key features of synergistic interactions between turbulence and thermodiffusive instabilities.},

The experiment was operated with an inlet air temperature of 670 K, mass flow rate of 1.14 kg/s, and pressure of 0.57 MPa. The dual-pump CARS system provided simultaneous measurements of the nitrogen Q-branch ro-vibrational energy level structure of nitrogen and pure-rotational energy level structure of nitrogen and oxygen. These spectra possess ample features for comparison to theory at temperatures of 600–2500 K. Comparison between CARS and OH-PLIF measurements indicated that the highest temperature and highest OH-PLIF intensity are located within the downstream extent of the recirculation zone. A comparison of wall-normal profiles of the OH-PLIF and CARS measurements indicates that maximum temperature standard deviation matches the mean location of flame heat release, while the maximum temperature better correlates with the OH-PLIF intensity. A bulk transport of hot combustion products toward the wall is observed in the instantaneous OH-PLIF images. This phenomenon is critical for the energy transfer to the grain that supports the local fuel regression to support the diffusion flame.},

  abstract     = {Transonic shock buffet refers to the phenomenon of significant oscillation of shock waves during transonic flight. Due to its strong unsteady and nonlinear characteristics, effective control of buffet has consistently posed a challenge. In this study, a physics-guided active control framework is proposed to stabilize the unsteadiness of buffet, in which the core control parameters are determined by the resolvent analysis and dominant flow features. Based on the unstable steady base flow, resolvent analysis is first conducted on buffet flow over the NACA0012 airfoil. The obtained forcing mode exhibits an obvious oblique characteristic on the upper surface of the airfoil, representing that the buffet flow is most sensitive to external forcing in this region, like an acupoint. Following this guidance, a steady jet active control with a very tiny momentum coefficient is then applied at this position. The results of different jet positions and angles from numerical simulation indicate that the jet can suppress shock buffet only within the narrow region guided by the forcing mode. The correlation between flow features obtained from resolvent analysis and optimal control patterns is quantitatively established by effective gains, which explain that the selection of jet control position and angle is essentially a flow sensitivity problem.},

However, the strain rate in the pulse laser shock test is approximately (an ultrahigh strain rate), which causes the current static or quasi-static constitutive models, failure criteria, and damage evolution to be no longer applicable. Therefore, this paper proposed the use of a three-dimensional orthogonal anisotropic constitutive model of strain-rate dependence, in which modulus and strength are proportional to the strain rate and follow a logarithmic relationship. The finite element model was created by dividing each layer of the composite material separately and further meshing each layer. The propagation rules of laser-induced plasma shock waves in the composite materials were calculated. The delamination locations and the particle velocity at the backside of the specimen were compared with experiment. It proves that the constitutive models of strain rate dependence are suitable for calculating the laser-induced shock impact on aeronautical composite materials.},

The abnormal vibration of the rotor caused by crack faults represents an anomalous transfer of energy from the force-driving point through the shaft. Relying solely on rotor vibration displacement for analysis may not provide a comprehensive reflection of the internal impact of cracks on system operation. Thus, the vibration power flow is utilized to investigate a cantilever support rotor, commonly employed in high-speed rotor systems for aeroengines, under the influence of crack faults. The results reveal the reason for the distinctive motion observed at twice the first critical speed in the cracked rotor. The vibration energy of the system is investigated through nonlinear dynamics analysis in the presence of displacement bifurcation. Subsequently, the energy response and transfer of cracked rotor systems under parameter influence are examined to elucidate how crack faults impact the input and transfer of vibration energy. The accuracy of theoretical findings is validated through experimental methods. These research findings are valuable for dynamic characteristic analysis and fault diagnosis in cracked rotor systems.},

Using a localized excitation study, the sensor’s spatial sensitivity is characterized, and a mathematical model to estimate the wall pressure spectrum is presented. It is shown that these sensors have a well-defined, second-order dynamic response without grazing flow. Their performance in flow shows the disturbance to the flow below the measurement uncertainty, indicating no significant flow disturbance.

  abstract     = {Accurate prediction of airfoil performance through stall underpins the successful design of modern proprotors and wind turbines, which can exhibit significantly stalled flow during normal operation. Existing stall models typically employ two-region approaches: coupling pre-stall data with semi-empirical deep-stall models. None of the current low-order methods accurately captures the initial drop and recovery of lift in the post-stall regime. This paper proposes a novel three-region lift model, which accurately predicts the regions of stall, recovery, and deep-stall across a range of airfoils and Reynolds numbers. This is achieved through the inclusion of a semi-empirical implementation of Rayleigh’s flat plate theory. The model is directly compared against published alternatives and integrated into a low-order solver. The inclusion of the new model results in thrust prediction improvements across the operational range when compared to current two-region approaches of 7% for a small-scale rotor. It is also shown to be up to 74% more accurate in the initial drop and recovery regions than other published methods for an isolated airfoil. In all scenarios, the model is shown to produce a more physical representation of an airfoil through stall, which has great potential for improving the fidelity of performance, structural, and acoustic simulations.},

The flow region where internal feedback forcing sustains the PVC is called the wavemaker. Linear stability analysis (LSA) methods, in conjunction with large-eddy simulation (LES), can be used to identify a wavemaker. Here, we assess a data-driven approach using complex network analysis (CNA) to identify the wavemaker of a nominally axisymmetric turbulent swirl nozzle flow using unsteady data from a prior LES for which wavemaker predictions from LSA are available. Networks are constructed using time-resolved velocity data from the LES. Internodal connectivity is defined using either correlation or mutual information, and weighted closeness centrality is used to identify network hubs in each case. These hubs identify the wavemaker when mapped back to physical space. Both networks predict the position of the wavemaker in good agreement with the prior LSA result, with the mutual information network providing a closer match to the wavemaker’s spatial extent. These results show that CNA can be applied reliably to extract wavemaker information from time-series data of turbulent swirl flow.},

However, the effect of the propeller wake on wing icing characteristics is not well understood. This study clarifies the mechanisms and extent of propeller wake effects on wing icing by comparing the icing characteristics with and without the propeller wake. Three-dimensional quasi-unsteady simulations are employed to capture temporal changes in the droplet field and ice accretion rates caused by local and unsteady propeller wake flows. The computational results provide insights into the icing characteristics induced by aerodynamic interactions. Higher axial velocities enhance droplet impingement and heat convection on the wing. Upwash and downwash change the local effective attack angle, altering droplet impingement limits and the size and intensity of heat convection. The rotation of tip vortices creates droplet voids and dense regions, enhancing heat convection on the inside of the wing tip and leading to noticeable differences in ice formation. Consequently, ice shapes behind the propeller wake are up to 80% thicker and more irregular, leading to twice as severe degradation in aerodynamic performance of the non-wake-induced iced wing. This study highlights the need to consider propeller wake effects in wing icing analysis.},

In the present work, the bullet passage is modeled by the ballistic, or N-wave, flowfield, which mimics the far-field flow of the bullet. A sharp-interface simulation (via the moment-of-fluid method) of droplet deformation and incipient breakup is then carried out. The match of simulated trajectory and droplet deformation with the measurements indicates that the N-wave model captures the experiment postshock decrease of the flow Weber number. Simulation analysis confirms a previous observation that, in the bullet experiment, the time of incipient breakup is longer than what is predicted by existing correlations. Moreover, droplet flattening predicted by the Taylor Analogy Breakup model with the coefficient consistently underestimates the observed diameter growth in both experiment and simulation. The difference with respect to a gradually accelerating droplet is attributed to the baroclinic vorticity that is deposited by the shock within a thin boundary layer at the droplet surface.},

This experimental study investigates the influence of the nose and boat tail geometry on the flow around hammerhead configurations in the transonic regime and for various angles of attack . To gain a general understanding of the shockwave structures, flow separation and reattachment, oil flow and schlieren visualizations were employed. Schlieren visualizations were also utilized to characterize the level of unsteadiness in these regions. Additionally, particle image velocimetry was employed to quantify variations in the velocity field. The study’s findings reveal an optimization of flow performance in the presence of a bi-conic nose, attributed to the creation of two-shockwave structures with relatively low intensity. This is in contrast to the ogive and conic noses, which exhibit a single, more detrimental shockwave structure. The investigation into different boat tail angles indicates that adopting low-angle boat tails (5° and 15° compared to 34°) leads to a noticeable reduction in the separated area, albeit associated with an increase in the range of oscillation of the shockwave structures.},

  abstract     = {In the aerodynamic shape design based on waveriders, the waverider surface is deemed to be unchangeable by default. It leads to many problems for practical application, such as in modifying the lower surface and adjusting the volume. In this paper, the concept of waveriding-dependent area (WDA) is proposed. The WDA represents the portion of waveriding surface, which decides the main shock wave. Employing the theory of characteristics, the method to generate the WDA is first to find a flow area on which the shock wave depends in inviscid axisymmetric supersonic flow. Then, taking this flow area as the basis flowfield, the wave riding surface generated by tracing streamlines is the so-called WDA. The range of WDA is analyzed using the oblique shock relations preliminarily. After that, computational fluid dynamics techniques were employed to test several osculating-cone configurations with retaining different ranges of waveriding surface. Their aerodynamic forces and longitudinal stabilities were compared, followed by the shock waves analysis in symmetric planes and trailing-edge sections. It is verified that just retaining WDA maintained the strength of the main shock wave, and thereby the shock waves attached along the leading edge, indicating evident waveriding performance. The WDA theory attempts to determine which area of the waverider surface is allowed to be modified or altered without breaking the waveriding performance. Hence, this concept is meaningful to enlarge loading volume, reduce drag, and improve wide-speed performance for practical waverider aircraft design.},

For a hovering rotor, the turbulence is mainly located in the boundary layer on the blade surface. In this work, we conduct a systematic investigation on a benchmark rotor to characterize the noise features, develop prediction models, and explore the effectiveness of the noise reduction methods. The two-bladed rotor has a radius of 0.5 m, and the tests were conducted in an anechoic chamber. Measurements show that the amplitude of rotor broadband noise can be scaled by the fifth power law of tip Mach number at , with the frequency scaled by the , where is the blade radius and is the tip velocity. The BPM model for airfoil self-noise computation is extended to a rotation frame for the rotor noise prediction. Prediction results show reasonable agreement with the measurements, suggesting that the broadband rotor noise is dominated by the trailing-edge noise source, mainly contributed by the suction side boundary layer and the effect of the nonzero angles of attack. Additionally, attempts for broadband reduction are conducted by applying particulate roughness on the blade surface, which can achieve a reduction of 3 dB above 5000 Hz. Moreover, results suggest that applying surface treatments on the blade leading edge can achieve nearly identical reductions as the full-span treatments.},

  abstract     = {This work investigates a ducted contra-rotating-rotor unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) whose aeroacoustic properties are less known compared to quadrotor UAVs. Two factors complicate the aeroacoustic analysis of this new design: the aerodynamic interaction among coaxial contra-rotating rotors and motor struts introduces additional source mechanisms, and acoustic scattering on duct walls further complicates the acoustic propagation process. A hybrid computational aeroacoustics (CAA) method is developed to project the aeroacoustic sources onto the in-duct modal space, allowing one to link various aeroacoustic sources to the acoustic far field through duct modes. An intriguing finding is that rotor–rotor interactions, the main source mechanism in open contra-rotating rotor propulsion systems, dominate acoustic far field only at even harmonic orders of blade passing frequencies (BPFs). A modified Tyler–Sofrin criterion has been derived to explain the underlying physics, where it is shown that the rotor–rotor interaction noise excites plane wave mode that couples to the acoustic far field. Conversely, at odd harmonic orders of BPFs, the rotor–strut interaction dominates the acoustic far field through the lower-order duct modes following the classical Tyler–Sofrin criterion. These results suggest the potential of exploiting mode scattering effects among rotors and struts, as well as the duct cutoff effect for significant noise reduction in ducted UAVs.},

  abstract     = {The aerodynamic noise generated by a circular cylinder in a subsonic crossflow is a classical problem in aeroacoustics, which has been investigated experimentally and numerically in the past. The presence of a turbulent inflow is known to have an effect on the generation of tonal noise due to vortex shedding, although the available experimental data are sparse. The present paper describes an experimental study on the noise generated by a set of circular cylinders in grid-generated turbulence conducted in an aeroacoustic wind tunnel facility. Acoustic measurements were performed using microphone array technology. The results show that the free stream turbulence broadens the spectral peak of the vortex shedding tones, especially for cylinders with a diameter that is small compared to the turbulent integral length scale. One key result of the study is that the turbulent inflow leads to an increase in the vortex shedding Strouhal number compared to the case with clean inflow as well as to an additional increase of the Strouhal number with Reynolds number. This trend can also be observed qualitatively in the velocity power spectral densities measured in the wake of a selected cylinder using hot-wire anemometry.},

  abstract     = {A fluidic oscillator, as the name suggests, emits an oscillating jet of fluid without the necessity of any moving parts. The frequency of oscillation and spread of the jet depends on the geometry as well as the dynamics of flow inside the device. The present investigation explores the internal and external flowfield behaviors exhibited by a fluidic oscillator using conventional methods and dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) analysis. A curved feedback-channel (FBC)-type fluidic oscillator of aspect ratio one is studied using two-dimensional, unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes (2D-URANS) simulations. The flow switching occurs due to the alternative exchange of momentum between the centerline jet and recirculating low-pressure regions in the mixing chamber. The alternating vortices outside the oscillator are produced due to the entrainment of the surrounding quiescent fluid by the oscillating jet. DMD analysis of the external flowfield reveals that most of the flow energy is associated with the highly oscillatory modes that have higher decay rates. This investigation will improve the understanding of the underlying physics of fluidic oscillators, aiding future design modifications and optimization of the size and shape of actuator geometries for various flow control applications.},

The approach is grounded in refining the wall law governing the mean velocity profile within the inner layer of the turbulent boundary layer (TBL) under APG conditions. Drawing insights from direct numerical simulations (DNS), the wall law has been modified to maintain good consistency with the mean velocity profile provided by DNS data in flows with strong nonequilibrium effects. Further theoretical analysis shows that the analytical solutions of turbulent quantities satisfying the wall law under APG cannot satisfy the turbulent kinetic energy transport equation (-equation). Based on the analysis, an approximate solution for the eddy viscosity coefficient that complies with the -equation in flows with slight APG to correct in APG flows is proposed. Leveraging this approximate solution, the eddy viscosity in the shear stress transport model has been modified. The resultant modification induces an elevation of the mean velocity profile within the inner layer of the TBL at APG, leading to augmentation of the skin-friction coefficient.},

  abstract     = {Since its publication in 2012, the negative version (SA-neg) of the Spalart–Allmaras model has been widely used to improve the iterative convergence of Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes solutions for practical turbulent flows. The success of this version is based on the rigorously proved positivity of the diffusion coefficient in the SA-neg partial differential equation and the corresponding positivity and boundedness of the continuous solution. However, some implementations of the SA-neg version in finite-volume computational fluid dynamics solvers may violate the positivity of discrete diffusion coefficients and result in the divergence of iterative solutions. A revised diffusion-based implementation of the SA-neg version has been accomplished in NASA’s cell-centered finite-volume flow solver, USM3D-ME. The implementation guarantees the positivity of discrete diffusion coefficients. This paper presents theoretical foundations for the revised implementation of the SA-neg version. Iterative convergence for different SA-neg implementations is studied for representative grids and flow conditions. With the revised implementation, fast iterative convergence to machine zero residuals is demonstrated for the test cases considered in the seventh AIAA Drag Prediction Workshop, held in 2022. Additionally, the robustness of the revised diffusion-based implementation is demonstrated for different discretization schemes, nonlinear iterative solvers, and turbulence models.},

In this study, we employ a -coupled -scale Reynolds stress model (RSM), whose potential has been confirmed in our recent work for NASA’s Juncture Flow. Further, we modify the model by incorporating new correlation functions for cases with pressure gradients and calibrated compressible correction to handle the effects of Mach number. The modified RSM transition model was validated by a series of benchmark tests (transition plates, airfoils, and sickle wing) and then applied to DLR(Deutsches Zentrum für Luft- und Raumfahrt)-F4 and CRM (Common Research Model)-NLF (Natural Laminar Flow) wing–body configurations. The numerical results, especially the transition onsets, show that the proposed model outperforms SST and original RSM in tests on the two transonic wing–body configurations.},

We present a global linear analysis, termed the Navier–Stokes-based mean flow perturbation (NS-MFP), of a supersonic rectangular jet to identify an optimal spectral range and modes of forcing for effective noise mitigation. These linear estimates are then verified by evaluating the noise reduction achieved in the corresponding controlled large-eddy simulations (LESs), which model the actuators as circumferentially placed localized-arc-filament-plasma-actuator-type strips near the nozzle exit. NS-MFP identifies the most receptive frequency in the near-nozzle shear layer as ), which undergoes maximum streamwise amplification within the first 2–3 equivalent jet diameters. The global eigenmode at is dominated by the first three circumferential modes of an equivalent circular jet, which helps refine the actuator configurations in the LES. Consistent with the linear estimates, when actuated with higher circumferential modes ( and 3) at , far-field noise reduced by over 2 dB, with a peak reduction of 2.5 dB achieved in the downstream direction. In addition to informing optimal control parameters, the linear model also accurately predicts the directivity and relative intensity of tonal response of the jet to specific modes of forcing, which is critical in minimizing tonal penalty associated with harmonic active control techniques. This is demonstrated through a comparative modal analysis of the linear forcing model and the corresponding signature in the LES.},

OWNS yields a reduced computational cost compared to global solvers while also conferring numerous advantages over the parabolized stability equations (PSEs), despite its higher computational cost relative to PSE, that we seek to extend to nonlinear analysis. We validate the nonlinear OWNS (NOWNS) method by examining the nonlinear evolution of two- and three-dimensional disturbances in a low-speed Blasius boundary layer compared to nonlinear PSE (NPSE) and direct numerical simulation (DNS) results from the literature. We demonstrate that NOWNS can be used to simulate flows involving blowing/suction strips, is more robust to numerical noise, and converges for stronger nonlinearities, as compared to NPSE.},

[“The stabilizing effect of grooves on Görtler instability-induced boundary layer transition in hypersonic flow,” Physics of Fluids, Vol. 35, No. 4, 2023, Paper 041701] has shown that grooves can attenuate secondary instability of Görtler vortices when placed at the center of Görtler streaks (the groove valley location coincides with the low-speed streak location) over a concave wall. However, experimental studies have not been conducted, and the underlying physical mechanism has not been investigated. For that reason, calculations are performed based on direct numerical simulations and biglobal stability analysis to discover the delaying mechanism. In the simulations, Görtler vortices are excited by wall steady blowing and suction with spanwise wavelengths of 3 mm. The wall is covered with grooves with depths in 1, 2, and 3 mm. A delaying mechanism by grooves is proposed: grooves with spacings corresponding to the wavelength of primitive Görtler vortices reduce the streamwise velocity gradients, which act as the source of the disturbance energy. Thus, the growth rate of the sinuous secondary instability mode of Görtler vortices is reduced efficiently, leading to the delay of boundary-layer transition. In addition, with the increase in the depth of grooves within an appropriate range, a better stabilizing effect can be achieved. The effect of phase difference between grooves and stationary Görtler vortices on hypersonic boundary-layer transition is also investigated, revealing that grooves with 0 phase difference (i.e., the groove peak location coincides with the low-speed streak location) could delay the boundary-layer transition most efficiently. Finally, preliminary experimental results are obtained, showing a qualitative agreement with the numerical results.},

For this distinct shock train system, the leading shocks are shaped like hourglasses composed of nearly axisymmetric bifurcated normal shocks; the following shocks are significantly twisted, distorted, and observed to exhibit unsteady large-scale motions at the tail part of the shock train region. Through the azimuthal discrete Fourier transform and proper orthogonal decomposition, these large-scale motions are shown to be closely linked with the coherent helical structures, which are present in two typical forms: the canonical-form ones concentrated in the bulk flow and the two-layer ones occurring in both the bulk and near-wall flow. Moreover, quantitative analysis of correlation functions and power spectral density of wall pressure fluctuations show that the two-layer helical structures greatly contribute to the peaks of wall pressure fluctuation coefficients near the tails of shock trains.},

The effect of control, however, decreases with an increase in the strength of the interaction. For vane height of , the plateau pressure in the conical region of interaction shows a maximum reduction of approximately 100% and 50% for fin angles of 6 and 18 deg, respectively.

  abstract     = {The potential thermodynamic gain of rotating detonation combustors (RDCs) is typically represented as a pressure gain or increase in total pressure. However, defining a singular total pressure for pressure gain requires averaging due to the unsteady and nonuniform flow. The choice in averaging is nontrivial, and this work details the procedures that conserve the flow’s entropy, thrust output, and work output. These, along with area averaging, are compared to the accepted equivalent available pressure (EAP), with a key finding being that the experimental EAP is equivalent to area averaging. Sample results from three-dimensional direct numerical simulations were analyzed for demonstrative purposes. The experimental EAP was found always to be conservative and underpredicts the other averages by 2.5–38%, with entropy averaging being the most idealistic. This analysis highlights that work averaging is not equivalent to thrust averaging, as the work-averaged total pressures were 4–8% larger. The nonuniqueness in total pressure is exacerbated by the thrust averaging being sensitive to the assumed ambient exit conditions, unlike the work averaging. Overall, this paper highlights that the appropriate averaging procedure depends on the desired RDC application, as the outlet total pressure, needed to define pressure gain, is not intrinsic to the flow after a reduction in dimensionality.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a novel magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) system for planetary entry aerocapture. The following two features provide the system an advantage over earlier methods: i) it can be deployed locally to one or various flow regions, and ii) it does not make use of electrodes. Previous MHD systems for planetary entry were either electrodeless global systems or two-electrode local systems. The proposed novel MHD system employs two magnets to establish a current loop, resulting in a Faraday electromotive force. The first magnet is positioned to ensure that the magnetic field faces outward from the shell, while the second magnet is oriented to ensure that the magnetic field faces inward toward the shell. Preliminary findings demonstrate that when located on the surface of an Earth-entry capsule at a flight Mach number of 35, the novel electrodeless MHD system can generate forces several times greater than a two-electrode system while utilizing the same magnetic field strength. The study is conducted entirely through numerical simulation using Computational Fluid Dynamics, Waves, Reactions, Plasmas (CFDWARP), a computational fluid dynamics code that employs advanced numerical methods allowing for the full coupling between aerodynamics, magnetohydrodynamics, and non-neutral plasma sheaths. The physical model includes an 11-species finite-rate chemical solver, including real gas effects, and the drift-diffusion model for all charged species, along with an electric field potential equation that satisfies Gauss’s law.},

This study proposes a design method for low-vibration structures in the spatial-wavenumber domain, based on the principle of spatial correlation for the suppression of structural vibration. The effects of key parameters on the design of low-vibration structures are also discussed in detail. The results indicate that different structural modes correspond to varying quantities of aerodynamic modes within the velocity response valley, resulting in distinct approaches for developing low-vibration structures. It is observed that structures that are excessively narrow or thick are particularly susceptible to thickness effects and should be designed using numerical methods rather than analytical approaches. Additionally, an analytical expression is presented to describe the structural equivalent wavelength, and the determination of the velocity valley for medium boundaries is addressed. To validate the proposed low-vibration structure design, a numerical evaluation of various structures is conducted in this work.},

The tapering effect in these laminated composite structures is introduced by terminating plies, which act as potential delamination sites. Delamination and uncertainties in material properties at various scales influence their dynamic behavior. The variational asymptotic method (VAM) is used as a mathematical framework to develop a model of a tapered composite beam with delamination. Subsequently, the modal characteristics are obtained by coupling the VAM model with the reduced 1D finite element beam model. Stochastic natural frequencies are investigated by combining the source uncertainties in the delaminated structure. Following a detailed validation study, the model capability is demonstrated on flexbeams typically used in helicopter rotor blades.},

  abstract     = {A common issue in structural damage identification is the measurement information being limited while the baseline structural model is complex, which renders the inverse analysis underdetermined. Leveraging that the damage in its early stage usually affects only small area(s), a multiobjective optimization can be formulated by minimizing the difference between model prediction and physical measurement and concurrently enforcing the sparsity in damage locations. The challenges, however, lie in handling the high-dimensional parametric space with multimodal objective functions as well as the computational cost brought by incorporating the norm minimization. In this research, we synthesize a hierarchical framework that searches potential damage locations first and then delves into accurate characterization of damage. In particular, to address the high-dimensional and multimodal challenges intensified by high-frequency measurement toward high-precision identification, we adopt the Group Lasso technique for sparsity induction and use the technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution to realize optimization phase transition, aiming at improving the computational efficiency as well as the accuracy. The validation of our approach through a piezoelectric admittance sensing testbed underscores its potential for structural health monitoring practices by providing a robust, accurate, and computationally efficient approach for early-stage damage identification and assessment.},

This study investigates the vibration characteristics of a shaft–disk–cracked-blade coupling system under multisource excitation using a hybrid modeling approach that combines the finite element method and the assumed modes method. The validity of the proposed model is confirmed through comparisons with the finite element model and existing literature on natural frequencies and vibration responses. A systematic analysis is conducted on the influence of multisource excitation, such as gravity load, unbalanced load, and aerodynamic load, on the vibration characteristics of the coupling system. The impact of different crack parameters on blade tip bending and shaft torsion is also investigated. Results show that for healthy blades, gravity load induces blade bending vibrations at the rotational frequency, while unbalanced load leads to static deformation. In the cracked system, equilibrium positions of blade tip bending displacements offset, and aerodynamic loads cause nonlinear vibrations due to the breathing behavior of the blade crack. Blade crack also induces additional torsional vibrations in the shaft. Furthermore, the amplitude ratios of blade bending and shaft torsion related to the constant component, rotational frequency component, and aerodynamic excitation frequency component are effective indicators for evaluating breathing cracks. This study provides a theoretical basis for diagnosing blade crack faults and improving the reliability of aeroengine operation.},

The effect of such fluctuation in high-speed rotating structural components is proposed to be exploited here for the dual purpose of energy harvesting and speed sensing through mounting piezoelectric elements. The voltage output is enhanced through the coupled effect of poling angle tuning and introducing functionally graded materials based on power and sigmoid laws. An efficient, yet insightful theoretical framework is developed on the basis of active Euler-Bernoulli beam theory and conservation of energy principles, which are further validated using separate finite element results and qualitative experimental characterization. We develop an effective computational mapping among the output open-circuit voltage, rotational speed, functional gradation and poling orientation, wherein the output voltage, voltage sensitivity, and charge sensitivity are used as critical metrics to quantify the performance of the energy harvesters. The concept of exploiting angular speed variation along with poling-architected piezoelectric functionally graded configurations will be crucial for designing selfpowered optimized electronic sensors and devices for a range of aerospace and mechanical applications such as helicopter blades, aircraft engines, wind turbines and other rotating machines.},

While the passive method with the SHS-coated blade was found to be only marginally effective under the glaze icing condition, it became ineffective or even further deteriorated the propeller performance under the mixed and rime icing conditions. While the active IPS design to forcefully heat the entire blade surface was found to be able to prevent ice accretion on most of the blade surface, some minor “ice crowns” were still observed to accrete near the blade tip. The hybrid IPS design was demonstrated to keep the entire blade surface ice-free under all the icing conditions with substantially less power consumption (i.e., power saving), rendering it a compelling UAV propeller icing mitigation strategy.},

This process typically involves multiple physical fields and spans various temporal and spatial scales. In this study, a fully coupled electrohydrodynamics–particle-in-cell method is proposed to perform transient simulation of this process. Based on this method, the dynamic deformation of freely suspended ionic liquid droplets in an electric field was simulated, changes in physical quantities (such as surface charge density, current density, and velocity over time) were recorded, and the acceleration and displacement of emitted ions in the electric field were captured. In this study, the impact of emitted ions on the electrohydrodynamic behavior of droplets was analyzed in detail and the significance of this impact under different ion masses and droplet conductivities was compared. The results indicate that the ion beam has certain inhibitory effects on the deformation and ion evaporation process of the droplets, with the inhibitory effects becoming more pronounced as the ion mass and conductivity increase. Although conductivity remains the primary limiting factor in the field evaporation process of ionic liquids, it can be anticipated that space-charge effects will eventually replace conductivity as the dominant limiting factor as conductivity continues to increase.},

  abstract     = {The development of high-performance green monopropellant-based small thrusters is essential for successful multipurpose space missions. This study experimentally demonstrates a novel electrochemical propulsion system that leverages rotating gliding arc (RGA) plasma to enhance the performance of 88 wt% hydrogen peroxide. This is the first electrochemical propulsion system that utilizes catalytic decomposition gases of hydrogen peroxide directly as plasma-forming gases and an alternating current (AC)-based RGA. The system employs an AC power supply operating at a 20 kHz frequency, combined with a swirler and an anchoring component that ensures geometric stabilization of the arc column. This configuration enabled stable plasma discharge under high-temperature and high-pressure conditions. The propulsion performance of the plasma reactor was significantly improved by rapidly heating the discharge gases, which were then accelerated to supersonic speeds through a De-Laval nozzle. In the electrochemical operation mode, this process led to consistent enhancements in both chamber pressure and characteristic velocity, achieving approximately 1.4- and 2-fold increases, respectively, compared to the chemical mode (without plasma discharge). The novel propulsion concept can provide a universally applicable solution capable of enhancing the performance of chemical propulsion systems with plasma discharge.},

  abstract     = {To enhance the accuracy of predicting the dynamic response of a supersonic rocket sled along a multikilometer track, a multibody dynamics model of a flexible sled-track system was formulated using finite volume beam elements and multi-degree-of-freedom spring-damper joints. Shear locking was avoided by modifying the constitutive matrix, and the accuracy of the modeling method was validated through modal tests of both the sled and the track. The sled-track interaction model was developed by considering clearance, collision, and friction. A window transfer method was developed to improve computational efficiency. The flexible sled, with a maximum velocity of Mach 2.7, was simulated running along the long flexible track, accounting for the sled’s time-varying mass, random track irregularities, oscillating engine thrust, and velocity-dependent aerodynamic forces. A supersonic rocket sled test was also conducted to validate the method. The results showed that the flexible sled-track model developed in this study significantly improved the accuracy of predicting the system’s dynamic response compared to traditional rigid sled or track models. The main frequencies of the sled cabin’s dynamic responses corresponded to the system’s time-varying natural frequencies. The slipper’s acceleration exhibited superharmonic responses, with the main frequencies being odd multiples of the fundamental frequency.},

The shape of the stable combustion flame and the flame propagation process were captured by a visualization window mounted on the combustor side wall, and the pressure along the combustor during the ignition process was collected based on pressure sensors. The results show that the global flame establishment of the combustor can be realized under the effect of the wall kerosene injection. The linear change of the strut/wall equivalence ratio will directly affect the thermal choke position of the combustor, which will affect the flame propagation characteristics of the combustor and result in varying degrees of flame blowing off, flame attachment, and flame backpropagation. In addition, the combustion stabilization of the combustor can be achieved under the combined action of the strut and the thermal choke. The oxygen injection of the strut plays a more important role in the combustion stabilization. However, if the oxygen is removed, the thermal choke will play a more important role than the strut.},

Parametric substructure mode is a vital component in ensuring the accuracy of the modeling process. This work uses the Craig–Bampton Component Mode Synthesis method to calculate normal and constraint modes of substructures at interpolation points. Instead of using singular value decomposition of augmented fixed-interface modes, the presented approach performs direct Taylor expansion for substructure modes with randomly varying parameters. The parametric substructure modes are approximated by the modes at interpolation points. The global parametric reduced-order model is constructed through the synthesis of parametric substructures. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is validated through 1) a thickness-variable beam, 2) a cantilevered plate with varying thicknesses, and 3) a mistuned blisk.

  abstract     = {Turbulence generation has received considerable attention as high-fidelity simulations have become more tractable for a widening range of applications. Many inflow strategies have emerged to reduce the numerical expense of generating equilibrium turbulent profiles, but ambiguity exists in the appropriate turbulent-inflow condition for each use case. This work aids in properly selecting turbulent inflows by comparing two common techniques: a synthetic digital filtering method and a body-force-based trip. The inflows are rigorously compared to identify parameters sensitive to the turbulence generation. A supersonic case with a Mach number of 1.5 and a subsonic case with a Mach number of 0.2 are considered. For both flow regimes, the skin-friction coefficient using the trip recovers faster than the digital filter. Conversely, the shape factor predictions recover faster for the digital filter than the trip. The results indicate that selecting the optimal inflow turbulence strategy is a multifaceted problem with many interrelated effects of flow conditions and desired target parameters. The numerical framework in which the technique is embedded is equally important. Therefore, code-specific comparisons like those provided here are a crucial benchmark for informed selection and guidance of turbulent inflows.},

In this paper, the distribution of the important variables and functions of the SA model is studied. It is found that, in APG TBL, the original SA model exhibits significant errors and encounters a multiple-value problem of the function in the destruction term. A new feature is proposed based on the gradient of eddy viscosity to characterize the pressure gradient and history effects of TBL, overcoming the multiple-value problem. A new algebraic expression of the function, as shown in Eq. (21), is established by combining neural networks and symbolic regression. The results show that the new model provides good generalization for nine different flows outside the training set, not only maintaining the good behaviors of the original SA model in ZPG, but also enhancing the accuracy of separated flows.},

To prevent unstart, detecting and controlling the shock train location are essential.

The data-driven control approach employed in this study, which utilizes radial basis function neural network (RBF-NN), offers a solution to these problems. It directly derives control laws from data, enabling adaptive parameter adjustment. An experimental investigation was conducted to control the shock train in an inlet at Mach 4.2, using the shock train location as the feedback signal and the downstream flap angle as the control input. The standard deviation method was used to accurately evaluate the shock train location and mitigate errors caused by reflected shocks. Real-time control input required for determining shock train displacement was calculated using the RBF-NN. Considering disturbances and system lag, the favorable pressure gradient downstream of the throat significantly enhanced control performance. The development of data-driven control ensures stable and high-performance operation for high-speed, air-breathing aircraft across various flight conditions.},

This resulted in an increase in nose-down pitching moment, increased lift and increased drag, as well as reduced wandering of the chine and wing vortices.

The design is based on a fluidic oscillator with two feedback channels, but the feedback channels are removed. The fluid used to switch the main jet is supplied externally through fast-switching valves into short remains of the feedback channels. This enables the independent control of main mass flow, feedback channel mass flow, and frequency. Pressure measurements inside the mixing chamber give insight into the internal fluid dynamics. The external velocity field is measured using a particle image velocimetry system. Mean velocity fields and phase-averaged jet deflection angles enable a detailed analysis of the oscillation patterns. When gradually reducing the mass flow through the valves, the oscillation transitions from consistent to intermittent and eventually to a nonoscillating state. An in-depth analysis shows that the fluid volume of the feedback channel is driving the oscillation. The amount of volume necessary for an oscillation depends on the inner geometry of the fluidic oscillator. These results are expected to be applicable on an unmodified fluidic oscillator with feedback channels because the decisive internal flow mechanics are presumably the same in both devices. The modified fluidic oscillator can create a wide variety of different oscillation patterns and therefore enables systematic investigations of oscillation patterns with just one device. Changing the oscillation frequency or the main jet velocity results in different oscillation patterns. When both parameters are changed simultaneously to maintain a constant Strouhal number, the oscillation pattern remains the same.},

We construct a data-driven parameter space of airfoils using principal geodesic analysis of separable shape tensors informed by a curated database containing almost 20,000 suitable engineering airfoils. Analyzing the shape reconstruction error and the maximum mean discrepancy between joint distributions of aerodynamic quantities, we study the dimensionality of the learned parameter space. This simple numerical experiment demonstrates a dramatic dimension reduction that retains design effectiveness and promotes regularity of the shape representations. Finally, we generate new airfoils and use the HAM2D Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes solver to predict lift, drag, and moment coefficients. We compute multiple sensitivity metrics to quantify and assert the consistency of parameter influence on the aerodynamic quantities. We also explore low-dimensional polynomial ridge approximations to motivate physical intuitions and offer explanations of the approximated sensitivities.},

  abstract     = {During rotor operation, wakes and tip vortices form and convect downstream, generating unsteady velocities on the blade surface, which act as significant noise sources. High-fidelity numerical simulations account for these effects but are computationally expensive, while the rapid predictions based on blade element momentum theory (BEMT) alone cannot capture the fluid mechanisms associated with tip vortex wakes. This paper presents a hybrid BEMT and free vortex wake (FVW) method to compute mean and unsteady flow variables on blade sections. The BEMT solver accommodates arbitrary flow directions, accounting for variations with the rotational phase angle, while the FVW models tip vortex dynamics with initial strength from BEMT computations. Unsteady airfoil theory is applied to compute time-varying loadings in inflight conditions, serving as noise sources for acoustic calculations. The method is validated with a benchmark rotor in hover and axial flow conditions, where wake correction alters thrust but has negligible noise impact. In inflight conditions, the FVW significantly improves prediction accuracy for blade passing frequency harmonics compared to BEMT alone. Near-field velocity and vortex structures also match high-fidelity simulations well. Application to a multirotor vehicle demonstrates the method’s potential for rapid and efficient noise estimation in low-altitude flight scenarios.},

  abstract     = {The present study proposes a pseudorotation adjoint-based aerodynamic and aeroacoustic optimization method for the application on isolated rotors with both accuracy and efficiency. The pseudorotation adjoint-based optimization methodology incorporates two innovative techniques: i) a hybrid computational fluid dynamics–computational aeroacoustics method closely integrating with Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equations under a rotating reference frame within a pseudorotation moving-medium Ffowcs Williams-Hawkings formulation to evaluate aerodynamic performance and tonal noise, and ii) a unified architecture for steady-state adjoint-based sensitivity analyses of both aerodynamics and aeroacoustics leveraging the pseudorotation approach, thereby facilitating effective multi-objective weighted optimizations within one comprehensive framework. The proposed pseudorotation steady adjoint-based optimization method is applied to a bidiscipline optimization problem of rotor blades compared with our previous on-the-fly unsteady adjoint method. Results of the comparative study demonstrate that the pseudorotation steady approach exhibits good agreement with the unsteady approach in predicting aerodynamics and aeroacoustics as well as their sensitivity derivatives. Furthermore, the steady adjoint optimization demonstrates its capability in achieving an optimum rotor design that closely resembles the outcome from unsteady adjoint optimization while exhibiting a 20-fold acceleration in computational time. These results highlight the potential of this proposed pseudorotation adjoint-based optimization method in efficiently exploring fundamental principles governing high aerodynamic performance and low tonal noise emissions for isolated rotors.},

  abstract     = {Helicopter acoustic scattering can change the acoustic characteristics of the rotor noise and has an adverse influence on its prediction and control. Previous research has mainly focused on numerical simulations and principle experiments. In this study, an analytical method in the acoustic modal domain is proposed to predict the scattered sound field of the helicopter fuselage based on the T-matrix method. This method utilizes the advantages of modal analysis to investigate the global scattering process of the fuselage on steady and unsteady rotor noise from different sound sources. Specifically, the rotor noise is modeled as equivalent to noise from discrete rotating monopoles and dipoles. The acoustic modal components of the incident sound field are derived theoretically. Furthermore, the T-matrix method is used to establish the mapping relationship between the acoustic modal components of the incident and scattered sound fields. The acoustic modal components of the scattered sound field are predicted theoretically. In addition, the acoustic modal analysis method is verified by the simulation results calculated by the frequency-domain method. The T-matrix method is verified by the experimental and numerical results presented by DLR (German Aerospace Center). Finally, a mechanism analysis is performed in the acoustic modal domain to investigate the acoustic characteristics of the scattered sound field. Benefiting from high computational efficiency and low memory consumption of the proposed method, it has the potential for online use.},

A multipoint spectral cross-correlation technique was used to minimize the corrupting effects of the mechanical vibrations on the aero-optical spectra. A scaling of the aero-optical spectra as a function of the viewing angle was developed and discussed. Both the apparent optical convective speeds and the overall values of aero-optical distortions were extracted from data. Angular dependence of the aero-optical distortions was computed and found to agree with the isotropic model within a few percent. Two new models, accounting for the presence of the large-scale structures and for the spatial growth of the boundary layer, were proposed and discussed.},

  abstract     = {Baseflow computation and stability analysis were conducted for hypersonic flow over a cone-cylinder-flare (CCF) geometry for conditions that correspond to the experimental runs carried out in three wind tunnels. Owing to the presence of an attached boundary layer, a separation bubble induced by a shock–boundary-layer interaction, and a reattachment region, the chosen flow configuration is physically rich. The complexity of this flowfield encompasses a combination of convective instabilities developing on the cone, global instabilities in the separation bubble, and shear-layer modes and streaks in the reattachment region. Thus, the selected CCF configuration provides the opportunity for a comprehensive comparison of the currently available methodologies for analyzing boundary-layer instabilities. Various tools are used for the analysis, including global stability codes as well as convective instability analyses based on a local theory, a weakly nonparallel analysis, and tools that are applicable to strongly nonparallel flows. The paper presents a comparison of the convective instability characteristics based on different methodologies, such as linear stability theory, the harmonic form of linearized Navier–Stokes equations, and resolvent analysis. The CCF configuration provided an effective framework for conducting a detailed cross-validation of this type, which had not yet been addressed in existing literature. This document is accompanied by a companion paper that is focused on the experimental aspects of the CCF configuration.

  abstract     = {The hypersonic flow stability over a two-dimensional compression corner is studied using Resolvent analysis, linear stability theory (LST), and parabolized stability equation. The authors find that the interaction between upstream convective-type disturbances and the laminar separation bubble can be divided into two regimes. First, two-dimensional (2D) high-frequency Mack (second, third, etc.) modes neutrally oscillate with the presence of alternating stable and unstable regions inside the separation bubble, which arises from repeated synchronizations between discrete modes with evolving branches. Meanwhile, the second modes upstream and downstream of the separation bubble can differ significantly from each other. Second, the 2D low-frequency shear-layer mode is stable, whereas multiple unstable three-dimensional (3D) eigenmodes are identified by LST. These modes are found to be sensitive to the streamline curvature effect. The locally dominant modes agree with the Resolvent response in terms of the preferential spanwise wave number, the disturbance shape, and the growth rate of energy. Thus, a combination of global and local analyses demonstrates that the separation bubble tends to selectively amplify low-frequency 3D disturbances and freeze high-frequency Mack-mode disturbances in an explainable manner. These findings facilitate the understanding of the early evolution of low- and high-frequency instabilities in hypersonic separated flows.},

An airfoil aerodynamics prediction model is pretrained with airfoil samples. Then, an airfoil-to-wing transfer model is fine-tuned with a few wing samples to predict three-dimensional flow fields based on two-dimensional results on each spanwise cross section. Sweep theory is embedded when determining the corresponding airfoil geometry and operating conditions, and to obtain the sectional airfoil lift coefficient, which is one of the operating conditions, the low-fidelity vortex lattice method and data-driven methods are proposed and evaluated. Compared to a nontransfer model, introducing the pretrained model reduces the error by 30%, whereas introducing sweep theory further reduces the error by 9%. When reducing the dataset size, less than half of the wing training samples are need to reach the same error level as the nontransfer framework, which makes establishing the model much easier.},

In the proposed method, DS is firstly employed to generate the random input target collocation sample pool (TCSP) with high failure domain exploring efficiency. Then in TCSP, the neural network is trained by the partial differential physics information governing the performance function, and the neural network trained to be convergent in TCSP is used to predict the performance function response of TCSP, on which the failure probability can be estimated by DS. Because the proposed method only uses partial differential physics information instead of finite element simulation to train neural network in the TCSP for predicting performance function, it remarkably reduces the computational cost for estimating failure probability. To improve the efficiency of training PINN in TCSP, this paper designs a strategy of adaptively updating loss weights and a convergence distinguishing strategy for training PINN.

  abstract     = {Mistuning in bladed disk structures disrupts their cyclic symmetry, potentially resulting in high cycle fatigue. The stochastic nature of mistuning greatly increases the computational cost of related studies. To improve computational efficiency, previous research has primarily focused on reduced-order models based on finite element methods, whereas the increasing demand for rapid computation and precise predictions has led to the emergence of data-driven approaches. These methods directly use vibration data from bladed disks, eliminating the need for building complex physical models. The accuracy of these methods is dependent on the size of the data, which, however, are often difficult to obtain. To overcome the challenge of insufficient data, this study introduces a Physics-Informed Neural Network Surrogate Model for Small-Sample Mistuned Bladed Disk (PINN-SMBD). This new method combines neural networks with the knowledge of bladed disk dynamics mainly reflected in the following three features: the integration of the governing equations of a mistuned bladed disk in the network architecture, the selection of the input and output according to the frequency independence of the response, and the data augmentation using the cyclic characteristic of bladed disks. Moreover, a dataset construction strategy is proposed that the use of datasets with high variance of mistuning can speed up model convergence and improve accuracy. Finally, a PINN-SMBD model for a dummy bladed disk is built by using only 30 samples which demonstrates remarkable accuracy.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents an improved approach for fast numerical modeling of the mutual aerodynamic interactions between a wing and tractor propellers for preliminary design purposes. Vortex methods are used to model the propeller and wing aerodynamic performance. The blade element momentum (BEM) method, which is used to model the propeller performance, is extended to allow for a nonuniform inflow field, such that the upstream effects of the wing can be included in the propeller performance modeling. The circulation distribution over the propeller blades is then used in the slipstream tube model (STM) to determine the time-averaged propeller slipstream velocities. Finally, an improved vortex lattice method (VLM) is used to model the wing’s spanwise lift distribution. The method includes an often overlooked correction for the finite slipstream dimensions experienced by the wing segments, in both vertical extent and spanwise extent. This physics-based correction, based on the image vortex technique, partially offsets the large discrepancies in the lift augmentation found in previous low-order numerical analyses of propeller–wing interactions, while keeping the analysis routine computationally very cheap. The BEM and STM are validated against experimental data, while the VLM and complete propeller–wing system are validated against high-fidelity numerical data, confirming the accuracy of the used models. Discrepancies are found in regions or operating conditions where viscosity becomes more relevant, such as separated flows. The numerical model derived in this paper can be used for a quick and accurate first-order estimation of the aerodynamic performance of new conceptual distributed propeller aircraft.},

It incorporates modal truncation to enhance vibration suppression efficacy while refining the stiffness selection strategy.

The validity of all these concepts proposed above is substantiated through comprehensive numerical simulations. Similarly, a targeted design of a 6-m-long truss structure was developed, and the feasibility of the variable-stiffness vibration suppression technology proposed in this paper was validated through physical experiments.},

  abstract     = {Quantifying structural damage using online monitoring data is crucial for condition-based maintenance to ensure aviation safety. However, most data-driven methods hardly use accumulated domain knowledge, making it difficult to address parameter variability across different structures due to manufacturing as well as compromising result interpretability. To address these challenges, this study proposes a physics-decoded variational neural network for structural damage quantification and model parameter calibration. The innovation of this method lies in seamlessly integrating a reduced-order digital twin containing damage states and influencing parameters as a decoder within the variational neural network and training a data-driven physical feature extraction model using the variational inference. This architecture enables the individualized, real-time structural damage quantification and parameter calibration across an entire fleet, while accounting for uncertainties. Validation on typical damaged aeronautical panels demonstrates that the proposed method accurately predicts structural damage states and quantifies associated uncertainties, thereby ensuring high interpretability and accuracy. This approach is expected to be integrated into the airframe digital twin framework to enable condition-based maintenance across a fleet.},

But it will cause serious issues with structural reliability and aeroelastic stability. This paper studies the critical flutter speed of a morphing wing structure and evaluates the deformation strategies. First, a biomimetic wing is considered as a variable cross-section cantilever beam, and the flutter model with Theodorsen unsteady aerodynamics is theoretically derived. The finite element theory is used to discretize the obtained PDEs with variable coefficients. Second, three typical wing models are examined to verify the model’s accuracy against finite element simulation findings for modal frequencies and critical flutter speeds. The results indicate good agreement, with errors of less than 3% for modal frequencies and fewer than 2.1% for critical flutter speeds. Thirdly, the flutter wind speeds are examined to assess the aeroelasticity properties for three different morphing strategies of biomimetic wing structures. The findings show that both forward bending of the elastic axis and greater density concentration near the wing root increase flutter speed. And the density distribution has a smaller effect on flutter speed than elastic axis bending. When it comes to static aeroelasticity, excessive folding ratios cause divergence problems.},

The rotorcraft dynamics model consists of coaxial three-bladed counter-rotating rotors and a finite element fuselage stick model constructed based on the measured data of the XH-59A helicopter. The two-way coupled rotor–body vibration analysis results exhibited excellent correlation with the test data for the rotor hub loads and airframe vibrations. The best actuation scenarios are sought for the minimum vibration of the vehicle using either an open- or closed-loop control scheme. IBC actuation is shown to effectively reduce the vibrations of the rotorcraft. Coreduction of the three per rotor revolution and vibrations of the rotorcraft is achieved using multicyclic control with offline system identification. Multicyclic harmonic IBC actuation enables the suppression of rotorcraft vibration at the rotor hub and pilot seat by 81.4%, and cockpit vibration by 92% compared with the uncontrolled case, leading to a significantly reduced vibration level (below ) of the rotorcraft. The closed-loop multicyclic control using the identified system and aircraft model shows good correlation, ensuring the suitability of the present optimal control simulations.},

Therefore, this paper presents an experimental study of the influence of different configurational parameters on the development of secondary vortices and their contribution to the vortex breakdown of a rotor in hover. The aim is to gain insight into which configurational parameters have an influence on the occurrence of secondary structures. An extensive database of more than 30 different configurations was created to validate the numerical simulations and methods. It was found that the blade passing frequency is the main contributor to the occurrence of secondary structures.

From three pressure measurements, the static pressure, total pressure, Mach number, and a single axis flow angle can be resolved. Despite this utility, there are induced errors related to the use of these probes that are particularly pertinent to use in turbomachines. Small passages cause end-wall proximity effects, the rotor induces flow unsteadiness, and complex flow three-dimensional flow structures are developed. These effects are considered in this effort by contrasting experimental inlet distortion data from an auxiliary power unit inlet of a centrifugal compressor with computational inlet-only models. The aerodynamic interface plane was measured using a rotatable rake assembly with trapezoidal three-hole probes and fast response pressure transducers. Two computational models are presented, one with and one without the aerodynamic interface plane instrumentation used in the experiment. The measurements from the simulated traverse are compared to the inlet-only computational model and experimental results. End-wall effects were the dominant error driver for the static pressure measurements. Swirl was predominantly altered by perpendicular flow angle magnitudes above 10 deg. Indicated total pressure was impacted by radial flow angle and unsteadiness that were highly coupled.},

One of the simplest structural forms is a thin circular panel, clamped around its perimeter, and the current paper focuses attention on such a system. A key aspect of this work is the extraction of sets of natural frequencies throughout the buckling process, with a primary focus on experimentally measured frequencies. Given the cyclically symmetric nature of the system, there are also some interesting observations concerning the changing vibration mode shapes as a function of thermal loading, and more clearly in the postbuckling regime. Another novel aspect of this research is an additional focus on the characterization of snap-through between postbuckled equilibrium configurations and its influence on the natural frequencies. That is, thermally buckled panels often possess multiple equilibrium configurations (bistability), with some characteristic transitions (both naturally occurring and forced) between them. Three panels are tested, consisting of two different materials (aluminum and brass) and two different thicknesses.},

However, the impact of higher flexibility on the aeroelastic behavior of fixed-wing aircraft still needs to be fully understood. This paper assesses the effects of aerodynamic nonlinearities from flow separation on the maneuvering and gust response of a high-aspect-ratio flying wing using low-order models. Three aerodynamic formulations are evaluated: a linear model without stall effects, a piecewise linear model with steady-stall characteristics, and a nonlinear model accounting for dynamic-stall phenomena. All models perform similarly during maneuvering oscillations near stall conditions, but the dynamic-stall model foresees flight dynamic instabilities poststall, which are not seen in other models given the same maneuver input. Under a limited number of discrete and continuous gust disturbances, the model without stall effects behaves nonconservatively, whereas the steady-stall model is more conservative compared to the dynamic-stall model, with respect to the prediction of flight instabilities. These outcomes highlight the importance of accounting for aerodynamic nonlinearities in understanding the flight dynamics of very flexible aircraft under moderate-to-high angle-of-attack excitations.},

This paper presents a novel multitask-transfer-learning method for random-force frequency identification that accounts for modeling and measurement uncertainties. A data-driven convolutional neural network (CNN) model is utilized to capture the relationship between the power spectral densities of external forces and measured responses, addressing the inherent ill-posedness of traditional model-driven force identification methods. To shorten the frequency-dependent training time in the full frequency domain, a transfer-learning strategy is implemented, fine-tuning hyperparameters from a CNN model trained at one source frequency to another target frequency. Furthermore, an iterative dimensionwise collocation method based on nonprobabilistic interval modeling is introduced to quantify the uncertain boundaries of external loads caused by multisource uncertainties. By incorporating a multitask-learning framework, the process of establishing CNN models for collocated samples is accelerated, reducing the computational effort for uncertainty quantification. The proposed method is validated through both numerical and experimental examples, demonstrating its accuracy, robustness, and computational efficiency for force identification in the full frequency domain, even under conditions of insufficient measurements, measurement noises, and material dispersions.},

If querying a low-fidelity model incurs significant computational costs, an emulator can still be constructed by training a surrogate model, such as a Gaussian process model or neural network, on data gathered from the low-fidelity model. These emulators are embedded into the neural network architecture and play an important role in boosting neural network accuracy with limited training data. However, in some practical situations finding a suitable low-fidelity emulator model is challenging. Use of an improper emulator can fail to improve learning performance, and in some cases no viable emulator is available. To address this technical gap, this study proposes using the decomposed functions of the actual physics-based model as emulators. Global sensitivity analysis is performed to compute the Sobol indices of the decomposed functions, which reveal their contribution ranks to the system response of interest. Based on the contribution ranks, the decomposed functions are embedded as emulators in an adaptive and iterative process. The proposed method is demonstrated with fundamental analytical examples.

  abstract     = {Resided at the intersection of multifidelity optimization (MFO) and Bayesian optimization (BO), MF BO has found a niche in solving expensive engineering design optimization problems, thanks to its advantages in incorporating physical and mathematical understandings of the problems, saving resources, addressing exploitation–exploration trade-off, considering uncertainty, and processing parallel computing. The increasing number of works dedicated to MF BO suggests the need for a comprehensive review of this advanced optimization technique. This paper surveys recent developments of two essential ingredients of MF BO: Gaussian process (GP) based MF surrogates and acquisition functions. First the existing MF modeling methods and MFO strategies are categorized to locate MF BO in a large family of surrogate-based optimization and MFO algorithms. Then, the common properties shared between the methods from each ingredient of MF BO are exploited to describe important GP-based MF surrogate models and to review various acquisition functions. This presentation aims to provide a structured understanding of MF BO. Finally, important aspects are examined that require further research for applications of MF BO in solving intricate yet important design optimization problems, including constrained optimization, high-dimensional optimization, optimization under uncertainty, and multiobjective optimization.},

  abstract     = {A systematic experimental investigation is carried out to examine the dynamic response of the shear layer to the aircraft bay (represented by a rectangular cavity) door operation at supersonic speeds. The study examines the effects of various door opening positions on cavity resonance in terms of overall sound pressure levels and pressure spectra. Measurements were conducted on a rectangular cavity of aspect (length-to-width) ratio of 4.5, with and without doors at Mach 1.6 and 2 at the Florida State University polysonic wind tunnel. The results show that adding doors increases the overall sound pressure levels and amplifies mode 1 of the pressure spectra, except when the doors are 3/4th closed. The sound pressure levels at Mach 1.6 are much higher than at Mach 2. At Mach 1.6 for the cavity with doors, the pressure spectra measured ahead of the cavity leading edge indicate an upstream influence of the cavity resonance. The analysis of results involving probability density function and time-delay phase portraits suggests that the addition of doors to the cavity modifies the underlying mechanism and makes the system more or less unstable, depending on their opening positions.},

  abstract     = {This study investigates the stabilization mechanism and interaction between the detonation wave and core flow in a flow-through rotating detonation combustor (FT-RDC). Employing simultaneous high-speed shadowgraph and broadband CH* chemiluminescence, we unravel the unique flow-field dynamics and elucidate the propagation process from the detonation wave to stabilize core flow combustion. The FT-RDC is operated using an ethylene–air mixture under various test parameters to systematically introduce core flow and fuel to assess combustion stability. Results reveal that the RDC pilot enhances core combustion under stoichiometric and fuel rich core conditions, though fuel lean and solely core air flow conditions suppress the detonation wave, giving rise to weak rotating thermoacoustic waves. Additionally, higher RDC air mass flow rates exhibit a more pronounced interaction, as supported by dynamic pressure trends and fast Fourier transform analysis. Spectral proper orthogonal decomposition analysis unveils distinct transverse acoustic modes—first tangential, higher tangential, and radial—characterizing the intricate interaction and unique flow features. Furthermore, a novel algorithm was developed to dissect the different regions of the flow field, shedding light on the impact of the detonation on the core flow. These findings emphasize the critical role of operational parameters, particularly core flow rate and equivalence ratio, in shaping the interaction dynamics.},

  abstract     = {A new delayed detached eddy simulation (DDES) model under the DDES framework is proposed in this work, namely, the explicit algebraic stress DDES (EAS-DDES) model. The model inherently accounts for the modeled stress anisotropy, making it outperforms the traditional linear eddy viscosity (LEV) based DES models in complex turbulent flows, especially when near-wall stress anisotropy becomes pronounced. The switching between the Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) and large eddy simulation (LES) branches is achieved based on the DDES framework. The explicit algebraic stress formula does not notably compromise the computational effort, stability, and robustness of the DDES model. Four test cases are simulated to assess the performance of the proposed EAS-DDES model. The first two cases are fully developed channel flows and flow over the backward-facing step, showing that the new EAS-DDES model has similar predictive performance to the LEV-based DDES model. The other two cases are square duct and rotating channel flows, where modeling the Reynolds stress anisotropy in secondary and rotating flows is crucial to predict the correct flow statistics. The accuracy of the EAS-DDES model compared with the LEV-based DDES models is significantly improved due to the reasonable prediction of near-wall modeled stress anisotropy. The new EAS-DDES model provides an advanced option for the DES of complex turbulent flows when the LEV assumption is problematic.},

The High-Lift Prediction Workshop series aims to assess the numerical prediction capability of current computational fluid dynamics technology considering the high-lift version of the NASA’s Common Research Model. The present work contributes to these collaborative efforts, quantifying sensitivities for Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS)–based steady, unsteady, and hybrid RANS/large-eddy-simulation scale-resolving approaches. Uncertainties associated with the choice of turbulence model, initialization strategies, grid resolution, and iterative convergence at free-air conditions are covered. Near stall, a large spread of RANS results was observed for different turbulence models and initialization strategies, while iterative convergence appeared less crucial for the present simulations. Steady and unsteady RANS simulations were unable to predict the correct flow physics near , even for large grids. Delayed detached-eddy simulations (DDES), however, showed good accuracy compared with wind-tunnel experiments and predicted with an error of around 5%. Compared to steady RANS, the computational cost of DDES was a factor of 10 higher. Lessons learned and potential best-practice strategies are shared to aid future studies. While warm-started RANS simulations using Spalart–Allmaras models are recommended at lower angles of attack, scale-resolving methods are required near stall.},

In this study, an equation of transport for the roughness amplification factor is introduced based on the improved baseline hypersonic transition model by considering the effects of surface roughness. The roughness amplification factor is convected into the flow field to represent the disturbance induced by the surface roughness. It defines a region of influence of the surface roughness to locally modify the transition model and track changes in the momentum thickness to locally modify the criteria for the onset of transition. Moreover, the boundary condition of the wall is amended for the specific rate of turbulence dissipation to model the effects of roughness in the fully turbulent zone. The improved model can accurately predict the location of transition in roughness under different hypersonic flows.},

Peripheral bleed actuation of the external airstream is utilized to alter and delay the near-ground flow reversal on the leeward side, which precedes the vortex initiation. It is shown that azimuthally symmetric or asymmetric bleed configurations can significantly delay the ground vortex formation, although at the expense of the decreased total pressure recovery. Utilization of about 21% global porosity over the upper inlet surface can delay the vortex formation to over 300% of the required dimensionless inlet momentum flux in the absence of control. Moreover, the circulation of a ground vortex that eventually forms in the presence of the asymmetric bleed actuation is reduced by nearly 40% compared to the corresponding ground vortex in the absence of control.},

  abstract     = {Three-dimensional laminar boundary layers over swept wings are susceptible to crossflow instabilities, manifesting as stationary and traveling crossflow vortices. The boundary layer distorted by these vortices is prone to the growth of secondary instabilities. Discrepancies between direct numerical simulation (DNS) and stability methodologies on the development of secondary perturbations of stationary crossflow vortices over swept wings have been reported in the literature. To shed light on the origin of these inconsistencies, a comparison of DNS and linear stability theory is provided here. Secondary disturbances of finite-amplitude stationary crossflow vortices are analyzed for two frequencies:   (Type III secondary instability) and   (Type I secondary instability). Results from linear stability theory (LST-2D) and linear parabolized stability equations (PSE-3D) formulated in a suitable nonorthogonal coordinate system correlate well with DNS data in terms of perturbation shape and location relative to the stationary crossflow vortices. Employing a nonorthogonal coordinate system is crucial for PSE-3D to fulfill slow variation along the streamwise direction and spanwise periodicity, whereas LST-2D, assuming parallel flow, can also use periodic boundary conditions in a vortex-aligned orthogonal coordinate system. However, the LST-2D results underestimate the integrated growth rate, whereas the PSE-3D computations closely match the DNS, highlighting the importance of including streamwise gradients and upstream history in the instability computations.},

Two nose tip radii (one nominally sharp and one blunt with a 5 mm radius) were tested. For the sharp nose tip case, there was excellent agreement between the measurements of both second-mode and shear-layer instabilities across the conventional facilities. However, the measured spectra for the blunt nose tip case showed more significant differences between the two conventional tunnels, potentially due to an alternate dominant instability mechanism coupled with the variations in the freestream noise spectra. The quiet facility resulted in a flow that remained laminar to much higher freestream unit Reynolds numbers, as well as in instability measurements that had more distinct spectral peaks for the sharp tip case and broadband rises for the blunt one. The instability mechanisms at play in the sharp quiet case were found to be the same as those in the conventional facilities.},

Infrared thermography measurements obtained by both campaigns have facilitated a global comparison of the transition front across facilities at analogous conditions, which are found to be in good agreement. High-frequency surface pressure fluctuation data demonstrate significant amplification of instabilities with Mack-mode characteristics in the outboard regions of the acreage. These measurements are compared to stability analyses of varying fidelity. The computational methods employed to characterize the boundary-layer transition phenomena include the traditional line-marching implementation of the parabolized stability equations (PSEs), 2D eigenvalue analysis coupled with PSE. Although the 2D eigenvalue analysis is found to predict instabilities, which correlate in terms of frequency and acreage location to the experimental measurements, the predicted amplification for these instabilities is lower than would typically be expected for transition. Line-marching results for traveling crossflow produce the best match to the experimental transition front, with a consistent transition N factor of approximately 3–3.5.},

Probability density functions are generated for Mach number, distance, and Weber number along three distinct regions of the shock structure: the separation region (boundary layer), oblique, and bow shocks. The results show that the intersection of the region behind the oblique shock and the bow shock exhibits the highest particle concentration and Weber number. Large particles in this region are the most prone to breakup, where they are exposed to Mach numbers varying between 1.5 and 2.5, and distance varying from 1 to 6 mm from the wall. Trajectory plots of individual particles indicated that the particles get trapped and transported to the wall by swirling vortices in the subsonic boundary layer. This study further provides realistic initial conditions for direct numerical simulation of isolated liquid droplets.},

  abstract     = {This research addresses the inherent computational demand of metaheuristic optimization techniques by developing a novel optimization framework that uses parametric model order reduction (PMOR). The improvement in efficiency is demonstrated using the buckling optimization of variable-angle tow (VAT) composite panels, as navigating the complex design space of VAT composite structures with global optimization techniques requires a substantial number of function evaluations. A new affine summation relationship conducive to PMOR was derived for its finite element stiffness matrix using the concept of lamination parameters and material invariant matrices, and principal component analysis (PCA) was used to extract the reduced basis vectors. Particle swarm optimization was conducted using a full-order model (FOM) and a reduced-order model. PMOR-based optimization exhibited a 0.55% relative error in the optimal objective value compared to the FOM analysis and exhibited a similar convergence history. It was observed that the optimization time was reduced by 93% by the novel affine decomposition alone, but PMOR achieved a significant reduction of 99.8% in memory requirements compared to the FOM. As the affine-decomposition-based assembly of the FOM is not feasible for large problems, PMOR functions as an enabling tool for leveraging the improvement offered by it.},

  abstract     = {Vibration isolation is necessary for reducing or suppressing unwanted vibrations in the packaging box outside the stowed film structure at launch. Vibration isolation characteristics of a passive nonlinear quasi-zero stiffness (QZS) isolator are investigated to suppress vibration for a two-degree-of-freedom (2-DOF) friction dynamic system. The vibration isolation system is modeled by a pair of horizontal precompression springs to generate negative stiffness and one vertical spring to provide support stiffness. Then the approximate analytic solution of this system is obtained by the harmonic balance method and compared with the solution derived for a linear system after numerical validation. The results show that the QZS isolator can effectively suppress the vibration transmission of the two primary structures simultaneously. Moreover, the QZS isolator achieves a broadband suppression effect according to the work–frequency curve done by friction. Wavelet spectrum analysis also shows that the QZS isolator reduces frictional work by suppressing the multifrequency energy transfer between the 2-DOF system, thereby reducing the damage to two primary structures. Hence, these results indicate that the QZS isolator composed of three springs has the ability to achieve efficient vibration reduction for a friction dynamic system.},

The influences of geometric parameters on the PBC were analyzed. During calculation, the edge beams were introduced to simulate effects of boundary on PBC. The perforated plates were manufactured and tested to verify the accuracy of the numerical results. The results show that the influence of in-plane constraints along the normal of edges on the PBC is more significant. The PBC increases with the increase of plate thickness but is not sensitive to the change of the hole’s location. The reinforcement can reduce the stress concentration and increase the PBC by 7–133%. The PBC is greatly affected by the aperture , and it is found that the optimal aperture exists when the side length is constant. The PBC under the optimal aperture is higher than that under other apertures. To facilitate the optimization design, a more refined geometric parameter library is provided by the least-squares method combined with the linear interpolation method.

  abstract     = {In a finite lined duct, strong reflections from the duct open end are observed when the sound frequency is near the cut-on/off boundary. Under such condition, in the rigid-wall segment upstream of the liner, the interference happens between the upstream-propagating transmitted wave and its copropagating coherent wave, which is formed after being reflected twice at the duct open end and the liner’s upstream end. When the two waves are out of/in phase, the interference is destructive/constructive. To validate this theory, three dissipative liners are designed and tested on the Fan-200 test rig at Beihang University. A modified exact transmission loss is proposed to quantify the effect of interference. Both numerical analyses and experimental measurements consistently demonstrate that the interference affects the liner performance by approximately 10 dB , which is relative to the length of the rigid-wall segment upstream of the liner and the reflection coefficients at the liner upstream end and duct open end. The comprehensive error analysis validated the quality of the experiments. These findings provide new insights for optimizing the installation position of liners, a crucial yet often overlooked aspect in engineering practice.},

  abstract     = {Nonconforming grids, which can simplify the generation of meshes for complex shapes and reduce the number of meshes, are commonly employed in addressing multiscale aeroacoustics numerical simulation challenges. This approach allows for the simulation of sound propagation processes at a reasonable cost. By utilizing the sixth-order weighted compact nonlinear hybrid scheme (WCNHS) with a piecewise exponential mapping function (WCNHS_Pe) and incorporating ghost grid blocks, a method has been developed to reconstruct interface flux for nonsingle-scale multiblock structured grids. The variable values of the ghost grid at the grid boundary are determined through high-order optimization interpolation methods. Furthermore, different time steps can be implemented for each subdomain to accommodate corresponding grid scales. To address coupling across multiple grid sizes, an interface flux reconstruction method is applied to numerically simulate various scenarios, including Sod shock tube problem, the Shu–Osher problem, Gaussian pulse propagation on two-dimensional nonconforming grids, sound propagation on discontinuous interfaces, sound radiation from three cylinders, sound generated by weak shock–vortex interaction, Gaussian pulse propagation on three-dimensional nonconforming grids, and slat noise prediction. The results demonstrate that the high-order finite difference method established in this study exhibits superior capability in capturing discontinuities as well as higher resolution and lower dispersion on nonconforming multisize meshes, making it suitable for simulating linear and nonlinear acoustic problems.},

This article proposes a piezoelectric stack periodic strut (PSPS) scheme based on the piezoelectric stack and rubber periodic arrangement. Piezoelectric stack actuators can achieve active vibration and noise control, and the periodic structure of the piezoelectric stack actuators and rubber also has wideband stopband characteristics for reducing vibration and noise. Therefore, PSPS has active and passive hybrid control capabilities, which has advantages in vibration and noise reduction performance, the power of active control, volume and mass, etc. This article presents a full-parameter model that can describe the electromechanical coupling dynamic performance of PSPS. The correctness of the model was verified by the finite element software, and the concept of optimal isolation potential of PSPS was proposed and evaluated. Finally, the hybrid control capability of PSPS for single-frequency and wide-frequency noise was verified through experiments. The results show that compared with the noise level of the cabin using an ordinary strut, PSPS has wideband vibration reduction and noise reduction performance above 500 Hz, with a maximum noise attenuation exceeding 25 dB. When applying active noise control to the PSPS on the helicopter model, a control effect of 12.63–15.56 dB at 900 Hz was achieved.},

The model highlights how the mass flux of the bias flow and the temperature difference serve as mass and entropic sound sources, respectively, influencing the HR’s sound absorption performance. To validate the model, we conducted numerical simulations using the Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes shear stress transport model to obtain the mean flow, followed by solving the frequency-domain linearized Navier–Stokes equations in COMSOL. The model was tested with HRs attached to combustor ducts under open–open and open–closed boundary conditions. Theoretical results agree well with numerical simulations, confirming the model’s accuracy. Results indicate that when the bias flow temperature is lower than the grazing flow temperature, the entropic sound source negatively affects duct acoustics, reducing sound absorption performance. Conversely, higher bias flow temperatures enhance sound absorption by superimposing entropic and mass-related sound sources. Additionally, the overall effect of the mass-related and entropic sound sources is equal to a volumetric source which depends on the mean sound speed and density of the HR instead of those of the combustor.},

Existing grid methodologies, such as overlapping grids and dynamic unstructured grids, struggle to ensure computational efficiency and solution accuracy simultaneously. Consequently, this paper presents a novel Cartesian grid-stitching algorithm designed to tackle the complexities associated with dynamic boundary problems. Firstly, a boundary normal projection approach is introduced for grid stitching, constructing a Cartesian-like grid capable of automated reconfiguration. The body-fitted portion dynamically selects nodes from the Cartesian grid for reconstruction, ensuring no grid distortion and eliminating the need for frequent deletion or addition of grid cells. Therefore, it demonstrates high adaptability to complex configurations and readily accommodates aerodynamic challenges involving moving boundaries with large-scale motion. Secondly, at the grid-stitching interfaces, the finite difference method for an unstructured grid is employed for spatial variable discretization, eliminating interpolation errors typically introduced. It enables interpolation-free information interaction between grids, achieving consistent discretization accuracy across the entire computational domain. Furthermore, three sets of numerical tests are conducted, with simulating results showing good agreement with those in the literature. This algorithm has proven effective in accurately capturing flow features involving shockwave interactions.},

Because this sensitivity would have a major impact on the wind-turbine performance, it is crucial to evaluate it at the large Reynolds numbers characteristic of modern wind-turbine rotor blades. This work extends earlier wind-tunnel investigations on a DU 91-W2-250 airfoil by examining the transition behavior on its pressure surface at angles-of-attack from −14 to 20 deg and chord Reynolds numbers up to 12 million. Large regions of laminar flow were identified at positive angles-of-attack using temperature-sensitive paint, which also enabled an estimation of the development of turbulent separation at negative incidence. The global surface temperature distributions were supplemented by pressure tap data, which also provided an input for linear stability computations of the laminar boundary layer that supported and complemented the experimental findings. This systematic analysis elucidated not only the effect of Reynolds number and airfoil incidence on laminar-turbulent transition, but also a localized, facility-specific variation in the transition front. The observed boundary-layer evolution substantiated the discussion of the development of the aerodynamic coefficients, which were measured in previous investigations and were well reproduced in the present work.},

  abstract     = {A novel bleed model derived from a comprehensive dataset generated by a numerical parametric study is introduced. This model discretely represents the hole contour on a porous patch, allowing the mesh to incorporate the hole pattern. This approach enables the extraction of the tangential Mach number at the outflow boundary condition within the RANS solver. Assessment of external flow conditions is conducted using this tangential hole Mach number and the pressure ratio from the cavity plenum to the wall. Separate regressions for supersonic and subsonic conditions are formulated based on extracted wall quantities. Comparing the model to state-of-the-art bleed models shows significant improvements in predicting downstream boundary-layer profiles, capturing compressible flow phenomena, and accurately predicting physical quantities such as wall pressure or shear stress. Application of the model to the control of shock-wave/boundary-layer interactions shows only minor differences from reference simulations, indicating its broad applicability. Derived from a comprehensive dataset, this model is validated for various external flow characteristics and plate geometries, enabling its use for diverse aerodynamic applications.},

  abstract     = {Under crosswind operating conditions, the flow field of an aero-engine intake can be characterized by notable unsteady flow distortion. These distortions are typically associated with flow separation within the intake as well as with the ingestion of the ground vortex. This unsteady flow distortion can have a detrimental effect on the intake performance and potentially on the operability of the downstream compression system. Measurements of the unsteady velocity field within a model-scale intake under crosswind conditions were acquired using stereo particle image velocimetry (S-PIV). This work analyzes the S-PIV data to quantify the unsteady flow distortion, as well as the characteristics of the ingested ground vortex, in a short intake under crosswind conditions. The swirl distortion metrics were calculated for a range of crosswind velocities and intake mass flow capture ratios (MFCRs). The conditions at which the intake flow separates depend on crosswind velocity, ground clearance, the design of the intake, and the MFCR. Flow characteristics of both low MFCR diffusion-driven and high MFCR shock-induced separation were identified. The circumferential extent and intensity of the swirl distortion are strongly dependent on the crosswind velocity and mass flow rate. The swirl distortion caused by the diffusion-driven separation is greater than that due to the shock-induced separation. The diffusion-driven separation affects a larger portion of the intake aerodynamic interface plane with greater time-averaged and peak distortion levels compared to shock-induced separation. The ground vortex characterization at the aerodynamic interface plane showed a decreasing level of unsteadiness in vortex meandering with increasing MFCR.},

  abstract     = {The aerodynamic performance of small drones is difficult to predict. Their small-scale propellers operate in a challenging fluid dynamics regime characterized by low Reynolds numbers, where complex transitional phenomena usually occur around the blades’ surface. In the present work, an experimental campaign is carried out on a small isolated propeller in forward flight conditions. The main scope is to investigate how the performance and the induced flowfield are affected by the presence of a crossflow, which can be representative of the forward flight condition for a typical drone’s propeller. As the crossflow velocity is incremented, considerable increases in thrust and power are measured. The resulting experimental loads are compared with semi-empirical laws derived from the momentum and blade element momentum theories. These laws have found extensive use in the preliminary design of helicopters and are also found applicable to the hereby investigated propeller with appropriate tunings. Furthermore, an analysis of the propeller’s wake is conducted via planar particle image velocimetry. Significant differences in terms of flow topology and flowfield statistics are deducted with respect to the hovering condition. Ultimately, the vortices shed from the propeller’s blades are identified and characterized, and a focus is posed on the vortices’ trajectory and circulation. With respect to the hovering condition, the strongest vortical structures are advected in more confined trajectories, while the weakest structures are instead broken down under the effect of the crossflow.},

Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes computations are performed on two academic configurations for verification purposes and on a technical application of wing–body juncture featuring corner flows to achieve a better comprehension of the QCR variants’ ability to reproduce turbulent stress combinations relevant to secondary flows generation. This addresses the more theoretical interest of analyzing the onset of corner separation (at an angle of attack ) and the role of corner flow vortices. Linear eddy viscosity model and the extended QCR failed to detect these vortical structures; the latter encountered numerical stability difficulties. On the other hand, QCR2000, QCR2020, and QCR(r) showed behavior consistent with a simulation using the Reynolds Stress Model, experiments, and literature results. This better prediction was found to be related to the ability of these models to accurately predict the stress-induced vortex that acts in delaying and reducing the size of the corner separation. Notably, the more recent QCR(r) and QCR2020 have enhanced the estimation of the normal stress combination compared to the more widespread QCR2000, demonstrating their validity as alternative models.},

This paper presents a comprehensive framework that combines hierarchically composable ROM approaches, the state-consistence enforced autoregressive with exogenous (SCE-ARX) technique, and a genetic algorithm (GA) for automated development of configurable parametric aeroservoelastic-gust (ASEG) ROMs. Our approach is based on the principle of superposition. It simultaneously models the interaction among aerodynamics, control surfaces, gust load, and structural dynamics, representing a significant level of complexity for aerostructural ROM development. Specifically, two hierarchical approaches, top-down and bottom-up, are presented to assemble ROMs from various physics domains, such as ASEG, aeroservoelastic, aeroelastic with gust, and aeroelastic, without the need to regenerate models or training data. The SCE-ARX method is combined with GA-guided ROM hyperparameter optimization to enhance ROM interpolation and accuracy. This framework is used to construct parametric ROM databases at selected flight conditions, which can be interpolated to any interstitial conditions, accommodating ASEG modeling over a broad flight parameter space. The top-down approach with GA-guided SCE-ARX demonstrates the best performance for parametric ROM development.},

The introduction of turbulence improves the time-averaged performance characteristics of the aeroelastic wing by delaying stall and increasing the peak lift coefficient. The turbulence excites structural modes such as bending and torsion, but it does not introduce new frequencies in the forces and moments. Instead, it amplifies particular frequencies that appear in the clean flow case. It is observed that, for full-chord integral length scales, the magnitude of the fluctuations in forces and moments at the frequency of a structural bending mode is excited. Meanwhile, at half-chord integral length scales, the magnitude of the fluctuations in forces and moments at the frequency of a torsional response is excited. The structural excitations resulting from the incoming turbulence in turn generate unique characteristics in the flowfield surrounding the aeroelastic wing.},

As increases, detonation cell size increases and the cellular structure becomes more irregular. Spectral analysis by the auto-correlation function is performed to provide quantitative insights about detonation cell size and irregularity. Furthermore, detailed analysis on the detonation wavefront captures three distinct detonation propagation modes, including stable detonation , weakly unstable detonation , and highly unstable detonation . The effect of activation energy in detonation attenuation is further studied through a detonation propagation over a semicylinder obstacle, where two distinct detonation attenuation regimes are captured, including unattenuated detonation transmission and critical detonation reinitiation . The mechanism of the critical detonation reinitiation event is further examined. It is found that a strong transverse detonation wave forms at higher activation energies after the Mach shock reflection at the bottom wall, which eventually leads to a steady detonation propagation.},

As is evident by the wall pressure measurements, the scramjet and ramjet modes were successfully reproduced for four global fuel equivalence ratios . However, a hysteresis in the mode transition occurs under the -increasing and -decreasing paths. A smooth ram-to-scramjet mode transition with gradual pressure drop occurs when decreases to 0.08 under the -decreasing path, whereas a jumped scram-to-ram mode transition with abrupt pressure rise occurs at under the -increasing path. The combustion efficiency under the -decreasing path is always higher than those under the -increasing path within the hysteresis loop. This higher efficiency can be attributed to mixing enhancement and kinetic strengthening. For the former, longer residence time and richer vortexes promote the mixing. Meanwhile, the latter kinetic strengthening is contributed by the higher pressure, higher temperature, and richer radicals inherited from the former combustion state. A dynamic regulation mechanism realized through a feedback loop with a characteristic response time of 0.89 flush through time resides the pseudo-shock wave in the isolator and sustains the ramjet mode. Hysteresis causes more total pressure loss due to stronger pseudo-shock structure and more heat addition. Within the hysteresis loop, higher combustion efficiency dominates the higher thrust under -decreasing path.},

Results show that the fluctuation in the baseline flow mainly comes from the impact shock wave and the distributed compression waves above the shear layer, while in the actuated flow, the shear layer zone also manifests high-level fluctuations. Physically, the multiple shock waves induced by the PSJs are responsible for the disturbances seeded to the shear layer. A wavy shear layer can be picked in the high-order proper orthogonal decomposition modes, indicating the formation of large-scale vortices due to excitation of the Kelvin–Helmoltz instability. As the discharge frequency increases, the grayscale fluctuation in the shear layer also goes up. At the highest frequency of 5 kHz, the growth rate of the shear layer thickness is elevated noticeably by approximately 10%, and the area of high-level velocity fluctuation is expanded by 30%, when compared to the nonactuated condition.},

In a transitional SBLI which exhibits sufficiently large shock-induced separation, a shock oscillation mechanism characterized by growth and natural suppression of the upstream laminar section of the separation bubble occurs. To validate the shock oscillation mechanism observed in large eddy simulations (LES), the shock oscillation mechanism is studied experimentally using high-speed Schlieren and spark-light shadowgraphy. A characteristic length based on the distance of laminar separation shock travel is proposed. Strouhal numbers from LES and the experiment collapse at around 0.075. A strong dependency of the oscillation mechanism on free-stream turbulence and boundary-layer state is shown. Dominant oscillation frequencies are an order of magnitude lower for the turbulent interaction as opposed to the laminar case. For the laminar case, dynamic mode decomposition showed a strong relationship of the laminar separation shock with the separation bubble and reflected shock movement. The turbulent interaction shows a significantly lower reflected shock travel distance. The findings experimentally confirm that stabilization of the shock is achieved by tripping the boundary layer.},

  abstract     = {The growth and breakdown of second-mode instability in hypersonic boundary layers are commonly characterized by analyzing surface pressure spectra. For the hypersonic boundary layer over a sharp cone, this study predicts the spectral evolution of instability waves at the downstream and upstream targets based on the multiple input locations, namely, the forward and inverse models. Based on spectral information of four upstream locations, the forward model can capture the growth and disappearance of spectral peaks associated with the second-mode instability, showing that the relative amplitude is captured within 20% error at all flow conditions. Similarly, the inverse model can accurately describe the spectral distribution of instability waves at the upstream location, providing the onset and peak frequency with less than 10% error. Besides, the iterated forward model captures the disappearance of the dominant spectral peak for , suggesting the availability of spatial prediction by only three input locations. Moreover, the model training process evaluates the relative importance of each input variable. The feature importance profiles indicate the nearest location’s dominant role but prove that spatial dependence does not solely decrease with distance. While the current paper focused on the hypersonic boundary layer over a sharp cone at Mach 6 at a 0 deg angle of attack, the approach of prediction beyond the measurement region using data-driven methods has broader potential. Extending these methods could provide a robust framework for predicting and understanding transition processes in various flow conditions.},

  abstract     = {We develop a neural-network-based variable turbulent Prandtl number model for the turbulence model for improved wall heating predictions in hypersonic shock–boundary-layer interactions (SBLIs). The model is developed by performing a finite-dimensional field inference for a spatially varying turbulent Prandtl number on six canonical SBLIs: three compression ramps at Mach 8 and three impinging shocks at Mach 5. The inference results identify a turbulent Prandtl number that reduces wall heating by systematically directing heat transfer away from the wall. An ensemble of Lipschitz-continuous neural networks is then trained on the inferred turbulent Prandtl number fields to develop a predictive model. We evaluate the resulting variable turbulent Prandtl number model on a suite of test cases, including the hollow cylinder flare and HIFiRE ground test experiments. The machine-learning-augmented model systematically increases near the wall to reduce negative turbulent heat flux while decreasing away from the wall to enhance positive turbulent heat flux, collectively reducing overall heat transfer to the surface. Results show that the learned model consistently improves peak heating predictions by 40–70% compared to the baseline model, a model augmented with various high-speed corrections, and the shear stress transport model across a range of conditions.},

  abstract     = {Optical force and moment measurements of hypersonic free-flight can cover a range of attitudes during a single test and avoid difficulties encountered by alternative measurement techniques. However, the signal to noise ratio of image processing is often low, and results require significant smoothing for meaningful interpretation. This work presents a new method for such measurements in which a sigma-point Kalman filter and Rauch–Tung–Striebel smoother compute a state estimate at each time step using images from two or more high-speed camera images. Markers detected in each image are treated as individual system observations, so cameras need not be synchronized nor be viewing similar features. The benefits of this approach are demonstrated with experiments of a cube in Mach 6 flow in the University of Southern Queensland’s TUSQ wind tunnel. Measured aerodynamic coefficients show strong agreement to CFD simulations also conducted as part of this work; average differences are 1.7% and 7.8% of the maximum measured forces and moments, respectively. A discussion on factors influencing the accuracy, uncertainty, and resolution of the results provides guidance to further improve the method. Moreover, this method can be extended to more complex geometry representing space debris and hypersonic vehicles.},

However, the extended duration and traveling distances of these missions require the development of procedures to accommodate dormant and crewed states and the transitions between them, which results in new risks for both crew and equipment. Consequently, the development of contingency plans is necessary to support crew safety and mission execution during transitions. In this paper we explore the use of the HabSim virtual testbed, a simulation tool for running different disruption scenarios in a space habitat. We perform an illustrative study that involves a disruptive event occurring during the crew ingress into a space habitat that has been dormant for a prolonged time. The purpose of this study is to illustrate how contingency strategies can mitigate the hazard and support a successful transition from dormant to crewed states. Various choices made for recovering the system and completing the transition are explored, involving action rescheduling and agent intervention. The results show how simulations may be used to advance transition and contingency planning, contributing to the safety and success of space missions.},

  abstract     = {Extraterrestrial habitat systems face numerous disruptions throughout their lifecycle, which may threaten crew safety. One serious risk is associated with air pressure leakage, which can occur due to sudden events such as micrometeorite strikes or airlock failures. To ensure proper functionality of the habitat, it is essential to detect the leak and assess its severity, quantified in terms of the leakage area, and communicate that information to the health management system in a meaningful way to support decision-making. A quantitative prediction of the remaining time before the detected fault results in system failure; its time-to-critical is also helpful for making decisions in such a resource-constrained environment. This paper presents a systematic study to develop and examine methods to estimate the current state of a pressurized vessel and predict the time-to-critical. To achieve this estimate in a real-time setting, an augmented extended Kalman filter method is used in conjunction with two noise identification procedures, namely, expectation maximization and variational Bayes. The robustness of the extended Kalman filter method, whether used independently or in conjunction with the expectation maximization or variational Bayesian approaches, is evaluated through a numerical study. The numerical study yields practical strategies for tuning the algorithm hyperparameters so as to obtain more rapid, accurate, and unbiased estimates of the fault intensity and the remaining time-to-critical. The performance and efficiency of these strategies are then experimentally validated by determining the leakage area and time-to-critical in a lab-scale pressure vessel.},

  abstract     = {Space exploration is progressing toward long-term missions that involve both human (HAs) and robotic agents (RAs) in operations in lunar space habitats, the Gateway space station, and the moon-to-Mars program. These missions require high-level intelligence and a sustained performance over extended periods. Analyzing agent performance solely at the task level is insufficient for such complex applications because the resources consumed by agents are coupled with the utility they provide under various conditions. Additionally, factors such as the availability of agents to respond to hazardous events, impacted by factors including human sleep cycles and robot charging times, must be considered. Understanding how resources, utility, and availability are interrelated is crucial for early-phase decision making, assessing logistics, and steering investments in promising directions. In this study, the rapid simulation capabilities of control-oriented dynamic computational modeling (CDCM) were used to explore the trade space involving an HA and an RA tasked with maintaining a smart space habitat. This approach was used to model two independent parallel scenarios as systems of systems that use stochastic methods to account for mission variabilities. A human scientist (HS) was included to quantify the mission’s research outcomes. The outcomes generated by the HS served as a metric to compare the performance of the agents along with the costs associated with engaging the HA and RA.},

  abstract     = {To advance long-term human exploration of the Moon and beyond, developing resilient deep space habitats capable of autonomous operation during both manned and unmanned periods is crucial. Unlike Earth-based buildings, which allow for immediate maintenance and access to external resources, deep space habitats will face significant challenges in addressing damages and disruptions due to the unique environmental conditions in space. Potential hazards such as micrometeorite impacts, moonquakes, internal fires, sensor failures, and power outages pose serious threats to habitat functionality. Given the inevitability of such disturbances, resilient designs would not only minimize the likelihood of system failure but also mitigate overall mission risks. Therefore, evaluating the resilience of deep space habitats under various potential disturbances during the early design phase is necessary before deployment. This paper introduces a resilience-based design evaluation framework for deep space habitats, using a deterministic structural-based habitat simulator (HabSim) along with a performance-based quantitative resilience assessment. HabSim simulates various habitat behaviors to assess the performance and resilience of habitat designs using well-established resilience assessment metrics. An illustrative case study demonstrates the effectiveness and capabilities of the proposed evaluation framework.},

However, such wings are sensitive to loads induced by gusts. A technique consists of using adaptive wings that modify their shape according to the gust measured ahead of the airplane (the so-called feed-forward gust load alleviation). The gust is typically measured using a wind lidar at the nose of the airplane. To determine the three-dimensional wind field, the lidar is addressed along different axes to obtain the projections of the wind along each of them. In this paper, we present a methodology for reconstructing a gust immersed in wind turbulence from the lidar measurements. The proposed estimation methods are based on the Bayesian filtering theory.

The presence of two components in the liquid drop makes the surface collision a complicated problem. During the collision the kinetic energy of the drop is converted into heat. Thus, the temperature varies during the collision and throughout the droplet. Two extreme situations were captured by performing both adiabatic and isothermal simulations. Molecular dynamics and classical density functional theory were used to explore the effects of the mixing parameter on the phase diagram of the binary AB mixed droplets. The location of liquid–vapor and liquid–liquid phase separation was determined. In addition, the value of the interfacial tensions of all interfaces was computed.

  abstract     = {Modern noncontact measurement techniques such as the three-dimensional scanning laser Doppler vibrometry (3D SLDV) are advantageous in measuring vibrations of lightweight, thin-walled aerospace structures, which were conventionally deemed as difficult or not feasible to apply using attached transducers. Nevertheless, the full-field measurements using 3D SLDV are still limited to extracting modal properties of linear structures, while measurements of complex nonlinear structures are rarely reported. This paper aims to extend the full-field measurement capability of 3D SLDV and combines it with a multiple-input–single-output vibration controller to deal with nonlinear structures. An advanced test strategy is introduced, which is capable of obtaining amplitude-dependent resonant frequencies, modal damping ratios, and full-field, multiharmonic mode shapes of nonlinear normal modes (NNMs). Conflicting parameters such as the frequency resolution and measurement time are optimized by combining phase separation and phase resonance testing techniques in a coherent strategy. The capabilities of the proposed nonlinear modal testing strategy are demonstrated on a realistic, large-scale fan blade that exhibits softening behaviors. Two of its NNMs were investigated at larger vibration amplitudes. Its nonlinear modal parameters were successfully extracted and validated, highlighting the time efficiency and data accuracy of the proposed strategy for measuring industrial-scale, lightweight nonlinear structures.},

In this study, the simulation specimens were designed based on the mortise structure. Fatigue tests were conducted to explore the failure mechanism under fatigue loading. Elastic-plastic finite element analyses were performed subsequently to investigate the distribution of local mean stress and stress gradient near the notch. Considering the influence of local mean stress and stress gradient, a novel fatigue life prediction method was proposed based on the theory of critical distance (TCD). This method overcomes the disadvantages of the TCD in which the critical distance cannot be determined beforehand and the requirement of a complex iterative process when predicting fatigue life. By using this method, the predicted fatigue life of the simulation specimens under different loads is within error factor.},

  abstract     = {The operation of the anti-icing system of an airplane can modulate its aerodynamics, whilst an aerodynamic control can alter the icing condition. Therefore, one well-designed control strategy can be expected to yield two benefits, which, however, has not been actively investigated. In this work, the constant leading-edge blowing technique is deployed to achieve joint effects on anti-icing and drag reduction, first on an airfoil and then on a half-airplane model. The results indicate that dual virtual surfaces (an inner one and an outer one) wrapping the leading edge are generated by the blowing control. The inner one prevents water droplets from impacting and accumulating on the airfoil by changing their trajectories. The outer one redirects the shear generated by the blowing and promotes its rolling up and vortex shedding, generating low-pressure zones around the upper leading edge and subsequently reducing drag significantly.},

A compressible extension of the flamelet progress variable method has been proposed and tested for use with large-eddy simulations or Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes analyses of the burning of methane in pure air and vitiated air; the latter being particularly relevant in turbine burner scenarios. Effects of the level of detail of the reaction mechanism on the subgrid- and resolved-scale computations are studied. A comparison is made with results obtained using a simplified one-step reaction. The numerical results employing the flamelet model with the more detailed reaction mechanism show faster chemistry, significantly reduced peak temperatures, and stronger sensitivity to pressure. Vitiated air flames are found to be dominated by unstable solutions, resulting in a weak flame with substantially lower peak temperature and impeded development, struggling to persist without quenching.},

  abstract     = {Addressing the issue of tangential mode combustion oscillation prevalent in aviation engine afterburners, this study targets bluff body diffusion flames. Innovatively, acoustic cavities were installed on either side of the bluff body flame, forming a tangential mode oscillation. The study employed experimental methods to study the flame pulsation characteristics under tangential oscillation, identifying the phase distribution of the flame front as a distinct feature differentiating it from conventional longitudinal mode oscillation. Furthermore, it was noted that the multiperiodic pulsation of the flame surface significantly contributes to the complex variability of the flame transfer function/flame description function. The research then established a phase relationship among velocity pulsation, pressure pulsation, and heat release rate pulsation, uncovering the phase coupling mechanism inherent in oscillatory combustion. It also delved into the impact of equivalence ratio and bluff body structure on tangential mode oscillation. Modifications to the bluff body structure led to a significant suppression of oscillation, reducing the amplitude by up to 81.3%. Thus, the study concluded that the flame dynamic response characteristics play a crucial role in determining the thermoacoustic coupling intensity, especially when the combustion system’s acoustic properties are stable. This finding lays a theoretical foundation for future endeavors to mitigate tangential mode oscillatory combustion in afterburners.},

To deal with the problem with multisource uncertainty, a Bayesian updating method under random and interval hybrid uncertainties is originally established in this paper. In the proposed method, the likelihood function is firstly built by considering the error of the observation and the hybrid uncertainties of the model prediction. Then, the posterior information of the random model inputs can be refined based on the defined likelihood function and the prior information. Finally, to efficiently obtain the posterior information of the random model inputs, an adaptive kriging method is developed. In this method, different learning functions are employed to accurately predict the extrema and classify the candidate samples, respectively. The significant novelty of the proposed adaptive kriging method is to design a posterior statistical information-oriented stop criterion. Four computational examples are used to illustrate the feasibility and rationality of the proposed Bayesian updating method.},

The findings reveal that, under identical average incoming velocities but with a velocity gradient along the jet direction in the crossflow, the jet breakup mode changes due to the variable aerodynamic pressures exerted on the jet and crossflow interface; when the gradient changes from positive to negative, the positive gradient delays the transition of the breakup mode while the negative gradient breaks up earlier, and the spray plume distribution differs, showing three characteristics: elevated oblique throw, oblique throw, and collapse. The penetration height is governed not only by the increment of the momentum flux ratio but is also profoundly influenced by the velocity gradient. Contrasting the uniform flow, the penetration height increases for positive gradients and decreases for negative gradients. Consequently, the empirical formula for the penetration height found based on uniform crossflow is not applicable, and this paper introduces an empirical correlation embracing a novel dimensionless parameter, calibrated for diverse crossflow gradients and generalized operational contexts, aiming to refine atomization characteristics and enhance the atomization model within nonuniform crossflows.},

Employing high-fidelity computational fluid dynamics simulations, the flow field is simulated in climb condition. Subsequently, acoustic transport to far-field observers is conducted using the Ffowcs–Williams and Hawkings equation. Because the noise mechanisms of such a configuration are not fully understood yet, several permeable and impermeable surfaces as input for the acoustic simulation are used, aiming to separate the various noise source contributions. Results reveal that in addition to the rotor-alone noise from the propellers, noise arising from propeller–wing interaction emerges as dominant, emitting mostly at the blade passing frequency. Moreover, a boundary element method tool is applied to observe the scattering effect of propeller-generated noise by the wing. Furthermore, this study incorporates consideration of structural components in close proximity to the model, thereby achieving a more realistic acoustic field. With this knowledge, the simulation is validated with experimental data from an open wind tunnel test campaign. An overall good agreement is observed between the simulated and experimental results, substantiating the reliability of both aerodynamic and acoustic predictions.},

When a LEBU is placed strategically at the outer part of a turbulent boundary-layer, the wall pressure spectra can establish a self-similar behavior against , which is a normalized separation distance between the LEBU’s trailing-edge and the targeted location for noise mitigation. It is found that has to be greater than 3 to achieve an overall reduction in the wall pressure fluctuations. What appears to be the optimal LEBU configuration for the mitigation of wall pressure fluctuations, however, will not be reciprocated in the lateral coherence length. The combined effect would render the LEBU rather ineffective to reduce the frequency-integrated, overall noise radiation. Our previous study has confirmed that riblets, a near-wall source-targeting device, is more effective in the mitigation of the lateral coherence length.

Under convectively supersonic conditions without an afterburner (AB), only K-H waves are present. At AB, SI Mach waves may exist, but at shallow angles outside the main radiation lobe. Evidence suggests that Mach wave radiation from faster-than-ordinary K-H waves could stem from shock-cell velocity fluctuations. The empirical convective Mach number indicates decreasing effective convective velocity from to of fully expanded velocity as engine power increases to AB. This convective velocity decreases with frequency, especially for those whose maximum source locations occur between the potential and supersonic core tips. Additionally, a new definition of supersonic-jet convective Mach number, dependent solely on the jet acoustic Mach number, has been derived from wide-ranging jet data. This definition describes the F404 maximum noise radiation angle from intermediate thrust through AB within 2°. Relating this expression to K-H Mach waves for an isothermal jet indicates the relative unimportance of temperature in determining maximum radiation angle for heated supersonic jets, including military jet aircraft and rockets.},

The results show that the wake after a pitching maneuver exhibits a local contraction region, resulting in the leapfrogging phenomenon of tip vortices. The influences of different pitch ranges and pitch rates on the aerodynamic behavior of the wind turbine are studied. The degree of wake contraction depends strongly on the pitch range, whereas an increase in pitch rate is mainly dominated by the shed vorticity, indicating a larger deviation from the quasi-state behavior. In addition, interaction between the shed vorticity and the neighboring tip vortex is observed in the near wake under the condition at a fast pitch rate, which may have an influence on the mutual inductance instability.},

  abstract     = {Reconstructing attractors of airfoil systems from observations facilitates understanding of aeroelasticity, especially the onset of flutter. However, it is generally difficult due to observation noise and the nonlinear nature of the underlying dynamics. In this study, a hybrid strategy is proposed which incorporates data preprocessing and next generation reservoir computing (NG-RC) for reconstructing attractors of an airfoil system. This approach first estimates the system states from noisy observations via a state estimation method and then trains the NG-RC model to predict the responses of the airfoil system. The NG-RC employs nonlinear functions of past states to approximate the dynamics, requiring less training data and fewer hyperparameters than the conventional reservoir computing. To reduce the model complexity, both and smoothed norm penalties are introduced to promote the sparsity of trainable weights, where the optimal weights are determined by simple iterative optimization. Simulation results show that the proposed method can predict various vibration patterns and reconstruct the attractors of the airfoil system from limited, noisy observations. The smoothed norm penalty can lead to sparser weights and, in some cases, enhance performance. The findings support applications of the present method like flutter boundary prediction and flight accident analysis.},

The actuation jets manipulate the interaction between the main element boundary layer and the cove jet to overcome flow separation over the flap and yield high-lift performance that is comparable to or better than conventional high-lift airfoils. The fluidic actuation enables effective operation at larger flap deflections while diminishing the sensitivity to cove characteristics. The performance of the actuator array varies with both the jet momentum coefficient and the spanwise periodic jet spacing. It is shown that the lift increment per jet, which for a sufficiently sparse jet array is invariant with jet spacing, diminishes as jet spacing is reduced due to spanwise jet interactions. Accordingly, the overall lift increment scales with the number of active jets and jet density, and a characteristic spanwise jet spacing is identified for optimal performance.},

  abstract     = {Artificial boundary conditions (BCs) play a ubiquitous role in numerical simulations of transport phenomena in several diverse fields, such as fluid dynamics, electromagnetism, acoustics, geophysics, and many more. They are essential for accurately capturing the behavior of physical systems whenever the simulation domain is truncated for computational efficiency purposes. Ideally, an artificial BC would allow relevant information to enter or leave the computational domain without introducing artifacts or unphysical effects. Boundary conditions designed to control spurious wave reflections are referred to as nonreflective boundary conditions (NRBCs). Another approach is given by the perfectly matched layers (PMLs), in which the computational domain is extended with multiple dampening layers, where outgoing waves are absorbed exponentially in time. In this work, the definition of PML is revised in the context of the lattice Boltzmann method. The impact of adopting different types of BCs at the edge of the dampening zone is evaluated and compared, in terms of both accuracy and computational costs. It is shown that for sufficiently large buffer zones, PMLs allow stable and accurate simulations even when using a simple zeroth-order extrapolation BC. Moreover, employing PMLs in combination with NRBCs potentially offers significant gains in accuracy at a modest computational overhead, provided the parameters of the BC are properly tuned to match the properties of the underlying fluid flow.},

The results for round jets with show good agreement with Finite Difference Method calculations from the literature. In principle, there is a strong sensitivity to the inlet conditions, suggesting a need in future experimental work to measure in detail the velocity profiles and turbulence quantities at the nozzle outlet. The application of turbulence at the inflow boundary of the calculation domain is often used to emulate sources of disturbances in experiments. The present study demonstrates the need to investigate the impact of turbulence level and length scale at inlet independent of each other. Finally, the calculation for a bundle of nine jets with a square inlet led to the finding that the velocity decay of the central jet is maximal when the spacing between the jets is ca. one jet diameter.},

Experimental campaigns on three distinct chord lengths are conducted thus resulting in chord Reynolds numbers of , and . Continuous variations in Mach and AoA allow mapping the shock wave behavior across a large parameter space and capturing the transition between prebuffet, onset, developed buffet, and offset. High-speed focusing schlieren imaging is employed to extract the temporal and spectral nature of buffet and to deduce key quantities that characterize the unsteadiness. Three-dimensional effects along the span due to interference with the side walls are assessed thoroughly, revealing that phases of upstream shock motion and large separation are accompanied by 3D distortion. Even though this effect gains relevance at reduced aspect ratio, a substantially 2D character of the shock surface around the centerplane is confirmed. Fully developed buffet governed by a 2D buffet mode is proven to exist across all test cases, although the buffet peak condition is gradually shifted toward reduced angle of attack, yet greater Mach number with increased Reynolds number. Conversely, accompanied by severely increased angles of attack, the buffet mechanism appears more volatile for small chord length and is consolidated with enlarged chord, which strongly suggests a dependence on the state of the turbulent boundary layer.},

  abstract     = {The dynamic coupling between a Mach 1.94 shock wave/turbulent boundary layer interaction (SBLI) and a flexible panel is investigated. High-order numerical simulations are performed for distinctly different dynamic panel motions and rigid snapshots of their maximum deflected shape. They are compared with a baseline interaction over a rigid planar wall. The panel’s dynamic surface motions were obtained from the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) wind tunnel experiments. The primary aim of the study was to determine whether there were any differences in the flow pressure loading on the compliant panel due to the various rigid and dynamic deformations considered. The results show that the examined panel deformations increase the SBLI size near the panel midpoint, where the deformation amplitude tends to be the largest. Relative to the rigid planar case, the examined surface deformations cause the mean-flow high-pressure surface loading caused by the impinging shock wave to shift downstream along the compliant panel midspan, albeit by a small amount. The spectrogram of the dynamic deformation and the flow surface pressure response suggests that the two are strongly coupled at the dominant (primary) mode but less so at the secondary modes. Although the primary mode frequencies overlap, they do not exactly match, with the pressure response frequency always being slightly higher in all three cases. The rigid deformations did not enhance the pressure power content at the SBLI. However, pre-SBLI and near the panel leading edge, the pressure power spectrum weakly increased throughout the resolved frequency range and overlapped with the onset of the amplification found in the dynamic deformation cases. Post-SBLI, the rigid deformations cause a weak enhancement at frequencies below 1 kHz, which closely match the dominant and secondary pressure response frequencies obtained in the dynamic cases.},

  abstract     = {In this report, we investigate the onset of chaotic flutter in laminar and turbulent flows over a two-dimensional semi-infinite panel using time-accurate fluid–structure interaction (FSI) simulations of shock–boundary-layer interactions (SBLIs). Results indicate that the critical dynamic pressure and the nature of the panel dynamics strongly depend on the static pressure differential across the shock, the local loading, the viscous and turbulent damping in the flow, and the formation of dynamic flow separation bubbles due to the SBLIs. The structural system undergoes local instability (Hopf bifurcation) when the local loading due to panel deformation overcomes the static pressure differential across the shock. In the absence of external fluid instabilities, the structural oscillations will induce unsteadiness in the flowfield, resulting in low-frequency limit-cycle oscillations. Viscous and turbulent damping in the boundary layer also delays the bifurcation and reduces the amplitude of the oscillations. Sufficiently strong shocks can produce localized flow separations, which drive additional boundary-layer instabilities, resulting in an early bifurcation. In the presence of external fluid instabilities, the behavior of the FSI strongly depends on the nonlinear coupling of their instabilities. Chaotic oscillations are observed when the fluid instabilities are dominant enough to induce structural oscillations with broadband frequencies.},

Experiments of two similar models have been conducted in LT5 at the University of Arizona and R2Ch at ONERA. Considerable differences in reattachment behavior were observed from infrared thermography measurements indicating that the reattachment in LT5 was approximately twice as far from the flare base as observed in R2Ch. Supporting simulations have been performed at the University of Arizona and the Technical University of Munich. Various effects are reviewed: Mach numbers and wall temperatures modulating boundary-layer development, 3D relief effects due to differences in normalized cylinder diameters, leading-edge bluntness effects, and the impact of freestream disturbances. Simulations show that modulation of freestream noise amplitude can scale the interaction size to match experiments. Experimental investigation of the respective noise environment between the two facilities showed that despite exhibiting similar noise magnitudes, they differed considerably in frequency content, suggesting that additional parameters are required when quantifying wind tunnel freestream noise conditions. These discrepancies are believed to lead to greater seeding of shear layer instabilities in R2Ch, resulting in faster transition, consistent with the experimentally observed smaller recirculation bubble.},

  abstract     = {Porous boundary-layer bleed alleviates the detrimental effects of shock/turbulent-boundary-layer interactions (SBLIs) in high-speed vehicles. However, many underlying mechanisms through which bleed influences SBLI dynamics remain poorly understood, including unsteady separation mitigation, effects on low-frequency spectra, and turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) modulation. Proper resolution of the dynamics of these phenomena motivates the use of wall-resolved large-eddy simulations. The configuration is based on experiments at Mach 2.5 and a momentum-thickness Reynolds number of 2800, on which a shock of flow-deflection angle of 8 deg impinges. Porous bleed patches are considered with resolution of the flow structure in individual holes. Two different suction strengths are examined, denoted “half-” and “full-bleed” cases based on the sonic mass flow coefficient. Although both bleed cases localize and reduce the mean reversed flow region, only the full-bleed case successfully reduces unsteadiness, TKE, wall-pressure loading, and overall distortion due to the SBLIs. These distinctions are reflected in various local and global effects of bleed, which are examined with three-dimensional modal analysis. Among the key findings is energy shifting from the low-frequency separation behavior to a higher-frequency signature, which modulates the bleed-associated shocks and expansions. Overall, the study highlights the complex interactions between individual bleed-hole flow structures that cumulatively yield the observed overall effects, which are important in optimizing bleed systems for various design objectives.},

The traveling crossflow mode over a swept wing with a Mach number of 6 is first solved using direct numerical simulations. The MPT decomposition illustrates the vortical nature of the traveling crossflow mode, with the vortical component having a higher magnitude than the acoustic and thermal components. The vortical source makes the greatest contribution to the mode instability, whereas the response of the source terms depends on the control method used. Wall cooling primarily impacts the thermal component, thus decreasing the thermal source and subsequently changing the vortical source. Wall suction influences the vortical component directly, and only the vortical source undergoes a small reduction. The acoustic and vortical components are sensitive to grooves. The compression waves induced by grooves are identified as the source of the stabilization effect.},

  abstract     = {A novel three-dimensional technique for correcting wind tunnel measurements for wall interference has been developed. The flow around the test body and its wake is approximated as a series of inviscid singularities, while the wind tunnel walls and model support are approximated using a panel method. A nonlinear least-squares approach with trust-region reflective optimization is then used to obtain the strength and locations of singularities together with the domain boundary panel strengths by fitting to measured wall pressures. The technique is demonstrated using computational fluid dynamics for the test case of a well-documented slender delta wing body with high blockage and validated against both experiments and legacy data. The nonlinear least-squares wall correction method is shown to demonstrate a significant improvement in wall corrections compared to the classical two-variable technique.},

  abstract     = {Turbulent boundary layer wall pressure fluctuations are of significant concern in acoustic engineering for both high-speed airborne and underwater vehicles, and the modeling of the associated wavenumber-frequency spectra has been extensively studied. In this paper, a review of 12 models developed between 1964 and 2017 has been conducted, and both the 2D and 1D forms investigated. In this work, fundamental concepts are introduced, followed by a classification of the models into two categories, that is, Corcos-type and non-Corcos-type models. Both the 2D and 1D forms of the 12 models are individually introduced in chronological order. To evaluate these models, comparisons of the 2D and 1D wavenumber-frequency spectra at different speeds and frequencies were conducted. Unlike Corcos-type models, non-Corcos-type models are grounded in a stronger theoretical foundation, with some models accurately reflecting acoustic region characteristics. Corcos-type models exhibit good consistency, however, they require an auto-spectrum as a necessary input, which makes them semiempirical models. In addition, the models within the Corcos-type and the non-Corcos-type were also compared, respectively, and a few important conclusions were accordingly made. The research output from this paper can provide an important practical engineering reference for studies associated with acoustic engineering, such as aircraft cabin noise and submarine hydrodynamic noise.},

In the present study, an absorption sensor for measurement was developed by exploiting the affordability and flexibility of a near-infrared fiber-coupled distributed feedback diode laser. The first objective of the present study was to address the incomplete spectroscopic data for the absorption feature near through the determination of line strengths and broadening coefficients with collisional partners including , and Ar. Line shape characterization in both an absorption cell and a shock tube behind reflected shock waves was conducted to determine the temperature exponents of these broadening coefficients. The other objective was to demonstrate the capability of the sensor through detection in multicomponent mixtures and time-history measurements in the shock tube for investigating chemical kinetics at engine and gas-turbine-relevant conditions. The sensor developed in this study could serve as a cost-effective diagnostic tool for chemical kinetic measurements, combustion monitoring, and other applications where flexibility and robustness are prioritized.},

To solve the multidimensional control laws from a single gain dimension, an active shape control model training framework is proposed based on the deep Q-network algorithm, including the state space, action space, and reward function. Numerical simulations, with errors stemming from two typical thermal loads as the initial errors, are conducted to illustrate the effect of the proposed control method. The influence of the voltage step size on the shape control precision is analyzed, and further online training is discussed for implementing control. The results indicate that the proposed method reduces the root-mean-square (RMS) error by more than 50% The control effect of the trained control model on other error conditions does not perform as desired. However, online training can effectively solve this problem, achieving faster convergence and a significant reduction of the RMS error.},

  abstract     = {Tensegrity structures are emerging as pivotal components in the assembly of ultralarge modular spacecraft in orbit, primarily due to their exceptional volume-to-mass ratio and robust controllability. During on-orbit operations, given the low damping and high flexibility of tensegrity, its vibration-induced deformations affect the magnitude of the heat flux, presenting a typical force–shape coupling problem. This paper introduces an energy-preserving matrix perturbation solution designed to efficiently and accurately address the thermally induced vibration challenges in tensegrity. This method effectively mitigates the energy dissipation and numerical instability issues. Furthermore, the analysis incorporates the impact of the axial component of heat flux on structural vibration, uncovering the influence mechanism of this often-overlooked slow variable on the dynamic behavior of tensegrity. The proposed method demonstrates a deviation of less than 1% between the thermal response and the results obtained from finite element analysis, while achieving a 70% reduction in computation time. The varying axial thermal load leads to a rapid decrease in system frequency, resulting in divergent thermal vibrations. Additionally, the significant dynamic stress can potentially surpass the structural stress limits. These findings underscore the critical importance of considering such effects in the design and calculation of tensegrity structures for aerospace applications.},

Unlike previous studies, the structural model considered in this paper includes practical situations and conditions arising in the design process and application of FGM cylindrical panels. The properties of material constituents are assumed to be temperature-dependent, and the effective properties of porous FGM are determined using a modified rule of mixture. Governing equations in terms of deflection and stress function are established based on first-order shear deformation theory, taking into account von Kármán–Donnell nonlinearity and initial geometric imperfection. Analytical solutions are assumed to satisfy simply supported boundary conditions, and the Galerkin method is applied to derive a time differential equation containing both quadratic and cubic nonlinear terms. This differential equation is numerically integrated employing the fourth-order Runge–Kutta scheme to determine the frequencies of nonlinear free vibration. Parametric studies are carried out to assess numerous effects on both linear and nonlinear frequencies of porous FGM cylindrical panels. The study reveals that natural frequencies are strongly decreased and that frequency nonlinearity is more significant due to axial compressive loads.},

In this work, a probabilistic approach is proposed for reliability and sensitivity analysis of composite all-movable fin flutter. To be specific, an adaptive method based on basis-adaptive polynomial chaos expansion (PCE) is developed to estimate the probability of failure, and the basis-adaptive PCE-based Sobol indices are used for measuring the contributions of input variables to the reliability over their entire uncertainty ranges. A composite beam and a composite plate are analyzed to test the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed approach. The finite element model of composite all-movable fin flutter is approximated by the basis-adaptive PCE model, which is adaptively updated by the FBR learning function. The weighed -means strategy is added to accelerate the convergence speed and reduce the number of iterations. Then the basis-adaptive PCE model is combined with numerical simulation for reliability and sensitivity analysis of composite all-movable fin flutter. Based on the results of Monte Carlo simulation, compared with adaptive support vector regression, kriging, and the traditional PCE method, it is found that the accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed method are the best for reliability and sensitivity analysis of composite all-movable fin flutter.},

Tests were conducted inside an optically accessible vacuum chamber where the PSI process was simulated using a sonic jet impinging on a bed of regolith simulant. Crater geometry measurements were taken at nozzle heights of 4.6 to 55.6 nozzle diameters above the simulant surface. Results show that the highly underexpanded plume under subatmospheric conditions resulted in broad and shallow craters compared to craters formed under Earth atmosphere. Some craters under subatmospheric conditions exhibited lobed geometry characterized by azimuthal depth variations. In these same cases, the deepest portion of the crater was located radially away from the center, and particles were observed moving toward the center resulting in fountain-like particle movement. Craters formed under Earth atmospheric conditions had an axisymmetric parabolic geometry with the location of maximum depth at the center. In general, subatmospheric crater growth was slower than Earth atmospheric. However, subatmospheric crater formation at nozzle heights of 9.3D and below was characteristically like Earth atmospheric crater formation at large nozzle heights.},

A concept of operation for AAM vehicles is considered to deliver packages for a number of customers at different locations. The objective of the problem is to minimize the overall energy consumption of all AAM vehicles. A feed-forward neural network (FFNN) is proposed to predict the fight energy consumption of a delivery drone, whose flight data were used to train the neural network. To optimize the allocation of AAM vehicles to service stations (e.g., for charging and maintenance) with limited service bays, a distributed limited resource allocation algorithm (DLRAA) is proposed based on the Hungarian method. DLRAA was compared with a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) solver based on the average run time and average cost in 1000 simulation runs. The results show that the proposed FFNN produced an accurate prediction given noisy flight data, the proposed DLRAA generates allocation that satisfies the given constraints efficiently, and DLRAA outperforms MILP based on average cost in all testing cases. DLRAA outperforms MILP based on the average run time when the number of charging stations is less than 30 and the number of drones is less than 160.},

In this paper, we propose an algorithm based on the coupled adjoint method and the algorithmic differentiation method that can compute the derivative of such constraint accurately and efficiently. We verify the proposed method using several simple low-dimensional dynamical systems. The relative difference between the adjoint method and the finite differences is between to .

However, during aerodynamic shape optimization, large geometry and flow solution changes may decrease solution accuracy and efficiency on fixed meshes. The optimizer may converge to a spurious optimum if the solution loses accuracy. We use the discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method to tackle this problem because it yields high-order-accurate solutions that often have less error per degree of freedom compared to second-order finite-volume methods. Because DG degrees of freedom often incur a higher computational cost, we take advantage of local adaptation to maximize accuracy at a given cost. However, during optimization, it is not clear when to adapt to avoid overoptimizing initial designs and to avoid errors polluting the optimal solution. We develop an adaptation strategy that reaches a target error at the end of a single optimization loop. Finally, we present results for two airfoil optimization test cases. Our results show that this adaptation procedure outperforms optimization using fixed-fidelity DG and second-order finite volume on a per-degree-of-freedom basis.},

Introducing such a thermodynamic constraint into the Lattice-Boltzmann Method can be accomplished by altering either the equilibrium distribution function or the external force. The former requires a lengthy parameterization for a free energy of multiple independent variables which becomes cumbersome for more than three components. The latter has been done for a multicomponent compressible system, but a correction term for the force is required to recover the expected conservation equations. This work builds upon the incompressible single component forcing method from He et al. (Journal of Computational Physics, Vol. 152, No. 2, 1999) by deriving and implementing the required force needed to successfully recover the expected mass conservation from a nonideal free energy with an arbitrary number of components. This allows the simulation of more realistic phase separating fluid systems by including many interacting components, which is demonstrated here for up to five components and phases.},

Various compressibility corrections have been proposed to integrate the van Driest transformation or the semilocal transformation, i.e., a given compressible law of the wall, into the RANS formulation. Prior work has focused mainly on the logarithmic layer, but upon evaluating these log-layer compressibility corrections, we find that they do not significantly improve skin friction estimates. To overcome this challenge, we develop viscous-layer compressibility corrections. We do that by altering the dissipation terms. These corrections conform the RANS model to the semilocal scaling, resulting in more accurate predictions of mean velocity and temperature in a posteriori tests. Although not the primary focus of this study, we also find that the baseline one-equation Spalart–Allmaras model, which was proposed before the concept of semilocal scaling, produces results consistent with the semilocal scaling in a posteriori tests without requiring any compressibility correction.},

  abstract     = {An experimental investigation was conducted on a NACA 0018 airfoil at near-stall conditions, with stalled, stable laminar-separation bubble, and intermediate flow conditions were considered. Planar particle image velocimetry and surface pressure measurements were used to quantify the flow development at the midspan of the model. For the intermediate conditions, the airfoil is stalled in the time-average sense. However, conditionally averaged velocity field measurements reveal that reattachment of the separated flow and laminar separation bubble formation occur intermittently on the suction surface. The characteristics of the intermittently forming separation bubble and fully separated flow are analyzed based on conditional statistics, revealing variations in the transition process that may underpin the observed low-frequency flow oscillations. The growth rates of the most amplified wavenumbers in the separated shear layer vary with the angle between the separation streamline and the suction surface, leading to earlier transition when the separation angle increases. This change in transition location may play a role in spontaneous changes between fully separated and reattaching flow states.},

  abstract     = {Natural laminar flow (NLF) is an important technique for reducing drag of the next-generation supersonic transport aircraft. However, achieving NLF on supersonic transport wings is challenging due to the large swept angles and high-Reynolds-number conditions, which significantly amplify Tollmien–Schlichting (TS) and crossflow (CF) instabilities. To address this problem, this paper proposes a modified target pressure distribution to attenuate the TS and CF instabilities. Compared with conventional targets defined using empirical functions, it is derived in two steps: the first step is to prescribe an initial flat target pressure distribution with a narrow leading-edge flow acceleration region and conduct inverse designs; the second step is to modify the target pressure distribution according to the stability analysis results of the designed wing in order to achieve a balance of disturbance growth at positive and negative wave angles. The proposed approach is validated on a 60°-swept infinite-span wing at and . Results demonstrate that TS and CF instabilities are well-suppressed under the modified target pressure distribution, with the transition location delayed from on the baseline wing to on the designed wing, suggesting that the proposed method is effective for NLF design on supersonic highly swept wings.},

Particle image velocimetry was taken at two principal locations at the stern of the BOR. Distortion of the correlation function was evident in the compact eddy structure of the BOR boundary layer on both the lee and port sides.

  abstract     = {Flow separation over the intake lip often occurs in gas turbine engines at off-design conditions such as crosswinds. The distortion transferred to the fan face detrimentally impacts the engine performance. The current study explores the efficacy of steady vortex generator jets (VGJ) to alleviate this flow distortion using high-fidelity implicit large-eddy simulations on a quasi-3D intake. The study reveals that VGJs, strategically placed on the windward side of the intake, induce coherent structures that include cylindrical jet shear layers, horseshoe vortices, and counter-rotating vortex pairs similar to transverse jets in crossflow. Parametric studies are carried out to identify the optimal VGJ location and blowing ratios. Superior flow control is achieved when the VGJs are placed on the windward side closer to the leading edge, reducing the distortion coefficient by compared to the uncontrolled case. In contrast, when the VGJs are placed farther from the leading edge, the flow relaminarizes and the coherent structures decay rapidly due to severe acceleration over the intake lip. Consistent with experiments, our computations at higher blowing ratios (VR1.5 and VR2) show an improved pressure recovery decreasing the distortion coefficient by due to deeper jet penetration and enhanced mixing.},

  abstract     = {Numerical and experimental studies were conducted to uncover the physical aspects of a liquid jet injected into a supersonic crossflow with gas throttling systematically. The results were obtained with the inflow conditions of a Mach number of 2.0, a total temperature of 300 K, and a total pressure of 0.55 MPa. The results show that fuel–air mixing is considerably enhanced due to shock-induced flow distortion by adding gas throttling. The strength of downstream backpressure determines the distance of forward movement of the throttling shock wave train and the flowfield structure in the channel. When the mass flux of gas throttling is high, the influence of throttling gas spreads across the expansion section, resulting in significant flow separation in front of the liquid jet. It is found that the spray flashback phenomenon is similar to the flame flashback phenomenon that occurs in the supersonic combustion process under the action of a precombustion shock train. The wall counterrotating vortex pair and induced cavity streamwise vortices are enhanced with the increase of the flux of gas throttling. The relatively high-pressure environment generated by gas throttling promotes the atomization of droplets. As a result, the mixing enhancement mechanism of a liquid jet in a supersonic crossflow with gas throttling is mainly due to the combined effects of 1) the shock waves separating the side wall boundary layer and modifying the local flow state of air in the combustor, which lead to a dramatic increase in fuel–air mixing, and 2) the streamwise vorticity values as well as the residence time resulting from channel blockage elevating.},

  abstract     = {Rotorcraft rotor-fuselage-intake aerodynamics and icing present unique challenges associated with rotor-wake dynamics and the interaction of rotor wake with the fuselage and the intake. The effects of the rotor wake are dominant in low forward flight, and performing high-fidelity simulations of the rotor-fuselage-intake simultaneously is expensive. This study presents a novel hybrid nonlinear vortex–computational fluid dynamics (CFD) approach to rotor-fuselage-intake aerodynamics and icing. The method combines nonlinear vortex–lattice, Lagrangian vortex–particle, and Eulerian CFD methods on airflow and droplet impingement with a PDE-based ice-accretion model. The Lagrangian description of rotor wake preserves the wake structure independently of the Eulerian grid, whereas the Eulerian description of the flowfield naturally computes nonlinear flow phenomena and surface properties. The algorithm allowed the ice accretion to be computed much faster than existing methods. The method was validated by considering airflow, surface pressure, and ice accretion around a model rotorcraft. We investigated ice accretion with strong rotor wakes for different advance ratios and rotor thrust coefficients. We also investigated the effects of the suction of airflow in the intake and the differences between with and without the rotor. It was found that the advance ratio had a dominant effect compared to the rotor thrust coefficient.},

Training data were acquired in an anechoic chamber on both isolated rotors and rotor–airframe configurations. The acoustic amplitude and phase of the revolution-averaged interaction were predicted, which required up to 25 harmonics to capture the impulse event caused by the blade’s approach and departure from the airframe. Prediction performance showed, on average, that the artificial neural network models could estimate the acoustic amplitude and phase over the relevant harmonics for unseen conditions with 86% and 75% accuracy, respectively. This enables a time-domain reconstruction of the waveform for the range of geometric and flow parameters tested. In contrast, the Gaussian process matched the amplitude but underpredicted the phase for unseen conditions at 86% and 45% accuracy, respectively.},

  abstract     = {The effects of part-speed geometry changes on the performance of an aeroengine centrifugal compressor are evaluated. In many applications, impellers are often of a high-flow-coefficient, high-specific-speed design. When coupled with the high rotational speeds and high temperature ratios of modern impellers, significant deformation occurs as the compressor moves across its operating range from low speeds to high speeds. At each operating speed studied, the impeller geometry was deformed to achieve the running, warm geometry at that speed. Typically, a single hot-to-cold analysis is performed to generate the cold geometry needed for fabricating the hardware. The hot as-designed geometry is used to predict performance at all operating speeds. The present study shows that this approach tends to overpredict part-speed performance. The variation between the hot geometry and the warm geometry at part speeds below 80% of design speed was nearly one point in efficiency and more than 1.2% in total pressure ratio. The assumption of constant geometry is made due to the time-consuming and computationally expensive iterative procedure required to compute the warm part-speed geometries. To address this, a scaling is presented that allows for part-speed geometries to be determined using only the as-manufactured and as-designed geometries.},

Specifically, we focus on assessing the projection-based ROM construction utilizing three different approaches: the linear static basis, the nonlinear quadratic basis, and an adaptive model order reduction (MOR) formulation. First, an a priori analysis is performed to evaluate the effectiveness of the linear static and nonlinear quadratic bases in representing the detonation wave dynamics. The a priori analysis reveals that, compared to the linear basis, the nonlinear quadratic basis provides significantly improved representation of detonation wave dynamics within the training regime. However, it exhibits limited capabilities in representing the dynamics beyond the training regime, either in the future state or under a different operating parameter (i.e., inlet velocity). Second, the investigations proceed to the adaptive MOR formulation, which constructs an online adaptive ROM with a small amount of offline training data. It is demonstrated that the adaptive ROM can provide significantly enhanced predictive capabilities in modeling the RDE dynamics in the future state and subject to parametric variations. More importantly, the adaptive ROM is shown to be capable of capturing the initial transience in establishing the detonation wave.},

The physical processes underpinning the dynamics of the combustion wave are complex, and a lack of understanding of these processes represents a significant barrier to practical implementation of the technology. A significant simplification of the RDE is considered through an abstracted experimental setup. The detonation wave is replaced with a nonreacting shock generated by a shock tube, and the annulus is unwrapped into a single linear channel. Both simplifications make direct visualization of the problem via schlieren imaging tractable. Several performance metrics are used to relate the fluid-dynamic behavior of the shock–injector interaction to the performance of a theoretical rotating detonation engine. The first such metric is “recovery time,” based on the time taken for the injector to return to a fully flowing state after the passage of a detonation wave. The second such metric not only considers the mass flow through the injector exit but also accounts for potential backflow into the injector nozzle that may occur for sufficiently strong waves. Finally, a reactant mass-deficit metric is used to characterize the reduction in mass injection due to the interaction with the wave.},

  abstract     = {When a civil aircraft engine is operated at windmill during the cruise flight phase, there is supersonic flow acceleration around the leading edge of the fan cowl toward the external surface. The terminating normal shock wave can separate the turbulent boundary layer developing on this external surface. A series of experiments at a flight-relevant Reynolds number (1.2 million based on lip thickness) are performed in a quasi-two-dimensional wind tunnel rig to investigate the underlying flow physics. At a nominal inflow Mach number of 0.65 and a nacelle incidence angle of 4.5 deg, as the equivalent engine mass-flow rate is reduced, an increase in shock strength results in flow separation when the shock exceeds Mach 1.4. Over a 10% range in the notional engine mass-flow rate, the boundary layer developing on the external fan cowl thickens by a factor of three on the onset of separation. A reduction in the incoming Mach number from 0.65 to 0.60 weakens the shock wave and thus delays separation. An increase in surface roughness has no significant effect in situations where the boundary layer remains attached. However, for separated cases, an increased local roughness height causes a greater separation extent and a thicker boundary layer downstream of the shock wave.},

  abstract     = {The shape of liquid droplets in air plays an important role in the aerodynamic behavior and combustion dynamics of miniaturized propulsion systems such as microsatellites and small drones. Their precise manipulation can yield optimal efficiency in such systems. It is desired to have a minimal representation of droplet shapes using as few parameters as possible to automate shape manipulation using self-learning algorithms, such as reinforcement learning. In this paper, we use a neural compression algorithm to represent, with only two parameters, elliptical and bullet-shaped droplets initially represented with 200 points (400 real numbers) at the droplet boundary. The mapping of many to two points is achieved in two stages. Initially, a Fourier series is formulated to approximate the contour of the droplet. Subsequently, the coefficients of this Fourier series are condensed to lower dimensions utilizing a neural network with a bottleneck architecture. Finally, 5000 synthetically generated droplet shapes were used to train the neural network. With a two-real-number representation, the recovered droplet shapes had excellent overlap with the original ones, with a mean square error of . Hence, this method compresses the droplet contour to merely two numerical parameters via a fully reversible process, a crucial feature for rendering learning algorithms computationally tractable.},

  abstract     = {Efficient validation of numerical models for predicting failures in composite structures is imperative due to the intricate nature of such failures. The multifaceted aspects, including multimodal, multiscale, and interactive factors, pose challenges in the calibration and validation of models. Constraints in cost and time often limit the comprehensive testing required for model validation across diverse failure response scenarios. This study proposes an optimal test selection approach, building upon previous insights that optimizing measures derived from progressive failure responses can unveil failure mode interactions sensitive to stochastic variations. Calibration designs should minimize interaction while maximizing sensitivity to calibration parameters, whereas validation models must encompass varied interactions to understand predictability limits. However, optimizing progressive failure analyses for composites is computationally intensive. A straightforward design of experiments exploration is demonstrated here, focusing on efficiently identifying designs sensitive to stochastic effects, which reveal mode interactions and suitability for calibration/validation. This method is exemplified using computational models for composite bolted joints subjected to pin-bearing loads, showcasing their intricate failure modes. Designs displaying high sensitivity to parameter changes offer insights into failure mechanisms, aiding in model validation and enhancement. Thus, employing such critical designs as test cases can refine numerical models, resulting in more accurate representations of complex failure behaviors in diverse composite components.},

Three reinitiation behaviors that result in an amplified pressure impulse were observed and are referred to as steady, spike, and endwall amplification. Steady amplification was characterized by an amplification event with a peak pressure impulse 2 times that of the inlet detonation, followed by a near-linear attenuation toward Chapman–Jouguet conditions. Spike amplification displayed a larger peak pressure amplification that was 3 to 5 times greater than the inlet detonation, followed by a rapid and nonlinear attenuation. Endwall behavior represents a Craven–Grieg deflagration to detonation transition scenario. These behaviors are shown to be factors of area expansion ratio and the degree to which the incoming detonation is subcrtical. A decoupling parameter, was devised to combine these effects into a single correlation metric. The finite length of the expansion chamber also plays a role in the reinitiation behavior as observed by the endwall reinitiation behavior. A critical chamber length parameter was devised to explain this behavior and then theorized to have a relationship to with this being explored theoretically and with the limited data set available.},

It is shown that during supersonic testing at the Transonic Dynamics Tunnel, vibro-impacts at the embedded external fuel tank shakers on the inboard underwing stations of the generic fighter introduce strong nonlinearity that gives rise to nonlinear modal interactions. Specifically, time–frequency analysis of the acceleration data demonstrates that and transient resonance captures occur across the aircraft exclusively during this vibro-impact forcing window. Further analysis suggests that these resonance captures are dependent on Mach number. These results show experimentally that local vibro-impacts can cause global nonlinear effects in an aeroelastic system and that these effects can be identified using the new methodology herein. The data-driven analysis scheme employed shows applicability to full-aircraft flight test data for identifying nonlinear modal interactions without knowledge of the precise nonlinear contributors.},

  abstract     = {This paper compares several approaches to model the unsteady and nonlinear longitudinal aerodynamics of a generic unmanned combat air vehicle configuration based on computational fluid dynamics (CFD). Three different reduced-order models (ROMs) are implemented through unsteady simulations to predict the evolution of forces and moments during prescribed trajectories carried out at . The first model investigates a linear quasi-steady model based on a first-order Taylor series expansion of the aerodynamic coefficients. The second one picks up the mathematical formulation of the first model but adds a dynamic coefficient in order to take into account the unsteady effect of rotation rate variations. Finally, the third model is built on indicial functions computed from positive step changes in the angle of attack or pitch rate. The unknown parameters of the first two models and the unknown indicial functions of the third one are obtained, respectively, from the study of forced oscillations and step motions. These prescribed trajectories are performed using unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes simulations coupled with a grid displacement tool. Two different methods are tested and compared to carry out the CFD mesh motions: an overset method and a full moving grid (FMG) method. The indicial functions obtained using the FMG method give results equivalent to those found in the literature in half the time of the overset method. To reduce the computational costs to set up the ROMs, the FMG method is preferred to the overset method. ROMs are then applied, and their predictions are compared with CFD simulations for prescribed trajectories with different angular rates and angles of attack. A study of instantaneous and overall accuracy associated with the implementation cost of the ROMs has allowed to show their strengths and their weaknesses. Similar results are observed at low angles of attack for the ROMs studied, while a major modeling advantage of the indicial method has been identified for higher angles of attack in the nonlinear domain.},

  abstract     = {Modal analysis has become an essential tool to understand the coherent structure of complex flows. The classical modal analysis methods, such as dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) and spectral proper orthogonal decomposition (SPOD), rely on a sufficient amount of data that is regularly sampled in time. However, often one needs to deal with sparse temporally irregular data, for example, due to experimental measurements and simulation algorithm. To overcome the limitations of data scarcity and irregular sampling, we propose a novel modal analysis technique using multivariate Gaussian process regression (MVGPR). We first establish the connection between MVGPR and the existing modal analysis techniques, DMD and SPOD, from a linear system identification perspective. Next, leveraging this connection, we develop a MVGPR-based modal analysis technique that addresses the aforementioned limitations. The capability of MVGPR is endowed by its judiciously designed kernel structure for correlation function, which is derived from the assumed linear dynamics. Subsequently, the proposed MVGPR method is benchmarked against DMD and SPOD on a range of examples, from academic and synthesized data to unsteady airfoil aerodynamics. The results demonstrate MVGPR as a promising alternative to classical modal analysis methods, especially in the scenario of scarce and temporally irregular data.},

  abstract     = {A new class of equivariant neural networks is presented, hereby dubbed lattice-equivariant neural networks (LENNs), designed to satisfy local symmetries of a lattice structure. The approach develops within a recently introduced framework aimed at learning neural network-based surrogate models’ lattice Boltzmann collision operators. Whenever neural networks are employed to model physical systems, respecting symmetries and equivariance properties has been shown to be key for accuracy, numerical stability, and performance. Here, hinging on ideas from group representation theory, trainable layers are defined whose algebraic structure is equivariant with respect to the symmetries of the lattice cell. The presented method naturally allows for efficient implementations, in terms of both memory usage and computational costs, supporting scalable training/testing for lattices in two spatial dimensions and higher (in which the size of symmetry group grows). The approach is validated andtested considering 2D and 3D flowing dynamics, both in laminar and turbulent regimes. It is compared with group-averaged-based symmetric networks and with plain, nonsymmetric, networks, showing how the presented approach unlocks the (a posteriori) accuracy and training stability of the former models and the train/inference speed of the latter networks. (LENNs are about one order of magnitude faster than group-averaged networks in 3D.) The work in this paper opens toward practical use of machine learning-augmented lattice Boltzmann CFD in real-world simulations.},

In AdaCM, the appropriate combustion submodel—whether the cost-effective species transport model or the advanced transported probability density function (TPDF) method—is adaptively assigned to different regions based on a criterion crucial for performance. The use of RL avoids the extensive manual optimization that involves repetitive calculations and struggles to account for multiple factors. Specifically, RL agents observe local variables as the state and determine the appropriate submodel through a policy. The policy is refined to maximize a reward measuring both accuracy and efficiency through the interaction between RL agents and the AdaCM solver. The methodology is demonstrated for a turbulent non-premixed jet flame, and a sophisticated RL criterion exhibiting a nonlinear and nonmonotonic dependency on the two-dimensional state of mixture fraction and Damköhler number is learned. The AdaCM with the trained criterion provides predictions that are nearly indistinguishable from those obtained using the TPDF method for the whole computational domain, while substantially reducing the computational cost with the speedup of 3.4 and only 22% of cells for TPDF.},

  abstract     = {This paper addresses the issue of predicting separated flows with Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) turbulence models, which are essential for many engineering tasks. Traditional RANS models usually struggle with this task, so recent efforts have focused on data-driven methods such as field inversion and machine learning (FIML) to correct this issue by adjusting the baseline equations. However, these FIML methods often reduce accuracy in attached boundary layers. To address this issue, we developed a “conditioned field inversion” technique. This method adjusts the corrective factor (used by FIML) in the shear-stress transport (SST) model. It multiplies with a shield function that is off in the boundary layer and on elsewhere. This maintains the accuracy of the baseline model for the attached flows. We applied both conditioned and classic field inversion to the NASA hump and a curved backward-facing step, creating two datasets. These datasets were used to train two models: SR-CND (symbolic regression-conditioned, from our new method) and SR-CLS (symbolic regression-classic, from the traditional method). The SR-CND model matches the SR-CLS model in predicting separated flows in various scenarios, such as periodic hills, the NLR7301 airfoil, the 3D SAE (Society of Automotive Engineers) car model, and the 3D Ahmed body, and outperforms the baseline SST model in the cases presented in the paper. Importantly, the SR-CND model maintains accuracy in the attached boundary layers, whereas the SR-CLS model does not. Therefore, the proposed method improves separated flow predictions while maintaining the accuracy of the original model for attached flows, offering a better way to create data-driven turbulence models.},

In the full-spectrum analysis of the bending direction, the reverse whirl frequency, which is the nonpower frequency component caused by rubbing, is found. This whirl frequency leads to the period-doubling bifurcation and the reverse whirl phenomenon of the system. In the analysis of the torsional direction, it is found that the torsional signal can better reflect the different types of rub-impact faults. Further research shows that the unbalanced phase between the rubbing discs is a crucial parameter influencing the bending–torsion coupled vibration and the whirl characteristics of the rotor system. An experimental platform with nonuniform clearance is designed and manufactured to reproduce the reverse whirl phenomenon. The reverse whirl motion near the second-order superharmonic resonance speed is designed to verify the mechanism of the reverse whirl.},

  abstract     = {This study investigates the effects of recirculation channel casing treatment positioning in a transonic fan. Recirculation channels are a passive casing treatment, consisting of an injection and extraction port connected by a secondary flowpath. Casing treatments typically extend stall margin at the cost of efficiency. However, in a transonic flowfield, strong pressure gradients can introduce an important unsteady component to the recirculation channel flow, giving these channels the potential to reduce this tradeoff by timing the injection and removal of the recirculated flow for maximum effectiveness. This timing aspect of the recirculation channel can be designed using the circumferential positioning (clocking) of the injection port relative to the extraction port. The presented results show two stability-enhancing mechanisms. First, the oscillation-attenuation mechanism improves flow stability by increasing the mean axial velocity at the tip and attenuating the oscillation of the shock and tip leakage vortex. Second, the tip leakage vortex (TLV) energization mechanism improves flow stability by injecting a jet that locally energizes the TLV. This study demonstrates that the stability-enhancing mechanism of the recirculation channel is determined by effective clocking.},

  abstract     = {The impact of adding a duct to an diameter, triple-bladed, electrically driven rotor operating up to at static conditions is investigated experimentally to identify the source mechanisms governing the measured acoustic differences. An unducted rotor is characterized by strong, coherent tip vorticity that interacts with each blade passing, generating high-amplitude harmonic tones. The addition of the duct results in tonal broadening and an increase of the primary and harmonic tone amplitudes. Up to a 15 dB increase in broadband noise across the entire frequency range is measured. High-speed particle imaging velocimetry up to 6.4 kHz is employed to acquire phase-locked and ensemble-averaged measurements of the velocity, vorticity, and turbulence fields. While it is often theorized that a duct can shield lateral acoustic radiation, this study finds that the ducted rotor is louder across all operating regimes, and the noise increases with tip Mach number. The ducted rotor dissipates the coherent tip vorticity into incoherent turbulence intensity due to the interaction of the vortices with the duct internal walls, contributing to a strong broadband noise increase and tonal broadening. The ducted rotor broadband noise increase is due to the rotor interacting with a more turbulent inflow condition and increased turbulence intensity throughout the plume shear layer.},

  abstract     = {This paper introduces a design framework for elastically deformable hinges consisting of two parallel flat flexures, focusing on the case where the hinge is folded by 180 deg in the stowed configuration. The authors first consider architectures in which the flexures are staggered to avoid contact so that they can be modeled independently using Euler’s elastica. They next focus on the nonstaggered case when folding can result in contact between the flexures, which they study through finite element simulations. The paper provides a set of design guidelines by rationalizing the relationship between hinge dimensions and the allowable curvature in the flexure material. For most hinge geometries applicable to deployable structures, the authors find a simple requirement for the minimum flexure length as a function of the allowable curvature in the material, . Their analysis also provides insight into the reaction forces necessary to keep the hinge in the folded configuration, which is useful in determining the deployment dynamics and the constraints necessary to secure the panel in place during stowage. Experimental prototypes show good agreement with the numerical predictions.},

  abstract     = {In high-speed aerodynamics research, point sensors are ideal for embedding in test models but lack spatial resolution, whereas high-speed cameras offer spatiotemporally resolved measurement but involve significant footprint, cost, and data size. To address these tradeoffs, this study explores the application of nascent event-based cameras for high-speed tests. Event-based cameras support continuous, data-sparse kilohertz-equivalent imaging at resolution, on form factors as small as 36 mm and 40 grams in mass, combining the benefits of point sensors and high-speed cameras. However, these attributes come from asynchronous pixels that necessitate unique operating and postprocessing approaches. Here, the authors adapted event-based cameras for two-/three-dimensional photogrammetric tracking of aeroelastic structures, demonstrating an event-based workflow and two tracking algorithms (mean-shift filtering and circle fit). Bench-top validations achieved three-dimensional precision of 0.35 mm/s on 20 mm/s motion across a 259 mm field of view, while two-dimensional measurements of an aeroelastic titanium panel in Mach 0.76 transonic flow successfully identified millimeter-scale vibrations at 43.7, 120, and 270 Hz, validated against a laser displacement and high-speed camera. The transonic test’s raw data were 145.8 MB on the event-based camera, compared to 88.5 GB on the high-speed camera. The presented results demonstrated the viability of event-based techniques in high-speed aerodynamic testing, while highlighting challenges such as polarity switching and pixel latency.},

The pressure field on the plate is measured using pressure-sensitive paint, and the structural response is observed using the measured voltage of a piezoelectric patch. The measurements show a dominant frequency of oscillation which indicates the likely onset of flutter and a postflutter limit cycle oscillation (LCO). A computational investigation is conducted to study the effects of static pressure differential, temperature differential, cavity pressure coupling, and plate boundary conditions on the linear flutter onset condition and the nonlinear postflutter LCO characteristics. Rivets that connect the plate to the supporting structure are modeled as local constraint in the in-plane direction, and their effect is investigated. Computations show that the coupling between the cavity acoustic and plate structural modes is necessary for flutter onset in the wind-tunnel conditions. Correlation between computed and measured aerodynamic pressure shows reasonable agreement in amplitude and frequency. Computational results are obtained using Piston Theory and also potential flow aerodynamics. Computed and measured pressure LCO mode shapes are extracted and correlated.},

The section geometry consists of a modified supercritical airfoil, with a jet that is blown over a one-quarter circular cylindrical trailing-edge Coanda surface. Because the configuration does not include a slotted trailing-edge flap, the mechanical complexity and weight may be reduced. The computations correspond to an experimental investigation, which provides data for comparison. High-fidelity solutions were obtained to the unsteady three-dimensional Navier–Stokes equations at a chord-based Reynolds number of and freestream Mach number of 0.1. Several angles of attack were considered, and solutions were obtained both with and without circulation control. In the control cases, three different jet-mass flow rates were simulated at each angle of attack. A grid-resolution study was carried out to assure numerical accuracy. Comparisons are made between the respective cases and with the experimental data, and features of the flowfields are characterized. It was found that Coanda-jet control was able to augment lift in excess of factors of three with reasonable amounts of jet-mass flow.},

  abstract     = {Magnetohydrodynamics couples the Navier–Stokes and Maxwell equations to describes flows in electrically conducting fluids. The divergence of the magnetic field must vanish, but numerical algorithms typically do not preserve this condition exactly. Artifacts can then arise in solutions, such as spurious forces parallel to the magnetic field. These artifacts can be alleviated by using extended sets of Maxwell’s equations that include magnetic charges and currents and hence are invariant under duality rotations that interchange the electric and magnetic fields. The eight-wave formulation supposes that the magnetic current arises from magnetic charges being advected by the fluid. The magnetohydrodynamic equations are then Galilean invariant even when the divergence of the magnetic field is nonzero. The evolution equation for the magnetic field then resembles Jeffery’s equation that describes the orientations of a suspension of axisymmetric particles. The ideal electric field is invariant under the extra terms proportional to the divergence of the magnetic field. This property leads to particularly simple lattice Boltzmann formulations for two of the three variants, with different treatments of the momentum equation, that are constructed and compared. The formulation that implements the Lorentz force directly, rather than via the Maxwell stress, proves more stable in numerical experiments.},

Reduced-order variational mode decomposition (RVMD) is performed to analyze the vorticity field, indicating that the method can identify the PVS frequency accurately (with 3.42% relative error) and capture large-scale vortex structures that remain intact at the rear of the combustion chamber.

As the equivalence ratio increases, the combustion usually changes from weak to intensive to blow-out mode. The weak combustion has little effect on the flow field, whereas the intensive combustion has the opposite effect. The transition combustion tends to occur between different modes. When the single injector is used, compared with the small-scale combustor, intensive combustion cannot occur in the large-scale combustor, and the flame stability range is also narrower. One probable reason is that as the combustor scale increases, the boundary layer becomes relatively thinner, resulting in a smaller low-velocity zone and a faster mainstream velocity at the downstream wall of the cavity, which is not conducive to the flame propagation upstream to form the intensive combustion. After shortening the isolator, all cases with intensive combustion in the small-scale combustor are transformed into weak combustion, further confirming the speculation. Compared to the single injector, the dual injector is required in the large-scale combustor to achieve intensive combustion and a wider flame stability range.},

Simulations use a new code, Cartablanca++, which is verified using the method of manufactured solutions. Three shock-capturing techniques are compared: artificial viscosity (AV), slope limiting, and subcell finite volume limiting. Three test cases are considered, including a shock tube (one-dimensional), a reflecting shock (two-dimensional), and an inclined cylinder with a hemispherical endcap (three-dimensional). The AV formulation was not robust in the sense that it could not maintain pressure positivity after initialization from freestream conditions in the final three-dimensional test case. The slope and subcell limiters performed well in all simulations. Both techniques robustly captured strong shock waves while still benefiting from the use of high-order polynomials. The targeted application of the slope limiter prevented residual convergence to machine precision, while the subcell limiter could achieve residual convergence. The mixed DG/finite volume formulation, inherent to the subcell limiting scheme, appears sensitive to the inviscid flux function. Future work will consider modifications to reduce this sensitivity. Additionally, modifications to the shock detection techniques would improve performance for both the slope and subcell limiters.},

  abstract     = {In hypersonic near-continuum flows involving diatomic gases, the influence of bulk viscosity (BV) is substantial. This study presents the development and comparative analysis of diverse BV models tailored for calorically complete, thermally complete, and thermally nonequilibrium gas models integrated within the classical Navier–Stokes–Fourier equations. The models exhibited a strong correspondence with the experimental data and other computational results. The effects of BV on the shock structure and flowfield characteristics were studied in detail. The analysis revealed that, in the context of the nitrogen shock structure, the inclusion of BV in the Navier–Stokes (NS) equations leads to density profiles and shock thickness predictions that align more closely with experimental observations and direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) simulations. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that accounting for vibrational excitation in thermally complete gases yields superior results compared to calorically complete gases in terms of shock structure representation. In the case of hypersonic diatomic flow around a cylinder within near-continuum conditions, not only does slip boundary play a role, but the consideration of BV is also crucial for accurately estimating the wall heat flux, frictional resistance, and spatial flowfield distributions, all of which closely resemble the DSMC results. Ultimately, the study concludes that BV expands the applicability of conventional NS equations to a broader range of Knudsen numbers, primarily because of the enhanced capacity of BV to capture nonequilibrium phenomena at the shock interface.},

In order to shed light on the complete transition process, the evolution of a stationary crossflow wave is first simulated. Then, unsteady wall blowing/suction perturbations are introduced to trigger transition to turbulence. The results show that both the type I and III secondary modes are excited, and they subsequently undergo a linear stage of amplification before breakdown. The type II mode is undetected despite its amplification predicted by the two-dimensional eigenvalue stability approach. Overall, the type I mode achieves a dominant amplitude and plays a key role in the transition. Furthermore, a transition correlation method is proposed based on the dominant secondary instability and threshold amplitude concept, and in order to verify and calibrate it, wall perturbations with different amplitudes are introduced to mimic the varying intensities of the background noise. The transition locations predicted by the most amplified secondary mode agree well with those by DNSs, validating the secondary-instability-based criterion for hypersonic crossflow transition.},

The theoretical model of the SCCSs is established by a series of artificial connection and boundary springs. The proposed method’s validity is confirmed through finite element analysis and experimental validation. Nickel-titanium-steel wire ropes (NiTi-STs) are then introduced as a passive vibration control method for the SCCSs. Both circumferential and axial NiTi-ST laying schemes demonstrate good vibration control capabilities on the SCCSs. For similar lengths of NiTi-STs, the vibration control effect of circumferential laying schemes is superior to that of the axial one. Furthermore, the vibration control effect of the circumferential schemes is found to be dependent on the number and positioning of NiTi-STs. The influence of the NiTi-ST structural parameters on the vibration control performance is also analyzed; adjusting the structural parameters appropriately is helpful to improve the vibration reduction effect.},

  abstract     = {Efficient band-structure calculations are essential for understanding the mechanical behaviors of periodic materials, with significant implications in material design and phononic engineering. This paper introduces the application of the improved reduced system (IRS) technique to expedite elastic band-structure calculations. The IRS, a dynamic condensation method, partitions the unit cell degrees of freedom (DOFs) into primary and secondary sets. A strategic selection of primary DOFs retains a subset of interior DOFs alongside all exterior DOFs while truncating the remaining interior DOFs. The integration of IRS with the Craig–Bampton method for additional reduction and the imposition of Bloch boundary conditions yields a notable decrease in computational overhead. Additionally, for structures with a high number of interior DOFs, a substructuring scheme can be implemented to further enhance efficiency. This approach offers a compelling combination of accuracy and expedited computation, making it applicable across diverse periodic materials.},

  abstract     = {Simultaneous design and trajectory optimization aims to find the best possible design of a dynamic engineering system, such as an aircraft, by considering the coupling between a physical system design and its trajectory. Multidisciplinary design optimization (MDO) fully considers this coupling and corresponding design trade-offs. This article discusses the computational efficiency of MDO formulations for design-trajectory optimization. Numerical studies are performed to compare two monolithic MDO architectures and two design-trajectory coupling strategies on aircraft design test problems. The test problems concurrently optimize a climb trajectory, wing design based on a low-fidelity aerostructural analysis, and aircraft sizing variables. The results indicate that surrogate-based coupling is more efficient than direct coupling when there are only a few variables coupling the trajectory and disciplinary models, whereas direct coupling is preferable otherwise. The simultaneous analysis and design (SAND) architecture outperforms the multidisciplinary feasible (MDF) architecture when using direct coupling, whereas the costs of SAND and MDF are comparable with surrogate-based coupling. The results and discussion in this paper provide general guidelines for selecting a computationally efficient approach for simultaneous design and trajectory optimization.},

The reliability assessment model developed in this paper represents a tool that can be used by engineers to harden the system design for operational and economic benefits. To improve the reliability of the system, this work provides a broad review of the different fault detection and diagnosis (FDD) algorithms used for power microgrids and space applications. Using data sets from the Habitat Simulator developed through the NASA-funded Resilient Extraterrestrial Habitat Institute, this paper compares the applicability and accuracy of the different FDD methods. The primary FDD approach proposed and assessed in this work is based on the Markov reliability model. It predicts and detects future faults in the space microgrids by using past data samples and categorizing them into different classes. Data-driven-based models such as artificial neural networks are also investigated, tested, and evaluated using simulation data sets.

  abstract     = {Deep-space habitation presents unique challenges in operating complex control-based systems in distant and disruptive environments far from Earth. The capability to handle unforeseen situations and manage system health is crucial for resilient operations in deep space. Trusted health management strategies operational on the International Space Station (ISS) heavily rely on ground control support. These strategies must adapt to cope with sizable communication delays imposed by the infrastructure limitations or light distances that separate ground control and the habitat. Alternative approaches that increase reliance on artificial intelligence-based onboard autonomy are constrained by limited onboard computing and risks associated with human-system integration. There is an increased need to study the design and architecture of the health management system (HMS) of such complex systems to address autonomy challenges for deep-space habitation. This paper presents a model-based HMS testbed developed at the Resilient Extra-Terrestrial Habitats Institute that is part of the HabSim, a system-of-systems simulator of a smart habitat. The testbed is designed to facilitate performance assessment of critical health management functions essential to enable fault-management autonomy, situational awareness, and interface-based mission control. In this paper, the HMS testbed is motivated and placed within HabSim, the architecture of its components is detailed, and the testbed features are demonstrated through an illustrative example. The lessons learned in developing this testbed that may be useful for others seeking to solve similar problems are also discussed.},

  abstract     = {Extraterrestrial habitats involve a tightly coupled combination of hardware, software, and humans while operating in an unforgiving environment that poses many risks, both anticipated and unanticipated. Traditional approaches with such systems of systems focus on reliability, robustness, and redundancy. These approaches seek to avoid failure rather than reduce overall risk. However, faults are inevitable, and understanding and managing the complex and emergent behavior and cascading events of such a complex system is critical. This study describes the development of HabSim, a computational simulation environment intended to support research to establish the know-how to design and operate resilient and autonomous SmartHabs. HabSim is a modular virtual testbed composed of many of the coupled dynamic systems expected in a typical SmartHab. A heterogeneous set of interconnected physics-based and phenomenological models is used to represent the essential functions of a SmartHab. HabSim further considers disruptions and models damage and repair of certain components. This paper discusses a) system and subsystem requirements of the deep space habitat included in the HabSim platform; b) architectural choices made in response to the requirements; c) technical considerations for developing, verifying, configuring, and executing HabSim; and d) illustrative sample results from a simulation of a representative disruption scenario.},

The simulations quantitatively evaluated the effect of background pressure on the micronozzle performance in nozzle flows ranging up to a throat Reynolds number of 220. The results showed that the background pressure could reduce total thrust by more than 50% as the inverse of the nozzle pressure ratio increases from 0 to . The primary cause identified was the gas depletion created by the collision of the nozzle plume with the background gas, which creates a negative thrust on the wall surface surrounding the nozzle. The trend of the background-gas-pressure effect differed at each Reynolds number. The wall size also affected the thrust in finite background pressure. Furthermore, this study emphasized the critical role of test-facility conditions in accurately predicting the performance of micronozzles and provided the knowledge necessary to properly predict their performance during space operations.},

Results from this study show NO levels higher than equilibrium concentrations, with relaxation timescales that exceed plenum residence times.

This paper develops a three-dimensional trilinear anisotropic immersed-finite-element direct-implicit particle-in-cell (IFE-DIPIC) model to solve the problem of large-scale, long-term evolution plasma with complex interfaces. The model uses the DIPIC method to track the motion of particles in the plasma while simulating the anisotropic electric field containing an interface by using a modified trilinear anisotropic IFE method. Compared to the previous models, the developed model in this paper allows for the use of larger spatial and time steps in the Cartesian meshes without inducing numerical divergence. Using an interface-independent mesh avoids redundant interpolation in the PIC method, further improving efficiency. These advantages significantly improve the efficiency in solving actual complex three-dimensional plasma physics problems. The accuracy, efficiency, stability, and applicability of the proposed model are proved through numerical examples and the application in magnetic sail. The simulation results indicate that the developed model can efficiently simulate the actual working conditions of magnetic sails. The performance is significantly influenced by both the direction and magnitude of the magnetic moment.},

In 2014, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology (JPL/Caltech) initiated a research and technology development effort to advance CubeSat communication capabilities. One of the critical thrusts was the Ka-band parabolic deployable antenna (KaPDA). This antenna started with the ambitious goal of fitting a 42 dB, 0.5 m, 35 GHz antenna in a 1.5U canister. At that time, there had been minimal development in high-gain CubeSat antennas, critical for high-data-rate communications and remote sensing science. A Ka-band high-gain antenna would provide a 10,000 times increase in data communication rates over an X-band patch antenna and a 100 times increase over state-of-the-art S-band parabolic antennas. This paper discusses designing, building, integrating, and operating the flight antenna from a mechanical perspective, its final performance, and lessons learned. KaPDA enabled the RainCube mission, the first Earth Science CubeSat to have an active instrument. RainCube was launched in May 2018, making KaPDA the second deployable parabolic antenna to fly on a CubeSat and the first to operate in Ka-band, enabling follow-on opportunities for high-rate antenna communications and remote sensing science.},

  abstract     = {This paper deals with the analysis of wave propagation characteristics in various prestressed structures with geometric nonlinearities using the Carrera Unified Formulation (CUF). CUF provides a versatile platform to model a wide range of structures and nonlinearities that can take care of all wave propagation aspects. In this work, different geometric nonlinearities for which representative governing equations have been derived and numerical solutions have been obtained through a unified approach are considered. The study investigates in detail the effect of prestress and geometric nonlinearity on wave propagation behavior. The results indicate that prestress has a very influential effect on modal frequency and dispersion characteristics for wave propagation. Specifically, three CUF-modeled beams are considered herein, having a sandwich, metallic portal, and metallic box cross section, respectively. Initially, the principal cross-sectional modal shapes of the unstressed, linear, and full nonlinear (i.e., full three-dimensional Green–Lagrange strain matrix) beam with a prestress are investigated, among which torsional and flexural modes can be recognized. Afterward, the equilibrium curves of such structures for various geometrical nonlinear approximations are traced, highlighting that most types of nonlinearity induce a hardening behavior in the system, which increases with the preload, directly leading to a variation in modal frequencies. The dispersion relations of the full nonlinear structure examined as a function of the applied preload are further compared, enriching the investigation by exploiting wave finite element method capabilities. This knowledge paves the way toward the design and optimization of prestressed systems with enhanced acoustic performance, and that fosters the development of sound absorption, noise insulation, and structural isolation.},

  abstract     = {Displacement-based formulations for composite structures are directly linked to the functional called the Principle of Virtual Displacements and present the minimum number of independent modeled fields, which are the displacements. However, these models usually provide an inadequate approximation of the transverse stress fields and suffer from pathological numerical problems. These issues have been addressed with the introduction of mixed variational formulations where independent stress fields are included in the definition of the corresponding functionals. Particularly effective and widely used are Reissner’s mixed variational theorem and Hellinger–Reissner Principle. Both Reissner’s mixed variational theorem and Hellinger–Reissner principle allow the a priori enforcing of the interlaminar equilibrium because of the axiomatic modeling of the transverse stresses. However, these functionals are different and present their own challenges. Under certain circumstances, Reissner’s Mixed Variational Theorem was shown to produce thickness oscillations of the displacements and transverse stresses. It was not clear if Hellinger-Reissner Principle had similar properties. It is shown that both functionals may present numerical oscillations. Moreover, the reconstructed displacement and stress fields are actually identical between Reissner’s Mixed Variational Theorem and Hellinger-Reissner Principle if the orders of the in-plane stresses of the Hellinger–Reissner Prinicple case are sufficiently large. In other words, a Hellinger–Reissner Principle/Reissner’s Mixed Variational Theorem Limitation Principle is shown to exist in addition to the well-studied limitation principle between Hellinger–Reissner principle and principle of virtual displacements.},

  abstract     = {A framework of physically consistent homogenization and multiscale modeling (PCHMM) for reduced-order analysis of plate/shell structures is developed in this paper. To address the inapplicability of conventional periodic boundary conditions and Hill’s condition involved in homogenization of shear-deformable shell structures, the paper proposes physically consistent boundary conditions and modified Hill’s condition for plate/shells. Unlike the PCHMM method for beams, considering the contradiction between high-order displacement fields induced by shear forces and low-order kinematic assumptions, additional constraints are applied to the plate/shell structure sectional strains during the solution of perturbation fields. The correctness and effectiveness of the proposed plate/shell PCHMM framework and method are verified by typical numerical examples. The proposed theory can also be conveniently embedded into commercial finite element software for homogenization and multiscale analysis of structures such as microscale metamaterials like lattice plates and large complex structures like aircraft fuselage sections.},

  abstract     = {This paper focuses on extending coupled structural–thermal reduced order modeling approaches for the prediction of the nonlinear geometric response of heated structures to efficiently account for temperature-dependent structural and thermal properties. Structurally, a linear dependence of the elasticity tensor and thermal expansion coefficient is assumed consistently with typical material behavior. The resulting structural reduced order model (ROM) equations exhibit polynomials of the temperature generalized coordinates, the coefficients of which are readily identified. A different strategy is proposed for conductance and capacitance properties which typically depend nonlinearly on temperature. It relies on splitting the temperature generalized coordinates into a small set of dominant ones having a nonlinear effect on the ROM conductances and capacitances and a much larger set affecting them linearly. The inclusion of uncertainty in the structural ROM is also addressed extending earlier work limited to temperature independent properties. These strategies are exemplified on a representative hypersonic vehicle panel undergoing a full mission profile and with aero-thermal–structural coupling. The ROM predictions are observed to be very close to the full finite element ones for the mean model. Moreover, an uncertainty analysis demonstrates the strong sensitivity of the response to the structural model in the strongly nonlinear regions of the trajectory.},

This case involves the combustion of ethylene that is injected into a cavity. It has previously been studied experimentally with multiple techniques, including particle image velocimetry, hyperspectral imagining, and laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy, as well as numerically using hybrid Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes/LES. Here, we build on the existing knowledge and provide an in-depth investigation of the flow and combustion using a pure LES approach. A range of fuel injection rates are studied, as well as the nonreacting case. This way we can disseminate how different amounts of combustion and the associated volumetric expansion affect the shear layer above the cavity, the recirculation zone, and the downstream shock train. For example, an additional shock train emerges from the start of the cavity when combustion is present, and it grows in intensity with increasing fueling rate from 50 to 110 slpm. For the cases studied, good agreement is found between the LES and experiments. The primary flow features, such as the shock train, primary and secondary cavity recirculation regions, and shear-layer lift due to exothermicity, are found to evolve similarly with increasing fueling rate in the experiments and the LES. This enables the use of the more complete LES results to further investigate the flow and combustion physics.},

This paper proposed a method to determine the equivalent concentrated loads of liquid rocket engines at main vibration sources using the direct inverse method in the frequency domain. Response verification is performed to confirm the effectiveness of the equivalent loads by assessing the consistency between responses due to them and actual distributed loads. A pumped liquid rocket engine is investigated for specific research. Responses from the hot-fire test are used to identify equivalent loads at three main vibration sources, which are the gas generator, turbine shell, and combustion chamber. The results indicate that the errors in responses induced by the equivalent loads and the actual distributed loads are generally within . To further validate the equivalent loads, an experiment is conducted, scaling and applying the equivalent loads to the rocket engine. The resulting responses, after amplification, align well with those obtained from the hot-fire test, confirming the validity of the proposed method. However, response verification errors escalate significantly when nonprimary sources are included in the equivalent locations.},

This model is built upon the Allen–Cahn equation, incorporating a filtered collision operator and high-order corrections in the equilibrium distribution functions. The numerical model is also integrated with the volumetric boundary scheme and the immersed boundary method to achieve various stationary and moving boundary conditions on arbitrary geometries for different application scenarios. A comprehensive evaluation of this phase-field solver is conducted through a range of academic and industrial cases. First, droplet splashing cases at different Reynolds numbers are studied. The phase-field LB model effectively captures the surface wave motion and splashing of the droplet, although some smearing of small structures is observed due to the diffused interface property of the numerical model. Second, a tuned liquid damper is simulated, accurately capturing sloshing forces on solid walls. In the simulation of a dam-breaking case, predicted gauge pressure and free-surface elevation time histories compare well with experimental data. Lastly, a gearbox case under dip lubrication is simulated, with both the gearbox churning loss and oil distribution being well predicted across a range of rotating speeds. The validation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the present phase-field lattice Boltzmann model in simulating immiscible two-phase flows with large and realistic density and viscosity ratios. The strengths, limitations, and weaknesses of the conservative phase-field LB model are discussed, and suggestions for the development and application of this numerical model are provided.},

Such curved meshes are required for high-order discretizations, but they are difficult to generate and adapt, in particular when anisotropic elements are desired next to curved geometries. To address the problem of possible inversions in this region, the proposed strategy grows prismatic, anisotropic layers of elements close to the geometry, using a metric to dictate the element sizing and starting with a metric-conforming surface mesh. The curvature of the elements attenuates as the layers grow, and the prismatic regions end once linear faces are possible. A linear unstructured mesh fills the remaining portion of the domain, and it is generated using a simple, metric-based advancing-front algorithm. The strategy is implemented in an adaptive solution process by using an existing mesh as a scaffold for metric evaluation. Results are presented for two-dimensional problems in an output-based adaptive setting. Comparisons with global remeshing show similar performance in output convergence, mesh quality, and aspect-ratio distributions and improved robustness and efficiency due to lack of a separate mesh curving step.},

Four types of datasets were used: a) synthetic data, b) simulated data generated using aeroelastic response simulations to stochastic gusts, c) measured data from a wind tunnel experiment, and d) flight test data including actual flutter onsets.

In this paper, a high-dimensionnal optimization method incorporating linear embedding subspaces of small dimension is proposed to efficiently perform the optimization. An adaptive learning strategy for these linear embeddings is carried out in conjunction with the optimization. The resulting BO method, named efficient global optimization coupled with random and supervised embedding (EGORSE), combines in an adaptive way both random and supervised linear embeddings. EGORSE has been compared to state-of-the-art algorithms and tested on academic examples with a number of design variables ranging from 10 to 600. The obtained results show the high potential of EGORSE to solve high-dimensional blackbox optimization problems, in terms of both CPU time and the limited number of calls to the expensive blackbox simulation.},

This framework simultaneously leverages exploration and exploitation without the need to know a priori which strategy is best fitted to the problem at hand. In this work, we first improve SoftFEM by replacing the original differential evolution by the so-called success-history-based adaptive differential evolution. The developed framework is then applied to optimize the aerodynamic performance of 1) an airfoil, 2) a wing, and 3) the fluid–structure interaction problem of an airfoil with a flexible trailing edge. In the first two cases, the open-source computational fluid dynamics code OpenFOAM is considered to evaluate the aerodynamic characteristics of the airfoil, while in the latter case, we combine OpenFOAM and MuPhiSim—our recently released open-source code for computational solids mechanics—to conduct fluid–structure interaction simulations. The results demonstrate that this approach can effectively find optimal solutions with improved aerodynamic performance in all three cases. The proposed framework has the potential to significantly impact the design and optimization of aerodynamic systems in complex design spaces. In particular, new systems involving soft components and soft–hard junctions would benefit from a seamless application of the developed framework to their optimization.},

To reduce the training samples and improve the global geometric generalization ability, the Euler equation embedding double-series residual neural network (ED-ResNet) is presented. Firstly, the wall inviscid solution is approximated to the information of the boundary layer outer edge by solving the Euler equation. Then, based on the principle of feature construction, the physical features of the boundary layer outer edge can be constructed. Finally, the double-series residual neural network (D-ResNet) is employed to establish the aerothermal model by using physical features of the boundary layer outer edge as input data. The physical features of the boundary layer outer edge are the bridge between the Euler equation and D-ResNet; it has a prior ability to distinguish the quality of generalization. The performance of the proposed ED-ResNet is validated using hypersonic double-ellipsoid, hypersonic ellipsoid, and blunt cone. The results indicate that with only four training samples, ED-ResNet can obtain high-precision aerothermal extrapolation prediction results with an error of less than 7% relative to Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes calculation results. Meanwhile, the ED-ResNet can successfully predict aerothermal loads for unknown geometric shapes, with a global geometric generalization error less than 13%.},

This paper presents a novel design method that integrates the recently introduced internal conical flow M (ICFM) basic flowfield (Musa et al., “New Parent Flowfield for Streamline-Traced Intakes,” AIAA Journal, Vol. 61, No. 7, 2023, pp. 2906–2921) with the pressure-corrected osculating axisymmetric flows and streamline tracing techniques. The new design method takes into account the effects of lateral pressure gradients by incorporating pressure corrections into the original design method using crossflow velocity information from the ICFM flowfield. Additionally, new entrance and throat profiles are introduced for designing two hypersonic internal waverider intakes with shape transition. One intake is designed using the new method, and the other using the original method. Viscous simulations have been performed at design (i.e., Mach 6.0) and off-design (i.e., Mach 4.0 and 3.5) conditions. The results indicate that the pressure-corrected intake exhibits superior performance in terms of total pressure recovery and reduced flow distortion. This reveals that the new design method can achieve a smooth shape and efficient aerodynamic transitions between the intake entrance and throat. The new entrance and throat profiles realized better performance than the typical ones. The startability analysis reveals that the Van Wie curve controls the considered intakes. Thus, combining the pressure-corrected osculating axisymmetric flows with the ICFM flowfield enhances the performance of hypersonic intakes, making this approach a promising avenue for future hypersonic vehicles.},

  abstract     = {This work develops an efficient real-time inverse formulation for inferring the aerodynamic surface pressures on a hypersonic vehicle from sparse measurements of the structural strain. The approach aims to provide real-time estimates of the aerodynamic loads acting on the vehicle for ground and flight testing, as well as guidance, navigation, and control applications. Specifically, the approach targets hypersonic flight conditions where direct measurement of the surface pressures is challenging due to the harsh aerothermal environment. For problems employing a linear elastic structural model, the inference problem can be posed as a least-squares problem with a linear constraint arising from a finite element discretization of the governing elasticity partial differential equation. Due to the linearity of the problem, an explicit solution is given by the normal equations. Precomputation of the resulting inverse map enables rapid evaluation of the surface pressure and corresponding integrated quantities, such as the force and moment coefficients. The inverse approach additionally allows for uncertainty quantification, providing insights for theoretical recoverability and robustness to sensor noise. Numerical studies demonstrate the estimator performance for reconstructing the surface pressure field, as well as the force and moment coefficients, for the Initial Concept 3.X (IC3X) conceptual hypersonic vehicle.},

  abstract     = {A unified least-squares Petrov–Galerkin (LSPG) framework for projection-based model order reduction featuring three different approximation manifolds [affine manifold, quadratic manifold, and nonlinear manifold built using a deep artificial neural network (ANN)] is presented. Its performance was assessed for a variable-speed version of the double-cone hypersonic benchmark problem. First, a high-dimensional viscous computational fluid dynamics model (HDM) was constructed, verified, and validated. The dimensionality of the HDM was then reduced using LSPG, each of the aforementioned approximation manifolds, and a global right reduced-order basis trained in the range . Each resulting global projection-based reduced-order model (PROM) was hyper-reduced and transformed into a hyper-reduced PROM (HPROM). The accuracy of each constructed HPROM was assessed for various quantities of interest and contrasted with that of snapshot interpolation. For this purpose, three different error measures were considered and discussed in the context of shock-dominated problems. Wall-clock and CPU time speedup factors are reported. Overall, it was shown that using a relatively small set of training data, all constructed LSPG HPROMs were nonlinearly stable, real-time capable, and highly predictive. The LSPG HPROM constructed using a nonlinear approximation manifold and an ANN was the most computationally efficient.},

  abstract     = {The chemical reaction and cold wall effects in hypersonic reacting turbulent boundary layers (HRTBLs) cause the failure of the existing wall function method. Therefore, this paper proposes an improved wall function method to simulate skin friction and wall heat flux in HRTBLs accurately and efficiently. Firstly, the temperature–velocity relation is extended to a generalized enthalpy–velocity relation to comprehensively involve the chemical reaction and cold wall effects. Then, a new unified velocity law of the wall for the inner layer of HRTBLs is theoretically derived. Finally, an improved wall function method is designed with the new laws of the wall. Numerical experiments of typical HRTBLs show that, compared with the existing wall function method, the improved wall function method can significantly reduce the errors of and from 8.0% and 10.2% to 0.4% and 0.5%, respectively, when the near-wall grids are relaxed to the viscous sublayer, while from 11.0% and 15.3% to 1.2% and 5.8%, respectively, when the near-wall grids are further relaxed to the logarithmic layer, bringing 2.7 and 15 times enhancement of the simulation efficiency. Moreover, by introducing the reference point, the improved wall function method removes the boundary layer edge quantities while ensuring accurate results.},

  abstract     = {A one-equation transition model is proposed for high-speed transitional flows. The model is based on the amplification-factor-transport framework and involves only one transport equation for the amplification factor of streamwise instabilities. A new algebraic intermittency factor is established and applied to a turbulence model to predict transition, and the model is tested by applying it to several cases over a wide speed range. Comparisons with linear stability theory and available experimental data indicate that the model handles first- and second-mode-induced transitions in supersonic and hypersonic flows and reasonably captures the effects of Mach number, wall-to-edge temperature ratio, and nose bluntness. The new one-equation model offers reduced computational burden and simpler implementation while retaining a reasonable prediction accuracy.},

  abstract     = {During atmospheric entry, super-/hypersonic vehicles cross distinct atmospheric layers characterized by large density variations and thus experience different flow regimes ranging from free molecular, transition, slip, to continuous regimes. Due to the distinct modeling strategy between these regimes and complex physical phenomena appearing near the vehicles (boundary-layer/shock interaction, base-flow recirculation, etc.), assessing their aerodynamic properties may be difficult. The present work focuses on supersonic flows around sharp-base geometries in both continuous and slip-flow regimes and aims at highlighting the influence of both rarefaction degree and base geometry on the vehicles’ aerodynamic features. For this purpose, three axisymmetric cone-cylinder geometries with right-angled, rounded, or flared rear parts are considered. Flow visualization, pressure, and drag measurements are carried out at Mach number and Knudsen numbers ranging from to in the supersonic rarefied MARHy wind tunnel. The experimental data are compared with numerical results of simulations performed with a continuous-flow Navier–Stokes solver and two rarefied flows codes: a discrete-ordinate Bhatnagar–Gross–Krook solver and a direct simulation Monte Carlo (SPARTA) solver. While the solver overestimates frictional drag as rises, the rarefied and SPARTA results show satisfactory agreement with experimental data. The latter numerical results highlight the main effects of rarefaction: as increases, shocks become more diffuse, skin friction strengthens (leading to a significant increase in drag coefficients), and the extent of the base-recirculation decreases. Regarding the aft-body geometry, its influence on the base recirculation vanishes with increasing .},

  abstract     = {This paper examines the application of Gauss’s principle of least constraint to the classical problem of the lift of a two-dimensional airfoil in ideal, incompressible fluid flow, including the role of the empirical Kutta condition that determines the airfoil circulation in classical theory. Gauss’s principle demonstrates that the fluid pressure field consists of two components: a constraint pressure field that enforces the continuity and nonpenetration constraints and an impressed pressure field of arbitrary strength that satisfies but does not influence any constraints. The analysis shows that a flow solution that minimizes the difference between the acceleration and the impressed pressure gradient is a valid solution of Euler’s equation. Furthermore, Gauss’s principle proves that ideal potential flow airfoil theory is incomplete and that a first principles closure condition cannot exist within potential flow. This reaffirms the view that an external, empirical condition is needed to complete classical airfoil theory, i.e., the Kutta condition. The paper also investigates and disproves a new variational theory of lift developed from Hertz’s principle of minimum curvature that is claimed to provide a closure condition based on first principles to replace the empirical Kutta condition of classical airfoil theory.},
