Considering a variety of soft and hard requirements with respect to the tracking performance, disturbance rejection, robustness, and stability of the controlled system, a multi-objective optimization problem is formulated to optimize the controller gains and filter time constants. In addition to utilizing linear models, high-fidelity nonlinear models are employed in the optimization to ensure that the optimization results account for nonlinear effects like sensor errors, vibrations, absolute, and rate limits. Furthermore, a detailed investigation into the influence of the proposed lead–lag filter is conducted, demonstrating the advantages of the additional degrees of freedom in the controller tuning. The optimized controller is assessed in both simulation and flight tests, showcasing compelling performance in reference tracking and disturbance rejection while complying with all robustness requirements.},

The guidance process consists of two stages: the plane pursuit stage and the coplanar cooperative stage. In the first stage, a circling-plane-constrained enclosing guidance (CPCEG) law is developed to control UAVs to circle the target in the specified circling plane. The CPCEG law contains an encircling guidance command for steering UAVs to circle the target and a plane pursuit command based on sliding mode theory for driving UAVs to reach the specified plane. In the second stage, a cooperative enclosing speed controller is designed based on the phase angle kinematics within the circling plane and allows the UAVs to enclose the target with desired angular intervals between each other. The stability of the proposed system is theoretically proven, and various numerical simulations are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method.},

In particular, an extended Kalman filter is used to estimate errors between the in-flight atmospheric density and the atmospheric density used to generate the guidance trajectory. This information is leveraged within a model predictive control strategy to improve tracking performance, reduce control effort, and increase robustness to actuator saturation compared to the state-of-the-art approach. The estimation and control framework is tested in a Monte Carlo simulation campaign with historical space weather data. These simulation efforts demonstrate that the proposed framework is able to stay within 100 km of the guidance trajectory at all points in time for 98.4% of cases. The remaining 1.6% of cases were pushed away from the guidance by large density errors, many due to significant solar storms and flares, that could not physically be compensated for by the drag control device. For the successful cases, the proposed framework was able to guide the deorbiting spacecraft to the desired location at the entry interface altitude with a mean error of 12.1 km and 99.7% of cases below 100 km.},

The proposed method is based on using differential algebraic techniques to construct the high-order Taylor expansions of complex functions. Initially, a clustering strategy for the mega Walker constellation is introduced. The orbits of all satellites within the constellation are analytically represented using high-order orbital expansion models derived from a selected number of nominal satellites. Subsequently, utilizing these high-order orbital expansion models, the high-order expansion of the visibility function corresponding to the nominal target is constructed, which can provide an analytical approximation of the visibility function between any satellites and targets within the cluster. The calculation of rise and set times is simplified to polynomial operations. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves high prediction accuracy across various payload types. Furthermore, the computational efficiency is significantly enhanced for large-scale coverage analysis missions that involve mega constellations.},

We present how to obtain its exact convex relaxation based on the concept of supporting hyperplane. A convex relaxation of the original problem is obtained by equivalent convexification of the dynamics and relaxing a nonlinear equality constraint. To make the convex relaxation exact, our contribution lies in proposing a method of replacing the objective function by a parameterized one and achieving exactness of the convex relaxation by iteratively updating one parameter. This innovative method is inspired by finding an appropriate supporting hyperplane to support the feasible set at the solution of the original problem. Based on the proposed method, we can design an algorithm to very efficiently find the solution of the original problem, and convergence is theoretically ensured. The proposed method can be readily extended to missions with obstacle avoidance constraints, where such constraints are simply linearized. We can design a double-loop algorithm, which has very robust convergence, to find minimum-time collision-free trajectories. Numerical examples are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness and high efficiency of the algorithms.},

This paper proposes a systematic, robust trajectory design method, where quantitative information concerning uncertainty on the system dynamics and stochastic navigation errors are directly accounted for in the mission-planning process. A linear feedback control law is designed to steer the probability distribution of the spacecraft state toward a target distribution at an assigned final time, minimizing the propellant consumption while guaranteeing robustness to disturbance and uncertainties. A hybrid multiple-shooting approach is adopted, where the mean trajectory and the open-loop controls are optimized according to a multiple-shooting scheme, while a single-shooting scheme is adopted for propagating the first two statistical moments of the spacecraft state distribution. The proposed approach is applied to the analysis of the nominal interplanetary transfer phase of the future JAXA mission DESTINY+. The final dispersion on the state is expected to be reduced by a few orders of magnitude, with a small increase in fuel consumption.},

Additionally, our focus is on formulating a rapid and computationally efficient approach to enhance speed without compromising accuracy. The investigation begins with a comprehensive analysis of the fundamental components of the method, particularly the sensitivity terms and the computation of feedback gains, with a comparison of alternative formulations to evaluate their relative computational efficiency. Subsequently, the application of this methodology to the target problem is thoroughly examined with an a priori performance index and characterized to reach the most efficient formulation, through the introduction of the idea of dominant sensitivities. Case-dependent modifications are explained and implemented to improve the methodology performances, resulting in the introduction of the marginal DOC coefficient, and the results are critically compared against those obtained using conventional methods through an extensive Monte Carlo analysis campaign.},

Intermediate models selectively introduce perturbations associated with specific frequencies, enabling a systematic assessment of their influence on dynamic structures. This study conducts an extensive numerical investigation across cislunar space to complement the hierarchy and evaluate the suitability of various intermediate models. A total of six intermediate models, rendering (quasi-)periodically forced systems within the common frame, are analyzed. The numerical analysis examines key CR3BP structures, including Lagrange points and periodic orbits, and compares their counterparts in the intermediate models and the HFEM. Frequency-domain analysis is leveraged to assess capabilities and limitations of each model. The findings supply a criterion for selecting appropriate intermediate models, improving i) the characterization of perturbations inherent in higher-fidelity models and ii) transitions between models within the cislunar domain.},

  abstract     = {Operations in proximity of minor bodies demand high levels of autonomy to achieve cost-effective, safe, and reliable solutions. Autonomous path-planning capability plays a pivotal role in this, allowing safe operations in challenging environments. A goal-oriented path-planning methodology is presented here based on repeated trajectory refinement via sequential convex programming. The objective of the approach is to refine an initial guess trajectory to best observe a set of features on the target surface with specific observation requirements while respecting physical and operational constraints. Maneuvering epochs are imposed on a given time horizon to satisfy ground-station requirements, and their magnitude is limited by control capability. Navigation and control uncertainties are taken into account to obtain a robust solution within a modular and flexible implementation framework. The methodology is applied to the case of proximity operations about the Eros asteroid. Results of Monte Carlo analyses are performed with a given set of observation requirements, showing an 80% convergence rate with large improvements in observation capability even starting from a poor initial guess. Overall, this work presents a step toward goal-oriented autonomous guidance capability for small-body proximity operations.},

  abstract     = {Navigation systems for human-rated space vehicles are typically required to be two-fault tolerant. This paper presents an optimal relative orientation of multiple orthogonal three-axis inertial measurement units in order to maximize fault detection capabilities. The optimality criterion is the entrywise one norm of the matrix mapping measurement or estimate errors into the fault detection vector. This choice of norm maximizes the projection of each measurement or state error into all components of the fault detection vector. Other matrix norms based on spectral decomposition are shown to be inadequate. A new formulation of the multiplicative extended Kalman filter is derived and used to validate the optimal arrangements. The filter uses measurements from one three-axis gyroscope for model propagation and fuses measurements from additional redundant gyros and a star tracker with Kalman updates. Fault detection and isolation are performed with a Cramer–von Mises goodness-of-fit test using a buffer of stored prefit measurement residuals. It is shown that the faulty gyro axis can be isolated with greater certainty when the optimal arrangement is used.},

Unlike the Kalman filter, the MCE models its additive measurement and process noises as Cauchy distributed rather than Gaussian. Due to its complexity, the initially introduced MCE was limited to small-dimensional problems running for short time horizons. In this paper, we propose several enhancements to the MCE algorithm, which, when used collectively, yield a fast and robust multivariate estimation algorithm for linear and nonlinear dynamic systems of a moderate state-space dimension. These contributions allow, for the first time, the MCE to be tested in linear and nonlinear estimation applications.

However, this introduces the complex but crucial transition flight phase, which is not yet well understood regarding aerodynamics and flight dynamics. To better understand the aircraft’s dynamic behavior within this flight regime, this paper analyzes the longitudinal tilt-wing transition, considering various operational strategies for the maneuver. The analysis is based on an optimal control approach where the dynamic control problem is transcribed into a nonlinear programming problem. The developed framework allows for successfully exploring different transition strategies by adapting constraints and objective functions. Compared to the results of static trim analyses, the phenomena of transition folds are attenuated in the dynamic investigation due to inertial effects. Furthermore, the backward transition maneuver from cruise to hover flight proves to be more challenging from a flight physics perspective because of high effective angles of attack and requires upward motion if flow separation is to be avoided.},

The desired flight path and heading angles of the quadrotor are proposed as functions of the bearing angle information of the four vertices of the window. These angular guidance inputs employ a bearing angle bisector term and an elliptic shaping angle term, which directs the quadrotor toward the centroid of the window. Detailed stability analysis of the resulting kinematics demonstrates that all quadrotor trajectories lead to the centroid of the window along a direction that is normal to the window plane. A qualitative comparison with existing traversal methodologies showcases the superiority of the proposed guidance approach with regard to the nature of information, computations for generating the guidance commands, and flexibility of replanning the traversal path. Realistic simulations considering a six-degree-of-freedom quadrotor model and Monte Carlo studies validate the effectiveness, accuracy, and robustness of the proposed guidance solution. Representative flight validation trials are carried out using an indoor motion capture system.},

  abstract     = {In deep space exploration missions involving lunar flybys, to ensure the successful execution of the lunar gravity assist (LGA), one or more trajectory correction maneuvers (TCMs) are typically required before the perilune. The concept of singularity suggests that targeting future states either requires a significant amount of maneuvering or cannot be calculated within a finite iteration time. To mitigate the high computational costs associated with TCMs determined via the differential correction method, it is essential to analyze the singularity of the Lambert problem in the lunar flyby. This study demonstrates that the singularity of the Lambert problem in Keplerian orbits exhibits transferability in lunar flybys under the three-body model by using the Lagrange coefficients and pseudostate theory. This transferability is validated through the determinant theory of the state transition matrix (STM), which is further extendable to other three-body systems. Furthermore, this study elucidates the applicability of singularity in lunar flybys under the three-body model through numerical simulations in both prograde and retrograde motions, considering different arguments of perilune. These derivations and simulations establish criteria for assessing singularity, facilitating the rapid identification of positions associated with high maneuver costs. The conclusions drawn from this study have been validated using the ephemeris model. It is shown that it is possible to preemptively circumvent singularities and enhance the robustness of the guidance algorithm in practical lunar flyby missions.},

In this work, we turn toward amortized optimization, a learning-based technique for accelerating optimization run times, and develop Trajectory Optimization with Merit Function Warm Starts. Offline, using data collected from a simulation, we train a neural network to learn a mapping to the full primal and dual solutions given the problem parameters. Crucially, we build upon recent results from decision-focused learning and develop a set of decision-focused loss functions using the notion of merit functions for optimization problems. We show that training networks with such constraint-informed losses can better encode the structure of the trajectory optimization problem and jointly learn to reconstruct the primal-dual solution while yielding improved constraint satisfaction. Through numerical experiments on a lunar rover problem and a 3-degree-of-freedom Mars powered descent guidance problem, we demonstrate that Trajectory Optimization with Merit Function Warm Starts outperforms benchmark approaches in terms of both computation times and network prediction constraint satisfaction.},

This is achieved by considering both flyby and rendezvous missions. Drawing inspiration from previous research using low-thrust propulsion, this work focuses on time-optimal missions, applying optimal control theory to achieve reasonable transfer times. The formulation relies on continuous guidance control, employing an indirect method derived from Euler–Lagrange variational equations and Pontryagin’s minimum principle.

  abstract     = {This paper proposes an integrated midcourse-terminal guidance methodology for a trailing pursuer in a Shoot-Shoot-Look scenario. We consider the case of a pursuer implementing given standard guidance laws for the midcourse and terminal phases. These engagement stages are separated by a predefined decision time, at which the pursuer allocation is determined. The pursuer’s position and heading at the decision time, referred to as a handover point, is optimized with respect to a tradeoff between the expected miss distance and control effort. Since the pursuer uses known given guidance laws, the handover point is the only optimization parameter of the problem. We propose a computationally efficient approach to evaluate the performance index online for a set of candidate decision points sampled from the pursuer’s reachable set at the end of the midcourse stage. Specifically, for the terminal phase, we develop the performance index representation using a limited number of sensitivity functions, which relate to variations in initial conditions and evader maneuver and can be computed offline. This terminal phase cost evaluation procedure is applicable for a class of linear time-varying systems with a quadratic cost. The proposed methodology is exemplified for minimum-time midcourse trajectories and proportional navigation terminal guidance law.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a numerical optimization algorithm for generating approach and landing trajectories for a six-degree-of-freedom (6-DoF) aircraft. We improve on the existing research on aircraft landing trajectory generation by formulating the trajectory optimization problem with additional real-world operational constraints, including 6-DoF aircraft dynamics, runway alignment, constant wind field, and obstacle avoidance, to obtain a continuous-time nonconvex optimal control problem. Particularly, the runway alignment constraint enforces the trajectory of the aircraft to be aligned with the runway only during the final approach phase. This is a novel feature that is essential for preventing an approach that is either too steep or too shallow. The proposed method models the runway alignment constraint through a multiphase trajectory planning scheme, imposing alignment conditions exclusively during the final approach phase. We compare this formulation with the existing state-triggered constraint formulation for runway alignment. To solve the formulated problem, we design a novel sequential convex programming algorithm called extrapolated penalized trust region that extends the penalized trust-region algorithm by incorporating an extrapolation step to expedite convergence. We validate the proposed method through extensive numerical simulations, including a Monte Carlo study, to evaluate the robustness of the algorithm to varying initial conditions.},

Here, we consider control strategies with a level of decentralization such that they do not require hardware and software modifications when assembling multiple modules together irrespective of how they are connected. To this end, we present two strategies: the first does not require the knowledge of the configuration of the assemblage, while the second, which offers better performance, includes identifying the configuration automatically during the takeoff phase of the flight. We discuss the control allocation associated with both strategies, as well as the configuration identification algorithm employed in the second strategy. Experimental analysis, including conducting flight tests, validates the efficacy and performance of the presented control strategies.},

  abstract     = {The Koopman operator theory provides a global linearization framework for general nonlinear dynamics, offering significant advantages for system analysis and control. However, practical applications typically involve approximating the infinite-dimensional Koopman operator in a lifted space spanned by a finite set of observable functions. The accuracy of this approximation is the key to effective Koopman operator-based analysis and control methods, generally improving as the dimension of the observables increases. Nonetheless, this increase in dimensionality significantly escalates both storage requirements and computational complexity, particularly for high-dimensional systems, thereby limiting the applicability of these methods in real-world problems. In this paper, we address this problem by reformulating the Koopman operator in tensor format to break the curse of dimensionality associated with its approximation through tensor decomposition techniques. This effective reduction in complexity enables the selection of high-dimensional observable functions and the handling of large-scale datasets, which leads to a precise linear prediction model utilizing the tensor-based Koopman operator. Furthermore, we propose an optimal control framework with the tensor-based Koopman operator, which adeptly addresses the nonlinear dynamics and constraints by linear reformulation in the lifted space and significantly reduces the computational complexity through separated representation of the tensor structure.},

These operator norms can be used to understand the performance and range of applicability of an algorithm exploiting linear approximations in different sets of coordinates. We examine uses of tensor operator norms in the context of linear and higher-order rendezvous guidance and to present a unified treatment of nonlinearity indices for dynamic systems. Tensor norm computations can offer insights into these problems in one to two orders of magnitude less time than similarly accurate sampling methods while providing more general understanding of the error performance of linear or higher-order approximations.},

This work introduces a novel hybrid soft–rigid space manipulator system (HSMS), which integrates a tendon-driven continuum manipulator with a traditional rigid robot. A strain parameterization technique known as geometric variable strain (GVS) is employed to derive a closed-form, minimum-order dynamic model of the HSMS by leveraging the principle of virtual work. Thrusters and variable-speed control moment gyros are incorporated to activate the spacecraft base and enhance the realism of the description. Two inverse-dynamics control designs are then proposed: one to bring the system to rest from a nonzero momentum condition and another one to track a three-dimensional trajectory in the end-effector task space. Extensive numerical simulations validate both the dynamic model and the proposed controllers, demonstrating the potential of the proposed HSMS concept for advanced space-manipulation tasks.},

In contrast to previous surveillance-evasion games, the pursuer is agile in the sense of being able to instantaneously change the direction of its velocity vector, while the evader is constrained to have a finite maximum turn rate. Both the game of kind, concerned with conditions under which the evader can escape, and the game of degree, concerned with the evader seeking to minimize the escape time while the pursuer seeks to maximize it, are considered. The game-of-degree solution is surprisingly complex compared to solutions to analogous pursuit-evasion games with an agile pursuer because it exhibits dependence on the ratio of the pursuer’s speed to the evader’s speed.

The work in this paper is motivated by the premise that each satellite has more reliable knowledge of its own state compared to its direct observations of others. The authors aim to leverage this shared, enhanced information among satellites to enable autonomous coordination and collision avoidance. They rely on multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) to model multiple autonomous satellites interacting in a shared environment with limited observation and communication ranges. First they demonstrate the effectiveness of their method against comparable MARL algorithms. To address the computational expense of MARL, they investigate the effectiveness of transferring a model trained on a ground environment to one trained in space. Despite the fact the two environments have very different dynamics, they show that the transfer learning model outperforms a model that is trained directly on the space environment. Furthermore, even in the presence of additional perturbations, the authors’ transfer learning model is able to accelerate training and achieve comparable rewards. With the effectiveness of their method explored, they then evaluate the benefits of information sharing by studying collision rates and path planning. Their results indicate that sharing maneuver information leads to lower collision rates and more efficient path planning.},

  abstract     = {Center manifold theory describes the phase flow near collinear libration points as a combination of two harmonic oscillations and one hyperbolic motion, the latter driving exponential spacecraft divergence. The Floquet modes approach (FMA), based on Floquet theory, is widely studied but suffers from inefficiency due to its inability to suppress nondivergent components (NDCs) beyond the unstable motion. To overcome this limitation, we propose an improved FMA strategy that leverages the collateral effect of NDCs—a key factor in traditional FMA failures yet exploitable for enhanced control. First, a predictor–corrector algorithm computes a correction factor to refine unstable mode estimation, accounting for unmodeled nonlinearities. Next, the most critical NDC is identified and suppressed, the timing of the next maneuver is predicted, and a maneuver overshoot factor is introduced to regulate excessive NDCs. By strategically selecting maneuver types, our approach ensures effective suppression. Finally, three numerical simulations validate the method’s effectiveness, versatility, and robustness.},

  abstract     = {This paper develops the mathematical framework to use higher-order state transition tensor (STT) approximations of nonlinear dynamics to design impulsive spacecraft maneuvers incorporating the effects of state uncertainty. Several semi-analytic formulations are derived strictly as a function of a reference STT expansion, including minimum-energy, minimum-covariance, and maximum-covariance cost functions; mean state constraints; state chance constraints; and control-linear maneuver execution errors. Analytical gradients are derived for most of the formulations, which can be used to speed up optimization procedures developed with these equations. A tractable approximation of the nonlinear covariance propagation equations is also derived to further speed up these calculations. Example applications for each of the formulations are provided for a multi-impulse, highly nonlinear transfer in the Earth–moon system. The proposed methodology can be used to efficiently compute a variety of maneuvers accounting for the effects of spacecraft state uncertainty using a single STT expansion. This can enable more flexible and rapid maneuver planning in reaction to changing mission priorities, navigation errors, and maneuver execution errors.},

  abstract     = {Aerocapture leverages atmospheric drag to convert a spacecraft’s hyperbolic trajectory into a bound orbit. For some aerocapture missions, heating due to the radiation of high-temperature gases in the shock layer can be much larger than the heat due to convection. This paper provides analytical proof and numerical validation that radiative heat load is minimized by the same trajectory that minimizes the final : a single switch bang-bang trajectory, starting with lift-up. The proof is general and is valid for several formulations of radiative heat flux; further, the same proof can be used to conclude that convective heat load, computed according to many of the available formulations, is instead maximized by that trajectory. Further, a novel guidance that plans a bang-bang trajectory with constraints in the attitude kinematics is introduced. While achieving performance similar to that of the current state-of-the-art, the inclusion of constraints in attitude kinematics allows for much less tuning. Finally, a lateral guidance that makes use of information on the final inclination of the predicted trajectory is introduced. Such guidance allows for very high accuracy in the inclination requirements with only two reversals by requiring a single parameter to be tuned.},

In Auto-SCvx, the authors solve a sequence of convex subproblems until convergence to a solution of the original nonconvex problem. This method iteratively optimizes dual variables in closed form in order to update the penalty hyperparameters used in the primal variable updates. A benefit of this method is that it is autotuning and requires no hand tuning by the user with respect to the constraint penalty weights. Several example hypersonic reentry problems are posed and solved using this method, and comparative studies are conducted against current methods. In these numerical studies, our algorithm demonstrates equal and often improved performance while not requiring hand tuning of penalty hyperparameters.},

  abstract     = {Autonomous on-orbit assembly operations are usually translated into complex optimal control problems requiring advanced methods to solve. Solved through either direct methods or indirect methods, these optimal control problems are known to be highly sensitive to the initial guess provided to the solver. This paper proposes an algorithm to reduce the problem’s sensitivity to the initial guess by integrating the continuation method and the notion of reinforcement learning. To this end, a continuation space is formed from a trivial problem with a known solution to the desired optimal control problem. A set of continuation parameters, selected from the state, control, or constraint variables, forms the basis for this continuation space. Finding a suitable continuation path is problematic since it requires a comprehensive search algorithm that considers several factors, such as the choice of continuation parameters and continuation steps for each parameter, to find an appropriate path. To search for this path, a reinforcement learning search agent was proposed based on the Sarsa method to traverse the continuation space in real-time for a continuation trajectory satisfying some desired criteria. Numerical experiments were conducted for a series of autonomous on-orbit assembly operations using robotic spacecraft to demonstrate the capability of the proposed technique. Various simulations with different reward functions showed that the shape and size of the objects in the assembly environment affect the solver’s performance.},

A transformer neural network model is trained to detect these keypoints and estimate the 6D pose of each part. The estimates are integrated using Bayesian fusion. The model is tested on synthetic data and in situ flight experiments, demonstrating robustness and accuracy in various lighting conditions. The position estimation error is approximately 0.8 and 1.0% of the distance to the ship for the synthetic data and the flight experiments, respectively.

Those methods may require the online computation of the pseudoinverse of the control effectiveness matrix, which results in a significant computational load using the standard singular value decomposition (SVD). This paper presents the decomposition, a variant of the Cholesky decomposition, as a viable replacement for the SVD in CA. The decomposition is known to be computationally less expensive while being numerically unstable. This study evaluates a nonpivoted, a pivoted, and a rank-1 update algorithm and demonstrates their implementability according to coding standards. The results show that the developed -based algorithms are applicable for full-rank and rank-deficient input matrices while reducing the computational effort significantly. Despite the theoretically inferior numerical properties, the -based algorithms reach the same level of precision as the SVD for real-world applications such as a multicopter, a cyclocopter, and a transition electrical vertical takeoff and landing vehicle.},

The proposed algorithm treats the uncertainty propagation problem by separating the propagation of the uncertainty in the initial conditions and static model parameters from that of the process noise. The first two types of uncertainty are propagated using an adaptive Gaussian mixture model method that exploits a low-fidelity dynamical model to minimize the computational costs. The effects of process noise are instead computed using the polynomial algebra stochastic moments analysis technique, which considers a high-fidelity model of the stochastic dynamics. The main focus of the paper is on the latter and on the key idea to approximate the probability density function of the solution by a polynomial representation of its moments, which are efficiently computed using differential algebra techniques. The two estimates are finally combined to restore the accuracy of the low-fidelity surrogate and account for all sources of uncertainty. The proposed approach is applied to the problem of nonlinear orbit uncertainty propagation and its performance compared to that of Monte Carlo simulations.},

  abstract     = {Solving constrained optimal control problems (OCPs) is essential to ensure safety in real-world scenarios. Recent machine learning techniques have shown promise in addressing OCPs. This paper introduces a novel methodology for solving OCPs with path constraints using physics-informed neural networks. Specifically, Pontryagin neural networks (PoNNs), which solve the boundary value problem arising from the indirect method and Pontryagin minimum principle, are extended to handle path constraints. In this new formulation, path constraints are incorporated into the Hamiltonian through additional Lagrange multipliers, which are treated as optimization variables. The complementary slackness conditions are enforced by ensuring the zero value of the Fischer–Burmeister function within the loss functions to be minimized. This approach adds minimal complexity to the original PoNN framework, as it avoids the need for continuation methods, penalty functions, or additional differential equations, which are often required in traditional methods to solve path-constrained OCPs via the indirect method. Numerical results for a fixed-time energy-optimal rendezvous with various path constraints and a constrained optimal rocket ascent demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in solving path-constrained OCPs.},

  abstract     = {Aeroassisted maneuvers, including aerocapture, aerobraking, and aeroassisted orbital transfers, represent a novel method for orbital maneuvers due to their significant low-fuel advantages in reducing orbital energy. This paper proposes a unified trajectory optimization method based on sequential convex optimization for multipass aeroassisted maneuvers. We initially reconstruct a new independent variable to reduce the dimensionality of dynamics. This new variable not only overcomes the potential non-monotonicity issues associated with traditional energy-based independent variables but also significantly enhances the convergence of sequential iterations. For the nonconvex nonlinear equality constraints posed by interior point connection conditions and endpoint maneuvers, we propose a relaxation strategy based on an adaptive rectangular trust region, ensuring feasibility during iterations. Additionally, to enhance the relaxation factors for convergence and ensure the activation of bank angle constraints under multiple constraints, we introduce a dynamic adaptive penalty strategy, ensuring the algorithm’s adaptability across multiple scenarios. Furthermore, we establish feasibility criteria and initial trajectory generation strategies to maximize the autonomy of the trajectory optimization. Simulation analyses using lunar return and Mars exploration missions demonstrate the effectivity of the proposed method and validate its strong robustness across varying initial orbits (spanning hyperbolic orbit to medium orbit).},

  abstract     = {As low-thrust space missions grow in prevalence, it is becoming increasingly important to design low-thrust trajectories with robustness against unforeseen thruster outages or missed thrust events. Accounting for such anomalies is particularly important in chaotic multibody systems, such as the cislunar realm, where pertinent dynamical structures constrain the dynamical flow. Yet it remains unclear how these dynamical structures influence robust trajectory design. This paper provides the first comprehensive statistical comparison between nonrobust and robust trajectories in relation to the invariant manifolds of resonant orbits in a circular restricted three-body problem. For both the nonrobust and robust solution categories, the optimal subset exhibits stronger alignment with the invariant manifolds, whereas the broader feasible set can sometimes deviate significantly. On average, the robust optimal trajectories shadow the invariant manifolds as closely as the nonrobust optimal trajectories and, in some instances, exhibit even stronger alignment than their nonrobust counterparts. By maintaining proximity to these invariant manifolds, the robust low-thrust solutions are able to efficiently leverage the global dynamical flow to achieve optimality even under operational uncertainties.},

  abstract     = {This paper introduces an aircraft contingency landing planner that assures safe road-based emergency landings by coordinating air and ground traffic with a vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) datalink. Suitable roads within the reachable footprint are extracted from a geographical database and evaluated initially based on road width, live weather, and live traffic flow. Then, a landing trajectory is planned for the road with the highest total utility, ensuring a safe road landing by requesting ground traffic allocate space on the road with the V2V link. Initial landing site utilities are augmented by aircraft landing trajectory metrics, including integrated population density under the landing path, minimum path length constraint derived from assured road landing, and gliding angle. Initial altitude and traffic speed impacts on potential landing sites and assured landings are investigated. A use case in Long Island, New York, is presented in simulation with connected ground traffic and a gliding Cessna 182 aircraft that has experienced loss of thrust. Results confirm analytically obtained safety constraints and illustrate a safe road landing sequence in dense traffic initially moving at normal speeds. We provide a computational cost analysis for this use case, with 71 potential landing sites processed in 300 ms on a laptop computer.},

These assumptions are unsatisfactorily limiting for some missions, like a starshade mission, since the starshade’s attitude will inherently vary from the configuration corresponding to Hamiltonian dynamics. This paper presents the derivation of the equations of motion for the CR3BP with SRP that permit the application of the Lindstedt–Poincaré method such that approximate solutions are produced, which may serve as trajectory design tools. Examples of periodic orbits and manifolds corresponding to three sets of attitude angles are shown, and the accuracy of their ninth-order approximations is considered.},

  abstract     = {Existing aerocapture predictor–corrector guidance algorithms apply significant simplifications to the problem in order to reduce the computational complexity involved in the control plan correction phase. Such simplifications include using a reduced set of equations of motion, exclusion of path constraints, the use of parametric control profiles, and the requirement of separate lateral logic to determine the bank-angle direction. This work presents an advanced predictor–corrector aerocapture guidance algorithm based on sequential convex programming, which enables the inclusion of system-level constraints, namely, peak aerodynamic loading and convective heat load, and eliminates the need for a lateral-logic law while maintaining a feasible level of computational expense. The developed algorithm is dubbed the “convex predictor–corrector aerocapture guidance” (CPAG) algorithm. CPAG’s performance is compared to the state-of-the-art fully numerical predictor–corrector aerocapture guidance (FNPAG) algorithm for aerocapture at Neptune, Mars, and Earth. Monte Carlo analyses indicate that CPAG produces similar in-plane requirements and improved out-of-plane requirements relative to FNPAG. Additionally, CPAG is able to enforce aerodynamic and aerothermodynamic constraints, even in the presence of uncertainty, while FNPAG is unable to do so. Finally, the use of an energy-based apoapsis targeting expression that can account for perturbations from nonspherical gravitational fields is presented, and its predictions for the required in-plane are compared to standard Keplerian expressions. The energy-based expression for targeting an apoapsis radius relaxes the Keplerian motion assumption and improves the accuracy in predictions by almost 25%.},

Given a nominal stable or unstable manifold, the mapping between the periapsis parameters and the initial state deviation is first derived using state-transition tensors (STTs). A distance-based STT is proposed to mitigate the impact of the duration from the periodic orbit to the smaller primary, thus enhancing the mapping accuracy. Then, the reachable set of periapsis radius and inclination is determined within a feasible region of initial states, of which the boundary is defined by the extremum of periapsis radius and the extremum of inclination with fixed periapsis radius. These extrema are determined through a series of optimization problems with the derived optimal necessary and sufficient conditions. Finally, the proposed method is applied to calculate the reachable set from Halo orbits. Numerical simulations show that the computation for a reachable set is efficient. The relative errors of the periapsis radius and the inclination for a single reachable set are within 3.64% and within 1% for the reachable set from a Halo orbit.},

Different from a complete information game, a pursuer needs to plan effective pursuit strategies by estimating the evader’s trajectory and considering its dynamic characteristics in orbital games with incomplete information. A novel control strategy using the parameter-optimized method is developed to address the orbital pursuit problem with incomplete information. First, this paper establishes a new extended system state containing parameters that characterize the evasion strategy. The unscented Kalman filter is employed to estimate the evader’s control weighting matrices represented by these parameters. Second, leveraging the trajectory according to the evader’s strategy, a parameter-optimized control method based on the receding horizon framework is introduced to design a pursuit strategy. The method comprehensively considers maneuvering capacity and mission requirements. In each interval, a parameter-optimized method aided by the Light Spectrum Optimizer enables the pursuer to approach the evader more quickly when the maneuvering capacity is adequate. Finally, simulation results validate the effectiveness of the algorithm in estimating the evader’s strategy information and enhancing pursuit efficiency.},

  abstract     = {The detection and estimation of spacecraft maneuvers, when the effects of that maneuver are not seen until after it occurs, are critical to ensuring the safety and efficacy of space traffic management and domain awareness. In this study, a new method is shown to determine the time, direction, and magnitude of small impulsive spacecraft maneuvers using a sequence of ground observations. The approach combines adaptive estimation techniques with relative linear models to provide recursive maneuver estimations. The nominal state of the spacecraft is perturbed and propagated forward in a particle-like filter manner, based on multiple-model adaptive estimation, using different assumed maneuvers until the time of each new observation. Maximum likelihood is used to provide an estimate of the time of the actual maneuver and enables subsequent estimation of the direction and magnitude of the maneuver. The forward propagation is enabled by state transition matrices, which allow the efficient propagation of large numbers of particles. The results are demonstrated for two different cases: a near-Earth case where Keplerian concepts can reduce computations by leveraging closed-form solutions and a general case presented through a cislunar scenario. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in the presence of measurement noise and process uncertainties and show potential for applications in both spacecraft operations and space domain awareness.},

However, it is still a challenge to design a fully distributed, stability-guaranteed control method for cooperative rendezvous. To address this issue, this paper proposes a distributed control method for an unmanned vehicle cooperative rendezvous mission. First, the cooperative rendezvous process is formulated as an optimal control problem. To decentralize the control framework, a rendezvous parameter is introduced, and the rendezvous parameter optimization algorithm is designed to guarantee the terminal rendezvous of autonomous vehicles while improving the system performance. On this basis, a distributed control framework, based on rendezvous parameter optimization, generates the control commands to achieve cooperative rendezvous.

  abstract     = {The potential use of tethered autogyros as energy-efficient low-altitude surveillance systems calls for control and stability analysis of autorotative flight. A control-oriented dynamic model of a tethered multirotor autogyro, introducing the flapping degree of freedom of each blade, is developed in this paper by combining the Lagrangian approach, blade element momentum theory, and catenary mechanics. The resulting model is hybrid in the sense that the aerodynamic forces are three dimensional, whereas the autogyro is constrained to move within the vertical plane. The assumption that roll and yaw motions can be controlled by lateral rotors in the full three-dimensional extension facilitates detailed dynamic modeling while limiting the number of states. The equations of motion are numerically solved, and equilibrium characteristics are explored. The trends of equilibrium data are consistent with existing results in the literature. Simulation results show that a two-loop feedback controller based on a novel regenerative differential rotor braking technique is effective in controlling the autogyro’s pitch angle and altitude while using the restoring force from the tether. To further substantiate the efficacy of the proposed controller, this paper presents a stability analysis of the system.},

  abstract     = {This paper introduces an innovative approach to landing guidance for reusable launch vehicles. With the consideration of aerodynamic forces, it is very challenging to solve the Earth landing guidance problem. Although predictor–corrector methods have demonstrated remarkable efficiency and reliability in various guidance problems considering aerodynamic forces, the complexity arises in the launch vehicle landing scenario because three control variables are involved: thrust magnitude, angle of attack, and sideslip angle. To mitigate this complexity, this paper employs the biased proportional navigation law to transform the angle of attack and sideslip angle into functions of the states, thereby reducing the control variables to a singular one-thrust magnitude. Subsequently, the theoretical analysis establishes fuel-optimal ignition time (the initiation of the powered descent phase) and thrust magnitude profile, allowing parameterization of the remaining one control variable with a single adjustable parameter. This results in a low-complexity algorithm that only involves one-parameter root-finding problems, conducive to real-time implementation in embedded computers. Numerical examples are provided to demonstrate the high performance of the proposed landing guidance algorithm.},

  abstract     = {Addressing the challenge of intercepting high-speed and highly maneuvering endoatmospheric targets, this paper dissects the issue into two components: the command direction and the magnitude design of the interception guidance law. For the former, through geometric and algebraic analysis, an optimal command direction is determined for the generalized differential geometric guidance law. This direction not only satisfies the constraint that the command acceleration vector is perpendicular to the velocity, but also meets the requirement of countering target maneuvers by maximizing the projection of the command acceleration along the line-of-sight normal. For the latter, tackling the matter of nonconvergence in zero-effort-miss (ZEM) due to high-speed engagements and significant target maneuvers, a fixed-time-convergent relative error dynamics (FxT-RED) method is proposed. This method introduces the relative error quantity and refines the parameters form, in turn, offering benefits, i.e., fewer parameters, a more accurate upper bound on the settling time, and stable convergent behavior of the relative error. Incorporating both, an optimal-command-direction guidance law with FxT-RED is designed, which ensures the ZEM convergence before terminal time, despite various target maneuver disturbances, validated by the theoretical proof and numerical simulations.},

This paper proposes a concept of effective planetary flyby (EPF) to investigate the dynamical mechanism of low-energy or low-speed flyby orbits in the Sun-planet planar circular restricted three-body problem. A simple and efficient decomposition method for the EPF motion is presented to elaborate details of the flyby process, such as the revolution and trend of the flyby orbit, and then six subsets for EPF motion in the phase space are obtained. A qualitative analysis uncovers that the energy variation of the low-energy flyby is strongly related to its orbital trend. This result finds that two kinds of EPF motions cannot only achieve significant energy variation but also orbit the planet-satellite system with at least one full revolution. Finally, the above results are applied to design interplanetary transfers from the Earth orbit to the Saturn orbit through a low-energy Jupiter flyby.},

  abstract     = {Continuation methods are used in numerous applications that focus on generating families of periodic orbits with common topology and characteristics, rather than achieving single disjoint trajectories. However, they work by sequentially tracking parameters associated with the system as they vary, thus creating a solution path. This study proposes a nonsequential hybrid method to compute families of resonant periodic orbits traversing total bifurcations of types 1 and 2 in the planar circular restricted three-body problem, including members with arbitrary proximity to the secondary that preserve both the intrinsic resonance of the family and its topology. A thorough description of the development is given, which combines the theory of generating orbits with an analytical asymptotic approximation of resonant orbits. Unification is achieved numerically by incorporating a two-stage differential correction scheme that modulates the minimum distances to the secondary of the closest approaching orbits. Families are constructed orbit-by-orbit simultaneously. The operation of the hybrid method is illustrated with the exterior 5:9 and 6:7 resonant families in the Jupiter–Europa system. The mechanism of type 1 bifurcations is further explored to analyze the impact of family approximation geometries to the singularity on the nonlinear physical behavior in the nearest orbits.},

The highly efficient sequential convex programming (SCP) is a potential method to address this issue, but its convergence is difficult to guarantee. To enhance the convergence performance of SCP, this paper proposes a high-dimensional merit-function-based SCP method. The main contribution of this paper is threefold. Firstly, the traditional one-dimensional penalty function used to ensure the convergence of SCP is extended to a high-dimensional merit function, which avoids using the penalty parameter that is difficult to determine in advance. Secondly, to match the high-dimensional merit function, a feasibility-then-optimality convergence strategy is proposed, which is essentially an application of the iterative direction descent property in higher dimensions. Finally, based on the high-dimensional merit function and the feasibility-then-optimality strategy, an iterative algorithm is developed, and its convergence analysis is provided under certain assumptions. In numerical simulations, the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed algorithm are validated using the reentry trajectory optimization problem of a lunar capsule.},

  abstract     = {Optical measurements are widely used in orbit determination (OD) during the approach phase of an asteroid exploration mission. Optical-only OD suffers from range ambiguity, leading to poor OD performance. This paper proposes a method to improve optical-only OD performance using vision-based range (VBR) measurements. The proposed method does not rely on prior knowledge about the shape or size of the asteroid. The proposed method first calculates the asteroid’s area projected on the image, with which the ratios of ranges from spacecraft to asteroid between different epochs are obtained. Then, VBR measurements are constructed by multiplying the range ratios and the previous range estimations. A linear programming algorithm is developed to filter noises and improve the accuracy of VBR measurements. Additionally, as the VBR measurement relies on both current and previous states, expressions of the covariance are derived to handle the time-series dependency of VBR measurements, which can improve the accuracy and uncertainty quantification capacity. Finally, optimal estimations are obtained using both the angle and VBR measurements in a Kalman filter framework. The proposed method’s performance is validated in the approach phase of the Bennu asteroid. Numerical simulations show that the estimation accuracy and convergence are improved by approximately 37%.},

The necessary higher-order sensitivities are obtained through a computationally tractable, derivative-free approach, where a least-squares process is adopted to calculate said sensitivities for the TPBVP in a prescribed domain of interest. A nonproduct quadrature scheme, the conjugate unscented transform, is used to compute the multidimensional integrals necessary for the least-squares procedure.

  abstract     = {To reliably localize and control planetary rovers, their controllers must keep the wheels away from traction loss. In this paper, a fast traction control system for rovers is developed that tracks dynamic trajectories, leveraging their redundant control directions. Trajectory-tracking performance is guaranteed by stabilizing an input–output linearized nonholonomic model of the system. A novel methodology is proposed to determine the control actions that optimally distribute the tractive forces among the wheels without affecting the tracking performance. The methodology uses the knowledge of wheels’ friction coefficients and estimation of normal and tractive forces based on a nonholonomic rover model. The novelty is in redefining the optimization problem in both lateral and longitudinal directions, which requires minimum information about wheel–ground interactions and leads to linear optimality conditions. The notion of required force/moment at the rover’s center of mass is proposed to define reference directions for tractive forces and isolate fighting wheels whose tractive forces are suppressed by finding suboptimal control actions. The proposed traction control system is implemented on a six-wheel rover modeled after the Lunar Exploration Light Rover, and its efficacy against the conventional pseudo-inverse solution is demonstrated in a software-in-the-loop simulation environment of hard frictional ground using Vortex Studio.},

The inner loop employs a deep neural network as a predictor to accurately forecast the impact angle, and a reinforcement learning algorithm serves as a corrector that generates a biased guidance command to eliminate the impact angle error. The outer loop uses a nested neural predictor–corrector that considers the inner loop command as the baseline guidance command to address the constraint on impact time.

The design of transfer trajectories between these two kinds of orbits remains a challenge due to their stability. In this study, a novel transfer pathway from DROs and ROs is constructed based on a search and optimization methodology, which could offer an alternative for mission design related to these two orbits. Two-impulse transfers for both planar and nonplanar cases are designed in the circular restricted three-body problem, and three types of transfer orbits are obtained and characterized, including the direct transfer, the lunar gravity assisted transfer, and the external transfer. Planar transfers are also refined in the bicircular restricted four-body problem in consideration of the solar gravity. Furthermore, representative transfer orbits are transitioned into the ephemeris model to validate the preliminary design, and the result indicates that the transfer cost fluctuates with different departure epochs for all types of transfers.},

  abstract     = {This paper illustrates the development, implementation, and testing of full-body haptic and spatial audio cueing algorithms for augmented pilot perception, where haptic cueing is based on localized electrical muscle stimulation. Cueing algorithms are developed for roll-axis compensatory tracking tasks where the pilot acts on the displayed error between a desired input and the comparable vehicle output motion to produce a control action. The error is displayed to the pilot using multiple cueing modalities: visual, haptic, audio, and combinations of these. For the visual and combined visual haptic/audio modalities, visual cues are also considered in degraded visual environments (DVEs). Full-body haptic and spatial audio algorithms that are based on a proportional-derivative compensation strategy on the tracking error are found to provide satisfactory pilot–vehicle system (PVS) performance for the task in consideration in absence of visual cueing and to improve PVS performance in DVE when used in combination with visual feedback. These results are consistent with previous studies on the use of secondary perceptual cues for augmentation of human perception. The combination of these results indicate that the use of secondary sensory cues such as full-body haptics and spatial audio to augment the pilot perception can lead to improved and partially restored PVS performance when primary sensory cues like vision are impaired or denied.},

First, the Lagrangian coherent structures (LCSs) are used to generate the interior transit orbits. The number of periapses around the moon is selected as the classification parameter and is mapped into the LCSs. Clear classification boundaries are achieved using a data-mining approach. Then, the dependence of the classification on energy levels and solar gravity perturbation is discussed and summarized. Based on these classifications and their dependencies, strategies for constructing two low-energy transfer scenarios are proposed. The effectiveness of these strategies is confirmed through numerical simulations of the transfer trajectories. The dynamic behaviors and transfer characteristics of transit orbits and their families are revealed, and a direct link between transit-orbit families and low-energy transfers is established.},

This paper discusses the powered descent guidance and associated guidance and control effects for the terminal descent phase of the SLIM lander. Minimizing propellant consumption was essential for its guidance and control. Large trajectory correction capability, consideration of a thrust-pointing constraint, and subsurface flight avoidance were also necessary. To do this, we modeled the guidance sequence in three subphases: free fall, followed by horizontal position correction with maximum thrust by the maximum tilt angle under a thrust-pointing constraint, and vertical braking with maximum thrust. The guidance problem was then converted to a parameter-finding problem with only a few unknowns. This modeling ensured SLIM’s robustness against initial state errors, fast runtime, and smooth convergence. The end-to-end results from conceptualization to in-flight validation can bridge theory and practice in guidance and control for lunar and planetary landing missions.},

These collisions can pose negative effects, such as harming the robotic arm and causing the EE to move away from the target, significantly increasing the risk of mission failure. Existing research demonstrated that implementing active collision control can effectively mitigate these negative effects. This paper proposes a new one-dimensional collision control method named force-feedback compliance resistance control (FFCRC) to regulate the collision process in capturing tasks. Compared to existing methods, FFCRC has three primary advantages: the first is that it simultaneously achieves two critical control objectives, reducing the maximum contact force and preventing separation; the second is that FFCRC does not rely on prior knowledge, such as target inertial parameters and contact parameters, significantly facilitating the approach’s implementation; the third is that FFCRC exhibits better adaptability to varying environmental conditions, eliminating the need for control parameter tuning. We proved the effectiveness of the FFCRC method through theoretical analysis. To apply this method in the three-dimensional capture missions of space robots, an FFCRC-based control scheme is introduced. Numerical simulation results demonstrated the effectiveness and robustness of this control scheme across various capture scenarios.},

  abstract     = {High-inclination orbits around planetary moons often suffer from short lifetimes due to multiple perturbations. This paper proposes a novel methodology to achieve long-lifetime, high-inclination orbits around planetary moons. The methodology is based on the doubly averaged dynamics considering the nonspherical gravity of the moon and the third-body perturbation from the planet. A semi-analytical formulation for the estimated orbital lifetime is developed. With the maximization of the orbital lifetime as the objective, a nonlinear programming model is established and solved to obtain optimal initial conditions. Then, a numerical scheme, which is based on the golden-section search and the differential correction, is proposed to map the obtained initial conditions back to the unaveraged system, i.e., to the osculating elements. The effectiveness of the proposed methodology is demonstrated through its application to orbit design around several different planetary moons, and the underlying mechanism enabling long-lifetime orbits is also revealed. Results prove that the initial conditions yielding the longest orbital lifetimes reside on stable manifolds of equilibrium points, i.e., the frozen orbits. Moreover, some comparisons indicate that the proposed methodology can obtain significantly extended orbital lifetimes compared to those reported in prior studies.},

The controls of the HCM under investigation are the angle of attack and the fuel flow of the scramjet engine. When fuel is burned, the angle of attack is strictly restricted under the engine’s limitations. Therefore, a novel control relation is introduced, allowing for a broader range of admissible angle-of-attack values during non-fuel-burning periods. Our analysis primarily examines two methods. The first is based on a vanishing constraint formulation, which implies that the control set is nonconvex and the linear independence constraint qualification is invalid. The second method employs an extended variable time transformation (VTT) approach to reformulate the problem. The advantage of the VTT formulation in terms of convergence to an optimal solution is demonstrated using a simplified problem. Finally, we present a comparison of both formulations for the range maximization problem of the HCM, highlighting the merits of the VTT method.},

  abstract     = {The aerothermal load on an aerospace vehicle is one of the most critical conditions during hypersonic flight. To maximize performance, a typical hypersonic vehicle rides the maximum allowable value of the heating-rate constraint during a portion of its flight. Because atmospheric density has high uncertainty, guiding a hypersonic vehicle along a deterministic optimal trajectory will violate the maximum heating-rate limit with an unacceptable probability. To address this problem, we pose the maximum heating rate on the vehicle as a chance constraint in a tychastic trajectory optimization problem (from Tyche, the Greek goddess of chance). To generate a tractable problem formulation, the chance constraint is mapped to a constraint on a deviation measure of the heating rate. The resulting tychastic problem is transcribed to a constrained unscented trajectory optimization problem and solved by a guess-free, spectral algorithm. The validity of the entire approach is independently verified via a Monte Carlo analysis. Sample numerical results demonstrate how risk can be reduced from unsafe (i.e., 70% risk) to safe (i.e., near 0% risk) operations.},

This formulation is motivated by the fact that analytical and/or approximate solutions to aerospace control problems generally are significantly easier to compute compared to corresponding optimal trajectories for the same boundary conditions. Moreover, numerical methods for computing indirect optimal control solutions often greatly benefit from having an initial guess that is “close” to the optimal solution. For this reason, it is often desirable to produce a quickly computable approximate solution that can bootstrap an optimal control solution process. Salient to note here is that using an approximate solution as an initial guess for an indirect optimal control solver requires the user to find the appropriate initial costate values corresponding to the previously known control history, which is generally a nontrivial problem itself. The proposed algorithm provides a systematic framework for addressing this initial costate generation hurdle together with strong convergence properties. The methodology is applied and illustrated for a wide array of benchmark control problems.},

  abstract     = {As satellite constellations grow in size, there is an increasing need for autonomous, scalable, and real-time dynamic task assignment to address the unique operational challenges of such distributed systems. In particular, a time-varying task assignment (i.e., for observing various regions of Earth) often means that the corresponding satellite has to reorient itself or its sensors, costing time and energy. However, most assignment algorithms for area requests proposed in the literature do not account for the significant cost associated with task handover in satellite constellations. In this paper, we develop a framework for solving the seemingly non-deterministic polynomial-time (NP)-hard problem of optimal dynamic task allocation while minimizing task handover. In particular, we develop Handover-Aware Assignment with Lookahead (HAAL), an algorithm with centralized and distributed variants, and solutions that provably achieve 50% of the optimal value. We then proceed to show that HAAL significantly outperforms similar heuristic methods proposed in the literature for realistic constellation experiments with up to a thousand satellites. The algorithm scales polynomially in the number of satellites/tasks and offers a smooth tradeoff between computational efficiency and performance, allowing the designer to tune the algorithm based on available computing resources, communication bandwidth, and required performance.},

Curvature and path length characteristics of the Lamé curve paths are analyzed, and conditions are deduced for the Lamé-curve-based circumscription of rectangular boundaries. Given the maximum turn rate capability of the UAV, a comparative study highlights significant reduction in path length as compared to the widely used elliptic circumscription. In conjunction with the desired Lamé curve path, a vector field guidance method is proposed for path-following. The vector field around the path is generated using a commanded heading angle, which encapsulates a tangent vector along the path and an arcsine shaping function of the UAV position error with respect to the desired path. Asymptotically converging behavior of the UAV position error is ascertained, and simulation studies illustrate the accurate following of the desired path for arbitrary UAV initial conditions. Indoor experimental studies utilizing a quadrotor UAV platform present the practical applicability of the proposed surveillance guidance solution.},

Eight participants performed compensatory tracking tasks with time-varying vehicle dynamics, where, at an unpredictable moment during a run, a sudden degradation in dynamics could occur. They were instructed to push a button when they detected a change in dynamics. Two methods to automatically detect the moment when pilot adaptation occurs from online estimated parameter traces are discussed. Results show that pilots are more accurate in detecting changes than either algorithm. But when the algorithms are correct, they are often quicker to detect pilot adaptation than pilots themselves. The presented techniques have potential but need improvements.},

A constant-speed unicycle agent using the proportional navigation guidance law is required to approach a given final configuration from the initial one while minimizing a quadratic cost functional that includes terminal miss, heading error, and control effort. The approach is based on the pursuit of an externally transmitted sequence of stationary or moving virtual targets, in which the initialization parameters are periodically updated at fixed times. The problem of finding the parameters of the virtual targets is reduced to an equivalent discrete-time optimal control problem of a particular structure. In one particular case, this problem was reduced to a linear–quadratic optimal control problem, which can be solved using a Riccati procedure. The obtained solutions were shown to outperform the intuitive waypoint guidance, in which the waypoints were sampled from the linear–quadratic optimal solution, whereas the solution using moving virtual targets was close to the full optimal solution for a wide range of boundary conditions.},

One challenge inhibiting wider adoption of autonomous distributed systems is online navigation capabilities, which may not be as accurate as non-automatons systems which leverage powerful ground-based sensors. To bolster online navigation estimates, a spacecraft may maneuver to alter the sensing geometry within the distributed system and view new information. This work focuses on the study of optical-only navigation within a distributed space system and develops two analytical guidance policies that minimize relative range uncertainty. The first policy is a heuristic that is derived from a geometric analysis, and the second is an analytic solution to a surrogate cost function. The guidance policies are simulated in cislunar space and shown to closely approximate the true nonlinear solution. Additionally, the analytic guidance policy is combined with station keeping to reduce operational maneuvers.},

The proposed algorithm uses both absolute and relative pose measurements between neighboring satellites in a network, allowing each individual satellite to estimate its own pose and that of its neighbors. By utilizing the distributed Kalman consensus filter, a novel sensor and state-estimate fusion procedure is proposed that allows each satellite to improve its own state estimate by sharing data with its neighbors over a communication link. A leader–follower approach, whereby only a subset of the satellites has access to an absolute pose measurement, is also examined. In this case, followers rely solely on the information provided by their neighbors, as well as relative pose measurements to those neighbors. The algorithm is tested extensively via numerical simulations, and it is shown that the approach provides a substantial improvement in performance over the scenario in which the satellites do not cooperate. A case study of satellites swarming an asteroid is presented, and the performance in the leader–follower scenario is also analyzed.},

T-PDG uses data from prior runs of trajectory optimization algorithms to train a transformer neural network, which accurately predicts the relationship between problem parameters and the globally optimal solution for the powered descent guidance problem. The solution is encoded as the set of tight constraints corresponding to the constrained minimum-cost trajectory and the optimal final landing time. By leveraging the attention mechanism of transformer neural networks, large sequences of time series data can be accurately predicted when given only the spacecraft state and landing site parameters. When applied to the real problem of Mars-powered descent guidance, T-PDG reduces the time for computing the 3-degree-of-freedom fuel-optimal trajectory when compared to lossless convexification, improving solution times by up to an order of magnitude. A safe and optimal solution is guaranteed by including a feasibility check in T-PDG before returning the final trajectory.},

  abstract     = {The accuracy of predictor–corrector entry guidance algorithms relies heavily on the accuracy of the onboard atmospheric density model. Existing approaches, such as fading-memory filters, assume a constant bias in the density profile from the current state in the entry trajectory to the terminal condition which does not capture the geospatial variation of atmospheric density. In this work, a deep-learning approach to estimate atmospheric density profiles for use in planetary entry guidance problems is developed. A long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network is trained to learn the mapping between measurements available onboard an entry vehicle and the density profile through which it is flying. Measurements include the spherical state representation, Cartesian sensed acceleration components, and a surface-pressure measurement. Training data for the network are initially generated by performing a Monte Carlo analysis of an entry mission at Mars using the fully numerical predictor–corrector guidance (FNPEG) algorithm that uses an exponential density model, while the truth density profiles are sampled from MarsGRAM. An iterative curriculum-learning procedure is developed to refine the LSTM network’s predictions for integration within the FNPEG algorithm. The trained LSTM is capable of accurately predicting both the density profile through which the vehicle will fly and reconstructing the density profile through which it has already flown. The performance of the FNPEG algorithm is assessed for three different density estimation techniques: an exponential model, an exponential model augmented with a first-order fading-memory filter, and the LSTM network. Results demonstrate that using the LSTM model results in an order of magnitude increase in terminal accuracy compared to the other two techniques when considering both noisy and noiseless measurements.},

  abstract     = {Phase space distributions outline regions of plausible spacecraft states in phase space given some degree of uncertainty. Under Hamiltonian dynamical flow, geometric features of these distributions become time-invariant and are referred to as Hamiltonian integral invariants. The shape and size of the distributions are correlated to our state uncertainty, so these geometric invariants provide unique, analytical insight into problems of uncertainty propagation. When a Hamiltonian system is perturbed by dissipative forces, the geometric features associated with integral invariants are no longer constant. Rather, they change in time, and the insight into problems of uncertainty propagation also changes. This paper explores how the geometric features of phase space distributions can be targeted with orbital and attitude guidance laws. For example, volume-collapsing guidance laws are designed to restrict both the translational and rotational spacecraft state. Alternative representations for regions of uncertainty are also considered via Monte Carlo and covariance matrix analysis. With these alternative representations, the targeted geometric behavior is validated.},

The trim law enables the aircraft to recover balance quickly after damage, while the adaptive control allocation algorithm reconfigures the remaining control surfaces of the aircraft so that it can track commands.

In-flight controllable morphing was achieved, significantly elevating the mission flexibility and environmental adaptability of the Compound Flexible Multibody Aircraft. A multibody dynamics model with 10 degrees of freedom is developed, and a modified control allocation strategy is proposed to enhance morphing control capability. The control structure placing the configuration controller and the overall attitude controller in parallel is developed to simultaneously guarantee the morphing and trajectory control task. Finally, a successful morphing flight test is implied, in which the configuration commands are determined according to the attainable configuration envelope. This paper presents a control method for compound flexible multibody aircraft that accommodates varying numbers of connections and provides solutions for the stable flight and aerodynamic morphing of such aircraft, expanding their usage and offering insights for the control of more general flexible aircraft.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we discuss an extension of the original Bode integral theorem to multi-input–multi-output (MIMO) continuous-time systems, without relative degree assumption. This result was recently derived by the first author. Literature search revealed that a similar formulation was developed prior and published as a draft paper in online archives. That formula was similar but not the same as presented in this paper. Nevertheless, both expressions show that the Bode sensitivity integral for a MIMO system can be written as a difference between the plant open-loop and closed-loop eigenvalues, irrespective of the system loop gain relative degree. The revised expression for the Bode integral gives further insights into sensitivity shaping and presents an alternative expression when compared to the previously known extensions. In that regard, we present derivations of the revised Bode integral formula for MIMO systems and demonstrate Bode theorem implications for flight control. Specifically, we design, analyze, and simulate a dynamic output feedback baseline controller with direct adaptive augmentation using the problem motivation from the Inaugural IEEE Bode Lecture “Respect the Unstable,” presented by Dr. Gunter Stein in 1989. For numerical illustration purposes, we will use the X-29A aircraft models and subsystems data from a NASA technical report.},

Such tests make possible the identification, based on input/output measurements, and, in turn, the fine tuning of aeroservoelastic-system mathematical models that would serve as a basis for designing control laws for flutter suppression and for a variety of other active control tasks, such as gust alleviation and ride comfort improvement. Such tests, however, are dangerous, costly, and, in many cases, not possible. This paper presents a safe wind-tunnel and flight-test technique in which, out of an array of multiple control surfaces, some are used, via closed-loop control, to generate deliberate instabilities of desired nature as well as desired dynamic characteristics of an aeroservoelastic system to be studied, whereas other control surfaces are used for the development of the active control technology required to meet active control targets for the resulting systems.},

To obtain higher-fidelity solutions, a variable-specific-impulse variable-thrust (VIVT) solar electric propulsion (SEP) system subject to solar power and duty-cycle constraints is considered. We also consider both regularized and nonregularized formulations of the indirect methods. We use an L2-norm-based regularization for smoothly embedding discontinuous events (e.g., throttle-control and power-input switches) to form a multiparameter family of smooth Hamiltonian boundary-value problems (BVPs), which are solved through a numerical continuation method. The solution to the regularized BVP is then used to initialize and solve an event-detection-based, nonregularized BVP. For the direct method formulation, a forward-shooting scheme is proposed with the introduction of an important power constraint to avoid overestimation of the performance of the VIVT SEP system. Two minimum-fuel interplanetary trajectories are solved with over 300 duty-cycle-driven thrust switches. The results of the both indirect and direct methods are compared. Initialized by the regularized solution, the nonregularized solution results in a noticeable improvement in the final mass value over the regularized indirect method and compared to the solutions obtained from the direct method.},

  abstract     = {High-precision and fast-response attitude control of launch vehicles plays an increasingly important role in numerous space launch missions, ensuring the efficiency of space transportation. However, disturbances caused by liquid sloshing and external environments degrade the control performances seriously. Because of the complicated coupling with control inputs and angular acceleration, the dynamics of liquid sloshing disturbance are highly uncertain. Therefore, it is urgent to develop novel disturbance estimation methods for launch vehicles by thoroughly analyzing disturbance dynamics. In this paper, an observer-based predefined-time attitude control method aimed at achieving precise and rapid estimation of liquid sloshing disturbance and other external disturbances is proposed. More specifically, a prescribed-time reduced-order state observer is proposed for estimating the liquid sloshing disturbance and the unmeasurable system state, leveraging the specific characteristics and inherent coupling relations of liquid sloshing disturbance. Additionally, a prescribed-time extended state observer is introduced for estimating external disturbances and nonlinear terms. Subsequently, by employing a predefined-time output feedback controller, a composite control law is proposed to enhance the antidisturbance capabilities of rigid–liquid coupled launch vehicles. Finally, simulation examples are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

This paper presents a control synthesis method for a hypersonic vehicle with the purpose of guaranteeing robust stability during flight testing when accurate analytic vehicle models are unavailable. Conventional model-based approaches typically rely on curve fitting of numerical simulation and test data, which can introduce inaccuracies. Our proposed approach assumes knowledge of the linear form of the ordinary differential equation and uses quadratic constraints to bound sampled data that accounts for the nonlinear and uncertain portion of the model for controller synthesis by iteratively solving convex semidefinite programs. A numerical example demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed method is performed before applying the technique to a nonlinear hypersonic vehicle found in the literature. Using the synthesized stabilizing controller, we demonstrate that the vehicle states remain within a certified bound given a known harmonic excitation when initiated from a quantified set of allowable initial conditions. Based on these simulation results, our proposed control synthesis method shows promise in ensuring robustness when performing hypersonic vehicle flight testing.},

Despite most encounters happening over very short time frames, some conjunctions occur over a longer time window, such as in geostationary Earth orbit (GEO), where the involved objects may have small relative velocities. Besides, external perturbations, particularly the geopotential, lunisolar, and solar radiation pressure ones, exert forces on the spacecraft, causing it to deviate from its designated slot and potentially endanger neighboring satellites. This issue is compounded when considering state uncertainty. The presented work, therefore, introduces convex optimization approaches for long-term CAM and tailored stochastic station-leeping (SK) policy regarding longitude and latitude in this regime. The formulation enables continuous CAM and chance-constrained SK, ensuring satellite adherence to an assigned GEO slot with a given probability. Two kinds of chance constraints are devised: the first one does not consider the correlation between longitude and latitude, but the latter does.},

  abstract     = {In the context of space situational awareness, orbit determination and maneuver detection pose considerable challenges given the ever increasing number of noncooperative satellites that perform unspecified maneuvers at unknown epochs. A new metric is proposed for maneuver detection here, based on measurements from a single surveillance radar. Data from the radar track are leveraged to derive this metric; it can flag the occurrence of a maneuver since the last time a satellite was observed. In the scenarios considered in this work, the main challenge is having just a few available observations in between long propagations. Thus, a realistic quantification of uncertainty becomes crucial; Gaussian mixtures are chosen for this work. The propagated state is compared against the radar track data to compute a well-known cost metric, the evidence in Bayes’s update, similar to the Mahalanobis distance (MD). The contribution of this work lies in using the variation of the cost metric across track points to define a new maneuver detection metric. The focus is on testing this new metric in diverse and realistic scenarios to gain practical intuition about its performance and limitations. The preliminary results are promising, simultaneously improving upon the classical MD at maneuver detection and reducing false positives.},

  abstract     = {Target evasion from modern missiles is a very challenging task because modern interception missiles usually have substantial agility and maneuver advantages over the target. This paper proposes novel near-optimal evasion strategies from any linear missile guidance law that exploit the pursuer’s two main weaknesses: the inherent time delay of the evader’s acceleration estimate and the pursuer’s acceleration bound. In the derivation, the pursuer and the evader are assumed to have arbitrary-order linear dynamics with bounded acceleration commands. The pursuer is assumed to have a delayed evader acceleration estimation, and the evader is assumed to know the pursuer’s guidance law. The problem is posed as a bounded optimal control problem with the miss distance as the performance index, and the necessary analytical optimality conditions are derived. The problem is then solved iteratively using backward and forward propagation of the costate and state dynamics until the solution converges. Furthermore, an additional gradient-descent-based algorithm is derived to improve the performance and robustness of the solution. The evasion strategies are extensively evaluated in deterministic and stochastic Monte Carlo simulations. It is shown that the proposed evasion strategies have substantially better evasion performance than state-of-the-art evasion strategies that only exploit the pursuer’s estimation delay.},

  abstract     = {Optimal sliding Gaussian control of a quadrotor aerial vehicle with a flexible structure has been demonstrated in six-degree-of-freedom flight simulation to be more robust to structural excitation than a standard proportional-derivative control scheme. A general derivation of the optimal sliding Gaussian controller, including an optimal gain selection algorithm and observer design, is presented. Additionally, a brief development of the equations of motion for a quadrotor with a flexible structure is provided as background for the nonlinear six-degree-of-freedom flight simulation results. Robustness properties of the optimal sliding Gaussian controller are evaluated using singular value analysis of linearized models of the closed-loop quadrotor with a flexible structure. Flight simulation and singular value analysis results illustrate the robustness improvements of optimal sliding Gaussian control over the standard proportional-derivative controller design.},

  abstract     = {A novel method for solving Lambert’s problem based around the universal variable formulation is presented. By extending the transfer time function into the complex plane, an exact solution is derived for Lambert’s boundary value problem. This solution is a function of complex contour integrals of the transfer time function that must be approximated numerically. For integrals of this type, the composite trapezoidal rule is exponentially convergent and is used to approximate the solution to a high degree of accuracy for both zero- and -revolution Lambert problems. Different families of contours are presented for the cases of hyperbolic, zero-revolution elliptic, and -revolution elliptic transfers, and numerical examples are presented for all the cases. Monte Carlo analysis demonstrates a direct tradeoff between accuracy and computation speed based on the number of points used to approximate the integrals. When choosing a number of points with a balanced accuracy to speed, this method demonstrates an exceptionally fast computation speed, faster than all other methods we compare to in this paper.},

However, existing state-of-the-art approaches for solving MIOCPs are often plagued by drawbacks such as high computational costs, low precision, and compromised optimality. In this study, we propose a novel multiphase scheme coupled with an iterative second-order cone programming (SOCP) algorithm to efficiently and effectively address these challenges in MIOCPs. In the first phase, we relax the discrete decision constraints and account for the terminal state constraints and certain path constraints by introducing them as penalty terms in the objective function. After formulating the problem as a quadratically constrained quadratic programming (QCQP) problem, we propose the iterative SOCP algorithm to solve general QCQPs. In the second phase, we reintroduce the discrete decision constraints to generate the final solution. We substantiate the efficacy of our proposed multiphase scheme and iterative SOCP algorithm through successful application to two practical MIOCPs in planetary exploration missions.},

We present a novel framework that uniquely employs overparameterized monomial coordinates and precomputed fundamental solution expansions to facilitate rapid optimization while minimizing real-time computational requirements. The fundamental solution expansions are precomputed about an uncontrolled reference trajectory using differential algebra. Unlike traditional approaches that repeatedly evaluate the nonlinear dynamics and constraints as part of complex shooting or collocation-based schemes, this method replaces the nonlinearity inherent to dynamics and constraint functions entirely with a computationally simpler manifold constraint. With this approach, trajectory optimization is posed efficiently as a path-planning problem on the manifold. This problem is entirely convex except for the manifold constraint, readily lending itself to solution via sequential convex programming. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in computing fast and accurate Δ optimal solutions for long-range spacecraft rendezvous, including problems with nonlinear state constraints.},

  abstract     = {Tracking a reference trajectory is a frequent task in aerospace guidance. The technical approaches for tracking guidance design so far are largely application-dependent and heavily rely on labor-intensive practices such as manual gain generation. In this paper the model predictive control (MPC) method is used as the foundation for a systematic tracking guidance design, dubbed appropriately model predictive guidance (MPG). Unlike most existing work utilizing MPC, the method developed in this paper does not require a quadratic program (QP) solver. Instead, the constrained QP from the discretization of the MPC problem is strategically formulated in a novel way so that it has only box constraints. An exceedingly simple but globally convergent fixed-point algorithm with a theoretical guarantee is developed to solve the QP. The relatively general formulation of the MPG problem, the automated tracking command generation, and the very simple yet highly reliable algorithm render this method appealing to many tracking guidance problems and autonomous operations. The application of MPG is demonstrated in planetary powered descent guidance for a high-mass Mars mission.},

  abstract     = {To ensure the safe and efficient operation of flights in terminal maneuvering areas, airports establish standard arrival and departure procedures. However, designing these procedures is typically time-consuming and challenging for quantitative path length optimization. This paper presents an efficient optimization method for designing multiple arrival and departure procedures, taking into account the configuration of the airport and the nearby environment. The objective is to minimize the total length of routes while satisfying related operational constraints, such as obstacle avoidance and route separation. Each route is modeled in three dimensions, consisting of a horizontal polygonal line and a vertical cone. Considering the actual procedures’ merging or diverging configuration characteristics, multiple arrival or departure routes are then modeled as a tree-like topology structure. A hybrid algorithm, integrating simulated annealing and an improved algorithm, is developed for automated problem-solving. Simulation results, based on tests at Sweden’s Arlanda Airport, exhibit advantages over existing related research in terms of both total route length and computing time. Tests at Shanghai Pudong Airport show an 8% reduction in total path length compared to actual procedures, demonstrating the proposed method’s effectiveness and potential contributions to energy savings and emissions reduction.},

An incremental backstepping sliding mode control is proposed to implement attitude control, while an incremental nonlinear dynamic inversion and a nonlinear dynamic inversion design are used to deal with the nonlinear system model for the flight path and position control, respectively. In addition, a radial basis function neural-network-based extended state disturbance observer is proposed to deal with model uncertainties, gust disturbances, and unknown faults of the aircraft. The closed-loop control system is proved to be stable using Lyapunov theory. The performance of the proposed disturbance-observer-based incremental backstepping sliding mode control is demonstrated in simulation through a set of three-dimensional tracking scenarios. Compared with both backstepping control and backstepping sliding mode control, tracking performance measured by settling time, tracking error, and overshoot are improved by the proposed design when realistic trajectory tracking missions are executed.},

The guidance law is derived using sliding mode control, with one sliding surface for every pair of neighboring pursuers to remove time-to-go difference and one global sliding surface to make sure at least one pursuer is heading toward the target, guaranteeing the others’ interception as well. A time-to-go approximation scheme for a stationary target is used during the derivation. In addition, the guidance law is expanded to a moving target using a predicted interception point approximation scheme. A two-dimensional nonlinear simulation of the relative kinematics is run for cases of both two pursuers and more, as well as a moving target, in which the guidance law is shown to successfully cause simultaneous interception among multiple pursuers starting from different initial conditions. The guidance law is compared to different guidance laws, bringing simultaneous interception for a case where a disturbance is entered into the system in the middle of the encounter, showing the flexibility of the derived guidance law to deal with such a disturbance.},

  abstract     = {The present work deals with accessibility analysis and robust controller design of dual-spin projectiles (DSPs). Applying linear controllability checks to a nonlinear system by linearizing about the operating points may prove inconclusive while examining the controllability of the system because such checks specify only the sufficient conditions for controllability. Thus, tools based on differential geometry have to be used to assess the controllability of nonlinear systems. One such tool is the Lie algebraic rank condition, used in the accessibility analysis of a system. In this study, the accessibility analysis is carried out for three different configurations of DSPs: the skid-to-turn (STT), the bank-to-turn (BTT), and the precision guidance kit (PGK). The analysis reveals the inaccessibility of the PGK configuration. Consequently, the controllers are designed for the STT and BTT configurations. A robust pitch/yaw autopilot is designed based on Lyapunov theory and a roll autopilot is designed based on robust backstepping. The efficacy of the designed controllers to intercept the target and handle uncertainties in the initial conditions and aerodynamic coefficients is validated through simulations. The results are compared for the STT and BTT configurations, and the equivalency of the dynamics of the two configurations is proven.},

  abstract     = {A major challenge in homing guidance is that accurately predicting the time to go for missiles is generally difficult, which limits the practical application of a certain class of guidance laws with impact-time constraints or cooperative capabilities. To address this issue, a generalized method referred to as the time-to-go inversion guidance is presented, where the time to go is first specified as an explicit function and then the corresponding guidance law is inversely derived. By employing this new method, a variety of guidance laws and their globally accurate time-to-go solutions can be developed, regardless of whether the impact-angle constraint is considered or not. Different from all existing studies, the proposed method addresses the problem of time-to-go estimation without relying on any linearizing approximations or numerical iterations. To enhance the practicality of the proposed method, it is augmented with bias commands to result in either the impact time control guidance law or the impact time and angle control guidance law. Numerical simulation results demonstrate the higher accuracy, larger feasible solution region, and lower computational demand of the proposed guidance laws even for the missiles with nonconstant speeds.},

  abstract     = {Approaching a target from a desired heading is crucial for various modern applications. Existing literature mostly addresses terminal angle-constrained guidance for stationary targets, which also includes strategies for achieving the entire angular spectrum (all-aspect approach). However, existing strategies against moving targets can achieve only a restricted set of terminal angles. To this end, this paper presents a proportional-navigation-based multiphase guidance strategy against a nonmaneuvering target, moving at a lower speed than the pursuer, with any desired terminal angle in 2-D, by shaping the trajectory on an angular phase plane. First, a generalized version of the two-phase guidance scheme is presented for achieving terminal angles in one half-space. This is subsequently extended to attaining any desired terminal angle in the other half-space by using an additional phase for line-of-sight rotation reversal. By shaping the angular phase-plane trajectory, the pursuer’s field-of-view constraint is also seamlessly incorporated in the guidance formulation. Further, an all-aspect approach in a 3-D environment is achieved by splitting the entire 3-D engagement into two planar engagement phases and employing the developed planar guidance on each engagement plane. The performance of the developed guidance strategies is validated through extensive numerical simulations considering first-order lag and lateral acceleration limits.},

The aircraft equations of motion are linearized, and an infinite-horizon linear quadratic regulator design is conducted. The open-loop system is unstable in the short-period and Dutch roll modes. This is mitigated in the closed-loop system, which is analyzed in the time and frequency domains. Included in the simulation dynamics are first-order actuator models, actuator deflection limits, and actuator rate limits. These are particularly important for this bio-inspired aircraft because control actuation requires rotation of the empennage, which has relatively large inertia. Simulation responses to initial condition dispersions, aerodynamic model error, and atmospheric turbulence are analyzed to characterize time-domain properties: settling time, region of attraction, control saturation, and robustness. Due to poor singular values for the throttle setting and rotating tail inputs, analysis is dedicated to control designs with these inputs fixed at trim values. Within the scope of these analyses, fixing the rotating tail at trim does not significantly degrade system performance.},

Motivated by a scenario of orbital inspection, we consider a similar malfunction occurring to the inspector satellite and investigate whether its mission can still be safely fulfilled. While a natural approach is to counteract in real time the uncontrolled and undesirable thrust with the remaining controlled thrusters, vehicles are often subject to actuation delays hindering this approach. Instead, we extend resilience theory to systems suffering from actuation delay and build a resilient trajectory tracking controller with stability guarantees relying on a state predictor. We demonstrate that this controller can accurately track the reference trajectory of the inspection mission despite the actuation delay and the loss of control authority over one of the thrusters.},

This study introduces an enhanced neural-network adaptive control methodology that optimizes the use of empirical data and ensures a more even spatial distribution of samples. A neural-network adaptive controller is developed, incorporating an experience replay strategy that refines the adaptive tuning of network weights. The adaptation is fueled by the current tracking and historical model prediction errors, markedly improving the excitation condition. Furthermore, a data- selection strategy that prioritizes regions with sparse samples is introduced, effectively mitigating the issue of learning singularities. Additionally, an adaptive technique to circumvent control saturation is employed. The stability of the control system and the convergent behavior of the network weights are substantiated through theoretical analysis. Simulation outcomes corroborate the superiority of the proposed algorithm in terms of parameter convergence, learning efficacy, and control precision.},

  abstract     = {This paper addresses the task of sensor selection over a finite time horizon for systems modeled via discrete-time, linear state-space representations. Our method for this general linear setting accommodates both spatial and temporal noise correlations. To our best knowledge, this is the first work to do so. Scheduling policies are designed to limit sensor usage and minimize a minimum-mean-square-error-based criterion with time-varying weights to accommodate different user scenarios (e.g., prioritizing certain state elements at certain times or performing linear quadratic Gaussian control). The approach is also nonmyopic since the effects of sensor activations on all time steps are incorporated. A new but algebraically equivalent formulation of the scheduling model is introduced that readily accounts for colored noise sequences. This lends a closed-form expression for the error covariance that is explicit in all scheduling variables. Such an expression had been considered intractable for filtering in both white and colored noise regimes. This expression is leveraged to develop a well-motivated surrogate objective function that is shown to be submodular, thus enabling the use of an efficient greedy algorithm accompanied by performance guarantees with respect to the surrogate objective. Numerical examples are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology.},

They include the full set of costate equations and the optimality conditions of the body attitude in terms of the angle of attack and sideslip angle. In contrast to a long-standing assumption of coordinated flight in the literature, it is shown that in general coordinated flight is not optimal if sideslip modulation is allowed. Special cases, such as small-angle and in-plane motion, are analyzed and harmonized with the previous results that are well known in the literature. The analytical conditions derived in this paper can also serve as independent verification for numerical solutions obtained by direct methods in optimal control or can be exploited for trajectory-design purposes.},

The present work focuses on controlling a multi-arm space robot in the post-impact phase under the presence of uncertainties, which may arise due to dynamical parameter variation, joint friction, and disturbances. This work proposes a Gaussian Process-based Model Predictive Control (GP-MPC) to achieve the desired motion by mitigating the effects of uncertainties. Whereas the GP helps in predicting uncertainties from collected data, the MPC provides control inputs subject to the cost function and constraints. Further, an event-triggered control strategy is employed to reduce the computational burden associated with GP-MPC. It uses a Chernoff-bound-based triggering threshold to decide the occurrence of events. The generated control inputs may disturb the base’s attitude, and reactionless manipulation is also presented as a special case to mitigate it. The analytical outcomes are verified through numerical simulations on a dual-arm planer space robot.},

This work addresses safety concepts for the relative trajectory guidance design applicable to challenging proximity operations in the close-range domain. The relative orbital element framework is used to formulate safety checks that improve the trajectory’s robustness in case of chaser’s malfunctions or loss of control. Particularly, concepts of passive abort safety and active collision safety are applied to the trajectory design to maintain the chaser outside keep-out zones. These definitions are included within a guidance algorithm that exploits sequential convex programming to efficiently solve the fixed final time safety-constrained close-range rendezvous problem. Test cases of reconfiguration between stable relative orbits and synchronization to a rotating hold point are presented, highlighting the advantages in using these new safety concepts in terms of safety, trajectory insight, and formulation efficiency.},

This paper presents a new formulation of TILTs with a framework similar to the classical Lambert problem. The developed algorithm searches for trajectories of TILTs with constraints on boundary values and time of flight by solving a one-dimensional root-finding problem. Compared to the traditional algorithm for TILTs, the developed algorithm enhances its generality by removing the restriction on the initial and final phases of the transfer. Additionally, the algorithm can achieve trajectory patching that includes TILTs without reoptimization and tour redesign based on the actual position of the spacecraft due to the Lambert-like input–output design. The algorithm uses existing neural network tools for fast and broad search in the solution space. Simulation results indicate that the algorithm can explicitly find TILT solutions and families satisfying boundary value constraints. Furthermore, the algorithm is applied to design a new endgame trajectory from Ganymede to Europa, demonstrating the potential of integrating the new algorithms with other trajectory design tools.},

  abstract     = {Sequential convex programming (SCP) has been gaining popularity for space trajectory optimization. However, application of SCP for solar-sail trajectory optimization has suffered from the nonlinear coupling between the magnitude and direction of solar radiation pressure acceleration, which renders the optimal control problem highly nonconvex in the control variables. To address this issue, this paper proposes a formulation that transforms the solar-sail optimal control problem into a problem that is convex with respect to control (called control-convex). This convexification is achieved by introducing a slack variable and applying a change of variable. This paper mathematically shows the lossless property of the proposed control-convex formulation by using Pontryagin’s minimum principle, and develops an SCP-based trajectory optimization algorithm for solar sails. We then apply the developed trajectory optimization algorithm to two interplanetary-transfer scenarios, demonstrating its effectiveness in solving complex sail optimal control problems efficiently and robustly, with better optimality compared to a conventional formulation.},

The surrogates, derived from the heat equation solution, are first incorporated into the necessary conditions as replacement of the terminal state and costate variables. The homotopy process is then applied to the heat conduction time: a longer time results in a more uniform temperature distribution and greater stability against initial temperature variations, thereby making the corresponding homotopy problem much easier to solve; zero time implies no heat conduction and reverts to the original problem. Furthermore, capitalizing on the heat equation’s boundedness characteristic, an efficient approach for determining the hypersensitive parameters is proposed, thus obviating the necessity of manual tuning. Challenging numerical examples are provided to demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method, indicating that its convergence and efficiency are significantly enhanced compared to the original smoothing homotopy methods.},

The proposed method relies on autonomously and in real-time reconfiguring the guidance function to compensate for the loss of the spacecraft actuation system. The performance and cost of the RGS have been tested in a high-fidelity simulation scenario, the 42 spacecraft simulator developed by NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, taking into account orbital and rotational nonlinear coupled dynamics, high-order perturbation models, and actuator and sensor models.

  abstract     = {Topological connectivity, which is the minimum requirement for a swarm to cooperate, was exploited to design control strategies for satellite swarm-keeping. Low fuel consumption is expected to be achieved by imposing only this minimum requirement on the relative motion. A distributed topology regulation method was adopted to maintain connectivity via proper topology switching with variations in intersatellite distances in free motion. Intersatellite distance-keeping control was only activated when free relative motion would otherwise disrupt connectivity of all possible topologies or when collision avoidance was needed. Velocity impulse commands for relative distance control were generated according to the relative states between critical satellite pairs. A distributed protocol was proposed to integrate the pairwise velocity impulse commands to obtain the impulse to be implemented for each satellite. The convergence of the protocol was theoretically guaranteed. The simulation of 10-day swarm-keeping for 50 satellites in low Earth orbit under the influence of the Earth’s nonspherical term demonstrated that the swarm could be kept in bounded relative motion with an average velocity impulse of approximately 0.038 m/s per day and an average number of velocity impulses of approximately 1.22 per orbit for each satellite, and collisions could be eliminated in the steady state.},

The primary objective is to synthesize a more efficient and less conservative life-extending control scheme than those currently available in the literature. The proposed load limiting control (LLC) scheme is a viable solution that addresses several issues that current life-extending control schemes suffer from, such as the neglect of fatigue damage induced by the harmonic component of loads and the inability to distinguish between aggressive and nonaggressive maneuvers. The proposed LLC scheme treats desired harmonic load limits as limit boundaries and recasts the problem of load limiting as a vehicle limit by computing a control margin (CM) using a limit detection and avoidance module. The computed CM is used as a cue to the pilot. The limit detection and avoidance module comprises an optimization algorithm, a model predictive controller, and a computationally simple onboard dynamical model. Simulations were conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the LLC scheme in limiting harmonic pitch link loads during flight. One significant outcome is that, with sufficient training, the pilot can skillfully track the cue within 0.5 s of initiating the tracking task.},

When the morphing aircraft transitions to the next configuration, the unidentified aerodynamic parameters change accordingly. To rapidly identify the aerodynamic parameters after deformation, a transfer learning approach is adopted. The advantages of both PINN and transfer learning are combined by this method, and a significant reduction in the required flight data for aerodynamic parameter identification can be achieved along with an improvement in model accuracy. The effectiveness of this method is demonstrated through simulation experiments.

Neural network compensation drives the combined controller–plant system to exhibit a closed-loop response similar to that of an idealized system, immune to the factors that trigger pilot-induced oscillations. Actuator rate limiting has been a historically ubiquitous cause of pilot-induced oscillations; meanwhile, aeroelastic effects pose a threat to future lightweight, flexible aircraft designs. Model reference control can reduce pilot-induced oscillation tendencies caused by either of these factors. This paper presents the methods used to train the model reference controller, including conditions for system stability under model reference control. It then showcases results from a pair of simulation experiments applying the control design to compensate for rate limiting and aeroelasticity, respectively. Results demonstrate that the model reference control scheme reduces pilot-induced oscillation tendencies and improves closed-loop tracking performance.},

The shape of the polyellipse depends on the constants of the weighted sum, and accordingly, a general method is developed to determine these weighted sum constants for the polyellipse to pass through all its foci. A variable gain proportional derivative guidance law is designed for the pursuer to traverse all waypoints by implementing the polyelliptic geometric rule. Implementation requires only the distance between the pursuer and all the waypoints. The efficacy of the guidance strategy is investigated through various simulation scenarios, revealing that the developed guidance law is robust to initial heading and separation errors, as well as to the pursuer dynamics.},

The real-time perception of the environment is leveraged to enhance both safety and efficiency of the generation of UAV trajectories. More specifically, to tackle with uncertainties presented in the UAV’s real-time measurements, we utilize a novel notion of dummy upper confidence bound, which was proposed in our previous work. As a result, two remarkable features are guaranteed for our online trajectory planner: 1) it is guaranteed with high probability that the regions generated by the confidence bounds are larger than the actual geofences, and thus safety of the planned trajectories is naturally assured; and 2) the confidence regions shrink progressively as more perception information is acquired, which further improves the efficiency of the UAV’s trajectories. With these two features, both feasibility and (sub)optimality are theoretically ensured for our online trajectory planning algorithm. At last, two sets of numerical examples are provided to demonstrate all theoretical findings in the paper.},

  abstract     = {The study of the dynamics of flybys is featured in several space-mission-related applications, spanning from the design of interplanetary orbits to the computation of impact probabilities with given celestial bodies in planetary protection and defense tasks. While patched-conics, two-body models suffice in accuracy for trajectory planning cases, collision probability assessment requires instead more insightful approaches. High-fidelity simulations have shown impact patterns to happen outside nominally colliding trajectories in terms of two-body analysis, all caused by distant or weak interactions between the given trajectory-celestial body pairs. This work proposes a novel concept of sphere of influence based on the Jacobian of the three-body dynamics, resulting in a wider definition of encounters that encompasses weak interactions up to an arbitrary threshold. The so-defined Jacobian spheroids are then used to construct the Keyhole map, a graphical tool that maps in the orbital elements space both nominal and off-nominal keyholes, i.e., collision paths accounting for three-body weak interactions. The proposed concepts arise from and are compared against the on-ground casualty risk assessment of the European Space Agency’s mission JUICE.},

  abstract     = {Space-based optical observation is assuming an increasingly significant role in space surveillance and tracking. However, it often yields tracks that are too short, which are known as too short arcs (TSAs). A single TSA lacks sufficient information for reliable initial orbit determination of a resident space object. Therefore, it is typically necessary to perform tracklet association during catalog building and maintenance. This study presents a novel tracklet association method that improves upon existing techniques by combining admissible regions and nonlinear orbital uncertainty propagation. Proceeding by constructing TSA association matrices and TSA clustering matrices, the bond energy algorithm, traditionally employed in the design of distributed database systems, is applied to cluster TSAs based on the association results between two arbitrary TSAs. Furthermore, the proposed splitting algorithm reduces the computational load associated with clustering multiple tracklets and effectively handles erroneous association results. To assess the effectiveness of this approach, it was tested in a space-based optical-survey scenario, accounting for practical observation uncertainties. The simulation results demonstrate that the method achieves a high level of accuracy in both TSA association and clustering.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a general analytical method to describe the center manifolds of collinear libration points in the restricted three-body problem (RTBP). It is well known that these center manifolds include Lissajous orbits, halo orbits, and quasi-halo orbits. Previous studies have traditionally treated these orbits separately by iteratively constructing high-order series solutions using the Lindstedt–Poincaré method. Instead of relying on resonance between their frequencies, this study identifies that halo and quasi-halo orbits arise due to intricate coupling interactions between in-plane and out-of-plane motions. To characterize this coupling effect, a novel concept, coupling coefficient , is introduced in the RTBP, incorporating the coupling term in the -direction dynamics equation, where represents a formal power series concerning the amplitudes. Subsequently, a uniform series solution for these orbits is constructed up to a specified order using the Lindstedt–Poincaré method. For any given paired in-plane and out-of-plane amplitudes, the coupling coefficient is determined by the bifurcation equation . When , the proposed solution describes Lissajous orbits around libration points. As transitions from zero to nonzero values, the solution describes quasi-halo orbits, which bifurcate from Lissajous orbits. Particularly, halo orbits bifurcate from planar Lyapunov orbits if the out-of-plane amplitude is zero. The proposed method provides a unified framework for understanding these intricate orbital behaviors in the RTBP.},

  abstract     = {Precise knowledge about the orbit state vectors and the associated uncertainties are crucial for reliable conjunction assessment and efficient mitigation of on-orbit collision risks through collision avoidance maneuvers by active satellites. The decision-making process heavily relies on the orbit accuracy and the uncertainty realism of the encountering objects, primarily space debris, and the maneuvering satellite itself. The process of determining an orbit creates an estimate of the orbit state and its associated state covariance matrix. This estimate serves as the initial value for predicting the orbit’s uncertainty at the time of closest approach. To determine and numerically propagate realistic orbit errors, the uncertainties of the dynamic model must be taken into account. One method that fulfils this purpose is consider covariance propagation, provided that suitable consider parameters and their variances have been established. This paper presents a novel method for optimizing the consider covariance parameters from past mission data. Real orbit data from multiple low Earth orbit satellites controlled by the DLR, German Aerospace Center’s German Space Operations Center are used to calibrate and evaluate different error models, including covariance parameters and other error terms. The results demonstrate improved uncertainty realism in orbit predictions and subsequent benefits for collision avoidance. Finally, this paper presents the required steps for integrating the new method into the existing collision avoidance system, along with initial results from conjunction assessment.},

  abstract     = {The European Space Agency (ESA)’s Hera mission requires autonomous visual-based navigation in order to safely orbit around the target binary asteroid system Didymos and its moon Dimorphos in 2027. Nevertheless, the performance of optical-based navigation systems depends on the intrinsic properties of the image, such as high Sun phase angles, the presence of other bodies, and, especially, the irregular shape of the target. Therefore, to improve the navigation performance, thermal and/or range measurements from additional onboard instruments are usually needed to complement optical measurements. However, this work addresses these challenges by developing a fully visual-based autonomous navigation system using a convolutional-neural-network (CNN)-based image processing (IP) algorithm and applying it to the detailed characterization phase of the proximity operation of the mission. The images taken by the onboard camera are processed by the CNN-based IP algorithm that estimates the position of the geometrical centers of Didymos and Dimorphos, the range from Didymos, and the associated covariances. The results show that the developed algorithm can be used for a fully visual-based navigation for the position of the Hera spacecraft around the target with good robustness and accuracy.},

The optimal control problem is solved using a direct approach, with individualistic grid adaptation facilitated by a local error analysis at element boundaries. Multiple objectives are considered using a dominance-based approach applying both local and global search methods to a collaborative population of unique solutions. These aspects are simultaneously incorporated via a novel application of evolutionary algorithms for adaptive optimal control problems. Together, this avoids the need for a priori specification of the quantity and temporal location of element boundaries and the set of scalarization weights defining the multi-objective descent directions. Solution fidelity can thus increase concurrently with the exploration of the design space, which leads to increased numerical efficiency while propagating and maintaining population diversity. The benefits of the proposed approach over traditional uniform-grid implementations are demonstrated. Results show that the multiresolution approach is capable of striking an effective balance between solution fidelity, population diversity, and computational cost unachievable using uniform grids.},

Although unscented trajectory optimization was introduced by the authors about a decade ago, it is reintroduced in this paper as a special instantiation of tychastic optimal control theory. Tychastic optimal control theory (from Tyche, the Greek goddess of chance) avoids the use of a Brownian motion and the resulting Itô calculus even though it uses random variables across the entire spectrum of a problem formulation. This approach circumvents the enormous technical and numerical challenges associated with stochastic trajectory optimization. Furthermore, it is shown how a tychastic optimal control problem that involves nonlinear transformations of the expectation operator can be quickly instantiated using the unscented transform. These nonlinear transformations are particularly useful in managing trajectory dispersions, be they associated with path constraints or targeted values of final-time conditions. This paper also presents a systematic and rapid process for formulating and computing the most desirable tychastic trajectory using the unscented transform. Numerical examples are used to illustrate how unscented trajectory optimization may be used for risk reduction and mission recovery caused by uncertainties and failures.},

Reference-frame errors found in quantities such as the translational velocity have not been considered previously. The work here derives the full INS equations where an alternative vector state-error is defined using common coordinates over all vector-error realizations, thereby providing a true-to-life representation of the actual errors. The INS is analyzed through a stationary linear analysis to show that the fundamental frequencies are unchanged; however, there are now more coupling terms within the state matrix. The performance of the INS filter is then analyzed using a simulation.},
