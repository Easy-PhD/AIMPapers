  abstract     = {Online marketplaces such as Amazon and Tmall have been expanding services to boost the growth of their ecosystems. One is information service on sharing privately gathered massive consumer data that is unavailable to their sellers, and the other is financing service, e.g., Amazon Lending and Ant Financial, aiming to provide accessible and affordable financial support for small and medium-sized sellers. This paper develops a game-theoretical model to examine the interplay between information sharing and financing services on a retail platform, particularly when sellers are financially constrained. The results show that while the information-sharing service always makes the platform less likely to provide an attractive financing service, the financing service also makes the information-sharing service less likely to be provided under certain conditions. These conditions depend on the structure of capital market and the seller’s initial working capital. We find that such misalignment between these two services can be resolved by charging a fixed payment for the information service, leading to improved operational efficiency and social welfare. We finally extend our analytical results and managerial insights to general settings, demonstrating the robustness of our findings. Our findings could provide useful guidance for platform practitioners in designing integrated information-sharing and financing services.},

  abstract     = {Platform firms are increasingly investing in value-added services (VAS), believing these investments in VAS universally contribute to their success. Although many studies have examined platform firms’ core services (e.g., intermediation), systematic analyses of VAS provision strategies remain limited. In this article, we develop a game-theoretic model to analyze (1) the conditions under which platform firms benefit from providing VAS and (2) to which side(s) platform firms should provide VAS. We offer several insights. First, variable service costs are a critical yet previously neglected factor in governing platform firms’ VAS provision. Second, a comparison of equilibrium outcomes across three VAS provision strategies—one-sided unidirectional, two separate unidirectional, and bidirectional—reveals that the optimal strategy is jointly determined by variable service costs, cross-network externalities, and the asymmetry in the benefits of bidirectional VAS to the two platform sides. Specifically, when asymmetry is low, bidirectional VAS is optimal. When asymmetry is high, platform firms should provide unidirectional VAS to one side, considering the second side only when variable service costs are low or cross-network externalities are significant. Third, we explore the implications of VAS provision strategies for platform firms’ investment and pricing decisions. For example, when platform firms provide two separate unidirectional VAS, these investments are complementary. VAS could incentivize platform firms to offer price subsidies to one side of the platform. Finally, optimal VAS provision strategies do not always increase consumer surplus.},

  abstract     = {Social media users generate a variety of content that can potentially influence their followers’ behaviors and preferences. However, most user-generated content, such as text and images, is unstructured, making it difficult to analyze how individuals impact the creation of such data as existing models primarily focus on the numerical aspects of behavioral data. In this article, we propose a method to identify influential users who significantly affect others’ interest in content topics, with a specific focus on text and images. Our study introduces a new variant of the topic model, incorporating a hierarchical structure and a vector auto-regressive approach. This method accounts for both the evolution of topic distribution and the social influence among users on their interest in content topics. The empirical application of our model to image-sharing social media data demonstrates that our model outperforms conventional topic models in terms of predictive accuracy and topic interpretability. Moreover, we illustrate how visualizing the estimated social influence within the network can provide valuable insights for seeded marketing campaigns and data-driven product development by identifying influential users in various content areas. This approach also offers a deeper understanding of evolving trends in content, preferences, and demand.},

  abstract     = {Challenges faced by call centers in managing capacity, efficiency, service speed and quality, training, emotional labor, and turnover are intrinsically intertwined. Call center agents are considered frontline workers, and as such, they often deal with hostile behavior from rude customers. However, they are expected to suppress their feelings and maintain a courteous demeanor despite rude customer behavior, which results in emotional dissonance. Such working environments, where the frontline workers experience emotional dissonance, are termed emotional labor environments. Emotional dissonance, if sustained over a long period of time, can lead to an erosion of organizational identification (OID) among agents, unless they perceive adequate protection and support from the management. A low OID can lead to high employee turnover, which in turn results in high recruitment and training costs as well as loss of experience and compromised service quality. In this study, we examine how employee protection policies and leadership style manifest in mitigating the erosion of OID. We develop a research framework to understand the mediating role of agents’ perception of the efficacy of the firm's policies to protect them from rude customers and the relevant aspects of the servant leadership style of supervisors in mitigating the erosion of agents’ OID caused by the cumulative emotional dissonance over their tenure duration. For this study, we partner with a major multinational firm in Korea in the insurance industry. We find that the perceived organizational support for protection from rude customers and supervisors’ servant leadership style are positively related to agents’ OID. The agent's OID decreases with their tenure duration, unless mediated by the agent's perception of the efficacy of protection from rude customers. We provide insights for the retention of agents with implications for capacity and service quality for the call centers. These insights may be extended to frontline workers in other emotional labor environments.},

  abstract     = {We explore retail supply chains in emerging markets in which a manufacturer can reach consumers by selling its product through very small independent stores (nanostores) and/or through a supermarket. Nanostores offer consumers the advantage of proximity, but supermarkets offer the advantage of bulk buying. We explore the competition between the supermarket and nanostores and examine the manufacturer’s role in shaping the retail market structure for its product through wholesale price contracts. We model and analyze a multi-party supply-chain game in which a manufacturer can sell its product to spatially distributed, utility-maximizing, price-sensitive consumers through nanostores and a supermarket. Consumers can buy in bulk at the supermarket, optimizing their purchase quantity, and hence visit frequency, in an economic order quantity type approach, or they can purchase from a nanostore (frequently due to store storage-space limitations). We fully solve for the equilibrium market structure and the associated retail and wholesale prices, establishing that the manufacturer’s desired channel strategy is governed by three factors: the manufacturer-nanostore supply chain cost, the manufacturer-supermarket supply chain cost, and the supermarket bargaining power. If the supply chain efficiencies are somewhat similar, then the manufacturer should (typically, but not always) use both retail formats to avail of the nanostore advantage in serving proximate consumers and the supermarket advantage in serving distant customers. The specifics of how the manufacturer should use the retail formats will depend on the supermarket power. Among other results, we establish that aggregate nanostore demand and profit can decrease in nanostore density and that the presence of a high-power supermarket can increase consumer surplus because the manufacturer induces strong price competition.},

We appeal to a real options framework to predict that firms delay layoff decisions and the issuance of WARN notices until the resolution of political uncertainty. Using establishment-level data on layoffs disclosed in WARN notices and state elections occurring between 1994 and 2022, we document that the likelihood of issuing WARN notices declines during the election quarter but increases in the subsequent quarter. Cross-sectional findings show that political uncertainty plays a significant role in the timing of WARN notices during election periods while other factors, including partisanship, economic conditions, union strength, and firm visibility, may also play a role. Further, firms that delay WARN notices do not experience a significant deterioration in their medium-term financial performance. Overall, our findings provide evidence that firms delay labor adjustment decisions and the announcements of such decisions in response to political uncertainty.},

We consider a dynamic setting with uncertain patient arrival and use of the emergency department. This problem is formulated as an infinite-horizon Markov decision process model. Since we cannot solve large-sized instances via conventional approaches, we hybridize this model with a neural network to simplify feasibility constraints while respecting all assumptions. Given the curse of dimensionality, we use an affine approximation architecture to estimate the value function. An equivalent linear programing model is solved through column generation in order to compute approximate optimal policies and derive two easy-to-implement scheduling policies. Simulation results demonstrate that the approximate optimal policy and heuristics outperform alternative scheduling policies. Finally, we demonstrate that the application of our methodology can enhance performance metrics in a large ambulatory care center in Canada. We show that a template-based scheduling rule can result in high resource utilization but poor scheduling decisions. However, an efficient scheduling policy equips a booking clerk with intelligent scheduling rules that are difficult for her to predict in real-time and work well in comparison to scheduling templates.},

  abstract     = {Social advertising platforms and search engines employ the so-called quality score to favor certain advertisers in ad auctions. These scores typically consider several factors including ad relevance, click-through rate (CTR), and landing page quality. While quality scores are often justified as a mechanism to enhance ad rank and reduce cost per click for high-quality ads, this study examines their broader role in incentivizing advertisers with varying investment costs to improve landing page quality and explores the implications for advertisers’ profits and the platform’s revenue in a setting where landing page quality is an endogenous decision made by advertisers. The results suggest that a quality score function in excess of the CTR incentivizes advertisers to invest in page quality in a non-monotonic way. These incentives have dual effects on auction dynamics: While advertisers can lower their cost per click by improving quality, such incentives also increase advertisers’ competitive pressure to maintain their quality advantage and secure the discount per click, particularly for those in higher positions. Our findings reveal that the former effect dominates, leading to increased advertiser profits with higher rewards. However, the intensified competition slows the profit growth for the top-position advertiser when the bottom-position advertiser invests. For platform revenue, which comprises both auction revenue and benefits derived from user experience, a quality score in excess of CTR is recommended when the user experience benefits are substantial enough to compensate for auction revenue losses. In a scenario where page quality is capped, our results show that a quality score in excess of CTR can generate higher platform revenue, even in the absence of user experience benefits.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a decision support system used by an agricultural cooperative in the Indian states of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana to optimize the purchase, blending, sale, and storage of groundnuts for maximum profit. The cooperative buys raw groundnuts (input commodity) from member farmers and processes them into multiple grades of groundnut seeds (output commodity). These may then be blended to create intermediate grades to exploit arbitrage opportunities. The cooperative sells part of the output on the spot market while storing the rest for future periods. A key challenge is the random supply of input commodity—driven by the cooperative’s obligation to accept all member produce—and the option to blend the output. Unlike prior work, this study examines blending across a multiperiod planning horizon, a novel aspect in operations management literature. The problem is modeled as a dynamic program over a harvest season. We analyze the structure of the optimal value function and decisions and find that the function is not separable in input and output inventories, which complicates the identification of optimal solution. However, in special cases such as when blending is disallowed, the function simplifies. An efficient computational procedure is developed for the general case. Using real cooperative data, we demonstrate that multiperiod blending significantly boosts profits—by 100–900%, or Indian National Rupees 1.94–17.46 million annually—highlighting the value of this approach.},

  abstract     = {The financial industry is plagued with account-based fraudulent transactions in which perpetrators surreptitiously siphon away money from customer accounts. To address this recurrent problem, service operations teams at financial institutions (e.g., the fraud detection and mitigation teams) spend millions yearly identifying perpetrators, attributing blame, and averting customer churn. However, in the vast majority of cases, the service operations teams cannot trace fraudulent transactions back to the perpetrators, and hence, it remains unclear whether they should continue to expend significant resources into investigating account-based fraud and attributing blame. Employing a wide range of econometric and machine learning techniques on a rich dataset from a US bank and an experiment, we attempt to offer the first empirical assessment of the association between blame attribution, or lack of it, in response to customer-identified account-based fraud and customer churn. The results indicate that relative to the customers that did not experience fraud, those that did and received a resolution lacking blame attribution have 40.69 %Lift (95% confidence interval (CI) = [24.41 %Lift , 56.97 %Lift ]) in churn rate. However, customers that experienced fraud and received a resolution involving blame attribution have −62.45 %Lift (95% CI = [−31.22 %Lift , −93.68 %Lift ]) in churn rate, making them less likely to churn than those that did not experience fraud. The latter result offers one of the first field evidence of the well-known service recovery paradox. Additionally, we observe significant heterogeneity in the findings based on customer tenure and the number of customer-firm interactions and document the long-term effects of attributing and not attributing blame. These insights can assist service operations teams in their postservice failure efforts to mend customer-firm relationships. Overall, the results underscore the importance of blame attribution during service recovery for service operations teams and inform a topical debate on a banking reform proposed by the US Department of Treasury.},

  abstract     = {In this article, we explore the impact of implementing an algorithmic supervisor, a data analytics tool that offers real-time feedback to employees, on their overall performance. We collaborate with a leading service company that initiated the transition from human supervisors to an algorithmic supervisor for managing call agents in their outbound call center on September 18, 2019. We collect data for 220,085 calls over a span of 6 months—that is, 3 months before and 3 months after the introduction of the algorithmic supervisor. We find that the introduction of the algorithmic supervisor improved the agents’ service quality in terms of customer satisfaction; however, this came at the expense of quantity as fewer customers were served. In particular, the adoption of the algorithmic supervisor resulted in a 15.80% reduction in the number of served customers, accompanied by a 14.91% increase in the number of satisfied customers. Moreover, our study uncovers a gender-related dimension to the impact of the algorithmic supervisor. Before its adoption, male agents outperformed their female counterparts. However, after its adoption, female agents exhibited an 11.52% increase in the number of served customers, and a remarkable 14.00% increase in the number of satisfied customers as compared to their male counterparts. Our results suggest that the adoption of the algorithmic supervisor strikes a new economic balance between service quality and service quantity and generates a social impact in differently affecting service performance of female and male employees.},

Using a sample of 9,745 Chinese firm-year observations spanning 2018–2021, we find that the likelihood of suppliers’ blockchain technology adoption in supply chain management is negatively associated with major customer concentration. The negative relation is reduced when supplier firms possess greater bargaining power and demonstrate governance mechanisms against information leakage, and when major customers have less incentive to engage in opportunistic behaviors, and have fewer concerns regarding information leakage by suppliers. Our findings suggest that major customers tend to discourage supplier firms from adopting blockchain due to the concerns regarding competitive advantages and information leakage risk.},

  abstract     = {Purchasing new experience products or services often involves significant quality uncertainty for both consumers and firms. Social learning through online reviews helps reduce this uncertainty but exacerbates strategic waiting, as consumers delay purchases to gain more information. This paper examines the impact of social learning on firms’ pricing policies in the presence of strategic consumers under two widely adopted schemes: Contingent pricing and price guarantee. We find that while social learning always benefits the firm, it enables the price guarantee scheme to outperform contingent pricing in terms of profitability for highly patient consumers, which would not be possible without social learning. Notably, social learning drives a range of pricing patterns, even making price skimming optimal under price guarantee for highly patient consumers, as high initial prices combined with markdowns effectively alleviate strategic waiting, enhancing review outcomes and the firm’s profitability. Additionally, social learning always enables the firm to extract greater consumer surplus for impatient consumers under price guarantee. In contrast, social learning under contingent pricing consistently benefits consumers and can achieve win-win outcomes when consumers are moderately patient. Our extensions validate the robustness of these findings under different assumptions, including fully rational consumers and partially forward-looking firms. In particular, a partially forward-looking firm can achieve win-win outcomes with social learning under price guarantee, expanding its practical applicability. This study provides novel insights into the role of social learning in shaping pricing strategies, highlighting its implications for firm profitability and consumer welfare in markets influenced by review dynamics and strategic consumers.},

  abstract     = {This article examines how the composition of managerial teams influences the information and competitive landscapes in which firms operate. Specifically, the impact of teams depends on the task environment under which they operate and the extent of competition the firm faces in the product markets. Under a substitute task environment, team heterogeneity better facilitates firm learning, whereas, under a complementary task environment, team homogeneity enhances learning. However, more learning is not always optimal, as this accentuates adverse selection concerns, which leads the firm's rival to counter by becoming more aggressive in competition. This, in turn, forces the firm to cede some of its information advantage through disclosures. In effect, when designing teams to manage information, the firm must balance its learning needs with its rival's competitive threats. Consequently, in a substitute task environment, team heterogeneity is only optimal for the firm when competition is not fierce, and homogeneity is desirable otherwise. In a complementary task environment, the preference for teams as a function of competition is reversed. Additionally, any inherent heterogeneity in the level of competition in the product markets in which the firm operates diminishes the demand for team heterogeneity. The article also derives the firm's optimal team composition when the markets are characterized by Bertrand or Cournot competition, when the available managerial pool for the firm is constrained or unconstrained, when tasks are market-specific or firm-specific, and when the task environment is generalized.},

However, the role of multidimensional expert reviews and how they affect consumer behaviors remain unknown. Using an empirical opportunity on an automobile review platform, we investigate how multidimensional expert reviews affect subsequent consumer ratings and the underlying mechanism. Our findings first reveal that expert reviews tend to be neutral and more critical than consumer ratings. We then find that consumers provide reviews with higher ratings following expert reviews due to the information disclosure effect. Decomposing the effect by expert reviews’ multidimensional characteristics, we find the effect is attenuated by multidimensional expert rating valence and multidimensional rating discrepancy between experts and consumers but amplified by multidimensional expert rating variance. Natural language processing of consumer review texts unveils a positive impact of multidimensional expert reviews on consumer satisfaction and a negative impact on consumer disappointment, which speaks to the underlying mechanism behind the information disclosure effect. Lastly, we find that the effect varies with expert characteristics, product characteristics, and information channels, diminishes when multidimensional expert reviews are posted sooner after product launch, and decays over time but persists in the long run. These findings not only advance information theories in understanding expert reviews and multidimensional rating systems but also provide valuable insights for stakeholders, such as platforms, firms, and expert reviewers, to improve review program operations and consumer engagement.},

We analyze more than 55,000 papers published by more than 54,000 unique authors during this period to document four sets of findings. First, our analysis suggests that Operations Management and Multidisciplinary areas experienced significant publication growth from 2008 to 2022, increasing their publication and citation share in FT 50 journals, even after accounting for the relative handicap in terms of number of journals in the FT 50 list. Second, the growth in publications of the Operations Management discipline is driven by significant growth in Production and Operations Management and Manufacturing and Service Operations Management . The Journal of Business Ethics is a notable outlier, it alone published nearly 10% of the papers published in the FT 50 list, more than the number of papers published by the five disciplines each: Accounting, Marketing, Multidisciplinary, Operations Management, and Information Systems. Third, we find that the most prolific authors in Management and Organizations, Operations Management, Economics, and Marketing had a higher number of publications during the 2008–2022 period than the most prolific authors of other disciplines. Finally, our analyses of the most prolific 150 worldwide universities published in the FT 50 list suggest that the list is dominated mostly by about a dozen countries that include North American countries (the USA and Canada), European countries (Netherlands, Germany, the UK, France, and Spain), China (including Hong Kong), Australia, and Singapore.

  abstract     = {In recent years, “super fakes,” that is, high-quality counterfeits, have gained popularity. The ability of super fake manufacturers to produce high-quality products has inspired a novel anti-counterfeiting measure: converting counterfeiters to authorized suppliers . We develop a game-theoretic model to examine the interactions between a brand-name firm with a licit home supplier and a counterfeiter who can be potentially converted to an authorized overseas supplier. Our analysis leads to three main results. First, the brand-name firm can convert the counterfeiter to a licit supplier through either dual sourcing or single sourcing when the cost differential between two suppliers is moderate to high, or the quality perception differential between brand-name products produced by two suppliers is low. However, this conversion does not necessarily prevent counterfeiting unless the penalty from law enforcement is stringent. Our paper recommends that brand-name firms strategically use their wholesale pricing and sourcing decisions to establish socially responsible supply chain operations and prevent counterfeiting. Second, while dual sourcing is known for its risk diversification, our study identifies another benefit previously not reported in the literature: mitigating counterfeit risks. Dual sourcing can be more effective than single sourcing as the quality perception of super fakes approaches that of brand-name products, and its effectiveness becomes more pronounced when the brand-name firm offers wholesale price contracts in a sequential order. Conversely, single sourcing is preferable under conditions of high cost differential and low quality perception differential. Lastly, converting counterfeiters to authorized suppliers can reduce consumer surplus and does not improve social surplus unless authorities enforce high penalties on counterfeiters or the cost differential between two suppliers is substantial.},

We define probabilistic selling and customization to be complements (substitutes) as that customization increases (decreases) the value of probabilistic selling. We find that probabilistic selling and customization may be either complements or substitutes, which depends on the customization level and the product marginal cost. As long as customization level is low and product marginal cost is high, they are generally complements. The complementarity benefit comes from the fact that customization can enhance probabilistic selling’s price improvement value when the customization level is sufficiently low. In addition, the complementarity benefit reaches the maximum when the product marginal cost is sufficiently large and the customization is at an intermediate level. We further show that probabilistic selling and customization may still be complements when the customization level is endogenously determined with investment cost, when the customization service is strategically chosen by consumers, when the inventory decision is optimized with demand uncertainty, or when customization is achieved by product assortment planning.},

  abstract     = {Many firms adopt behavioral-based pricing (BBP) to customize prices for both existing and new consumers whose valuations of products are influenced by the variety-seeking behavior, that is, the tendency to pursue diversity in brand or product choices. While this behavior is common in practice, it remains underexplored in the literature. To investigate BBP in markets with variety-seeking consumers, we develop a two-period model involving two competing firms. Our findings reveal that when firms adopt BBP, a greater degree of variety-seeking among consumers mitigates first-period price competition, resulting in higher profits for the firms. The adoption of BBP increases profits when consumers exhibit a high variety-seeking degree, enhances consumer welfare when this degree is low, and can lead to mutually beneficial outcomes for both the firms and consumers. If a firm unilaterally adopts BBP, its competitor benefits when the consumer's variety-seeking degree is high. In scenarios where the firms can strategically decide whether to adopt BBP, asymmetric equilibria may arise, with only one firm choosing to implement it. The firms may strategically adopt BBP without necessarily price-discriminating consumers, as the potential for price discrimination can reduce first-period competition. When BBP is exogenously feasible, the firms experience higher profits in relation to the consumer's variety-seeking degree compared with when it is not feasible, with gains from BBP feasibility increasing as the degree of variety-seeking rises. In addition, with behavioral-based personalized pricing, that is, the firms can charge tailored prices to existing consumers, profits also increase with the consumer's variety-seeking degree. However, with behavioral-based services, that is, firms can customize prices for both new and past consumers and provide additional services to previous customers, as the consumers variety-seeking degree increases, service levels decline while profits initially decrease before they rise again. These findings highlight the distinct characteristics of BBP and elucidate various real-world operational strategies.},

  abstract     = {This work aims to jointly estimate the arrival rate of customers to a market and the nested logit model that forecasts hierarchical customer choices from an assortment of products. The estimation is based on censored transactional data, where lost sales are not recorded. The goal is to determine the arrival rate, customer taste coefficients, and nest dissimilarity parameters that maximize the likelihood of the observed data. The problem is formulated as a maximum likelihood estimation model that addresses two prevailing challenges in the existing literature: Estimating demand from data with unobservable lost sales and capturing customer taste heterogeneity arising from hierarchical choices . However, the model is intractable to solve or analyze due to the nonconcavity of the likelihood function in both taste coefficients and dissimilarity parameters. We characterize conditions under which the model parameters are identifiable. Our results reveal that the parameter identification is influenced by the diversity of products and nests . We also develop a sequential minorization-maximization algorithm to solve the problem, by which the problem boils down to solving a series of convex optimization models with simple structures. Then, we show the convergence of the algorithm by leveraging the structural properties of these models. We evaluate the performance of the algorithm by comparing it with widely used benchmarks, using both synthetic and real data.

  abstract     = {Online platforms that rely on voluntary user contributions face persistent challenges in maintaining sustained and active participation. This study investigates the effectiveness of a unique combination of social mechanisms—a group reputation system—in motivating individual voluntary contributions within the context of online prosocial crowdfunding. While a strong group identity can inspire member participation, the study also acknowledges a potential downside: a positive group reputation may “crowd out” individual contributions by signaling the efforts of other members. Using data collcted from Kiva, we empirically examine the impact of group reputation, measured in the form of group rankings, on both overall team contributions and individual member contributions. The findings indicate that teams with higher rankings experience a decline in subsequent contributions, supporting the idea of group reputation as a public good. Further analyses explore the mechanisms driving this negative impact, offering valuable insights into the dynamics of group reputation systems.},

  abstract     = {Customer service has evolved beyond in-person visits and phone calls to include live chat, AI chatbots and social media, among other contact options. Service providers typically refer to these contact modalities as “channels.” Within each channel, customer service agents are tasked with managing and resolving a stream of inbound service requests. Each request involves milestones where the agent must decide whether to keep assisting the customer or to transfer them to a more skilled—and often costlier—provider. To understand how this request resolution process should be managed, we develop a model in which each channel is represented as a gatekeeper system and characterize the structure of the optimal request resolution policy. We then turn to the broader question of the firm’s customer service design, which includes the strategic problem of which channels to deploy, the tactical questions of at what level to staff the live-agent channel and to what extent to train an AI chatbot, and the operational question of how to control the live-agent channel. Examining the interplay between strategic, tactical, and operational decisions through numerical methods, we show, among other insights, that service quality can be improved, rather than diminished, by chatbot implementation.},

Although recent research has examined operational issues in cloud computing, these papers have not analyzed the vendor base design decisions when these cloud capacity instances are procured through the reverse auction mechanism. Therefore, several important research questions are still unaddressed. For example, how should federal clients decide on the number of cloud providers for the multi-cloud strategy? How should clients decide on private cloud capacity investments along with sourcing requirements from multiple cloud providers? We find that the client’s capacity portfolio decision is determined by factors such as vendors’ cost heterogeneity and available capacity. Specifically, we find higher cost heterogeneity leads to a smaller vendor base. Interestingly and somewhat counter-intuitively, we find that higher cost heterogeneity may increase or decrease private cloud investments. We also study the client’s decision on the type of capacity instances to be procured via reverse auctions. We find federal clients should only utilize the on-demand instances mechanism (where capacity is procured after demand realization) to fulfill the cloud computing requirements. We further observe that if vendors experience capacity outages, then the client should upfront reserve capacity instances.},

  abstract     = {Facilitated by information technology and online platforms, group service has emerged in many service systems, such as one-to-many tour guide service, one-to-many tutoring courses and one-to-many medical diagnosis. We consider a service provider offering both group service and individual service and model it as a single-server queue in which customers with heterogeneous waiting costs make both joining/balking and group/individual service decisions. We solve the private provider’s service assortment and pricing strategies for profit maximization (system C), whose solution leads to six equilibrium structures. Furthermore, both equilibrium service volume and service price are nonmonotonic in the potential arrival rate, which contradicts classical theory due to the follow-the-crowd (FTC) characteristics associated with group service. This leads to a counterintuitive and novel pricing implication: sustaining full coverage in a larger market may necessitate an increase in service prices when group service is offered. We then numerically show that the optimal group size is unique. Furthermore, compared with scenarios where only individual service is provided, the simultaneous provision of both services can create a win-win-win situation, particularly when the potential arrival rate is relatively high. We extend the discussion to the scenario with a welfare-maximizing objective (system S) and show that the aforementioned results continue to hold. Furthermore, we find that the socially optimal price is lower than the profit-maximizing price, resulting in a larger total number of customers served in system S. Notably, our findings suggest that system S is more likely to provide group service and achieve full market coverage than system C.},

We construct a parsimonious model of a bilateral monopoly supply chain where the supplier can encroach through online marketplaces as both reselling and agency channels are available. Surprisingly, the encroachment option does not necessarily benefit the supplier. Unlike the traditional supplier encroachment literature, the supplier now always prefers simultaneous ordering, suggesting that more information can hurt the supplier. We further characterize the retailer’s channel offering strategy and identify a win-win region where both firms prefer encroachment (i.e., the hybrid mode).

We find that (1) enhancing the customizability of SaaS software does not necessarily benefit the SaaS vendor, nor does it necessarily harm the on-premises vendor, depending on the current level of the SaaS software's customizability; (2) The SaaS vendor generally prefers pay-per-use pricing to subscription pricing because it can not only serve more consumers but also help relieve competition pressure from the on-premises vendor; (3) Adopting a hybrid model is not necessarily profit enhancing. Specifically, while the SaaS vendor always benefits from adopting a hybrid pricing strategy, the on-premises vendor may be better off by either not offering or offering a SaaS version with limited customizability, even if it does not make sales. Nevertheless, both vendors adopting a hybrid model leads to socially efficient competition outcome, where both vendors and consumers are better off, a win-win-win scenario.},

  abstract     = {With the increasingly uncertain future of brick-and-mortar (B&M) retailing, companies are exploring new ways to avoid the high costs associated with maintaining traditional, full-service retail stores. One solution, pop-up stores, has gained popularity in recent years. This paper uses empirical evidence from a leading U.S. retailer to examine the value of pop-up retailing. Specifically, we focus on pop-up stores operated by a traditional multichannel retailer over 3 years and examine their impact on customer demand and order fulfillment in the short run and long run. We further evaluate whether the impact of a pop-up store is sensitive to its operational terms, including whether it is a first-time or returning “pop-up” to a market region and the duration of the store. Using a quasi-field experiment, we find that having pop-up stores leads to an expansion in the overall demand during and after operations, indicating a spillover effect that extends beyond a pop-up store's limited operational window. From an operational perspective, our empirical evidence suggests that customers migrate from the online channel to pop-up stores for faster demand fulfillment. Moreover, recurring pop-up stores are slightly less effective at stimulating local demand than first-time pop-up stores. Finally, results reveal that pop-up stores are not as effective as permanent stores in generating demand; however, the flexibility in operations still makes pop-up stores an attractive physical retail format, especially for exploring markets with modest potential.},

We analyze competition among two platforms, with one platform collecting data in market 1 where it is dominant, using it to improve its competitive edge in market 2 where it competes in both prices and advertisements with the other platform. Our analysis unearths a novel anti-competitive effect of competition—that increased market 2 competition may increase the dominant firm’s market power in market 1, which in turn leads to several interesting results. First, that data collection by the dominant firm is increasing in market 2 competition. Second, efficiency of data collection is non-monotonic in the level of competition; being, from a welfare perspective, excessive (respectively low) whenever market competition is at an intermediate level (respectively weak). We then use this framework to examine several policy proposals—user control of data, blocking data-driven mergers, restricting data collection, and allowing data-sharing—deriving actionable prescriptions for managers and policymakers. For example, in markets with effective ad-targeting, we find that user control of data decreases data collection, thus improving privacy, if and only if competition is strong.},

  abstract     = {How will peer pressure among sellers affect their operations in an online marketplace? Motivated by online platforms’ marketplace designs that prompt sellers to compare their performances, in this paper, we develop and study a price competition model in which sellers account for both profits and peer comparison outcomes. In our model, two sellers offer substitutable products, and each of them sets a price ex ante to maximize their expected total utility, which is the sum of one’s profit and the payoff from peer comparison. In particular, peer comparison takes place ex post based on sellers’ realized sales. It results in a penalty for one’s underperformance (i.e., sellers are behind-averse) or a reward for outperformance (i.e., sellers are ahead-seeking) relative to the other seller. Contrary to what extant research on social comparison would predict, we find that peer comparison is not always pro-competitive. Indeed, while the behind-aversion aspect of peer comparison fosters competition, the ahead-seeking aspect can be anti-competitive when the market uncertainty is sufficiently large. This is because market uncertainty causes a greater variation in sellers’ performance disparity ex post ( uncertainty effect ), which can have a more salient impact on sellers than the expectation of their performance gap ( comparison effect ); While sellers’ behind-aversion further aggravates the uncertainty effect and encourages them to take more aggressive actions, their ahead-seeking counterbalances the tension by absorbing part of it into the comparison effect and moderating the marginal disutility of lagging behind. Overall, we find that peer comparison can intensify sellers’ price competition, which lowers the expected profits and utilities for both sellers, benefits the consumers, and reduces the hosting platform’s profit. Our main insights are robust in a number of extensions, including general demand specifications, seller asymmetry, sellers’ misperceptions of market uncertainties, and consumers’ reference-dependent decision-making. They highlight the importance of sellers’ behavioral regularities in online platforms’ daily operations and shed light on marketplace designs regarding algorithmic transparency, information sharing, and so forth.},

Using large-scale property-level customer reviews, we then traced down individual review-level content features describing host support that can explain the impact of home sharing on attraction experiences. Specifically, the mechanism centers on local travel support from hosts who provide saving tips, share attraction knowledge, and facilitate travel planning while consumers stay at their home sharing properties. We further explore the intriguing heterogeneity of the home sharing impact, unveiling the unintended consequence of overtourism, especially at nationally renowned attractions and during peak season. Finally and fortunately, host support manifests to mitigate the negative impact of home sharing and remains a potential solution to address overtourism. Collectively, these findings add evidence to the sophisticated roles of home sharing in local markets and provide timely implications on customer experience management to service operation practitioners and attraction stakeholders.},

In each scenario, we characterize the structure of the optimal promotion policy (OPP). We categorize the two kinds of OPPs based on the retailer’s objective as profit-based and clearance-based OPPs. If customers are homogeneous, we show that B1G y policies are always optimal. However, if they are heterogeneous, B1G y policies may not maximize profit, resulting in a complex structure for profit-based OPPs. Therefore, we focus on B1G0, B1G1, and B2G1 policies due to their prevalence among retailers. We then derive how both kinds of OPPs change with quantity. We explain the impact of quantity using the ideas of bundling effect and differentiation effect . We perform a numerical study to examine (i) the impact of the two kinds of OPPs on profit and waste, and (ii) the impact of demand uncertainty.

  abstract     = {Cardiac arrests are a significant health concern in the United States, as more than 350,000 occur annually and 90% of them are fatal. Providing quick access to automated external defibrillators is paramount since irreversible damage to vital organs occurs within minutes without cardiopulmonary resuscitation and defibrillation. We propose a novel optimization model to design a network of drones delivering automated external defibrillators in response to out-of-hospital cardiac arrests. The network is modeled as a collection of queues in which the occurrence of cardiac arrests is modeled as a Poisson process while the drone service times and the arrival of cardiac arrest requests at drone bases are random variables whose distribution parameters are determined endogenously. The model is formulated as a fractional integer problem with bilinear terms and minimizes the average response time which is conducive to maximizing the chance of survival of patients. We derive a mixed-integer linear reformulation and develop an exact solution method that includes a warm-start approach and new optimality-based bound tightening models. We use real-life cardiac arrest data (i) to derive healthcare insights about the impact of delivery mode and drone technology on response time and probability of survival, (ii) to showcase the dependency of the service rate and response time on the utilization of drones and the need to endogenize the response time, and (iii) to ascertain the computational efficiency and scalability of our approach. The cross-validation analysis confirms the robustness of the model and its applicability to unseen out-of-hospital cardiac arrest data.},

  abstract     = {Generic drugs provide lifesaving, affordable treatment to millions of people each day. Generic drug manufacturing has been steadily moving from advanced economies, such as the U.S., to emerging economies, such as India. Due to the opacity of drug supply chains, the quality risk implications of manufacturing in emerging economies have not been carefully empirically tested. This study addresses this gap. To do so, we identify a novel source of drug manufacturing location data that allows us to compare the occurrence of serious adverse events of generic drugs made in different locations. Using exact matching analyses based on the equivalency criteria established by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, we find that generic drugs manufactured in India, where a majority of emerging economy generic drugs are made, are associated with significantly higher instances of serious adverse events than equivalent generic drugs made in the U.S., where a majority of advanced economy generic drugs are made. We further show that this key result is explained by mature generic drugs, which are particularly susceptible to operations and supply chain cost reduction efforts—efforts that unfortunately may compromise drug quality. Our study finding leads to implications for the FDA in their regulation of generic drugs.},

  abstract     = {Despite increasing investments in Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) initiatives and practices, firms often fail to meet public expectations, causing ESG incidents. While firms often choose to remain silent after an incident, we argue that this is not attractive to firms anymore on social media platforms, where consumers and stakeholders can freely share information and concerns. That is, firms tend to use official social media accounts to increase communication frequency and communicate with stakeholders about the incidents (i.e., incident-related posts) after the occurrences. We are also interested in the extent to which firms would adjust their use of social media in terms of non-incident-related posts, as the current prevailing practical advice and studies offer contradicting predictions. Using data from different sources, we construct an event-based firm-day dataset and empirically show that firms significantly increase the number of social media posts after ESG incidents. The impact is more salient for firms in consumer-oriented industries and when the incident is more impactful. Using a semi-supervised, dictionary-based approach, we delve into the content of tweets and demonstrate that firms are inclined to increase both the number of incident-related and the number of non-incident-related tweets after an ESG incident. The follow-up analyses at the incident level indicate that firms that post more after an ESG incident experience a better reaction from the capital market, especially for customer-oriented firms or incidents that receive high attention from the traditional media.},

  abstract     = {Over the past two decades, there has been a rise in localized terrorist organizations that have seized control of geographical regions, leading to intricate spatial topological relations between areas controlled by terrorists and those populated by civilians. Given the complexity and duration of counter-terrorism operations, governments must continually adapt their strategies to defeat terrorists in diverse geographical configurations. These operations can be protracted and expensive, with numerous factors influencing their success. We develop a framework to investigate four spatial topological relations: no overlap between opposing forces, partial overlap, government-controlled regions within terrorist-held areas, and terrorist-controlled regions within government-controlled areas. We determine whether government forces should start strikes and, if so, analyze the allocation of resources between airstrikes and ground operations. Additionally, we assess the maximum acceptable level of civilian casualties resulting from mistaken airstrikes. Further, using an evolutionary game, we conduct an equilibrium analysis of disruptive technologies and strategies—such as unmanned aerial vehicles used by governments and the deployment of homemade rockets and bluffing tactics by terrorists—in long-term operations, examining their impact on government strike decisions. Our findings show that achieving complete success requires carefully chosen airstrike- or ground-oriented counter-terrorism operations based on their comparative advantages, while avoiding over-concentration or excessive averaging in resource allocation. In conclusion, our parsimonious framework and associated results contribute to informed optimal decision-making in counter-terrorism operations, taking into account the tradeoff between the strike resources and the disruptive offensive-defensive measures within various geographical relations between opposing forces.},

  abstract     = {We analyze product reusability, executed through refurbishment, amid supply disruptions. Consumers trade in used units, which can later be refurbished and sold. Using a three-period model, we determine the optimal reusability level, trade-in and refurbishment policies, trade-in fee, and the prices of new and refurbished units. Our analysis provides a useful framework to understand the interaction between a firm's choice of product reusability and the possibility of supply disruptions. First, we establish a threshold refurbishment policy: the firm refurbishes more as reusability increases but avoids refurbishment at low reusability. When both consumer valuation of used units and supply disruption probability are high, the firm builds a safety-stock of traded-in units, which it refrains from refurbishing when there is no supply disruption, unless the product reusability level is sufficiently high. Second, we find that it benefits to increase product reusability as the supply disruption risk increases until a certain threshold. Beyond this threshold, it is advantageous for the firm to reduce reusability and save on design costs to be profitable, contrary to popular belief. Our numerical examples reveal that the firm reduces reusability when production cost is high due to narrow margins. Finally, we demonstrate that the firm shares the benefits of higher product reusability with its consumers through higher trade-in fees and lower refurbished unit prices. This results in a “Pareto-efficient” win for the firm, its trade-in customers, and purchasers of refurbished units. Thus, our analysis offers insights for product designers on how supply disruption influences reusability choices in products.},

Utilizing the exogenous disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic as the setting for quasi-natural experiments, we compare profit impact and time-to-recover across manufacturing firms that operated with varied levels of inventory and SCPS use in the period leading up to the onset of the pandemic. The results of multiple tests provide no evidence that inventory buffering aided firms in being more resilient, even for firms in industries that experienced positive demand shocks during the pandemic. In contrast, we find that firms that used SCPS evidenced fewer negative financial impacts throughout the disruptive period, and they recovered faster than their peers. The results are robust to sample characteristics, time frame, and control-group matching procedures. Our study extends a growing literature on supply chain resilience by offering a more refined explanation of IPT in a disruptive context, highlighting the limitations of inventory as a buffering tactic, and describing how SCPSs help planners cope with uncertainty and disruptions. In addition, interviews with managers from a leading SCPS provider and from user firms highlight specific ways in which SCPSs provide faster and more effective responses to disruptions. We discuss the implications of these findings for future research.},

  abstract     = {When a competitor enters a market, incumbent retail stores often adjust their product variety to avoid sales loss. However, no empirical evidence has been provided in the literature to justify the value of such product variety adjustments after a rival's entry. One difficulty is that the change in consumer demand due to rival's entry and changes in product variety simultaneously affect incumbents’ sales. When changes in sales at incumbent stores are observed after rivals’ entries, it is unclear whether the sales changes result from product variety adjustments or changes in consumer demand directly resulting from the entry. Even if adjusting product variety can potentially mitigate sales loss due to rivals’ entries, it is unclear whether such product variety adjustments provide a universal solution to all incumbent stores. This paper applies the difference-in-difference research design to develop a system of equations for product variety and sales at incumbent stores after rivals’ entries by exploiting the entries of warehouse clubs. The findings reveal that, on average, product variety at incumbent stores increased after the entries. This increased product variety mitigates the sales decreases caused by the entries with a diminishing return. After the entry of a warehouse club store, incumbent stores collocated with the new store have less sales loss than the noncollocated stores due to the trade-off between the substitution and agglomeration effects. Product variety adjustments at collocated incumbent stores experience greater sales benefits than noncollocated stores. Moreover, the sales loss that was mitigated by increased product variety at incumbent stores within the retail category of entrants is larger than others after the entry of a warehouse club store. Interestingly, the mitigation effect is not significant for certain incumbents, such as convenience and drug stores, which belong to different retail categories from entrants. This study also explores the heterogeneous effects by investigating preexisting competition and different warehouse club chains. The empirical findings offer valuable insights to managers of incumbent stores on how to adjust product variety to reduce sales loss resulting from a rival's entry.},

While online social media platforms have employed automated methods to combat fake news, they face two notable challenges: the scarcity of labeled data and the diversity of news domains. To enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of online platforms in mitigating the spread of fake news, this study proposes MT-GPD (multimodal deep transfer learning with gating network, model patch, and domain classifier) for cross-domain fake news detection. MT-GPD integrates three novel design artifacts as auxiliary mechanisms for enhancing multimodal deep transfer learning, including a gating network that captures the relative importance of textual and visual components of individual news articles for dynamic fusion; a customized model patch that balances detection performance and computational efficiency; and a domain classifier that adapts multimodal representations to a target news domain. We evaluate the performance of MT-GPD using news datasets spanning four different domains. The results demonstrate the efficacy and robustness of MT-GPD, providing strong evidence for the impacts of the proposed auxiliary mechanisms on improving fake news detection performance.},

This positive effect of bond market transparency enhancements on supplier innovation is weakened when major customers demonstrate a better information environment, have higher levels of institutional ownership, and share common institutional investors with suppliers, while strengthened when the bond market conveys positive information about major customers, and when major customers face tighter financial constraints, exhibit higher levels of risk-taking, and possess greater importance to suppliers.

  abstract     = {In reusable resources like vehicle sharing, city parking, and hotel services, resource units are used by consecutive customers for a stochastic usage time and are made available for future customers upon return. We model such reusable resources as Erlang loss systems, where customers who find all units occupied are blocked. Customers are rational decision-makers, and their willingness to join the system depends on factors such as price, time limits, service value, and resource availability. When each customer is charged a fixed price, we examine whether it is beneficial to install time limits, which increase availability at the expense of reduced usage time. We formulate and solve a two-dimensional revenue maximization problem to optimize both the usage price and the time limit. We differentiate between on-demand resources, which are immediately reusable upon return, and reserved resources, which can only be reused after the time limit expires. With on-demand resources, setting a time limit is proven to be detrimental, making the entry price the sole tool for maximizing revenue. This conclusion remains valid when the usage time increases with the entry price. In contrast, managing reserved resources involves an interplay between time limits and entry prices. Additionally, we show that loss systems (where customers do not wait) should be managed differently from systems where customers do wait. Specifically, in systems with waiting, we prove that only the time limit should be optimized, while the entry price should capture the full market share. We prove our results by analyzing the behavior of the equilibrium arrival rate and revenue, which necessitates establishing novel properties for the blocking probability. These properties yield new sharp bounds for the blocking probability and enable us to prove the convergence of the optimized model for on-demand resources to the quality-and-efficiency-drivenregime as the number of resource units grows.},

We examine two waiting room designs: The designated waiting room , where each server has its own designated waiting area, and the shared waiting room , where all customers are waiting together. In the designated waiting room design, customers observe the number of customers waiting for each service, whereas in the shared waiting room, customers cannot distinguish which service the other customers are waiting for, but can still observe the total number of customers in the waiting room and make a joining/balking decision accordingly. Assuming two types of customers that have similar characteristics seeking service from two different servers, we show that all customers adopt an identical pure equilibrium threshold. We find the shared waiting room design achieves higher throughput than the designated waiting room design when the congestion rate is low. However, the designated waiting room is always preferable in terms of social welfare. Furthermore, we extend our analysis to the asymmetric case, where types differ from each other in terms of arrival rate, service reward, per unit-time waiting cost, and service duration. Finding the equilibrium strategies in these cases is more challenging and requires an iterative process. We show that mixed equilibrium thresholds can emerge, and that the designated waiting room does not always improve system performance, even when considering social welfare.},

  abstract     = {This paper investigates how a manufacturer’s internal sourcing capability and government regulation influence the supplier’s distribution strategy and the manufacturer’s sourcing and capability investment decisions. We consider a supply chain consisting of a supplier that produces a critical component, an independent manufacturer that also has the capability to produce the component in-house, and a dependent manufacturer without such capability. We first consider a scenario in which the supplier chooses its distribution strategy—either offering its component to both manufacturers or establishing an exclusive selling agreement with a single manufacturer. We explore how the supplier’s optimal distribution strategy (dual or exclusive selling) depends on the terms and process of the contract and on the independent manufacturer’s ability to produce a high-quality component in-house. We also show that, in equilibrium, the independent manufacturer may invest in a high capability level (leading to a high-quality component) as a strategic deterrent against the supplier’s decision to engage in an exclusive selling agreement with the dependent manufacturer. We further consider a setting with mandatory exclusion, imposed by government regulation, that affects free trade among parties. We show that mandatory exclusion can exacerbate or mitigate the independent manufacturer’s incentive to invest in internal sourcing capability, relative to a setting in which the supplier determines its distribution strategy in the absence of such government regulations.

  abstract     = {Do firms voluntarily disclosing emissions have lower levels of greenhouse gases in their in-house and outsourced operations? We examine this question using Scope 1 and upstream Scope 3 emission data reported by firms or estimated by S&P Trucost from 2002 to 2020. Our empirical results reveal that “voluntary disclosing firms” tend to have lower levels of “internal emissions” (i.e., Scope 1 emissions) and yet higher levels of “external emissions” from upstream suppliers (i.e., estimated upstream Scope 3 emissions). Overall, disclosing firms tend to have more emissions in the entire supply chain. A plausible explanation is that they may outsource more emissions to upstream suppliers than non-disclosing firms. By exploring the potential mechanisms that explain our results, we find that disclosing firms tend to exert more effort to reduce their internal emissions and outsource more carbon-intensive operations to suppliers. This finding is consistent with their decreasing Scope 1 emissions and increasing Scope 3 emissions. In addition to examining differences in emissions between high- and low-emission industries and across regions, we also investigate the implications of mandatory environmental reporting regulations by different governments and find these regulations can effectively nudge disclosing firms to reduce total emissions, including Scope 1 and Scope 3. As more regulations require the disclosure of Scope 3 emissions, our findings highlight the necessity for firms to develop processes and exert efforts to measure, monitor, and control both in-house and outsourced emissions. Additionally, our findings indicate that Environmental, Social, and Governance investment managers should perform due diligence rather than solely relying on firms that disclose their Scope 1 emissions.},

However, empirical investigations into the externalities and opportunity costs of queuing in multitasking scenarios are limited. This paper reports on two laboratory experiments that compare a queue-based rule with a lottery-based rule by quantifying their respective efficiency losses. Our findings indicate that while the queue-based rule demonstrates superior allocative efficiency, it incurs significant losses in productive efficiency attributed to opportunity costs of time. In contrast, the lottery-based rule exhibits improved overall efficiency with minimal time spent on the booking system. Additionally, under the queue-based rule, participants display bimodal behavior, either engaging fully or abstaining from the booking system, influenced by their time valuations. Furthermore, while providing queue length information facilitates more efficient coordination, it also leads to more frequent task-switching behavior that negates any productive efficiency gained from improved coordination. This research underscores the crucial need to reevaluate allocation mechanisms in booking systems, taking into account their externalities.},

  abstract     = {Prior to the Internet, many industries catering to mass audiences, particularly entertainment industries, tended to have very skewed sales distributions with most sales volume accruing to a small share of products (titles) generally known by terms such as “blockbusters.” The long tail hypothesis claims that increased Internet usage will weaken the dominance of blockbusters in these industries, so that the large number of obscure products, in aggregate, will become an important, perhaps primary, portion of the market. Such a change would have significant implications for firms’ operations. We test this hypothesis for the book industry with two analyses. First, using unusually rich data on book sales, we examine the temporal share of sales taken by niche titles as Internet retailing grew from obscurity to ubiquity. Changes in the distribution of sales by title popularity are weakly consistent with the direction of the hypothesis but not with the magnitude. Second, we exploit the 2011 bankruptcy of the Borders bookstore chain, and the resulting sudden shutdown of all its physical stores as a natural experiment. This analysis also finds a shift in sales away from the most successful titles. But the major beneficiaries are not the most obscure titles but instead titles that would regularly be found in most bookstores. Both analyses support a version of the long tail where the share of obscure titles changes from one very small value to a somewhat greater but still very small value. These results are inconsistent with proposed radical changes in management practices to accommodate a presumed large increase in product variety.},

However, ensuring timely one-on-one AHH services for homebound patients remains a challenge because of cascading delays arising from uncertainties in travel and service times. To address this issue in last-mile homecare delivery, we develop a systematic cascading delay mitigation strategy to ensure patients receive dependable homecare services. Specifically, we introduce a compound set reliability index ( CSRI ) that captures risk exposure by separately characterizing distinct travel and service time uncertainties, instead of approaching them as a single type of uncertainty in previous studies. The CSRI -based service-level constraints are then integrated into a set-partitioning formulation to mitigate the cascading delays. We devise an exact branch-price-and-cut framework and employ a variable neighborhood search metaheuristic to achieve fast-effective solutions. Numerical experiments with benchmark and real-world datasets validate the effectiveness of our methods, underscore the benefits of adopting a systematic cascading delay mitigation strategy, and provide insights to AHH service providers regarding the impact of crucial managerial parameters on delay manifestation. The CSRI constraints and dedicated solution methods can effectively support practical decision-making and enhance the punctuality of AHH services, leading to better service dependability and heightened stakeholder satisfaction.},

  abstract     = {The advance in e-commerce has provided firms with more options when designing their channel structures. The rise of “beyond profit” managerial doctrine has also added complexity to channel design. Extending the literature in distribution channels that focuses on for-profit firms, this paper develops a stylized model to examine the channel design problem for a socially responsible manufacturer who pursues a dual-purpose objective—the manufacturer values both profit and consumer surplus. We compare three channel structures: Direct selling (centralization), retailing only (decentralization), and the hybrid of both the direct and indirect channels. We show that double marginalization rooted in the retail channel can alleviate the manufacturer’s loss in profit due to her pursuit of consumer surplus. Thus, compared to direct selling, retailing only may lead to a higher profit for the manufacturer (even when the manufacturer’s direct channel is as efficient as the retail channel) and a higher conversion efficiency in boosting consumer surplus at the expense of the manufacturer’s profit. In the hybrid channel analysis, we show that the manufacturer’s pursuit of consumer surplus leads to upward distortion of direct sales. Facing competition from direct sales, the retailer becomes less sensitive to the wholesale price, and the manufacturer has to reduce the wholesale price significantly to boost the retailer’s order quantity, leading to serious downward wholesale price distortion when the consumer focus is high. Counterintuitively, we find that as the selling cost disadvantage in direct selling increases, the manufacturer with a higher consumer focus increases the wholesale price to rely more on direct selling. We also find that the hybrid structure may cause loss in profit due to price and quantity distortions, leading to lower manufacturer utility and conversion efficiency compared to the single-channel structures. We also provide several extensions to show the robustness of our main findings and offer further insights for channel design for dual-purpose organizations.},

  abstract     = {Crowdfunded Supply Chain Finance (SCF) represents a novel market design that transforms financial flows within the SCF paradigm. It enables crowd investors to serve as financers, lending vital working capital to suppliers facing liquidity problems. A distinctive feature of this market is the mandatory involvement of loan guarantors, which facilitates repeated interactions between investors and fundraisers, potentially fostering investor learning. To understand how such learning dynamics shape investor decision-making, we develop a Bayesian learning model that conceptualizes investor perceptions of guarantor reliability as a subjective attitude underlying the perceived risk of a loan listing. The model posits that investors can learn about a guarantor's reliability through a series of scheduled repayments involving the same guarantor over time. We consider investor decision-making a joint process comprising two interdependent components: (a) the incidence decision of whether to invest and (b) the amount decision of how much to invest. Our results reveal that investor perceptions of guarantor reliability play a crucial role in shaping both decisions, albeit in distinct ways. While perceived reliability exerts a positive, monotonic effect on amount decisions, its impact on incidence decisions follows an inverted U-shaped pattern. Furthermore, perceived reliability attenuates the positive effect of loan interest rates on both decisions, suggesting that the appeal of higher returns diminishes as investors’ reliability perceptions increase. A posterior analysis further shows that offering high interest rates may become counterproductive when perceived reliability is sufficiently high. These findings provide actionable implications for platform designers and participants in crowdfunded SCF markets.},

  abstract     = {Using a large sample of supplier–firm relationships, we develop new measures to operationalize the industrial and geographical concentrations of firms’ upstream industries. The developed measures show an upstream industry might be competitive and contain many suppliers (low industrial concentration) and yet be concentrated in a few countries (high geopolitical concentration) or a small geographical area (high geographical concentration), thus leaving the downstream firm vulnerable to geographical or geopolitical disruptions. Using COVID-19 as an exogenous shock, we document that the firms whose upstream suppliers are operating in industries that have high concentration (either geographically or geopolitically), on average, experienced a reduction of 250 million US dollars in quarterly sales. Thus, competitive industries with ample suppliers may still impose significant risks on downstream firms if the upstream suppliers’ industries are concentrated mainly in a few countries or small geographical areas. Noteworthy, we find evidence that the link between upstream suppliers’ industry-level concentrations and downstream firms’ sales growth is heterogeneous. Specifically, firms can mitigate the negative relationship by adjusting their supply chain networks. The negative relationship is weaker for firms with a geopolitically diversified supply base and firms with more domestic suppliers. Our estimates are robust and consistently identified through several different empirical strategies. Our findings help policymakers and managers to systematically identify locations in supply networks that have the potential to create bottlenecks that may even threaten national security. Additionally, the proposed measures give policymakers insights into which industries to support for onshoring.},

Tapes are the technology of choice for long-term storage due to their reliability, low costs, security, and significant energy savings. However, physical limitations on tape pose challenges to policy implementation, which must be scalable on low-power hardware. We provide a theoretical and numerical analysis of existing policies and introduce new ones, identifying cases where each is applicable and evaluating their theoretical performance in terms of the number of requested files. In particular, we show that the standard first-in, first-out (FIFO) policy can be arbitrarily inefficient and investigate novel constant-ratio approximations and polynomial-time procedures. If data on the frequency with which each file is accessed is available, we consider a dynamic programming procedure to minimize a stochastic variant of the problem, providing a constant-time approximation for arbitrary file requests. We also investigate a quality criterion based on makespan and explore online variants of the problem. Our numerical analysis, conducted on both synthetic and real-world data from an industry partner, offers insights into when each policy is most appropriate, identifying cases where the proposed algorithms significantly outperform traditional policies, like FIFO, in terms of average reading times. This study has managerial implications, as current data retrieval practices in data centers are often limited to traditional policies with unknown theoretical performance. Our methodological and numerical analysis provides evidence of the value in appropriately sequencing requests based on tape structure, guiding algorithm choice and highlighting underlying trade-offs in response times.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, patients have increasing autonomy in medical decision-making. With great autonomy in selecting medical institutions, patients with low-risk diseases may opt for treatment in prestigious hospitals, which limits the access of patients with high-risk diseases to these hospitals. Moreover, due to limited medical knowledge and a fear of uncertainty regarding diseases, patients with greater medical autonomy may request various unnecessary medical tests to alleviate their health-related anxiety. This study takes a novel patients’ perspective to investigate how dockless bike sharing, which addresses the “last-mile problem” and improves geographical accessibility to medical institutions, affects two types of ineffective use of medical resources: disease-institution mismatch and overuse of medical tests. By introducing the concept of quality-accessibility trade-off in patients’ decision-making processes, we shed light on the psychological mechanism underlying the effect of dockless bike sharing on patients’ medical institution choices. We also introduce a new concept, perceived necessity of medical tests, to explain how dockless bike sharing reduces unnecessary medical tests. In Study 1, we designed a quasi-experiment and applied a difference-in-differences model based on real-world electronic health record data to show that dockless bike sharing increased the likelihood of patients choosing hospitals over clinics and decreased the number of unnecessary medical tests. In Studies 2a, 2b, 3a, and 3b, four randomized controlled experiments were employed to replicate the findings and reveal the underlying mechanisms. In sum, we found that dockless bike sharing acted as a “double-edged sword” in terms of its impact on exacerbating disease-institution mismatch and alleviating the overuse of medical tests. This study makes significant theoretical contributions to the Operations Management, sharing economy, and medical resource management literature.

  abstract     = {The emergence of the sharing economy has catalyzed the proliferation of online knowledge payment platforms, empowering individuals possessing untapped knowledge to engage as sellers. Within this landscape, reputation plays a pivotal role in shaping the sales dynamics of knowledge products, which are categorized as credence goods. Unlike conventional sellers, who typically focus on internal reputation-building efforts, knowledge providers have the opportunity to cultivate an external reputation through their professional contributions beyond the platform, potentially influencing sales within it. However, the relative impact of internal and external reputation on driving sales remains uncertain. Our study addresses this gap by investigating the influence of a knowledge provider's internal and external reputation on sales across two phases of live knowledge-sharing lectures—pre and post-live broadcast—using data obtained from a prominent online knowledge payment platform. Our findings reveal that both internal and external reputation positively impact sales during both phases. Furthermore, our analysis indicates that the type of product moderates the effect of reputation on sales, with internal reputation exerting a greater influence on sales of hedonic products, while external reputation has a stronger effect on sales of utilitarian products. These discoveries contribute to technology operations management by providing theoretical insights into the formulation and implementation of innovative strategies aimed at enhancing the sales performance of knowledge-based products. Our findings underscore the importance of integrating distinct reputation-building approaches into the design of reputation systems, thereby charting a course toward achieving successful product sales in the realm of online knowledge payment platforms.},

In the presence of product competition, SM selling can affect the prices and sales of the markdown product as well as the upgraded product. Therefore, in this study, we analyze impacts of the manufacturer’s choice of delegation. Our analytical findings reveal that the SM selling strongly influences the equilibrium price and the demand for the markdown product offered by the manufacturer under all the mechanisms. However, demand cannibalization of the markdown product is most severe under the delegation mechanism. Additionally, we counter-intuitively reveal that the manufacturer is better-off under the delegation mechanism when the sales commission is low and remanufacturing cost is high. In fact, the delegation mechanism is found to be the most profitable arrangement for the manufacturer as well as the TPF. Interestingly, demand for the upgraded version product remains unaffected by SM sales under the independent TPF mechanism, allowing the manufacturer to launch the upgraded version product without any fear of demand cannibalization. Furthermore, we discover that consumers secure the maximum surplus under the competitive scenario owing to intense price competitiveness. For robustness checking, we further extend our model to consider the cases with variable remanufacturing cost, differential emission cost, environmental cost, and collection rate of used product.},

  abstract     = {In-game purchases have become the dominant source of revenue for developers of digital games and are critical to the growth of the digital game industry. However, the distribution of in-game purchases among gamers is highly skewed, where a very small proportion of gamers, labeled “whales,” account for the majority of in-game purchases, and a massive proportion of non-whales spend a minuscule amount. In this study, we explore how to improve in-game purchases by examining gamers’ underlying beliefs. We postulate that compared to spending on other forms of entertainment, in-game purchases suffer from an unusual set of negative beliefs that work against such purchases. We conduct four consecutive studies related to the negative beliefs, propose an approach to mitigate their impact on in-game purchases, and explain the heterogeneous effects of the proposed approach. Specifically, in study 1, we demonstrate the existence of negative beliefs. In Study 2, we identify five key types of negative beliefs. In Study 3, we develop an approach to reduce the negativity of these beliefs and improve gamers’ positive attitudes toward in-game purchases. Lastly, in Study 4, we examine reasons behind heterogeneous results from Study 3 on different gaming platforms and using different revenue models, and design more tailored approaches to incentivize in-game purchases for pay-to-play games and gamers on console platforms. Collectively, the findings in this paper reveal a set of overlooked factors that hinder in-game purchases and introduce a low-cost, effective technique that has the potential to influence gamers’ spending behaviors. Our findings extend beyond a single-game genre or platform and offer potential benefits to the entire digital game industry.},

  abstract     = {We study the design of a novel, flexible revenue-sharing contract between a platform and an app developer (or other digital content provider) when the parties hold heterogeneous beliefs with regard to the future income. The current contracts adopted by platforms in reality invoke a policy of two or three commission levels based on historical revenue data. We design a contract in which the commission is a continuous function of the revenue generated by the app or other digital content within the current period. In contrast to the majority of prior studies in operations management, which analyze the homogeneous beliefs scenario, we introduce heterogeneous beliefs, which turn out to be a crucial consideration in designing the contract structure. We use game theory and calculus of variations to derive the conditions to be satisfied by the flexible contract. Two criteria are used to evaluate the performance of the proposed flexible contract: the benefit gained by each party and the complexity of the negotiation (measured by the number of contract terms). The best linear contract serves as a performance benchmark. We show that the flexible contract has the potential to enhance the relationship between platforms and digital content providers. In particular, using extensive numerical analysis (based on 99,225 instances in a full factorial design), we demonstrate that the proposed contract may yield an improvement in expected profits of more than 100% compared with the best linear contract, and we identify the conditions under which the flexible contract achieves a substantial improvement relative to the benchmark. Moreover, the flexible contract outperforms the best linear contract in 99% of cases—the former is either more profitable while entailing the same level of negotiation complexity, or it has the same profitability but a lower level of negotiation complexity. In the remaining 1% of studied cases, the flexible contract is preferable in terms of profitability, but the best linear contract involves less negotiation friction, such that neither contract dominates the other. Based on real data, we demonstrate the applicability and advantages of the flexible contract for a scenario within the video games industry.},

  abstract     = {The increasing frequency of traffic accidents involving food delivery drivers has raised public concern about the safety of fast delivery services. In response, food delivery platforms have introduced two corporate social responsibility (CSR) strategies to enhance drivers’ road safety: One in which the platform assumes full responsibility for extending delivery times and another that empowers consumers to decide on extended delivery times. Additionally, policymakers are mandating that platforms purchase employment injury insurance for their drivers. Despite these efforts, debates continue over how platforms should adjust delivery times to mitigate driver risk and whether new driver protection policies are truly effective. In this study, we employ the Hotelling model to examine a duopoly food delivery market in which consumers are socially responsible, time-sensitive, and exhibit heterogeneous loyalty to competing platforms. Building on the consumer empowerment framework, we investigate the optimal CSR strategy choices for these platforms and assess the resulting impacts on various stakeholders. Our analysis provides three key insights. First, we demonstrate that offering differentiated extended delivery time options can mitigate the negative impact of consumer aversion to empowerment on platform profitability, especially in markets with a significant consumer heterogeneity in time sensitivity. Second, we identify a potential all-win CSR outcome, wherein positively shaping consumer attitudes benefits all stakeholders, a possibility often overlooked in practice. Third, we surprisingly find that the widely adopted protective measure, namely the mandatory insurance policy (MIP), does not effectively mitigate driver risk. In contrast, our proposed risk-based MIP addresses this limitation and allows consumers who actively participate in CSR initiatives to benefit from a lower markup on delivery fees. These insights offer a refined analytical framework for understanding consumer empowerment, providing valuable guidance for researchers, platform operations managers, and policymakers.},

  abstract     = {Peer-to-peer (P2P) platforms facilitate the direct exchange of goods, services, or financial transactions between individuals without the involvement of intermediaries. To maintain trust among their user bases, these platforms must implement stringent access controls to determine which users are eligible to participate in their digital marketplace. We argue that when a platform transitions from private to public ownership, it may be incentivized to strategically lower its access standards and admit users who might otherwise have been deemed unqualified. Lowering standards before an initial public offering (IPO) can enable platforms to rapidly increase their user base—and, consequently, enhance their perceived valuation—which could appeal to stock investors and positively influence the IPO price. While this strategy may bolster short-term growth, it could be costly to the platform’s user base. We support this hypothesis using data from two major P2P lending platforms—one that went public and one that remained private. Using a difference-in-differences analysis, we find that the platform preparing for an IPO admitted borrowers who exhibited higher risk levels. Additionally, lenders, in some cases, did not effectively screen out these subpar borrowers and ended up issuing loans to them, leading to higher default rates and lower returns for the lenders. This effect was particularly evident for a specific segment of lenders—namely, those who brokered small-valued loans and loans for necessary purchases (e.g., health emergencies). By contrast, lenders who screened for large-valued loans or loans for discretionary expenditures (e.g., vacations or weddings) were more successful in screening out these subpar borrowers and not issuing loans to them. These results fill a gap in the operations management literature on platform governance by integrating capital-raising objectives into the discussion of access control and operational screening. Our study highlights the nuanced trade-off between quality control and user expansion during capital-raising events, emphasizing both the opportunities and potential inefficiencies that arise in this context.},

We model the platform-customer interaction with a Stackelberg game and explicitly characterize customers’ optimal charging decisions under the platform’s various service plans. In a general scenario that involves charging requests within a transportation network, we develop a joint optimization model for the platform’s pricing and service fulfillment, utilizing an elaborately constructed augmented network. In addition, we explore a localized subproblem where multiple orders are concentrated within a specific region. With a simplified model structure, we propose an approximation algorithm with provable performance guarantees and further theoretically evaluate the resource consumption and associated platform benefits for serving the orders in each region. The results enable the batching of neighboring demands within the general scenario as a specialized node, resulting in a streamlined network with fewer nodes. Additionally, we can enhance the algorithm’s efficiency within the general framework through strategic prioritization of node visitations, leveraging the analytical findings. Furthermore, the insights derived can offer recommendations for the deployment of mobile charging and the selection of target areas in the initial stages.

  abstract     = {Recent empirical studies suggest that human behavior in queues causes workload-dependent service times. We investigate the translation of empirical service times into state-dependent queueing models. To this end, we identify two types of state-dependent models, static and dynamic, and two types of corresponding behavioral mechanisms. For example, we view customer early task initiation as a static mechanism and social speedup pressure as a dynamic mechanism. For each model type, we discuss behavioral mechanisms consistent with the model assumptions and indicate how empirical service times can be translated into model input parameters. We illustrate how translating service times into dynamic models can result in invalid service rates, which provides evidence against dynamic mechanisms. For dynamic models, we find that mean service times are in general not the inverse of service rates, the directional change in service rates is not always the opposite of the directional change in mean service times, and workload measurement timing can drastically impact mean service time patterns. We provide closed-form equations to convert service times into service rates and vice versa, and find conditions under which monotonic mean service times imply monotonic service rates and vice versa. Our results provide guidelines for researchers to select and specify an appropriate state-dependent queueing model from service time data, and expand the scope of previously published analytical results.},

  abstract     = {Due to the strategic and adaptive nature of adversaries, the deployment of new technologies is common practice in the arenas of security and defense (e.g., new baggage scanners at airports). History has shown that the deployment of these technologies has often been disclosed to the public, allowing malicious actors to potentially understand which venues are defended, and how. There is limited research examining how information disclosed about the deployment of new security measures can impact the beliefs and decisions of adversaries. Studying these beliefs and decisions is critical in obtaining insights into adversarial behavior, which can inform the allocation of defensive resources and the design of related information disclosures. This article aims to address this gap by studying how people—who are motivated to attack one among multiple targets—respond when receiving information from a defender regarding the deployment of new security measures at those targets. We address whether attackers (i) believe the information they receive from the defender and (ii) choose to attack after learning that new security measures may be deployed at their target(s) of interest. We find that attackers’ beliefs regarding where new security measures are deployed, and their decisions to attack particular targets, are impacted by the information they receive from the defender and by their understanding of the defender’s target valuations, highlighting the importance of strategic information disclosure in counterterrorism operations. In an experimental setting with two targets, when attackers ( N = 975 ) knew that the defender valued one target much more than the other, they had a stronger belief that security measures would be deployed at the higher-value target, even when the defender announced that only the lower-valued target was protected with enhanced security. We also identify important factors that increase the likelihood of deterrence (i.e., when adversaries decide not to attack), which is a major goal in counterterrorism operations. Overall, this study provides novel insights into information disclosure and adversarial decision making in security and defense contexts, contributing to the operations management and behavioral decision analysis research in this domain.},

Our findings indicate that task division improves performance when the task becomes more challenging, such as under high demand uncertainty. It facilitates counteracting behavior, where individuals adjust their decisions to counterbalance their partner's errors, leading to more stabilized final decisions. We identify this counteracting behavior as a critical mechanism driving the benefits of task division, mainly when subtasks are interdependent. We demonstrate the robustness of our findings by examining an egalitarian system, where decision-making authority is shared among team members, and a hierarchical system, where decision control resides entirely with one team member.},

Platform users can update their reviews, and complete records of review updates are observable, which allows us to utilize variations in the same customer’s review ratings of a single game both before and after receiving a managerial response. Addressing concerns regarding the endogeneity of managerial responses, improvements in game quality, and censored data in rating updates, we find that users who update their reviews after receiving managerial responses upgrade their ratings by an average of one star. In addition, we find that the positive direct effect of managerial responses is negatively moderated by the level of response politeness, measured separately using both machine learning and large language models. By conducting a survey study, we further show that as the level of politeness increases, the likelihood of reviewers perceiving a managerial response as an attempt to persuade them also increases. These findings highlight the positive direct effect of managerial response and the importance of response style, specifically politeness, which can produce a backfire effect in online communications.},

  abstract     = {A stream of recent research considers the practice of random price discounts (a.k.a randomized pricing) when selling to forward-looking customers and shows that such pricing strategies can mitigate strategic customer waiting and boost seller profit. In practice, random price discounts are often offered together with price guarantees, in which customers are refunded the price difference if the price is lowered within a given time window after purchase. This paper investigates the efficacy of price guarantees under randomized pricing. To that end, we consider a model in which a firm adopts Markovian pricing and interacts with customers over an infinite time horizon. The following results are obtained. First, while Markovian pricing allows firms to price discriminate customers based on their monitoring costs, price guarantees further allow firms to price discriminate customers based on their willingness to pay. Second, offering price guarantees under Markovian pricing can help retain customers effectively by inducing high-valuation customers to purchase early, regardless of their arrival time. Third, even with price guarantees, Markovian pricing can dominate static pricing only when high-valuation customers are more likely to have a high monitoring cost, which illustrates that customer composition plays a crucial role in the effectiveness of the firm’s pricing strategy. Fourth, the optimal duration of price guarantees is closely related to customers’ lifetime duration. Finally, perhaps surprisingly, offering price guarantees can decrease the aggregate customer surplus since the firm offers sale prices less often under price guarantees.},

  abstract     = {Dynamic treatment regimes improve health outcomes by tailoring each treatment to a patient’s evolving condition, but they also allow providers to learn and game the system over time. How should insurers pay? We study this new class of reimbursement problems, where the provider can privately learn and manipulate the progression of the patient’s condition. (i) We characterize the optimal payment policy: it internalizes two intertemporal effects of each treatment, and rewards provider honesty with incentive pay; moreover, it admits a simple implementation of risk-adjusted cost-sharing policy. (ii) We show that, ignoring dynamic learning and gaming, the existing payment models may have overestimated the harm of information asymmetry. Using the optimal policy, insurers only need to pay for initial private information; they can exploit provider uncertainty and elicit future private information at no cost. (iii) Our study informs U.S. healthcare payment reform with new insights; using two sets of real data, our study also quantifies when and why the optimal policy outperforms the existing ones. By highlighting the critical role of dynamic learning and gaming, this study advances our understanding of healthcare payment theory and practice.},

  abstract     = {Innovation contests have been increasingly used to address innovation problems of seeker firms. However, seeker firms complain about low-quality submissions obtained from these contests. Research suggests low-quality submissions may result from contestants’ over-reliance on exploiting experience in solving similar contests. A more balanced approach in submissions involving exploitation and exploration (i.e., individual ambidexterity) will likely enhance creative performance. However, how ambidexterity affects contestants’ creative performance in innovation contests remains obscured. On the one hand, ambidexterity can have synergistic benefits. On the other hand, ambidexterity is costly to employ. We argue that when a contestant invests in cultivating individual ambidexterity, the benefits initially outweigh the costs, leading to enhanced creative performance. However, the costs may outweigh the benefits as individual ambidexterity increases, undermining creative performance. The overall relationship between individual ambidexterity and creative performance in open innovation contests follows an inverted U-shaped pattern. Creative performance was evaluated based on three dimensions—winning rate, submission novelty, and submission usefulness. Two analyses were used to test this relationship. In Analysis 1, we examined a panel dataset comprising 61,152 observations collected over 12 months from 5,096 contestants on a large innovation contest platform. Results support the hypothesis of an inverted U-shaped relationship between individual ambidexterity and contestant winning rate. In Analysis 2, we randomly subsampled 500 contestants from the sample used in Analysis 1. The subsample made 3,168 submissions, which were evaluated for submission novelty and usefulness by 14 experienced contestants (i.e., domain experts). The analysis results demonstrate that individual ambidexterity has an inverted U-shaped relationship with submission novelty but a positive linear relationship with submission usefulness. This work contributes to the literature on individual ambidexterity by identifying the inverse U-shaped relationship in creative contests and demonstrates how ambidexterity affects the three dimensions of creative performance. Suggestions for enhancing creative performance are also proposed.},

  abstract     = {In the private logistics service sector, considerations of fairness among service agents are relatively new but are gaining importance due to public and governmental pressures to improve equity in workload allocation among internal stakeholders, such as the service personnel. Fairness becomes more complex in settings with a heterogeneous workforce due to inherent worker differences. In this study, we present an equitable workload allocation model for the vehicle routing problem with heterogeneous drivers. We adopt the Nash Social Welfare (NSW) solution as the focal point for coalition among the various drivers. In our setup, while the ultimate goal is to maximize the equity and efficiency of drivers, the company’s efficiency is guaranteed by putting a cap on the deviation of the company’s cost from the least-cost solution value. We formulate the problem of last-mile delivery of online orders from a store using a fleet of crowdshippers as a variant of the vehicle routing problem with a highly nonlinear objective function inspired by NSW’s objective function. To solve the proposed new formulation, a column generation method is developed and used to study the behavior of the model. Through a comprehensive computational study, we investigate the behavior of the system in terms of the company’s cost, drivers’ total profit, and the level of achieved equity among the drivers when the main parameters of the problem vary. Our study demonstrates that the proposed framework outperforms the classical max–min approach in balancing workload equity and efficiency. We show a median equity improvement of 18% with a 5% cost deviation and 30% with a 10% deviation from the least-cost solution.},

The challenge for production control is allocating materials to individualized orders before they can be released to the shop floor. This requires joint evaluation of material inventory and workload control. However, these topics have been studied in isolation for 40 years, under the presumption of a hierarchical control design. This traditionally had the practical advantage of a reduced need for real-time system information. With the advancements in Industry 4.0, control functions can now be integrated. We amalgamate knowledge from both disciplines, present hierarchical and integrated production control designs, and formulate material inventory policies tailored to pulled order release. Using simulation, we show that a decentralized and integrated production control design drastically reduces cost (at least 15%) and improves delivery performance in various settings.},

We also examine whether the upfront-only information-sharing mechanism used in MADRL helps alleviate the bullwhip effect. Our results show that policies constructed by HAPPO achieve lower overall costs than policies constructed by single-agent deep reinforcement learning and other heuristic policies. Also, the application of HAPPO results in a less significant bullwhip effect than policies constructed by single-agent deep reinforcement learning where information is not shared among actors. Somewhat surprisingly, compared to using the overall costs of the system as a minimization target for each actor, HAPPO achieves lower overall costs when the minimization target for each actor is a combination of its own costs and the overall costs of the system. Our results provide a new perspective on the benefit of information sharing inside the supply chain that helps alleviate the bullwhip effect and improve the overall performance of the system. Upfront information sharing and action coordination in model training among actors is essential, with the former even more essential, for improving a supply chain’s overall performance when applying MADRL. Neither actors being fully self-interested nor actors being fully system-focused leads to the best practical performance of policies learned and constructed by MADRL. Our results also verify MADRL’s potential in solving various multi-echelon inventory management problems with complex supply chain structures and in non-stationary market environments.},

  abstract     = {As the scale of renewable energy on the demand side continues to grow, a new demand response program (DRP), the virtual power plant (VPP), pays a rebate to the consumer and purchases his rooftop solar electricity. This electricity is dispatched to areas of electricity shortages, which is vital in balancing electricity loads and avoiding energy waste. However, the new DRP differs from the traditional DRP in terms of paying rebates. The traditional DRP requires consumers to respond above a specified baseline to receive a rebate. In contrast, in the new DRP, consumers can receive a rebate even if their response is small (i.e., no baseline). There is no research that addresses this divergence. Therefore, we construct a supply chain consisting of a consumer and a VPP for this novel DRP and analyze the strategic interactions between them in two situations where a baseline is not set/set. Our results show room for improvement in the DRP that dispatches electricity generated from rooftop solar. If the consumer generates more electricity from rooftop solar, the baseline, rather than frustrating the consumer, motivates the consumer to be more responsive. While the baseline also discourages the demand response process, it reduces the emissions generated from the consumer’s over-responsiveness. Additionally, our study suggests that a baseline, whether it facilitates or hinders the DRP, could benefit the VPP, depending on the business model of the VPP. In addition, we add several extensions to demonstrate the robustness of our model.},

Our analysis shows that compared to prevalent commercial financing schemes such as bank financing and equity financing, government financing encourages firms to pursue more aggressive operational strategies by elevating technology levels and production volumes. While those aggressive measures yield environmental benefits, they also expose firms to increased bankruptcy risk. To address this issue, we propose a risk-mitigation strategy that manages bankruptcy risks within the bounds of a moderate environment target.

To address this gap, our study quantifies the impact of breaches on operational performance and identifies how operational, technological, and market factors moderate the impact. Using a quasi-experimental design with a difference-in-differences technique and propensity score matching, we analyzed a matched sample of 1,766 US hospitals, consisting of 883 breached hospitals and their non-breached peers from 2010 to 2017. We find that breached hospitals experience a 2.1% reduction in hospital admissions and a 0.28% decrease in market share. Moreover, network affiliation, decentralized governance, and cloud-based information technology services negatively moderate breach impacts, while IT security systems for detection, identity governance, and recovery provide mitigating effects. Additionally, we find that breaches in one hospital spillover to affect non-breached hospitals in the same local market. Our findings contribute to the operations management and security literature and provide managerial insights for enhancing breach resilience. Understanding these moderating factors can help hospital managers and policymakers formulate tailored mitigation strategies.},

To improve operational efficiency and performance, many crowdfunding platforms allow users to exert more effort (referral effort) when making referrals. In this paper, we study the impact of users’ referral efforts on referral outcomes, using a unique data set from a reward-based crowdfunding platform. We analyze three types of referral effort beyond merely sharing the referral link, namely, writing the referral message, matching the referral recipients’ pledges, and supporting their own referrals. Our results suggest that users’ referral efforts can help improve the outcome of referrals, as these efforts may be perceived as positive signals of quality, thus reducing referral recipients’ uncertainty about the crowdfunding project. We further explore the heterogeneity in this observed impact, and find that matching recipients’ pledges have a greater impact than the other two types of referral effort. Furthermore, the impact of referral effort is attenuated under conditions of low uncertainty, wherein project quality can be inferred from observable features, such as projects launched by large creators, selected by editors, or referred by experienced backers. Our analyses also indicate that referring users’ efforts can collectively improve the fundraising performance of projects that receive referrals. We discuss the implications of our findings for platform managers, policy makers, and users in crowdfunding marketplaces.},

  abstract     = {A common strategy of extending the lifetime of an aging system is to reduce its workload below the normal operating level, a practice known as derating. While derating can slow the deterioration process, it often comes at the expense of reduced performance. Thus, derating involves a trade-off between performance and deterioration. Central to the optimal derating strategy is the relationship between deterioration and workload, also referred to as the pd-relationship. In practice, however, this relationship is rarely known a priori. We consider the workload optimization when the pd-relationship can be adaptively learned through sequential experimentation, or active learning. We show that the workload not only influences the performance and deterioration but also controls the speed of learning. The decision-maker must therefore account for the complex interplay between performance, deterioration, and information in real time. We formulate this problem as a partially observable Markov decision process and characterize the optimal policy. A key structural insight is that the optimal workload is always less than the myopic load. We further propose an efficient algorithm based on the fast Gauss transform to compute the optimal policies. The model is validated with vibration data and the performance of the optimal policy is compared against several heuristic policies.},

In this article, we assert that, rather than a threat, resale can serve as an effective pricing tool for managing heterogeneous demand. We consider a seller of digital goods/services who offers a contract to a heterogeneous group of customers at a fixed price for a specified amount of usage allowance. Rather than imposing restrictive sharing barriers, the seller allows subscribers to share their allowances with others in a secondary market. Our analysis reveals that the seller’s optimal strategy involves facilitating resale by eliminating transaction costs. The sharing contract effectively achieves the same outcome as a two-part tariff, wherein subscribers pay an entry fee along with a marginal usage rate. Both approaches generate equivalent revenue and market coverage, and result in idential demand and individual surplus for customers of the same type. Consequently, the sharing contract acts as a mechanism for price discrimination. Our finding provides a new perspective on peer-to-peer resales and also challenges the conventional belief that successful price discrimination hinges on preventing resale.},

This phenomenon of platform encroachment has received attention from various stakeholders, and concerns have been raised about how it may marginalize independent sellers and hinder the development of the ecosystem. At the same time, platforms expedite the diffusion of information about successful products and facilitate learning and imitation from other independent sellers, which has received little attention in the literature. In this article, we explicitly account for this feature and consider a dynamic model to study the impact of platform encroachment on sellers’ incentives to experiment with new products, when both the platform and independent sellers can imitate and introduce competing versions of products offered by the successful experimenter. We show that when a seller with successful experimentation holds a competitive advantage in the product market, platform encroachment may enhance the incentives to carry out experimentation. This enhancement effect is stronger when information diffuses faster on the platform. We further discuss the implications for the platform’s optimal encroachment strategy and regulatory policies.},

  abstract     = {The embeddedness of digital platforms in firms to improve industrial accident prevention performance remains a challenge for safety management. A pressing question exists regarding appropriate pathways to improve firm accident prevention performance by leveraging digital platforms. Prior research focuses on individual and organizational factors to prevent industrial accidents while ignoring information technology (IT) from a holistic perspective. Following a socio-technical lens, this study fills the research gap by proposing a new conceptualization of technical and institutional components and examining their combined effects in shaping individual and organizational accident prevention outcomes (i.e., employee accident prevention competence and firm accident prevention performance). Specifically, we introduce and conceptualize the concept of digital platform affordance to represent the technical component and theorize the external institutional force ( government pressure ) and the internal human agency ( top management support ) as the institutional components of digital platforms. By integrating the socio-technical lens, IT affordance theory, and institutional theory, we develop a theoretical model to examine the interaction effects between digital platform affordance, government pressure, and top management support on accident prevention performance. We conduct a multilevel modeling approach to test the proposed research model using a fine-grained matched-pair survey from multiple respondents (i.e., employees and safety executives) in 161 industrial firms in China. We find that digital platform affordance enhances firm accident prevention performance by improving employee accident prevention competence. The results also indicate that the magnitude of the moderating effect of government pressure is contingent upon top management support. This study conceptualizes and assesses the role of digital platforms in safety management and indicates that the amalgamation of their technical/institutional components is a promising means to prevent industrial accidents. We also provide a new perspective for Operations Management scholars to reinterpret the socio-technical lens in the emerging digitally enabled safety management subdiscipline.},

The advent of digital platforms has not only propelled the expansion of the cosmetic sector but has also provided an avenue for in-depth scrutiny of cosmetic services. Digital platforms dedicated to discussing and analyzing cosmetic procedures offer unprecedented opportunities for researchers to examine service dynamics. This study explores the impact of information embedded in images on digital platforms on business performance in the cosmetic industry. Employing a deep learning framework, we extract beauty information from posttreatment images shared by consumers and scrutinize its relationship with the performance of cosmetic services. Drawing on data from an online-to-offline cosmetic platform, our empirical findings reveal a positive association between beauty information and the performance of cosmetic services. Furthermore, we identify service variety and service risk as moderating factors that influence the correlation between beauty information and performance on digital cosmetic platforms. The outcomes of this research carry significant implications for the beauty industry and stakeholders in digital cosmetic platforms.},

  abstract     = {Maintaining a high service level with customers involves a fundamental tradeoff between investing in inventory and investing in expediting the shipping of the additional units needed to achieve that service level. We use a multi-method approach to show how and when ordering decisions are influenced by different levels of expediting costs and target service levels. First, we derive a mathematical model that provides a closed-form solution to this tradeoff. Second, we run a behavioral study to show how increments in the expediting cost and the target service level impact buyers’ ordering behavior. Results show that ordering decisions are influenced mainly by the expediting cost. Our econometric estimations provide a generalization of the pull-to-center effect to a setting with expedited shipping. Moreover, we find that buyers adjust their orders only when facing a high target service level. To reduce the observed behavioral biases, we propose that managers can increase the salience of key performance metrics in the buyers’ decision-making process. We test for the role of salience with a second behavioral study and a behavioral model. Results show that the extent to which salient information helps improve buyers’ ordering decisions depends on the level of the expediting cost. Interestingly, our behavioral model highlights how ordering decisions improve not by eliminating people’s biases but by amplifying some of those biases. We contribute to the literature on expedited shipping and behavioral operations, and provide practical recommendations for how managers can improve ordering decisions.},

  abstract     = {How to decarbonize transportation, which is now, unfortunately, the largest source of carbon emissions among all sectors? The entire industry is heavily driven by economies of scale. When more freight is collected in a lane, it can be shifted to a greener transport mode (e.g., from less-than-truckload to full-truckload, and further to rail transport), and costs and emissions are saved. To support firms achieving such benefits, we develop novel supply chain contracting models that capture supply chain partners’ strategic orders, as well as freight transportation modes with trade-offs on costs, emissions, and flexibility (in the form of a minimum transport quantity for the green mode). We find that even a conventional price-only contract with an option to shift freight mode can already boost the use of the green transport mode and considerably improve supply chain efficiency. Furthermore, we design a revenue-sharing contract that can incentivize even larger order quantities from the retailer and strongly promote the use of the green transport mode. We characterize the conditions under which the contract can achieve a win–win situation, that is, increasing economic as well as environmental sustainability of the supply chain. In a follow-up case study using realistic industry-level data, we numerically evaluate how the supply chain parameters affect this win–win situation.},

This paper analyzes a supply chain in which a manufacturer can source from a cheaper, less reliable supplier with a long lead time and/or a reliable quick-response supplier. The manufacturer also has to make demand-generating marketing investments before the selling season. Our analysis shows that if the unreliable supplier’s reliability is low, the reliable supplier will charge a low wholesale price; otherwise, it will choose a high wholesale price. As the unreliable supplier’s reliability improves, the manufacturer is inclined to increase its marketing investment, but there is a drop at some critical threshold. Interestingly, the existence of an unreliable supplier can lead to a win–win outcome for the reliable supplier and the manufacturer. The unreliable supplier’s reliability has nonmonotonic effects on the equilibrium profits of the reliable supplier and the manufacturer.},

  abstract     = {The crowdfunding market has developed fast in recent years. However, the problem of information asymmetry is still an issue for both backers and fundraisers. Hence, crowdfunding platforms design various policies to reveal more project information to backers. This paper studies the impact of product sampling, a novel policy in the crowdfunding market, and provides suggestive evidence of the underlying mechanism. A product sampling campaign can be divided into three stages chronologically. In Application Stage , backers can apply for free samples. In Trial Stage , users of free samples experience them, but no feedback reports are available. In Report Stage , at least one feedback report is published, and backers can refer to reports when making decisions. Leveraging a rich data set from a large online crowdfunding platform in China, we construct a structural model considering both the demand and supply sides of the market. We use a consideration set model to characterize the fact that backers cannot notice all projects on the crowdfunding platform. We find that sampling campaigns raise the awareness of backers on sampling projects in all stages. However, in Trial Stage , backers’ utility of supporting the project declines, which is most likely to be attributed to backers’ strategic delay waiting for valuable feedback reports. We also find that the scores of feedback reports and the number of free samples offered serve as effective quality signals of projects. These two signals largely determine how backers’ utility changes in Report Stage . Moreover, our counterfactual analysis shows that the demand for most projects rises in Application Stage but falls in Trial Stage , and half of the projects see a demand increase in Report Stage while the other half experience a decrease. Our research strives to uncover the underlying mechanisms of product sampling in the crowdfunding market, makes methodological contributions, and provides meaningful managerial implications for fundraisers and crowdfunding platforms.},

  abstract     = {Recent advancements in communication and social technologies have resulted in the growth of peer-to-peer (P2P) marketplaces, such as Xianyu and Poshmark. Individual sellers in these markets, most of whom are unbranded and lack credibility, often face immense challenges in building trust to facilitate P2P transactions. We consider the potential of sellers’ use of social media to establish trust and drive sales. Specifically, we address whether social media use benefits the sales performance of individual sellers, and how social media use affects customer retention and acquisition. We draw on social capital theory to explore the theoretical mechanisms by which social media participation may affect sales, hypothesizing that such participation enables the seller to accumulate social capital and develop trust. We empirically test this by exploiting a quasi-natural experiment wherein a large P2P marketplace for second-hand goods (Xianyu) unexpectedly removed its social media feature (Fishponds). We employ a difference-in-differences design, leveraging a proprietary data set capturing social media participation and sales activities for individual sellers, covering more than 180,000 transactions over a multi-week period around the event. We find that sellers who initially participated in social media channels experienced a significant decline in sales after the shutdown, which is attributable to poorer customer retention and acquisition. We explore heterogeneity in the effects and find that the sellers who benefit most from social media participation are those with the most to gain from trust-building. An additional online controlled experiment provides further evidence of the trust-building mechanism. Our study implies individual sellers can harness social media to generate additional sales from existing and new customers. These insights are important, as they speak to the value of social media channels as drivers of trust in P2P marketplaces.},

  abstract     = {Exclusivity is a key component of certain service offerings such as elite members-only social or country clubs. Indeed, such services may only appeal to customers if they limit the crowd density, that is, the maximal number of customers granted access to the service. We consider a service provider, who sets its crowd density cap in addition to its price. Customers are heterogeneous in both their willingness to pay (WTP) for the service and their density tolerance. Each customer purchases the service only if the price is below her WTP and the density is below her tolerance. Importantly, customers’ WTP and density tolerance may be statistically dependent, and we develop a novel, copula-based framework to model the dependence structure of these two dimensions of heterogeneity. We analytically characterize the provider’s optimal price and density decisions. As long as the customer population is not too severely sensitive to density: (i) the provider optimally serves all segments of the market and sets the price and density so that the price, not the density, is the determining factor for customers (from a particular subpopulation) on the margin between purchasing and not and (ii) as customers’ valuations and density tolerances become more positively dependent, the provider earns higher revenue and optimally increases its service density. By contrast, the optimal price is quasi-convex but not necessarily increasing. On the other hand, with severely density-sensitive customers, it may be optimal to partially cover the market and to make density the determining factor in customer decisions. Our findings offer prescriptive guidelines for service operations in the presence of density-sensitive demand and also provide an explanation for the failed versus successful practices of prominent private clubs.},

  abstract     = {Social scope group buying has emerged as an increasingly popular promotional strategy and has served as a new customer acquisition tool. In the service industry, companies use social group buying (SGB) to recruit new customers and promote full-price products. Through SGB activities, customers can trade their social capital to form buying groups, experience SGB-offered sample products, and further alleviate uncertainty regarding expensive full-price products before making a final purchase. We investigate this novel SGB phenomenon by examining customers’ decisions throughout the “experience-conversion” process. In collaboration with a leading online educational platform, we examine customers’ grouping behavior during SGB activities and analyze their subsequent purchases. Our analysis reveals an interesting pattern in which non-grouped customers have a higher proportion of full-price product purchases than grouped customers. We postulate that, in addition to observations from operational data, unobserved social information is important for gaining a deeper understanding of the customer behaviors underlying this pattern. Employing a Bayesian learning framework, we model customers’ three-stage discrete-choice decision-making processes and quantify two influential social information factors: social cost and social learning. By incorporating social information, our Bayesian learning model demonstrates improved effectiveness in assisting companies with accurately predicting final purchases in the conversion process. We provide actionable insights into how companies can employ our model to strategically tailor SGB designs by customer segments to increase overall purchase rates. Our study sheds light on the significance of social information in enhancing customer management and refining SGB design.},

Supply chain efficiency, that is, the ability to mitigate recurrent risks in the absence of disruptions has been studied even longer. But only recently have the topics of efficiency and resilience been coupled in the supply chain literature. In this literature review, we focus on the intersection of supply chain resilience and supply chain efficiency. We provide a thematic overview of literature streams according to the structure of the underlying supply chains. We identify various gaps in the current literature including areas in multi-echelon and multi-product supply chain research. Furthermore, we consider dual-purpose and dedicated levers for building resilience. Dual-purpose levers are resources that are able to promote efficiency in a supply chain while enhancing resilience in expectation. By contrast, dedicated resilience levers are resources that are able to guarantee the resilience of a supply chain in the face of particular disruptions without benefiting the supply chain in the absence of disruptions. We call for more research to better understand the value of dual-purpose and dedicated resilience levers to overall supply chain performance.},

We investigate how project collaboration requirements and uncertainty levels affect the choice between “specialists” with higher levels of task-specific abilities and “generalists” with higher levels of collaboration skills. We also examine how these factors affect optimal team incentives. In addition to performance-enhancing helping, we consider another type of collaboration that has received less attention in the incentive literature: information-sharing, which can reduce uncertainty and lead to more compatible design decisions. In the case of helping, we show that if uncertainty is high then specialists might be preferred in order to reduce risk exposure—even if their task-specific abilities are only slightly better. Conversely, if information-sharing can significantly reduce uncertainty then generalists may be favored even if their task-specific abilities are much lower. Our study also reveals that task and collaboration incentives can be either complements or substitutes depending on the type of collaboration and level of project uncertainty: in projects that benefit from helping, firms will always substitute task incentives for collaboration incentives when selecting a team of specialists (rather than a team of generalists), yet this need not be the case with information-sharing. In such projects, it can be optimal to offer higher task incentives and also higher collaboration incentives to a team of specialists (than to a team of generalists) even though specialists’ collaboration skills are relatively lower.},

  abstract     = {Consider a single server that should serve a given number of customers during a fixed period. The appointment scheduling problem (ASP) determines the schedule of planned appointments that minimizes some cost function that accounts for both the cost of idle times and the cost of waiting. When service time distributions are fully specified, the ASP presents a much-investigated computationally challenging stochastic program. When service time distributions are only partially specified, one can apply distributionally robust optimization (DRO) to find the schedule that minimizes costs in worst-case circumstances. We assume that only the mean, mean absolute deviation and range of the service times are known and develop a DRO method that finds the optimal (mini–max) schedule. For independent service times, the min–max problem becomes nonlinear and difficult, if not impossible, to solve exactly. Existing DRO methods for ASP with partial information (such as mean and variance), therefore, consider relaxations that allow correlations between service times. Such relaxations have major repercussions, as the worst-case scenario will then be highly correlated. Our method thus deals with independent service times and finds a robust schedule as the solution to a linear program. We identify several new structural features of optimal robust schedules. We also apply the method to model extensions including sequencing and alternative objective functions.},

  abstract     = {Customers who renege from a queue signal dissatisfaction with the wait, possibly leading to lost business opportunities. Service organizations need to understand how queue features observed by waiting customers drive decisions to renege. Through a series of experiments run in the lab and online, this article demonstrates a relative progress effect in queues. This behavioral effect is created when a series of fast service times are observed early in a wait, followed by slower service times that make the total wait equal to that in a comparable queue progressing at a steady rate. The observer experiences a fast depletion of the queue and a lower proportion of the original queue length remaining. This generates a sense of relative progress for the observer which leads to a reduction in renege behavior. In one of the studies, a relative progress effect enables participants to wait for a longer queue or longer duration compared to a benchmark queue without this effect. A simulation analysis, where individuals in a queue are modeled as experiencing a similar behavioral effect, shows that the individual-level effects lead to systematic differences in the queue performance. Behavioral effects that increase individual patience for some are shown to reduce the overall renege rate in the queue. Our findings suggest that queue practices that modulate the perception of relative progress can reduce renege behavior.},

A recent study ascribes to informational inconsistency two discrepancies between its partial monetization findings and the known excellent valuation performance of this method: (i) the rolling intrinsic policy can perform worse than the intrinsic policy and (ii) it appears to be far from optimal. This paper contends that this claim generally confounds informational inconsistency and the risk adjustment that underpins the common no-arbitrage valuation of this policy. In particular, lack of risk adjustment in that investigation explains at least the first difference and informational inconsistency cannot be associated with the second dissimilarity in about 4 % of its instances. Furthermore, this work establishes that equipping the rolling intrinsic policy with forward trading rules out the former disparity, whereas the latter one in general can persist. Finally, it uses known results to argue that in realistic settings this extended policy incurs small monetization losses on average for storage assets acquired at a fair price and outlines alternative monetization methods with potentially improved effectiveness.},

As a result, platforms have adopted various content moderation policies aimed at decreasing the volume and impact of misinformation. However, implementing new platform policies runs the risk of decreasing user contribution and alienating core users, and results regarding the efficacy of such policies are mixed. Herein, we empirically assess a prominence reduction policy applied to a problematic group that is high in misinformation. The goal of this policy is to reduce the visibility of misinformation on the platform (rather than deleting misinformation or banning users). The results show that while prominence reduction diminishes misinformation dissemination in the focal group, this method also results in a spillover of misinformation to topically related spaces. This spillover is short-lived and driven primarily by a small set of problematic users. As misinformation is not contagious, we find that this spillover to external groups diminishes over time. Finally, prominence reduction is found to have no impact on non-misinformation contribution on the studied platform. The findings of this study have important implications for platform operations and provide useful recommendations for managers regarding effective ways to reduce the spread of misinformation.},

  abstract     = {A brand manager can interpret a rival's product recall as an opportunity to preempt sales and/or signal superior quality by raising their brand's ad spending. Conversely, they may interpret the recall as a threat that may harm their brand's image and/or lead buyers to draw unfavorable comparisons between their brand and the recalling brand. This interpretation nudges the manager to suppress their brand's ad spending. The authors test the interpretations empirically in the context of 62 substitute car models’ responses to the recall of a competing model. They assess the response over 31 weeks and 308 geographical regions, leading to 591,976 model-week-region observations. Regression discontinuity in time analysis reports that, on average, a substitute brand responds by lowering its ad spending by 50%, suggesting that the threat interpretation dominates the opportunity interpretation. A decomposition of spending by type suggests that substitute brands increase their spending on price advertising by 25%, decrease spending on quality advertising by 71%, but make no adjustment to brand advertising. This nuanced analysis suggests that substitutes attempt sales preemption, avoid quality signaling, and are not worried about brand spillover. A follow-up analysis reports that this advertising strategy strengthens the positive spillover effect of a brand's recall on its substitute brands’ sales volume. The key findings hold for another major automobile recall event in the same market. The findings contribute to the literature on the management of quality perceptions while informing about substitute brands’ managers responses to a rival brand's quality failure and whether the response helps or hurts the substitutes’ sales. Furthermore, the findings build an empirical foundation for future analytic investigation on strategic interactions among brands when a quality defect occurs.},

This research investigates the impact of disturbances on a two-tier supply chain network with asymmetric competing firms. We establish the equilibrium in a unique structure that represents the maximum set of profitable upstream supply paths achievable through competition and exhibits stability under specific conditions. We evaluate the efficiency of the supply chain configuration by a shortfall problem and solve it with an adapted pseudoflow algorithm that efficiently identifies the mismatches between shortfalls and capacity surpluses in the multitier network. The parametric analysis reveals that the disturbance loss can be significantly offset by supplier competition, although the marginal benefit of competition decreases rapidly with the number of suppliers. Furthermore, shortfalls could be magnified by network asymmetries that increase configuration inefficiency, and supply chain performance could be improved by pushing high-cost firms to cease production. Simulation results indicate that the supply chain with a moderate level of competition and a balanced configuration can be robust against disturbance and demand volatility.},

  abstract     = {Online retail platforms are increasingly challenged by the proliferation of low-quality products, which may damage their reputation and sales. To address this problem, we propose a system architecture to proactively identify products that are likely to go “out of favor.” Our approach uses historical data to extract useful information from customer ratings and textual reviews. Available data are fed into a state-of-the-art deep learning sequence model to forecast future ratings. We then analyze rating trends, extracting hyperparameters that a binary classifier uses to label products as “out-of-favor” or not. We tested this system on an Amazon dataset comprising nearly 800,000 observations across 2826 electronics products. Our results show that the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model excels in forecasting future product ratings compared to other benchmarks. Ablation analysis shows sentiment-related features significantly improve rating forecasts by up to 40%, with review topics adding 10% and other review characteristics, 4%. Counterintuitively, topic extraction from reviews does not provide substantial benefits, despite the heavy computational resources it requires. Finally, the two-stage classification process, which leverages time-series data and rating trends, offers a more stable and robust performance than conventional single-stage methods. We provide considerations for system architecture development through robustness checks ensuring its resilience to stressors. Our experiments indicate that rating trends can change in subtle ways over time, leading a promising “star” product to turn into a liability (“dog”). E-commerce platforms can use the proposed system architecture proactively to identify and remove potentially dubious products instead of waiting to take reactive action.},

  abstract     = {E-commerce packages are notorious for their inefficient usage of space. More than one-quarter volume of a typical e-commerce package comprises air and filler material. The inefficient usage of space significantly reduces the transportation and distribution capacity increasing the operational costs. Therefore, designing an optimal set of packaging box sizes is crucial for improving efficiency. We present the first learning-based framework to determine the optimal packaging box sizes. In particular, we propose a three-stage optimization framework that combines unsupervised learning, reinforcement learning, and tree search to design box sizes. The package optimization problem is formulated into a sequential decision-making task called the box-sizing game. A neural network agent is then designed to play the game and learn heuristic rules to solve the problem. In addition, a tree-search operator is developed to improve the performance of the learned networks. When benchmarked with company-based optimization formulation and two alternate optimization models, we find that our ML-based approach can effectively solve large-scale problems within a stipulated time. We evaluated our model on real-world datasets supplied by a large e-commerce platform. The framework is currently adopted by a large e-commerce company across its 28 fulfillment centers, which is estimated to save the company about 7.1 million USD annually. In addition, it is estimated that paper consumption will be reduced by 2,080 metric tons and greenhouse gas emissions by 1,960 metric tons annually. The presented optimization framework serves as a decision support tool for designing packaging boxes at large e-commerce warehouses.},

  abstract     = {In 2019, self-employed individuals in the United States owned and operated more than 27 million nonemployer firms and generated more than $1.3 trillion in revenue. Our study examines how self-employed workers adjust their operations in response to an exogenous regulatory change that places limits on how they can utilize their productive assets. Extending modern property rights theory of the firm (PRTF), we studied how self-employed for-hire truck drivers modified their operations in response to the required installation of electronic logging devices (ELDs) in their vehicles. The introduction of ELDs bolstered enforcement of preexisting legal hours-of-service limits, thereby weakening the drivers’ ability to accept hauls above statutory hours-of-service limits and reducing the strength of their economic property rights. Our difference-in-differences analysis that relies on self-employed truck drivers exempt from the ELD regulation as a control group reveals that the restrictions imposed by the ELD mandate, while effective at curbing major hours-of-service violations, prompted a change in a host of market behaviors among affected drivers, including a shift toward working as subcontractors, decreased labor supply, and increased exit rates from the industry. These findings contribute to the literature on PRTF. First, our findings underscore the significance of economic property rights in shaping self-employed workers’ operating decisions as legal property rights were largely left unchanged under the ELD regulation. Second, our findings with respect to subcontracting highlight that property rights restrictions placed on asset attributes may prompt self-employed workers to unbundle economic property rights and allocate them to exchange partners better equipped to maximize the economic value reaped from these rights. Such transfer of economic property rights common to intermediate forms of organizational design such as subcontracting embodies a multidimensional view of economic property rights. By demonstrating a range of consequences of restricting self-employed workers’ economic property rights, our study carries important implications for theory, managers, and policymakers.},

Hence, during their relationship with established firms, young firms must constantly monitor signs of a failing partnership and terminate it before being in a disadvantageous position. However, discontinuing the alliance with an established firm can also be risky, especially if the young firm has limited alternative collaborative opportunities. Our study adopts the young firm's perspective and dynamically weighs the tradeoffs between the risks of continuing and discontinuing its relationship with established firms, thereby deciding on its termination. We first develop an analytical model to understand how the alliance duration (time from alliance formation to termination) between young and established firms is affected by alliance, firm, and industry characteristics. We then test the resulting hypotheses on a sample of 1,111 alliances with licensing deals formed between 159 established pharmaceutical firms and 448 young biotechnology firms during the 1986 to 2000 period, which straddles the technological discontinuity of combinatorial chemistry. Our empirical results provide partial support for the hypotheses derived from the analytical model, informing us of firms’ rational alliance duration decisions as well as their deviations from rationality. In presenting both optimal alliance duration decisions and suboptimal alliance duration practices, our mixed-method approach offers important implications for theory and practice.},

While failure learning involves organizations embracing change and seeking improvements after experiencing failures, threat rigidity leads to a more conservative and resistant approach to change during such times. In our study, we used a pioneering approach by integrating these seemingly competing perspectives within the context of data breaches. Employing a propensity score matching (PSM)-combined-difference-in-differences (DiD) approach, we uncovered a dual impact of data breaches on firms’ information technology (IT) investment—after data breaches, firms tend to increase their IT investment intensity (a promoting effect) while simultaneously reducing their new IT investments (an inhibiting effect). Furthermore, we found that a firm with a strong quality culture exhibits a stronger tendency to increase its IT investment intensity following a data breach, while a firm highly valuing innovation demonstrates a weaker trend in reducing new IT investments after a breach. In post hoc analyses, we found that the impact of data breaches on IT investments is contingent on a series of factors related to the nature of the breach and the specific type of IT investments considered. Overall, our study provides valuable insights into the complex and diverse relationship between data breaches and IT investments in firms.},

  abstract     = {Self‐service technologies (SSTs) have been widely adopted in industries that require the delivery of physical products by services, in which consumers evaluate a product for both the product value and the service value. A typical service delivery system usually involves sales agents and/or self‐service technologies, for example, online services and kiosks, to serve consumers by a coproduction process. In other words, both the sales agent (or self‐service machine) and the consumer should exert effort, with corresponding service costs. By modeling the coproduction output with a Cobb–Douglas production function, we establish a principal–agent model to study the value of self‐service technologies in designing a service delivery system wherein the sales agent's service cost is private information. We first characterize the main trade‐off between the sales agent and the self‐service machine when the firm provides only one service channel. Then, we analyze the value of the self‐service machine when the firm can provide both service channels. We find that, interestingly, the firm may possibly provide both service channels, that is, services offered by the sales agent and the self‐service machine, when the level of information uncertainty is high, and the self‐service machine's service cost is intermediate. Moreover, when both service channels are offered, only the efficient sales agent will be contracted, and the inefficient sales agents are screened out of the market by the self‐service machine; that is, the self‐service machine can help the firm eliminate the information rent. We also investigate how the firm's service weight in the coproduction process and information uncertainty influence the consumer surplus, firm's choices, contract parameters, and resulting profits. Our results are shown to be robust when our model is extended to consider a single‐contract strategy, contracting on effort, a continuous sales agent type, and a general coproduction function.},

  abstract     = {In the United States, even though national guidelines for allocating scarce healthcare resources are lacking, 26 states have specific ventilator allocation guidelines to be invoked in case of a shortage. While several states developed their guidelines in response to the recent COVID‐19 pandemic, New York State developed these guidelines in 2015 as “pandemic influenza is a foreseeable threat, one that we cannot ignore.” The primary objective of this study is to assess the existing procedures and priority rules in place for allocating/rationing scarce ventilator capacity and propose alternative (and improved) priority schemes. We first build machine learning models using inpatient records of COVID‐19 patients admitted to New York‐Presbyterian/Columbia University Irving Medical Center and an affiliated community health center to predict survival probabilities as well as ventilator length‐of‐use. Then, we use the resulting point estimators and their uncertainties as inputs for a multiclass priority queueing model with abandonments to assess three priority schemes: (i) SOFA‐P (Sequential Organ Failure Assessment based prioritization), which most closely mimics the existing practice by prioritizing patients with sufficiently low SOFA scores; (ii) ISP (incremental survival probability), which assigns priority based on patient‐level survival predictions; and (iii) ISP‐LU (incremental survival probability per length‐of‐use), which takes into account survival predictions and resource use duration. Our findings highlight that our proposed priority scheme, ISP‐LU, achieves a demonstrable improvement over the other two alternatives. Specifically, the expected number of survivals increases and death risk while waiting for ventilator use decreases. We also show that ISP‐LU is a robust priority scheme whose implementation yields a Pareto‐improvement over both SOFA‐P and ISP in terms of maximizing saved lives after mechanical ventilation while limiting racial disparity in access to the priority queue.},

We propose a conceptual framework in which resilience is determined by (a) the intrinsic stability of the customer pool that the store serves and (b) the actions the store implements to cope with external shocks. We apply our framework to study the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on thousands of fashion stores across the world, using a novel high-frequency scraping method to infer daily sales. Our results indicate a severe impact of lockdown regulations, with remarkable store-level heterogeneity. Stores of smaller size, in high-income lower-density areas, catering to non-touristic demand, and not located in shopping malls were intrinsically more resistant to external shocks. Furthermore, stores that chose to be more differentiated (reduced assortment similarity) and to keep a fresher inventory (faster inventory days) were also able to attenuate the impact of the pandemic. Our framework can be useful for policymakers, who are interested in identifying and targeting most vulnerable businesses, as well as managers, who would like to build a network of stores sufficiently resistant to shocks.},

Specifically, we adopt a distribution‐free approach to study an ambiguity‐averse monopoly's joint price and production decisions given the random yield's mean and variance—arguably two of the most widely used and easy‐to‐estimate summary statistics. We derive for four models, which result from all possible combinations of the two strategies, closed‐form solutions of the optimal price and production decisions as well as the optimal profit. Through comparative analysis, we obtain several managerial insights based on the problem's parameters, including cost parameters, demand parameters, and supply variation. The firm can benefit more from pure emergency supply than from pure responsive pricing if the unit emergency purchasing cost is not larger than a certain threshold, and the strategic relation between emergency supply and responsive pricing also critically depends on the unit emergency purchasing cost as well as the type of distributional information we know about the random yield. We discuss how distributional information about mean and variance bridges the most and least variable situations of the random yield, thus establishing the gain and the limit of knowing variance.},

  abstract     = {We investigate how volume flexibility, defined by a sourcing cost premium beyond a base capacity, at a local responsive supplier impacts the decision to reshore supply. The buyer also has access to a remote supplier that is cheaper with no restrictions on volume flexibility. We show that with unit lead time difference between both suppliers, the optimal dual sourcing policy is a modified dual base‐stock policy with three base‐stock levels S 1 f , S 2 f , and S s . The replenishment orders are generated by first placing a base order from the fast supplier of at most k units to raise the inventory position to S 1 f , if that is possible. After this base order, if the adjusted inventory position is still below S 2 f , additional units are ordered from the fast supplier at an overtime premium to reach S 2 f . Finally, if the adjusted inventory position is below S s , an order from the slow supplier is placed to bring the final inventory position to S s . Surprisingly, in contrast to single sourcing with limited volume flexibility, a more complex dual sourcing model often results in a “simpler” policy that replaces demand in each period. The latter allows analytical insights into the sourcing split between the responsive and the remote supplier. Our analysis shows how increased volume flexibility at the responsive supplier promotes the decision to reshore operations and effectively serves as a cost benefit. It also shows how investing in base capacity or additional volume flexibility act as strategic substitutes.},

  abstract     = {Forced labour poses a significant challenge within global supply chains, yet traditional compliance-based governance based on auditing has proven to be ineffective in addressing this issue. Non-government organizations and worker rights organizations can serve as crucial allies in supporting and safeguarding workers by assuming the role of a 'social intermediary' (SI) between supply chain firms and workers. However, these external organizations often hold limited power within these supply chains. In our paper, we examine the sources of power that SIs can cultivate and utilize to lead successful interventions against forced labour in supply chains. Through a comparative case study involving three SIs and their collaborative efforts with a global seafood brand, we explore various forms of non-mediated power and their underlying origins. By establishing these connections, we shed light on the effectiveness (or lack thereof) of interventions against forced labour. Our research makes three contributions. First, we contribute to ongoing research on forced labour in supply chains by emphasizing the constructive role that SIs can play to protect vulnerable workers. Second, we address a critical gap in the existing literature concerning power of SIs in supply chain relations. More specifically, we specify sources and types of non-mediated power that SI can leverage to design effective interventions against forced labour. Third, by comparing unique data on two worker groups vulnerable to forced labour – vessel workers and workers in seafood processing – we provide much-needed insights into how working conditions in non-factory settings can still be regulated.},

Our study expands the current understanding of LW pay by shifting from the traditional labor-capital view to an operations and supply chain management perspective. We use a game theoretical approach to explore the different responses of two competing supply chains to LW accreditation. We find that a moderate LW standard allows for Pareto optimality where key stakeholders (i.e., manufacturers, retailers, consumers, and workers) have a collective interest in promoting the LW movement. From a multistakeholder lens, the LW movement is only sustainable if the LW standard is neither too aggressive nor too conservative. We further demonstrate the following points. (1) Not all types of uncertainties are harmful to supply chains with LW pay. Yield uncertainty slows down the progress of the LW movement, whereas demand uncertainty encourages the voluntary adoption of LW pay among all stakeholders. (2) Supply chain coordination may slow the adoption of voluntary LW pay, which implies that the classic coordination paradigm is not a panacea in alleviating the plight of underpaid workers. (3) From the perspective of competition intensity, greater monopsony power hinders the progress of the LW movement, and we provide evidence for the positive effects of a competitive environment on incentivizing voluntary LW pay.},

While scandals like the Rana Plaza incident have focused the world's attention on Asia, in Brazil, over 35,000 people have been rescued from conditions analogous to slavery in the past 15 years. Outsourcing and the underlying social structures that blur the implementation of outsourcing are central to this problem. Fashion supply chains are highly fragmented and labour intensive, exhibiting power asymmetry and informality. Although supply chain research has focused on how focal firms can control or improve supplier practices, this study examines focal firm misconduct and decoupling. Our research presents an intervention aimed at developing a blockchain solution to create a census of fashion working conditions in Brazil. The project included two non-governmental organisations, two fashion brands and their suppliers, the fashion retail association, a blockchain start-up and the research team (18 organisations). We contribute to both theory and practice, revealing that the blockchain's potential to ease transaction costs is outweighed by governance costs related to third-party supervision. We show that focal firms justify unfair purchasing practices via victimisation and diverting attention from themselves to consumers (‘unwilling to pay’) and suppliers (‘not behaving as expected’), unveiling how these drivers of organisational misconduct lead to supplier decoupling (means–end) and focal firm decoupling (policy–practice). Such underlying social structures sustain inaction or, at best, advance focal firms’ visibility of their supply chains while offering no true transparency to the broader society.},

Through a cross-case analysis of data from the agricultural sector in the United States, this paper seeks to understand labor trafficking operations through a socio-technic systems theory lens and contributes to prior literature on labor trafficking in three important ways. First, we utilize a cross-case approach to explore labor trafficking operations through a network lens and derive insights into the interconnectivity and key players in each labor trafficking operation. Second, we outline the socio-technic practices of those labor trafficking networks that maintained ties to corporate supply chains. Hence, the scope of operations management socio-technic theory is widened to also include exploitative and harmful practices. Third, we elucidate the connections between corporate and labor trafficking systems to demonstrate that corporate responsibility does not exist in a vacuum and that the interplay between legal and illicit organizations is of critical importance in combating human trafficking. Altogether, this article provides an interdisciplinary perspective using insights from operations management theory, criminology, and network design. In doing so, the assessment of socio-technic dynamics between actors broadens the operations and supply chain frame of reference beyond corporate socio-technic systems to include the illicit systems they are connected to.},

  abstract     = {Relevance : In this article, we focus on the decision of a multinational firm (MNF) on production strategies under the influence of national culture. The national culture of a country can result in a high preference for openness or self-reliance, and such a preference changes over time. The related government policies have a strong impact on the MNF’s decision whether to produce overseas and sell products in the domestic market or produce locally for domestic selling. Theory and methodology : We build a game-theoretical model comprising an MNF and a local retailer to investigate the MNF’s preference for production strategies with the consideration of the influence of national culture. Practice of the research : We find that when the factory establishment variable cost is low and the fixed cost is in a moderate range, the MNF’s preference over production strategies switches twice from local production to overseas production and then back to local production, as the channel substitutability increases. Interestingly, when the factory establishment variable cost is low and the fixed cost is high, the MNF’s preference is heavily dependent upon the tax disparity, exhibiting a threshold policy based on the channel substitutability. Our findings provide important insights for the MNFs into utilizing the national-culture-oriented tax policies and channel substitutability when establishing factories in foreign countries. We also reveal that the preferential local manufacturing policies originated from a high cultural preference for self-reliance may not attract more MNFs, which negatively impacts the policy effectiveness.},

  abstract     = {Conflict is common within global supply chains, especially where the buyer and supplier span different cultures. In such settings, formal contracts assume an important role in providing a common language that specifies each party's roles, responsibilities, and liabilities. However, the primacy, use, and interpretation of contracts is subject to the cultural norms of the two parties involved. We adopt a multi-method research design to understand how cultural context affects how suppliers interpret and respond to different contract functions (control vs. coordination) adopted by a buyer firm during conflict episodes. Study 1 involves multiple, in-depth case studies of conflict between three Indian suppliers and six of their international buyers from China, Germany, and the United States. Our findings highlight how the use of contractual control or coordination is interpreted differently depending on the supplier's cultural context. In particular, a mismatch in contract function use and the supplier's culturally derived expectations can lead to strong negative emotions and damage to the relationship. In Study 2, we propose and test a set of hypotheses via a scenario-based experiment of German and Chinese managers. We find support for our hypothesized conditional effects, showing that for suppliers from high-context cultures, the buyer's use of contractual control to address conflict has a significant negative, indirect effect on relationship commitment (via the emotion of anger). We conclude with a discussion of the implications of using contracts to manage conflict in cross-cultural supply chain relationships.},

  abstract     = {As businesses increasingly move into digital domains, digital piracy has become more prevalent and more costly. Pre-release piracy, where pirated versions of digital products are distributed before legitimate ones, remains particularly damaging to digital product developers. Although workers’ social norms may play a critical role, limited research exists on the behavioral factors that intentionally or unintentionally contribute to pre-release piracy, particularly when considering multinational nuances (e.g., national cultures) and workers’ experience (e.g., organizational tenure). To address this gap, we develop and test an empirical model of how national culture and organizational tenure jointly predict the likelihood of pre-release piracy. Our empirical analyses employ a dataset compiled from more than 20 distinct sources and capture the electronic video game industry's PC-based products from 2000 through 2019. For national culture, we focus on two forms of collectivism—institutional and in-group—finding that institutional collectivism is associated with a reduced likelihood of pre-release piracy, while in-group collectivism increases it. We also find that the likelihood of pre-release piracy reduces with a product development team's organizational tenure, but that this relationship is distinctively moderated by each of collectivism's two forms. Specifically, the benefits of increased organizational tenure are amplified in the presence of stronger institutional collectivism but muted in the presence of stronger in-group collectivism. We link our findings to research streams on national culture, digital piracy, and organizational tenure, and specify contributions to each.},

  abstract     = {We investigate how language, an essential part of culture, affects manufacturing firms’ supply chain operations management practices, including the cash conversion cycle and its components. Based on the Sapir–Whorf hypothesis, which theorizes that a language's structure may affect how its speakers think, prior studies have established that using the future tense to describe future events increases one's mental distance from the future, reducing a person's concern about it. Building upon this foundation, we hypothesize that firms in weak future-time reference countries are likely to be better prepared for future volatility in demand for their products and therefore carry higher inventory to avoid potential stockouts. We also hypothesize that firms in weak future-time reference countries are more apprehensive about long-term relationships with their customers and hence extend longer credit terms to them. Finally, we hypothesize that firms in weak future-time reference countries have longer operating and cash conversion cycles due to carrying higher levels of inventory and extending longer credit terms to customers. The empirical results using a large global sample of 193,625 firm-year observations from 45 countries support our hypotheses. In terms of economic significance, on average, the cash conversion cycle of firms in weak future-time reference countries is ∼ 11% longer than that of firms in strong future-time reference countries. We also find that the effect of language is dominant over the influence of traditional cultural dimensions. Together, the results suggest that time encoding in the language of a firm is a determining factor in its supply chain operations.},

The results indicate that the relationship between dynamic operations complexity and operational performance is moderated by every dimension of national culture except gender egalitarianism and institutional collectivism. We contribute to the literature on complexity by introducing the dynamic operations complexity construct and showing the moderating effect of national culture.

  abstract     = {Product customization enables consumers to tailor products to their individual preferences. One benefit of customization is its lower volume of returns. By customizing, consumers learn about their product preferences and develop a sense of attachment to the products they help “create.” As a result, they are less likely to return the purchased items. The effect of product customization on returns may depend on cultural traits of consumers, such as the extent to which they would avoid uncertainty or the degree to which they would feel “subordinate” to authority. Hence, this article studies how national culture moderates the negative relationship between customization and returns. Our investigation analyzes a unique dataset from a leading global luxury brand manufacturer that offers both standard and customized versions of a product across more than 20 countries. We find that the disparity in return rates between standard (higher rate) and customized products (lower rate) depends on the cultural dimensions originally introduced by Hofstede. This gap widens with masculinity and uncertainty avoidance but narrows with power distance and individualism. Therefore, multinational firms should weigh these aspects of national cultures when designing both customization and return policies.},

However, the OR/OM/SCM literature on DEI is fragmented and a systematic review of where we stand is missing. In this paper, we adopt principles of systematic analysis to select and examine a wide range of peer-reviewed research in OR, OM, and SCM using qualitative and quantitative methods. We develop baseline metrics that represent the presence of DEI principles in published research and, through discussion of specific papers, identify opportunities for research to meaningfully engage with DEI principles and discuss specific ways that authors’ work reflects DEI principles. We develop principles for DEI and race- and social justice-aware research in OR/OM/SCM, provide guidance for institutions to support an enabling environment for DEI-aware research, discuss a range of research opportunities in DEI-infused OR/OM/SCM, and explain how critical theory can enhance DEI-aware research in decision science.

  abstract     = {The persistent inequities in American cities—long recognized and lived by black and Hispanic people and other minorities, the poor and working class, and others disadvantaged by urban systems—have been vaulted into the broader public consciousness over the past decade. Lessening entrenched urban inequalities is now at the top of the national policy agenda, suggesting a need and opportunity for more urban operations management. On what issues and how might this work occur? Operations management was deeply intertwined with urban planning in research and practice from the 1950s through the 1970s, at which point the fields diverged. To build a case for what perspectives and approaches a modern urban operations management agenda might employ to address inequity, I synthesize historical and contemporary planning theory with the debates among reflective operations scholars in the 1950s-1970s over work on cities. Modern operations scholars can look to planning, and especially to recent major shifts in its thinking on race and class, to address urban operations that disadvantage some city residents and overly advantage others. This urban operations agenda should be empirical, equity-oriented, and community-focused in order to best resonate with planners and the city residents they serve. In reengaging with planners to tackle the modern range of urban policy problems, operations analysts have a chance to contribute practical clarity on how cities work and can be made more livable for all residents.},

We argue that a key impediment today and a potential enabler tomorrow—and thus an important subject of operations and supply chain management (OSCM) research—is the array of public policies that sets the “rules of the game” in OCSM. We differentiate three types of public policy regimes—laissez-faire, regulatory, and transformative—and analyze how each differentially affects DEI practices in OSCM. Our analysis suggests that the laissez-faire type may not offer sufficient incentives to trigger a comprehensive change in DEI practices, while the regulatory and transformative types offer more incentives but, in many instances, do not work as expected. By analyzing the effects of distinct public policy activities for DEI-related practices—for example, through comparative empirical studies or modeling and simulation—OSCM scholars can make important contributions to a more comprehensive implementation of DEI practices.},

We offer three lenses that potentially broaden the scope of this scholarship: justice, paradox, and dialectical. The justice logic frames DEI as primarily a moral concern of inequality in firms and supply chains. It goes against an instrumental, performance-driven approach to establishing DEI in OSCM. To understand the persistence of tensions in DEI implementation, we present a paradox lens and link it to OSCM through four major types of organizational paradoxes: performing, organizing, learning, and belonging. We employ a dialectical perspective to resolve these tensions and combine instrumental and justice logics to explore how the latter can help firms realize DEI's (often unfulfilled) performance potential. OSCM scholars are well placed to use justice, paradox, and dialectical lenses to assess pathways for realizing DEI's transformative potential through modeling, decision support, and empirical research. Such research can help managers pursue objectives that conflict with or go beyond instrumental DEI, thus contributing to substantive DEI implementation.},

The LGBTQ+ community is an integral part of society, and the field has significant potential to impact the lives of its members economically and socially. MS and OM scholars could pay greater attention to research problems at the interface of operational decision-making and the LGBTQ+ community, which I term “rainbow operations.” This study advances LGBTQ+ diversity, equity, and inclusion within the MS and OM literature by invoking several existing studies and showcasing how similar state-of-the-art techniques and tools can be used to answer interesting, rich, and impactful research questions concerning rainbow operations. I present motivating examples and supporting statistics, discuss related work by MS and OM scholars, and suggest several avenues for future research around the following three themes: LGBTQ+ clients in service delivery settings, LGBTQ+ employees in contemporary workplaces, and LGBTQ+ community in global supply chains. My goal is to inspire MS and OM scholars to think more broadly about our discipline and offer valuable operations-related perspectives on research problems of relevance to the LGBTQ+ community.},

  abstract     = {Access to contraceptives empowers women to not only exercise their reproductive rights and avert unintended pregnancies, but also to prevent a spectrum of adverse societal and health outcomes (e.g., unfulfilled career aspirations, unsafe abortions, maternal deaths.) However, in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), where resources are limited and women are under-represented as decision-makers in national governments, reproductive health has not traditionally been prioritized. Motivated by past research showing that female decision-makers tend to prioritize issues in ways that align more closely with women's needs and preferences, we examine the relationship between female decision-makers in national governments and contraceptive procurement. Specifically, we focus on female decision-makers at two levels, as health ministers and parliamentarians, and examine their impact on the procurement quantity of contraceptives by LMICs. Our empirical analysis, based on a comprehensive compilation of data across six distinct sources, shows that a female (vs. male) health minister is associated with an average 66% increase in the procurement quantity of contraceptives. Notably, this relationship is strengthened with an increase in the proportion of female representatives in national parliaments. Together, these findings demonstrate that female (vs. male) decision-makers exhibit greater commitment to contraceptive procurement, an issue that has a disproportionate impact on women's health and well-being. As ensuring good health and well-being for all and increasing gender parity in leadership positions are two of the key United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, our study on examining the relationship between female decision-makers and contraceptive procurement constitutes a timely and consequential line of inquiry.},

We draw on sociology and economics literature to argue that the returns to digital skills in such contexts are shaped by caste and gender, and that digital skills empower disadvantaged individuals to increase their wages. Our empirical analysis of a rich micro-dataset on more than 20,000 individuals across all states in India from two waves of Indian Human Development Survey in 2005 and 2011 yields two key findings. First, we find that the positive returns to digital skills are greater for individuals from the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in India than for individuals from other castes. Second, we find that the returns to digital skills are greater for women than for men. We also find that movement up the skilled occupation ladder is a mechanism that mediates the relationship between digital skills and wages. Our post hoc exploratory analyses suggest that among individuals from the lowest castes (Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes), the returns to digital skills are greater for women than for men, and that returns to digital skills are lower in regions with less developed infrastructure and lower literacy rates than in other regions. We discuss the implications of our findings for diversity, equity, and inclusion research in operations management.},

  abstract     = {The digital divide is an area of significant concern as society increases its reliance on the internet for everyday tasks. Retail operations are no exception to this trend where the use of the online sales channel has become ubiquitous. As retailers seek to provide a high-quality customer experience across socioeconomic groups to maximize sales potential, they must find ways to bridge the digital divide and ensure consumer access to their products. Embracing resources and appropriation theory and the consumer transaction cost perspective, we hypothesize on the efficacy of strategically focusing on omnichannel fulfillment offerings and online fulfillment offerings as operational tools retailers can employ to expand access to their products and improve sales to the diverse populations affected by the digital divide. We contribute to the digital divide research in operations management by showing that a strategic focus on e-commerce fulfillment capabilities is associated with a reduction in the negative impact of the digital divide. We further disaggregate the digital divide into its two component parts, infrastructure deficiencies and socioeconomic factors, to delve into the nuances of the hypothesized relationships. The findings indicate that e-commerce fulfillment strategies are broadly effective at ameliorating the negative effects of infrastructural elements of the digital divide while overcoming the socioeconomic-related component of the digital divide is more nuanced. To further understand the complexities of the socioeconomic element of the digital divide, we disaggregate the measure and explore the impact of an emphasis on omnichannel and online fulfillment offerings to help alleviate the impact of the digital divide for the following vulnerable consumer populations: those who are in poverty, those who are over 25 and have less than a high school education, those 65 and older, and individuals with a disability. Our results show that while these vulnerable populations can be aided by carefully selecting which omni or online fulfillment offerings are available to consumers, not all fulfillment offerings are effective.},

  abstract     = {The opioid crisis has ravaged the United States, taking 69,000 lives in 2020, with prescription opioids accounting for 98% of opioid abuse. Although this epidemic is often considered a White public health crisis nationally, overdose deaths among people of color doubled from 2017 to 2019. As research has shown that the crisis was fueled by excessive supply from the pharmaceutical industry, several individual firms have received significant public criticism. However, we find evidence that the scope of the blame transcends individual actors to indict the very structure of complex supply chains, which may have exacerbated the crisis by dispensing significantly more opioids. In specific, we posit that supply chain complexity allowed mass quantities of opioids to escape detection by the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA). Further, we find new evidence showing the greater impact of complexity on opioid dispensing in non-White communities, which underscores their exclusion from the public discourse and governmental response surrounding the crisis and suggests possible racial bias in the DEA’s regulatory policies. Our analysis was made possible by the 2019 release of the DEA’s Automation of Reports and Consolidated Orders System database, which logged every shipment in the US opioid supply chain from 2006 to 2014. Using a fixed effects model, we find that a one-unit increase across three dimensions of supply chain complexity is associated with a 16% increase in opioid dispensing. This effect is intensified in non-White communities, where a 10% increase in the non-White population is associated with a 3.39% (1.33%) increase in opioid dispensing by pharmacies that have supply chains with high (average) complexity. To verify that high-complexity pharmacies’ excess dispensing supplied non-medical/recreational demand, we exploit the reformulation of OxyContin (designed to prevent recreational use) as an exogenous shock to the market. In a novel approach, we leverage the fact that different pharmacies received their first shipment of reformulated OxyContin at different times and use a difference-in-differences model to estimate the heterogeneous effect of the shock on dispensing. As the reformulated OxyContin stifled demand, high-complexity pharmacies experienced a 15.31% greater reduction in dispensing compared to lower-complexity pharmacies, suggesting that their excess dispensing was indeed satisfying non-medical/recreational demand.},

We find that the number of reviews increases, but the average rating decreases after restaurants are identified as Black-owned. We investigate how various contextual factors, such as the number of hate crimes where the restaurant is located and restaurant popularity, as well as reviewer characteristics, such as reviewer race and gender, impact this relationship. We also examine mechanisms that could be contributing to our findings.

  abstract     = {Consumers taking prescription drugs have limited ability to ascertain drug quality before taking the drug. After drug use, however, consumers frequently report their personal experiences with prescription drugs on one of the world's largest medical websites: WebMD. Drug reviews on WebMD are a potentially rich source of free-form text that can be utilized to inform firms, consumers, researchers, and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) about the quality and safety of prescription drugs. Additionally, because men and women communicate in starkly different ways, the gender of the reviewer may play a key role in drug reviews signaling drug quality problems. We examine if drug review textual sentiment is associated with the hazard of a serious drug recall and whether this relationship varies depending on the gender of the reviewer. We analyze textual sentiment on drug reviews from WebMD along with 13 years of drug recall data using several hazard models. We find that the more negative the drug review sentiment, the greater the hazard of a serious recall on that drug. This relationship is completely explained by drug reviews written by females; reviews written by males have no explanatory power. Our findings are confirmed by numerous robustness checks. In post-hoc analysis, we explore possible mechanisms by comparing female and male adverse events on the recalled drugs in our study. Our contributions to gender diversity and drug quality literature lead to implications for the FDA, WebMD, and firms that manufacture prescription drugs.},

  abstract     = {A significant portion of hospitalizations result in readmissions, many of which are preventable. Additionally, over a quarter of admissions necessitate intensive care unit (ICU) stays. These trends impose significant strain on healthcare systems, leading to penalties and reduced reimbursements for healthcare facilities. Consequently, reducing readmissions stands as a critical priority for healthcare institutions, with a specific focus on ICU processes and procedures. While some healthcare processes, such as vital sign monitoring, are consistent across patient cohorts, disparities in pain management have been well-documented. Existing research predominantly explores biases in outpatient settings, particularly in the underestimation and undertreatment of pain for Black patients. However, these biases can extend to the frequency of pain measurements in ICUs, where continuous monitoring plays a pivotal role in patient care. This study investigates disparities in pain measurement frequencies in ICUs for patients of different races and their impact on early readmission rates. Utilizing a dataset of ICU stays from a major U.S. healthcare institution, we employ mediation analysis with instrumental variables by performing a two-step mediation analysis using an IV-Probit estimator to answer these research questions. Our findings reveal that the frequency of pain measurements in the ICU stays partially mediates the relationship between a patient's race and the probability of early readmission. Specifically, Black patients receive fewer pain measurements during their ICU stays compared to White patients, increasing their likelihood of 30-day readmission. This study represents the first to demonstrate that bias in pain management extends to the frequency of pain measurements in intensive care settings, shedding light on a critical aspect of healthcare disparities and their impact on readmission rates. The implications of our findings span healthcare practice, operations, and the growing body of literature on healthcare equity, offering valuable insights into addressing these disparities.},

  abstract     = {Racism at the individual and societal levels has been identified as a cause of disparity in healthcare outcomes in the United States but reducing disparity has been slow. This study disentangles the relative effects of two types of racism on inpatient service delivery and hospital mortality: technology bias and implicit bias. Drawing on clinical data from intensive care unit (ICU) patients with sepsis, we use propensity score matching to balance groups of White and nonwhite patients and run a causal mediation analysis to test our model, which links patient race to hospital mortality through two mediating variables related to service delivery: (1) discrepancies in blood oxygen saturation measurements due to technology bias embedded in the medical device (i.e., pulse oximeter) and (2) administration of supplemental oxygen, which could be impacted by clinicians’ implicit bias. We first replicate prior findings that (a) higher discrepancies between oximeter readings and laboratory tests for nonwhite patients compared to Whites and (b) a higher discrepancy lowers the likelihood of patients receiving supplemental oxygen during the ICU stay. We make a unique contribution by finding that nonwhite patients with sepsis have a 79% higher risk of hospital mortality in the ICU compared to Whites, with nearly half of the racial disparity in mortality stemming from technology bias and less than a fifth from clinicians’ implicit bias. Eliminating these two biases would help save thousands of lives annually among racial/ethnic minorities with sepsis in the United States. Our findings indicate that technology bias exerts a greater negative impact on mortality than does implicit bias, highlighting the importance of device approval standards and clinicians' ability to customize decision criteria for supplemental oxygen.},

In such cases, organizations face variable profits based on the socioeconomic status (SES) of the end-user. We introduce the Inclusive Practice Options (IPO) framework to explain how, within the constraints of existing business models, SMEs can balance financial, operational, and community-related priorities. Vulnerable end-users should be considered in the end-user mix of all three priorities and may contribute to the overall fiscal solvency of the organization because while servicing these end-users may generate less revenue per end-user, they also may require less processing time, lower processing variability, and fewer denied or missed payments contributing to more stable profits on average. To present this framework, we first describe the conceptual and theoretical underpinnings of IPO. We then delineate the three dimensions of the IPO framework: comprehensive financial performance, operational fairness, and community lift. We describe how the IPO framework can be applied to stakeholder management, market segmentation, and resource allocation. We provide an illustrative mental health practice case for additional context. Finally, we discuss future research directions and the implications of viewing operations management through this multidimensional lens.},

  abstract     = {Diversity, equity, and inclusion are at the core of present-day health and humanitarian logistics. Aid organizations advocate inclusive people-centered approaches to ensure that affected communities receive appropriate aid in an effective and equitable way. Tensions and even conflicts can arise if affected communities perceive the distribution of aid as inequitable. These perceptions are driven by people’s so-called distributional preferences. These preferences are shaped by culture, social bonds, and experiences, and they describe how an individual’s well-being and behavior are impacted by potential inequalities. Their importance is increasingly recognized by aid organizations, but research on equity in health and humanitarian logistics remains focused on equal access and prioritizing needs. Using current examples from the Syrian and Rohingya refugee crises, we show the importance of recognizing and managing distributional preferences. Based on these examples and in line with diversity, equity, and inclusion principles, we discuss several ways that we, as the operations community, can help conceptualize inclusive and people-centered approaches that account for distributional preferences.},

  abstract     = {In this essay, our analysis takes important insights on diversity and inclusion from the behavioral literature but critically contextualizes them against the reality of humanitarian operations. Humanitarian operations are characterized by system immanent diversity, particularly between local and expatriate aid workers, who not only bring valuable different perspectives to the table but also differ along multiple dimensions of diversity into a so-called diversity faultline. Such a faultline, however, provides fertile ground for continued conflict resulting in relational fractures and, ultimately, inefficient collaboration. While, in theory, inclusion could help overcome the negative effects of faultlines, in practice, the time pressure for humanitarian organizations to quickly respond to disasters makes it effectively impossible to engage in it. Against this background, we argue, humanitarian organizations should take preemptive action before disaster strikes. Specifically, we posit that the pre-disaster phase presents an opportunity to engage in inclusion in order to cultivate relational resilience between local and expatriate aid workers. Such resilience would enable them to not only better weather the inevitable relational fractures during a disaster response (and thus stay more functional throughout), but also quickly realign with each other in the post-disaster phase. We conclude with a set of concrete recommendations for practicing inclusion in the pre-disaster phase.},

  abstract     = {The recent refugee crises in Ukraine (2022) and Syria (2011) have created millions of refugees, 40% of whom are children. The education systems of countries hosting refugees struggle to integrate such large populations. In addition, language barriers and the stigma associated with refugees hamper inclusive and equitable education opportunities for these children. There is thus a risk of “lost generations” distanced from education, who may eventually depend on social security systems and monetary aid in the long term. This study considers the following research question: How can a host country improve the inclusion of refugee children in the education system without overburdening its infrastructure? First, we document the availability and accessibility challenges and opportunities that refugee children face during the Syrian refugee crisis. We then develop an inclusive planning strategy aligned with existing capacity and resources and formulate two adaptations of the maximum covering problem (MCP): cooperative capacitated MCP with heterogeneity constraints (CCMCP-HC) to improve the current schooling access in Türkiye and Modular CCMCP-HC to guide early planning in the case of a future crisis. Our computational analyses illustrate that the proposed approach yields higher schooling rates and capacity utilization than existing approaches. Our results emphasize the importance of having a planning strategy in the initial phases of a crisis that considers future integration possibilities. This study analyzes Türkiye’s experience and lessons learned to provide a road map for other ongoing and future refugee crises.},

  abstract     = {Critical infrastructures in many countries face the problem of aging and, thus, require significant upgrades to continue serving their purpose for the next few decades, especially in the face of extreme weather events caused by global climate change. Given the urgent need for such improvements and the substantial funding gaps being experienced, prioritizing investments in critical infrastructures is a challenging task for governments. Furthermore, the need to assure equitable solutions, as well as to consider deep uncertainty due to climate change, adds to the complexity of the problem. We seek to address this complexity by developing a set of models that explicitly consider both horizontal and vertical equity, along with efficiency, in prioritizing stormwater infrastructure improvement projects. While horizontal equity seeks to provide equal resources to everyone, vertical equity aims to allocate relatively more resources to vulnerable groups who are disproportionately susceptible to shocks and are more likely to fall into chronic poverty. By differentiating between losses in horizontal equity and vertical equity due to efficiency considerations, the models provide a practical approach to find the right balance among efficiency, horizontal equity, and vertical equity. The initial models are then extended into regret-based optimization models to help address the issue of deep uncertainty. A case study of stormwater infrastructure improvement in the City of Miami is presented, through which the performance of the models is explored both with and without the projected sea-level rise scenarios. The findings highlight the value of the proposed approach in promoting equity while maintaining efficiency.},

  abstract     = {Prolonged emergency department (ED) length of stay (LOS) is associated with detrimental effects on patient care quality and outcomes. There is evidence that certain groups of patients experience longer LOS based on their gender or race, especially with regard to the part of LOS that is attributable to waiting to be seen by a clinician. This work tackles the patient prioritization and placement aspects of ED operations with the goal of improving throughput and wait time in a fair, equitable way. We present a novel Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) predictive-prescriptive formulation that incorporates a breakdown of predicted patient ED LOS into actionable pieces. We incorporate considerations for fairness and reformulate the MILP formulation into a compact and computationally tractable formulation that can be solved efficiently in real time. To deal with uncertainty, we propose a sampling-based solution, and provide provable guarantees regarding its convergence, stability and sample complexity. The proposed solution increases the throughput of the ED by 50 − 100 % and decreases the average wait time by 50 − 75 % compared to current hospital practice. In addition, the method is near-optimal in terms of throughput, and produces high-quality solutions in terms of average wait time compared to a clairvoyant oracle. Our proposed approach demonstrates desirable properties when it comes to fairness in patient prioritization, illustrating a path for addressing hidden biases in patient ED wait times and hospital operations as a whole. This work was conducted in collaboration with a large US academic medical center. Data from more than 40,000 patient visits were used to shape and evaluate the predictive-prescriptive models. An important practical contribution is translating a complex algorithm’s output into recommendations that can be operationalized in the context of existing processes in the ED. Specifically, we develop an interpretable metamodel that is trained to mimic the predictive-prescriptive algorithm’s decisions and provides a transparent set of rules for patient placement. The method will be used by the hospital to improve patient flow and quality of care as well as to support more fair and consistent bed allocation decisions.},

  abstract     = {This article focuses on the social choice problem in which decisions are based on the utility of multiple stakeholder types. The sum of these utilities—Utilitarian welfare—is one of the most important objectives in solving the social choice problem. While it is the most efficient solution, maximizing Utilitarian welfare may lead to unfair outcomes. However, Encouraging a Utilitarian decision-maker to adopt a fair decision is challenging due to the associated efficiency loss. This article takes a novel perspective by motivating a Utilitarian decision-maker to make fair decisions from an uncertainty-averse standpoint. We study the problem where the proportions of stakeholder types are uncertain and propose a distributionally robust optimization (DRO) model that maximizes the worst-case Utilitarian welfare over an ϕ -divergence-based uncertainty set. We provide three aspects of the relationship between fairness and the uncertain-averse Utilitarian welfare maximization. First, we establish that the worst-case Utilitarian welfare adheres to all five axioms of unfairness-averse cardinal welfare functions with two stakeholder types and satisfies four of these when this number exceeds two. Second, we demonstrate that with the maximal extent of uncertainty aversion, the DRO model identifies the Egalitarian welfare maximizer, which prioritizes fairness. Furthermore, given several conventional assumptions, the proposed model selects the Nash welfare maximizer, an objective trade-off between efficiency and fairness, with moderate levels of uncertainty aversion. Lastly, we present numerical studies of two specific instances of the social choice problem—resource allocation and facility location—to show that, as uncertainty aversion increases, our model increasingly emphasizes fairness.},

Furthermore, while supplier diversity efforts are not yet widespread, these initiatives are increasingly common, especially in the form of references to diversity in companies’ supplier codes of conduct. Companies in North America and in certain economic sectors, such as the financial and healthcare sectors, are more likely to have such efforts in place. Based on our data, companies that report on their internal diversity and companies that have other forms of supplier sustainability initiatives are also more likely to have supplier diversity initiatives.

We use the 2017 Diversity Campaign of the “Big Three” institutional investors as our main identification strategy to support a causal interpretation.

However, the survival of minority-owned businesses depends on their ability to win contracts from buyer firms—which might be impacted by buyers’ racial biases. Whether discrimination can exist in sourcing and affect this ability is an unexplored question, perhaps due to an implicit assumption that business-to-business settings are immune from discriminatory biases. In this paper, we use controlled experiments to study whether racial discrimination can affect sourcing decisions. We find that when a supplier's sales manager has a distinctively Black name, buyers are 6.5% less likely (statistically significant at 1% level) to select that supplier compared to a supplier with a sales manager with a distinctively white name. Our findings suggest that equal-opportunity legislation similar to that already in place in the labor market may be needed in the sourcing context. Our findings have implications for executives, suggesting that supplier diversity programs and procurement-bias training can boost corporate performance by expanding the supplier pool, and simultaneously enhance a firm's corporate social responsibility profile.},

Conversely, the U.S. federal government's spending with these suppliers exceeds 25%. The government's use of set-asides, which limit the bidding on certain contracts to small or small and diverse suppliers, is one reason that might explain this difference. Although set-asides entail socioeconomic benefits for these suppliers, they are controversial. Our study contributes to this debate by investigating the types of federal procurement contracts typically awarded to small and diverse suppliers and whether set-asides help these suppliers win more complex contracts. We also examine contractual performance in terms of cost overruns and delays for contracts performed by small and diverse suppliers versus other suppliers and contracts awarded to small and diverse suppliers through set-asides versus no set-asides. We test these effects by analyzing 38,417 procurement contracts awarded by all U.S. federal departments and independent agencies between 2011 and 2022. Our results show that small and diverse suppliers are more likely to be selected for less complex contracts. Set-asides, however, have a boosting effect, increasing the likelihood that these suppliers are selected even for more complex contracts. Moreover, contracts performed by small and diverse suppliers exhibit (a) similar cost overruns and delays as contracts performed by other suppliers and (b) lower cost overruns and shorter delays when awarded through set-asides rather than without set-asides. Our results have implications for the sourcing literature, small and diverse suppliers, and procurement professionals.},

One specific call to action from stakeholders is the public disclosure of intersectional diversity data in EEO-1s, which companies with 100+ employees must report each year to the federal government, but which companies rarely make publicly available. Conducting five online experiments to examine how consumers perceive transparency into an operation’s workforce diversity, we find no evidence that disclosing workforce diversity data undermines customer attitudes or behaviors toward the company, even when the disclosures reveal racial disparities across job categories. Instead, we find that consumers perceive firms that disclose their workforce diversity data to be more committed to DEI initiatives, view disclosing firms more positively, and are more likely to choose their offerings over those of non-disclosing firms. We find these attitudinal and behavioral differences to be especially pronounced when the disclosures reveal progress in diversification.},

  abstract     = {Amidst stakeholder demands for transparency and the recent pandemic, the inner workings of supply chains have become more visible. This visibility has shone a spotlight on workplace corporate social irresponsibility (CSI)—actions within a company's internal supply chain operations perceived to harm the well-being of its employees. At the same time, companies scrambling to recruit new talent for operations and supply chain management (OM/SCM) face dual challenges in the shortage of diverse talent and the emergence of new generations in the workforce. Research indicates that younger generations and women more broadly expect social responsibility from their employers, but it is unclear how they perceive social irresponsibility when evaluating job offers. To begin to address this gap, we draw on attribution theory and develop hypotheses that examine prospective employees’ responses to workplace CSI in supply chain operations and whether their responses vary with gender and pay. Results from a conjoint task and mixed effects models reveal that both young men and young women respond negatively to job offers from firms with pervasive workplace CSI across their supply chain operations and atypical levels of workplace CSI relative to other firms. Although we do not find gender differences in general, supplementary analyses offer more nuanced insights (e.g., young men respond less favorably than young women when workplace CSI is pervasive, whereas young women respond more favorably than young men to above-average pay). Overall, our study advances understanding of the spillover effects of workplace CSI on new talent recruitment and highlights that the new generation's preferences run deeper than traditional gender-based expectations. In doing so, we offer timely guidance for executives and human resource managers as companies struggle to recruit diverse new OM/SCM talent.},

  abstract     = {Excellent service is often discussed with an assumption of equivalency in its application, yet the reality is far more complex. Customers have distinct needs that pose distinct challenges for frontline service employees. In hotel settings, providing excellent service to a diverse set of guests is more nuanced when frontline employees themselves are from a wide variety of backgrounds. Whereas the literature considers operational tactics to promote excellence in guest service, it is unclear whether training, policies and procedures, and leadership designed to advance excellence have the same impact on employees who, by virtue of their background, are more attuned to guests’ needs. We extend the literature by empirically demonstrating that operational tactics impact frontline employees’ perceptions of service equality, with racial/ethnic minority employees seeing statistically distinct impacts. Employing a sample of 25,698 employee-year observations across 32 luxury hotels in the United States over 3 years, we find that codified policies and procedures, as well as training, improve assessments of guest service equality. In contrast, racial/ethnic minority employees are less impacted than their White counterparts by leadership stances that seem to promote equality more broadly. After controlling for time and other relevant employee- and hotel-level variables, operational tactics (a) improve perceptions of service equality, and (b) reduce the disparity between White and racial/ethnic-minority service-quality assessments. Our findings provide further direction for managers to elevate such perceptions of customer service equality across the board by leveraging training and by reinforcing clear operating policies and procedures.},

In this study, we report on two laboratory experiments that induce routines to assess the stability of coordination and adaptability to organizational changes across mixed-gender teams of varying diversity and empirically examine operational performance via routines. Based on frequentist and Bayesian statistical approaches, our findings reveal that compared to other mixed-gender teams, balanced-gender teams (a) attain stability in routines faster, (b) exhibit varying levels of adaptability to internal and external changes, and (c) deliver better economic benefits via resource- and time-efficiencies under normal and change conditions, and this is attributable to their higher pace of routine formation. We find the operational-performance effect more prominent in situations of change than in normal conditions.

  abstract     = {Research suggests that workgroup diversity influences various group and organizational-level outcomes. However, few studies consider its impact at the individual level, particularly in knowledge-related work, where workers have considerable discretion in making decisions. Our study aims to fill this gap by examining two significant types of workgroup diversity—gender diversity, a kind of bio-demographic diversity, and specialization diversity, a kind of job-related diversity—in a healthcare setting. Using detailed data on the entire patient population of Florida hospitals (10.14 million patients), including 25,187 physicians across 240 hospitals over a period of 4 years, we find that physicians who work in departments with more diverse colleagues (in terms of gender and specialization) have better patient outcomes, for example, a shorter stay, lower cost of treatment and increased likelihood of discharge to home. We find that the impacts of colleague diversity are contingent on departmental focus. Our research shows that specialization diversity, a type of job-related and deep-level difference, especially helps physicians who work in more specialization-diverse departments perform better when their departments are less focused. In contrast, we find that physicians in more gender-diverse departments perform even better when in more focused departments. Our results are robust to alternate explanations and biases arising from patient selection, population demographics, and endogeneity in diversity measures. Our study adds to a relatively small literature in operations management that considers how workgroup diversity (beyond diversity in on-the-job experience) might influence individual performance. Our research also contributes to the emerging conversation on why hiring managers should actively work toward improving workplace diversity.},

Our findings suggest that DEI-commitment announcements can yield positive abnormal stock returns during the announcement period (from day −1 to 0 and from day −1 to 5).

We introduce a Markov decision process (MDP) with an ordinal action space as a way to quickly and safely identify the MSTI for an individual patient. The MDP’s ordinal action space allows users to update the expected outcomes of multiple actions with only a single decision. We solve the MDP and show how the expected outcomes of each action can be presented to clinicians as a menu of treatment options. We describe conditions under which the MDP is guaranteed to find the MSTI under uncertainty. We illustrate the model’s effectiveness through an application to AMD, and show that following the MDP can reduce patient exposure to symptoms by 38% and find the optimal interval 7% faster when compared to current clinical protocols.},

A more informative credible product review has two effects on cheap-talk advertising. First, a credible product review plays a disciplinary role that enables the firm to provide informative advertising. Second, it reduces the incremental value of cheap-talk advertising. We find that, in equilibrium, whether or not the advertising is consistent with a credible product review is informative about product quality. The results also imply that an overly informative product review can reduce the total information available to customers by deterring the firm from providing informative advertising.},

The retailer needs to decide which commodities to place on each level of the shelf (location decision), and determine the stock level for each selected commodity at the shelf (stock decision) that can be adjusted based on updated demand prediction, under constraints on allocation and capacity, so as to maximize total expected profit. Key issues of the problem include demand endogeneity on vertical-location effect and the demand ambiguity that may arise from the ever shorter life cycles of commodities and other complicated determinants. We address the problem in a rolling-horizon fashion and develop a two-phase data-driven robust optimization model leveraging a decision-dependent Wasserstein metric that incorporates time-series demand forecasts and captures vertical-location effect under demand ambiguity. We derive tractable solution schemes for the model, in which the phase-I model determines the optimal location decision by solving one instance of mixed-integer linear program, while the phase-II model admits an analytical solution for updating the optimal stock. Furthermore, we discuss the sensitivity implications on how the ambiguity aversion impacts the optimal stock, and prove the consistency of the model solution under regularity condition on the underlying demand process that well justifies the asymptotic performance of the proposed data-driven approach. Finally, we extend our model to incorporate substitution effect, and conduct sufficient numerical experiments with real-life data that demonstrate the performance of our model.},

Consumers who face the uncertainty of the product value are assumed to have different levels of hassle costs of buying from the online channel and choosing which channel to visit. Our equilibrium analyses show that the brand has an incentive to use the retailer's offline channel to achieve an intended market segmentation based on hassle cost levels. Interestingly, the retailer's optimal profit and the brand's optimal prices both increase in search cost. Showrooming decreases consumer surplus when the value of a good match is relatively low or high, and a “Win–Win–Win–Win” situation in which all stakeholders (the retailer, the brand, consumers, and the social planner) benefit from monetizing the showrooming service may exist. Our paper also explores the role of a price-matching policy and service costs incurred by the retailer. Relevant managerial implications are discussed.},

  abstract     = {We examine a scenario in which a service provider updates its queue length information to customers at a specific frequency. Customers decide whether to join the queue based on the most recent update. Our objective is to determine the optimal updating frequency that benefits both the service provider and customers. Using a two-dimensional continuous-time Markov process, we model the actual and announced queue length processes. By proving the identical distributions of these two processes under a Poisson updating scheme, we derive closed-form solutions for customers’ utility functions. Our findings demonstrate that customers adopt a generalized mixed-threshold strategy at equilibrium, and their certainty about whether to join the queue or balk does not always increase with fresher information. Furthermore, we reveal that due to customers’ different sensitivities to information freshness, system performance metrics such as throughput and total customer utility exhibit non-monotonic behavior in response to the updating frequency. Consequently, providing fresher information does not necessarily lead to improved system performance. To address this, we propose algorithms to determine the optimal updating frequency for each system performance metric and identify the conditions under which different updating frequencies are optimal. We demonstrate that any positive updating frequency can achieve customer utility no worse than the no-information system. Additionally, in systems with high customer arrival rates, updating with a positive updating frequency can improve throughput. Furthermore, we prove conditions under which a positive and finite updating frequency can yield higher throughput and total customer utility compared to real-time information systems.},

  abstract     = {In this article, we incorporate the effects of multi-unit purchases into consumer choice models and investigate the associated joint assortment and price optimization problems. Under the proposed two-stage choice framework, consumers first form a consideration set, and then select a product with the optimal quantity from the consideration set to maximize their utility. For the joint assortment and pricing problem with homogeneous consumers, we find that a multi-purchase-willingness-ordered assortment is optimal under certain technical conditions, and propose a polynomial-time algorithm to find the optimal assortment and prices for general cases. We further show that the optimal prices and assortment size are not monotone in multi-purchase preference and multi-purchase resistance. For the joint assortment and pricing problem with heterogeneous consumers, we first prove that this problem is NP-hard. We then consider a scenario with discrete prices and develop a fully polynomial-time approximation scheme by considering a finite number of consumer segments and nested consideration sets. We conduct an empirical study on the JD.com dataset and show that the new choice framework can improve model fitting and prediction accuracy compared with existing choice models with multiple purchases. We reveal that our model is especially suitable for datasets exhibiting a strong diminishing marginal effect for product variety. We further extend our analysis to price competition and establish the existence and uniqueness of a Nash equilibrium. For the joint optimization with fixed costs, we develop an algorithm that can find a solution guaranteeing at least half the optimal expected profit.},

  abstract     = {Supplier selection is critical in the sourcing process: retailers evaluate candidate suppliers across multiple attributes, including price, quality, speed, and service, to locate an ideal supply chain partner. While related theoretical research requires prior knowledge of retailers’ preferences across attributes, little empirical evidence about the criteria has been drawn from actual sourcing decisions. Capitalizing on an innovative online marketplace where manufacturers sell production capacity, our research reveals the relative importance assigned by retailers to over twenty supplier attributes including price, product quality, speed in multiple phases from ordering to delivery, and various ancillary services. Our research enables a direct connection between theoretical models and business practices and solidifies existing survey studies by removing reporting bias and increasing representative samples. Using various machine learning approaches, we discover that speed and price attributes are considered the most important, followed by quality, and finally, service offerings. We further investigate how supplier selection criteria are adjusted based on order sizes and product features. We reveal that, as the order size increases, price and quality attributes become more important while speed and service attributes plummet in importance. Furthermore, we find that retailers attach a higher value to speed and service attributes with trendy innovative products, but care more about the price dimension with long-life-cycle functional products. Based on these findings regarding supplier selection criteria, we provide investment guidelines for suppliers by quantifying the economic value associated with each non-price attribute. Also, to enable more efficient information disclosure, we recommend that online platforms consolidate their service menus by removing services with low enrollment rates and low impact on deal formation.},

Disruptions are a real threat to supply chains, especially as the supply chains become longer and more complex. When buyers and sellers write a purchase contract, specifying every possible contingency related to disruptions may not be realistic. However, the ability to renegotiate once a disruption occurs can help buyers and suppliers find efficient solutions. We conducted a controlled laboratory experiment consisting of three studies, each exploring different conditions regarding relationship length, bargaining power, and communication. Our findings indicate that the ability to renegotiate increases buyer profit and decreases disruption inefficiency in short-term relationships but not in long-term ones. In free bargaining, where bargaining power is equal, the impact of renegotiation is greater than in ultimatum bargaining, where bargaining power is unequal. Additionally, when communication is not allowed in ultimatum bargaining, renegotiation significantly enhances buyer profit and reduces disruption inefficiency. These insights can assist managers in designing and negotiating incomplete contracts in environments prone to supply disruptions.

  abstract     = {Malaria remains a significant public health concern in several developing countries. Tropical weather, coupled with poor environmental and socioeconomic conditions, increases mosquito activity and disease transmission in impoverished nations. The most effective strategy to prevent and control malaria is the use of long-lasting insecticidal nets, or LLINs. Ensuring that LLINs are effectively and equitably distributed to those who need them most is crucial yet challenging, especially since financial and health resources are scarce in endemic countries. Through a real-world case study conducted in the Brazilian Amazon, which accounts for 99% of malaria cases in Brazil, we propose a Malaria Vulnerability Index (MVI). This composite index encompasses epidemiological, socioeconomic, and environmental factors. Using the MVI, we developed a prioritization-based location-allocation model to maximize the benefits of targeting the most vulnerable municipalities for malaria interventions. Our mathematical model relies on discrete coverage levels, which makes the allocation of LLINs more flexible while ensuring community-wide protection. We also explore the theoretical relationship between our proposed model and classical demand covering problems. Finally, we discuss some approaches to delivering more equitable solutions by minimizing the number of underserved areas. Our results include comparisons between various malaria interventions and provide practical insights. In particular, we show that we can drastically reduce the number of underserved areas without compromising the effectiveness of the LLINs allocation through lexicographic optimization. The results also reveal that with investment levels up to 50% of the ideal, we can fully protect the endemic area after 2 years of successive interventions.},

Legalizing access to recreational cannabis may shrink the illicit market as it could be a substitute for illicit substances—the substitution effect. Alternatively, recreational cannabis may serve as a gateway drug to illicit drugs and raise the risk of using illicit substances—the gateway effect. Using novel darknet transactional data along with public health databases, we add evidence to the debate by empirically investigating the impact of recreational cannabis legalization on illicit drug use and mortality. Capitalizing on a quasi-experiment opportunity in which U.S. states legalized recreational cannabis at different times, we found a significant increase in the mortality of illicit drug overdose, along with the initiation and use of illicit drugs after the policy, i.e., the gateway effect. This effect is evident in a significant surge of Bitcoin transactions on darknets—a major source of illicit drugs—after the policy. It is also particularly salient in states allowing higher dosage possession and lower excise taxes on recreational cannabis. Our study contributes novel data to address the public health debate and provide policymakers with timely regulatory recommendations on recreational cannabis legalization.},

To investigate the mechanisms behind these effects, we conduct a randomized controlled experiment with 233 participants.

Using data from a large teaching hospital, we empirically examine the effect of ICU capacity strain on patient discharge. We find that capacity strain has no effect on the health status of discharged patients and that capacity strain leads to a shorter length-of-stay in the ICU, but the magnitude of the effect is less than half a day in the most extreme scenarios. In post-hoc analyses, we find evidence the discharge process is expedited by starting discharges earlier in the day when capacity is strained, demonstrating that more efficient discharges can free up space without compromising patient health. In addition, we find a decrease in patient admissions during periods of capacity strain. To our knowledge, this is the first study to examine the direct relationship between ICU capacity strain and patient health at discharge, and it builds on the existing literature that has examined the effects of ICU capacity strain on proxies for patient health at discharge. We advocate that hospitals use outcome measures based on patient status at discharge to accurately assess the impact of capacity strain on quality of care. In addition, our work highlights the need for tailored research approaches and management practices for different types of ICUs, as generalizing the impact of ICU capacity strain across different settings may lead to inaccuracies.},

We find that local warehousing prompts consumers to delay purchases in hopes of discounts, compelling e-tailers to lower prices to encourage early buying. Consequently, the firm may not utilize the local warehouse, even when it comes at no cost. Intriguingly, we find that increased local storage expenses or diminished product durability could paradoxically elevate firm profits. Our numerical analysis highlights the benefits of strategically distributing inventory across both central and local warehouses, especially under conditions of reduced demand uncertainty. Moreover, we establish that our key insights persist in the case of multiple local warehouses.},

Our focus is on policies constrained to fulfill two fairness properties that preclude outcomes wherein different groups of agents experience different treatment on average. We formulate the problem as a high-dimensional stochastic optimization problem and study it through the use of a closely related deterministic variant. We show that the optimal static solution to this deterministic variant is asymptotically optimal for the dynamic problem under fairness constraints. Though solving for the optimal static solution gives rise to a nonconvex optimization problem, we uncover a structural property that allows us to design a tractable, fast-converging heuristic policy. Traditional schemes for retention ignore fairness constraints; indeed, the goal in these is to use differentiation to incentivize repeated engagement with the system. Our work (i) shows that even in the absence of explicit discrimination, dynamic policies may unintentionally discriminate between agents of different types by varying the type composition of the system, and (ii) presents an asymptotically optimal policy to avoid such discriminatory outcomes.},
