  abstract     = {This paper examines the concept of creativity from a historical-psychological perspective, exploring its evolution over time and its manifestation as both an individual and collective phenomenon. Through a narrative-theoretical review of the literature on creativity’s conceptualization, nature, and valuation, we examine how social, cultural, and psychological factors have influenced the understanding of creativity throughout history. The discussion contrasts key aspects at the individual level, such as motivation, personality, intuition, exceptionality, and intelligence, with group dimensions like domain, field, collaboration, background, and the societal consequences of creative acts. The paper presents diverse psychological frameworks, including behaviorism, psychoanalysis, Gestalt psychology, humanistic psychology, and cognitive psychology, each offering unique insights into the mechanisms behind creativity. By tracing the historical phases of creativity—from its early association with divine creation to its modern applications in art, science, and technology, as well as its relationship with artificial intelligence—this paper highlights how creativity has been judged and valued across different eras. One of the conclusions drawn is that while the concept of artistic genius and originality cannot be disentangled from its broader social and cultural context, creativity is also an intensely personal psychological process, with the internalized sociocultural context acting as a proxy for external fields and domains.},

  abstract     = {We humans have scaffolded minds into an ecological niche. Considering this, the main thesis I will defend in this article is that we humans live surrounded by images, and we spatially organise these images into a particular cultural niche which I call imaginal space, a material or virtual space that we interactively navigate. We use such images in the imaginal space as fundamental props in the imaginative dynamics of our scaffolded minds. The images we find in our imaginal space are public depictive representations. They are twofold objects: on the one hand, they are material objects in that they can be manipulated into the ecological niche; on the other hand, they also are normative objects in that their representational function can be redesigned through a practice of use. As a first consequence of this main thesis, I will contend that public representations emergent into the imaginal space of a certain community may play a crucial regulative role for imagination: emergent systems of public representations can get a canonical status in their community, so that they can exert a normative power on the members of that community regulating their imagistic mental representations. As a second consequence, I will defend that the canonical images emergent in the imaginal space constitute the collective imagery of a human community: they support and influence the development of public narratives in the considered community.},

  abstract     = {The foraging task is a commonly studied scenario for distributed swarm robotic systems. The robots switch searching and resting behavior in a distributed manner to perform foraging quickly and energy efficiently. It is known that robots that are resting can act as a potential labor pool in addition to saving energy. Because they function as a potential labor pool, resting robots can help with foraging if needed. In this study, we consider the group foraging task, which requires two or more robots to transport a food item. In a group foraging task, resting robots can help with the transportation of a heavy food item in response to the recruitment of other robots. Until now, the efficacy of the resting behavior as a potential labor pool has been suggested, but the environments in which this function is dominant is still unknown. In this study, we propose a state-transition model for robots that includes the resting behavior and investigate the performance through multi-agent simulation. By comparing models with and without the resting behavior, we found that the function of the resting behavior as a potential labor pool is dominant in cases when the food items are heavy or the population is small.},

Autopoiesis 2.0 is heavily influenced by Hans Jonas and other thinkers in the tradition of Naturphilosophie. Despite the similarity in name, this is quite different from Veit’s contribution to philosophy of nature in the sense of Dennett, Godfrey-Smith, and Sterelny.

Philosophers and biologists emphasize the importance of environmental complexity and how organisms deal with it in evolution of cognitive processes. This article adds to these discussions by highlighting the importance of stress physiology in processes connected to plant cognition. While this article supports the thesis that life means cognizing (i.e., sensing the environment, arranging internal processes according to that perception, and affecting the environment with its actions), it also emphasizes that there are various kinds of organisms. In this regard, plant cognition is not animal cognition. However, given both the variety and continuity in evolutionary processes and the similarities even between the distantly related organisms in the tree of life, I argue that it is usually useful to consider and compare physiological and molecular mechanisms in plants and animals as well as the concepts and research processes in animal and plant science. Although the “pathological complexity” thesis that Veit (2023) presents is fruitful in considering the evolution of consciousness and cognition, I argue that, when thinking of biological processes in relation to cognition, stress can be a helpful concept (maybe even as suitable as pathological complexity) in thinking of organisms’ responses to environmental complexity and their adaptation and acclimation processes.},

  abstract     = {In his book “ A Philosophy for the Science of Animal Consciousness ,” Walter Veit attempts to provide a philosophical foundation for the science of animal consciousness, especially focusing on hedonic evaluation. While he highlights an important aspect of phenomenal consciousness, several conceptual issues warrant further examination. The first one is the role of evaluation. Veit argues that hedonic evaluation explains the origin of consciousness, but it seems implausible for conscious animals to have the evaluative aspect alone. Instead, the origin(s) of consciousness may have linked to the capacity for making prediction that combine both perceptive and evaluative aspects. Second, it is necessary to distinguish between creature and state consciousness for discussing subjective unity. Autonomous movements of octopus arms do not necessarily imply multiple conscious subjects within one body. Alternatively, an octopus may experiences “switching” within a single phenomenal field between conflicting perceptions as in binocular rivalry. Lastly, the adaptivity of consciousness requires scrutiny. Just as different animal phyla show various body plans, the neuroarchitecture of consciousness may be implemented in different ways among animals. Specific mentalities may be fine-tuned to specific lifestyles, similarly to specific adaptation of animal bodies. It appears that the “adaptivity” of ground plans (e.g., vertebrate body and vertebrate consciousness) makes no sense or must be considered differently from the adaptivity of specific character states (e.g., the body shape and food preferences of a bat). The current analysis could help improve Veit’s proposal, linking it to previous accounts and establishing a solid philosophical foundation for this research field.},

Based on these insights and given the capacity of humans to construct and adapt their ecological niches, this article explores the creation of enriching sporting contexts for the development of adaptive player-environment interactions in competitive team sports. This model of adaptation emphasizes the importance of creating a sports niche rich in shared affordances to enable team coordination through the development of individual and collective homeostasis in different sub-phases of competitive performance. In a homeostatic sports system, principles of play advocated by coaches allow players to intentionally coordinate and adapt their actions to shape the collective identity of the team. The team’s identity is shaped by the synergetic development of collective attractors (stable system states) emerging at specific scales of complexity. This is facilitated through the manipulation of constraints by the coaching and support staff. These ideas have important implications for implementing team sports training and performance preparation, helping to transform the self-regulating tendencies of players through adapting their behaviors to dynamic performance contexts.},

When operating in continuously changing environments, robots often struggle to achieve satisfactory decision-making outcomes due to a lack of prior knowledge about the environment. Investigating how to endow robots with human-like learning and decision-making capabilities to make sound decisions in changing environments remains a significant topic in robotics research. This paper models the processes of memory replay and memory consolidation by mimicking the memory conversion mechanism of the human brain, from the cellular level (synaptic consolidation) and system level (system consolidation), and proposes a human-like brain memory consolidation model based on a motivated developmental network. By leveraging different neurotransmitters’ neuromodulatory effects and considering the dependency of memory conversion on the neocortex during the memory transformation process, the model simulates the conversion of short-term memory to long-term memory and the reconsolidation of long-term memory, enhancing memory plasticity and improving the robot’s learning and decision-making capabilities in dynamic environments. Physical experiments and comparative tests have verified the feasibility and superiority of the proposed model.},

However, previous studies in this field have yielded variable and conflicting results leading to inconsistent conclusions. Here we present a computational model integrating key neurocognitive mechanisms, all of which have been considered critical in accounting for atypical behavior in autism, such as bottom-up/top-down processes, the excitation-inhibition (E/I) balance, and neural noise. By systematically altering these mechanisms within an artificial neural network, we explored their functional roles on perceptual fluctuations. Our approach provides a clearer understanding of how specific behaviors may correlate with varied neural and cognitive alterations in autism. This model offers a perspective on key debates in autism research, such as the direction for the excitation/inhibition imbalance, and the possible dominance of bottom-up processing. Moreover, this model challenges heuristic single-mechanism theories of autism, favoring neurodiversity approaches by illustrating the spectrum’s complexity, where identical behaviors might result from diverse neurocognitive mechanisms. We highlight the need for future research to employ multiple behavioral tasks to map neurocognitive alterations in autism, aiming for more precise identification and management in therapeutic scenarios.},

  abstract     = {In an article from 2023, Tom Froese suggests Irruption Theory as a new conceptual framework for understanding the causal efficacy of normative states, particularly concerning motivations for action in embodied agents. Froese’s theory is built on three central tenets, two of which—the Irruption and Scalability theses—are central to its claim that normative states causally affect behavior via the creation and amplification of the microscopic, stochastic processes after which the theory is named. According to Froese, this amplification process explains why agential behavior is underdetermined by its material basis, creating a causal gap that can be filled by causally-efficacious normative states. In this commentary, I argue that the Irruption and Scalability theses do not give a sufficiently detailed account of how underdetermination arises in material systems and how the scaling-up of irruptions causally affects normative behavior. However, the theses should not be rejected outright. Rather, I argue that Irruption Theory should adopt central concepts from complex systems theory in order to adequately describe the causal efficacy of normativity in embodied agents. To this end, I suggest that it should identify normative states as relations holding between embodied agents and similar-scale systems in their environment. These relations can be usefully described and modeled as topologies of a large-scale agent-environment system that top-down constrain an agent’s behavior. Accordingly, I propose interpreting irruptions as a boundary condition for normative behavior, with normative states as one of its control parameters (237 words).},

  abstract     = {Several research labs around the world have been developing and applying hyperscanning, an innovative methodology that allows to observe what happens in the brains of two or more people when they interact in different social/interpersonal settings. Hyperscanning findings seem to point to the fact that synchronized interbrain activity may be caused by cooperative social interaction, showing that traditionally dominant perspectives about the mind‒brain relation (in particular, supervenience and internalism regarding mental contents) should be revised or replaced by others that adequately integrate the influence of human interactions on the neurobiological underpinnings of cognition (e.g., contextual emergence, externalism regarding mental contents, 4E cognition). This shift would undeniably also have important implications in the fields of mental health (e.g., opening avenues for the design of diagnoses and treatments for social skill conditions) and the social sciences (regarding aspects such as sociocultural interplay, collective decision-making and public participation, social conflict and polarization, interpersonal curiosity, and autonomy).},

  abstract     = {Insightful theoretical and experimental research has shown toroidal representations of entorhinal grid cells working in continuous attractor neural networks. However, this commentary underscores a critical aspect: these toroidal representations do not exist in isolation from the environment within the brain’s neural networks. Instead, they arise as a response to dynamic requirements within the relational context of the task being performed. This view highlights the adaptive nature of these neural representations discussing their emergence based on specific task-related demands rather than as pre-existing, independent neuronal structures.},

  abstract     = {Animals can navigate through complex environments with amazing flexibility and efficiency: they forage over large areas, quickly learning rewarding behavior and changing their plans when necessary. Some insights into the neural mechanisms supporting this ability can be found in the hippocampus (HPC)—a brain structure involved in navigation, learning, and memory. Neuronal activity in the HPC provides a hierarchical representation of space, representing an environment at multiple scales. In addition, it has been observed that when memory-consolidation processes in the HPC are inactivated, animals can still plan and navigate in a familiar environment but not in new environments. Findings like these suggest three useful principles: spatial learning is hierarchical, learning a hierarchical world-model is intrinsically valuable, and action planning occurs as a downstream process separate from learning. Here, we demonstrate computationally how an agent could learn hierarchical models of an environment using off-line replay of trajectories through that environment and show empirically that this allows computationally efficient planning to reach arbitrary goals within a reinforcement learning setting. Using the computational model to simulate hippocampal damage reproduces navigation behaviors observed in rodents with hippocampal inactivation. The approach presented here might help to clarify different interpretations of some spatial navigation studies in rodents and present some implications for future studies of both machine and biological intelligence.},

  abstract     = {The Diverse Intelligence research seeks to understand commonalities in behavioral competencies across a wide range of implementations. Especially interesting are simple systems that provide unexpected examples of memory, decision-making, or problem-solving in substrates that at first glance do not appear to be complex enough to implement such capabilities. We seek to develop tools to determine minimal requirements for such capabilities, and to learn to recognize and predict basal forms of intelligence in unconventional substrates. Here, we apply novel analyses to the behavior of classical sorting algorithms—short pieces of code studied for many decades. To study these sorting algorithms as a model of biological morphogenesis and its competencies, we break two formerly ubiquitous assumptions: top-down control (instead, each element within an array of numbers can exert minimal agency and implement sorting policies from the bottom up), and fully reliable hardware (instead, allowing elements to be “damaged” and fail to execute the algorithm). We quantitatively characterize sorting activity as traversal of a problem space, showing that arrays of autonomous elements sort themselves more reliably and robustly than traditional implementations in the presence of errors. Moreover, we find the ability to temporarily reduce progress in order to navigate around a defect, and unexpected clustering behavior among elements in chimeric arrays consisting of two different algorithms. The discovery of emergent problem-solving capacities in simple, familiar algorithms contributes a new perspective showing how basal forms of intelligence can emerge in simple systems without being explicitly encoded in their underlying mechanics.},

  abstract     = {A core issue of embodiment is the question of how phenomenal and agentive consciousness relates to external forms of behavior. Instead of biasing the question in terms of the “hard problem” as to why and how consciousness arises from brain processes (D. Chalmers), it is suggested to ask for psychophysical correlations in a metaphysically neutral way. This, however, demands (1) to explore both sides of the problem with equivalent precision and depth—not only the physical—and (2) to develop a metaphysically neutral tool to formalize them in a consistent way. Concerning (1), the basic structure of mental micro-activities found in first-person studies on cognitive processes suggests extending the scope of qualia as a mark of consciousness. In the context of Structure Phenomenology (H. Witzenmann), functionally negative phenomenality experienced in ambiguous or meaning-deprived situations and inner agentive qualia of mental activities are correlated with the decompositional signature of sensory-neural processing and synchronized neural oscillations. Concerning (2), G. Günther’s Transclassical Logic is briefly introduced and deployed to integrate the mental, psychophysical, and physical contextures in a three-valued formal framework which also includes enacted and embodied aspects. The emerging picture rebalances first-person and third-person aspects of cognition by functionally separating and dynamically integrating them, thus revitalizing the neurophenomenological research agenda with new experimental proposals and concrete hypotheses.},
