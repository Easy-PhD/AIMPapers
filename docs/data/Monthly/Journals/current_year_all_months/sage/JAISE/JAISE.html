  abstract     = {The neighbor-based method has become a powerful tool for addressing the outlier detection problem, which aims to assess the abnormality of a sample based on its compactness relative to neighboring samples. However, most existing methods primarily focus on designing various processes to identify outliers, while the contributions of different types of neighbors to the detection process have not been adequately explored. To address this gap, this article investigates the role of neighbors in existing outlier detection algorithms and introduces a taxonomy that utilizes three key components: information, neighbor, and methodology, to define hybrid methods. This taxonomy provides a framework that can inspire the development of novel neighbor-based outlier detection algorithms by combining different components from each level. Extensive comparative experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets, including performance evaluations and case studies, demonstrate that reverse K-nearest neighbor-based methods perform well and that dynamic selection methods are particularly effective in high-dimensional spaces. Furthermore, the results confirm that strategically selecting components from this taxonomy can lead to the development of algorithms that outperform existing methods.},

Today, people use mobile devices on a daily basis in different conditions of mobility and encumbrance. This research investigates a usability evaluation of stylus and finger during two levels of mobility (standing and walking), four levels of encumbrance (both hands busy, dominant hand busy, non-dominant hand busy, and both hands available), and two types of gestures (tapping and dragging). We measured the usability based on movement time, error rate, and user satisfaction. The experiments show a negative effect of encumbrance and mobility for both stylus and finger. The interaction with stylus takes more time with encumbrance than that of finger; furthermore, the error rate for stylus is greater than finger. Finally, a survey conducted for user satisfaction showed that the user prefers to interact with stylus when both hands are available, and the encumbrance affects stylus more than finger.},

  abstract     = {Smart farming systems, while enhancing agricultural productivity, are increasingly vulnerable to cyber threats due to their reliance on interconnected devices and networks. However, existing Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) often suffer from high computational costs and suboptimal detection accuracy due to irrelevant features. To address this challenge, this study proposes a novel hybrid filter-based feature selection method designed to optimize feature selection for artificial neural network (ANN)-based IDS in smart farming environments. Unlike conventional methods that rely solely on chi-square, mutual information, or mean absolute deviation, the proposed method combines these techniques to leverage their complementary strengths. Furthermore, a comprehensive smart farming system was established to collect extensive data, creating a dedicated dataset named Smart-Farm-IDS for binary classification, distinguishing between normal operations and anomalies. Both shallow and deep ANN models were employed to detect these anomalies, with their performances compared in detail. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed hybrid feature selection method enhances detection accuracy while reducing computational overhead compared to existing methods. This study offers a robust approach for improving the security and resilience of smart farming systems, providing a foundation for more secure agricultural operations.},

The proposed framework addresses key challenges posed by fragmented data collected from small-scale farming devices, as well as the complexities associated with varying climate and soil patterns. Specifically, our framework optimizes the selection of clients in the federated learning process through deep reinforcement learning. The evaluation of the proposed framework is conducted across different multifarm configurations, showcasing its scalability and adaptability. Furthermore, the FL-DDQN framework facilitates collaborative training of a weather and climate forecasting model using a hybrid convolutional neural network (CNN)–long short-term memory architecture. This model is enhanced by incorporating regulation and normalization techniques, which help mitigate the effects of distribution shifts and pattern changes in dynamic farming environments. The results demonstrate high accuracy, achieving a low mean absolute error for soil moisture (0.0118), temperature (1.0200), and relative humidity (4.3958). Additionally, we integrate autoencoders based on CNNs to detect anomalies in irrigation system sensor readings by evaluating the reconstruction error. The proposed framework achieves a significantly lower reconstruction error compared to recent state-of-the-art methods, confirming its robustness in anomaly detection.},

  abstract     = {In uncontrolled environments, facial expression recognition encounters challenges such as poor image quality, uneven lighting, facial occlusions, and head pose variations. To address the challenges of facial occlusions and head pose variations, this paper introduces the Feature Segmentation-Based Dual-Stream Network (FS-DSN). The network consists of four components: a feature pre-extraction module, a feature segmentation module, a global feature extraction module, and a local feature extraction module. The pre-extraction module extracts mid-level features from facial expression images, which are then segmented into three areas: left eye, right eye, and mouth. The global feature extraction module uses the full set of features to extract global expression features, while the local feature extraction module focuses on the segmented regions. This dual-stream approach captures both broad and subtle expression changes, enhancing the semantic interpretation of facial expressions. Empirical tests show FS-DSN's robust performance, achieving accuracies of 88.82%, 60.09%, 78.33%, and 74.17% on the RAF-DB, SFEW 2.0, FED-RO, and FER-2013 datasets, respectively.},

  abstract     = {The concept of smart cities is becoming increasingly popular, driven by the goal of improving residents’ overall quality of life. Effective thermal management is a crucial component of smart cities, especially in light of significant changes in global weather patterns. These changes pose challenges for individuals seeking indoor comfort, particularly in workplaces and schools. Occupants often struggle with extreme temperatures, leading to increased energy consumption due to excessive use of air conditioners and heaters. In this work, we propose a novel edge machine learning-based smart controller for air conditioners to maintain user-preferred thermal comfort levels while minimizing energy consumption. The trained long short-term memory model is embedded in a mobile application designed to predict the predicted mean vote (PMV) based on temperature setpoints and the PMV index. Through this mobile application, personalized parameters such as clothing insulation, metabolic rate, and other environmental factors are communicated to the controller. The performance of the smart controller in maintaining PMV-based temperature setpoints for cooling is compared with fixed setpoints. The results reveal that by utilizing PMV-based setpoints for male occupants, the smart controller reduces energy consumption by 38.14% compared to a fixed setpoint of 26°C and by 60.68% compared to 25°C, while maintaining the user-preferred thermal comfort level.},

Across all datasets, our hybrid design outperformed all previous benchmarks, achieving high accuracy rates. These results underscore the model’s adaptability and efficiency in handling diverse sensor data types and activity scenarios.

This approach offers flexibility and accessibility, making it attractive to many students. Many institutes also offer virtual professional courses for business and working professionals. However, ensuring the reachability of courses and evaluating students’ attentiveness presents significant challenges for educators teaching virtually. Various research works have been proposed to evaluate students’ attentiveness using facial landmarks, facial expressions, eye movements, gestures, postures, etc. However, no method has been proposed for real-time analysis and evaluation. This paper introduces a multi-modal student attentiveness detection (MMSAD) model designed to analyze and evaluate real-time class videos using two modalities: facial expressions and landmarks. Using a lightweight deep learning model, the model analyzes students’ emotions from facial expressions and identifies when a person is speaking during an online class by examining lip movements from facial landmarks. The model evaluates students’ emotions using five benchmark datasets, achieving accuracy rates of 99.05% on extended Cohn-Kanade (CK+), 87.5% on RAF-DB, 78.12% on Facial Emotion Recognition-2013 (FER-2013), 98.50% on JAFFE, and 88.01% on KDEF. The model identifies individuals speaking during the class using real-time class videos. The results from these modalities are used to predict attentiveness, categorizing students as either attentive or inattentive.},

  abstract     = {With the increasing application of construction robots on construction sites, autonomous path planning in unstructured and uneven construction sites has become an urgent challenge. Current path planning approaches face several issues, including prolonged computation times, low efficiency, and redundant nodes, often resulting in impractical paths for robots. Addressing these concerns, this study introduces a global path planning method based on an enhanced A* algorithm to ensure safe and robust navigation of construction robots in such challenging environments. The Improved A* algorithm initially incorporates a bidirectional alternating search strategy to expedite computational speed. Subsequently, it employs path node filtering to mitigate issues associated with bidirectional search and reduce the number of critical nodes, thereby enhancing search efficiency. Furthermore, the introduction of slope constraints decreases the robot's climbing and tilting angles, augmenting the safety of the planned paths. Finally, the paths are smoothed using Bézier curve fitting, facilitating better motion control for the robots. The efficacy of the improved algorithm was validated through experiments on elevation maps with varying terrain and obstacle densities. Simulation results indicate that, compared to the traditional A* algorithm, the Improved A* algorithm reduced computation time by 71.05% to 82.90% and the number of critical nodes by 51.94% to 70.53%, while only increasing the path length by 14.6% to 37.84%. Additionally, there was a significant reduction in climbing and tilting angles, and the paths have become smoother. Therefore, this method not only improves efficiency while generating safe and reliable paths in unstructured and uneven construction sites, but also enables robots to adapt to complex environments, and promotes automation and intelligent construction processes.},

Our analysis identifies four primary groups of individuals, each distinguished by different SES and behavioral tendencies, ranging from practical and family-oriented to lifestyle-driven patterns. The results show that SES strongly influences mobility behaviors and interactions with urban spaces, revealing disparities in housing access, services, and work environments between different population segments. These findings highlight the interaction between mobility, social habits, and economic conditions, offering key insights for urban planning and strategies to mitigate the impacts of gentrification. The proposed methodology can be applied to other cities to support inclusive policymaking, transportation planning, and spatial equity strategies, fostering more accessible and equitable urban environments.},

  abstract     = {Due to the continuous growth of Internet and online applications, network traffic classification is not only becoming one of the most crucial disciplines in network management but is also becoming quintessential for providing advanced tasks such as Quality of Service and network security. Moreover, even though many studies have been undertaken in recent years, real-time encrypted traffic classification continues to be an important challenge in the field of network traffic classification. Therefore, in this paper a real-time network traffic classification system is proposed together with five new models. The real-time classification system classified each incoming real-time packets into appropriate classes of interest and the five new models make use of a cost-sensitive learning strategy to deal with the unbalanced data problem during the training phase. The proposed models, which are called Cost-Sensitive Long-Short Term Memory (CSLSTM), Cost-Sensitive Gated Recurrent Unit (CSGRU), Cost-Sensitive Convolution Neural Network (CSCNN), CSNN with LSTM and CSCNN with GRU, can handle both traffic categorization and application identification. These proposed models were compared with prominent methods in this field and the proposed CSCNN was observed to outperform the researched deep learning models by at least 4% to 16% in correctly classifying packets from the ISCX VPN-nonVPN dataset.},

The major concern in the edge computing scenario is its privacy risks. A user, as well as a cloud data preservation scheme, is the main aim of this paperwork. Test data is given by the user to access the cloud-based data processing framework. The training of the suitable model is carried out by utilizing the data stored in the cloud. The suggested model divides the entire model into two sections, namely, the untrusted cloud and the trusted edge. On the trusted edge side the data is directly provided to the developed advanced deep learning model called the Atrous Convolution based Cascaded Deep Temporal Convolution Network (ACC-DTCN) for the data analysis process. However, instead of giving the whole data directly to the untrusted cloud side, the test data is protected on the cloud side by utilizing a hybrid encryption technique called the Optimal Hybrid Encryption Model (OHEM). Both Attribute-Based Encryption (ABE) and Homomorphic Encryption (HE) are utilized in the recommended OHEM scheme. The OHEM variables are tuned with the help of an advanced algorithm called the Enhanced Ladybug Beetle Optimization algorithm (ELBOA). The confidence score vector among the testing and training data is predicted by the implemented ACC-DTCN model by utilizing the encrypted data on the cloud side. The suggested privacy preservation scheme provides higher prediction accuracy and prevents interference attacks while contrasting it against conventional methods during extensive experimentations.},

Focused on a shallow coastal lagoon, Mar Menor, this work analyzes statistically daily Sentinel 3 information behaviour and compares Machine Learning and Deep Learning techniques to enhance efficiency and accuracy data of this satellite. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) stand out as a robust choice, capable of delivering excellent results even in the presence of anomalous events.

  abstract     = {Adequate hydration is important for one’s health, but many people do not consume sufficient fluids. By constantly monitoring fluid intake, we gain information that can be extremely useful in dealing with unhealthy drinking habits. This paper deals with the problem of developing a machine learning method for drinking detection, intended for use on an edge device, with a specific focus on power consumption. The proposed approach is based on data from inertial sensors built into a practical, non-invasive wrist-worn device that monitors wrist movement throughout the day and automatically detects drinking events. It ensures low energy consumption by triggering the machine learning only when the probability of drinking is high, as well as by other energy saving measures. To develop and validate our methods, we collected data from 19 participants, which resulted in 135 hours of data, of which 2 hours and 30 minutes correspond to drinking activities. The algorithm was thoroughly assessed through both offline testing and by running the algorithm directly on the wristband in real life. During the offline evaluation, we obtained a precision of 94.5 %, a recall of 84.9 %, and an F1 score of 89.4 %. Testing in real life demonstrated a precision of 74.5 % and a recall of 89.9 %. Additionally, the energy efficiency analysis showed that our proposed technique for triggering the drinking detection method reduced the battery power consumption during the periods of inactivity by a factor of 5.8 compared to continuously monitoring for drinking events.},

  abstract     = {A wireless sensor network (WSN) is defined as an infrastructure-less wireless network containing a substantial amount of the sensor's data deployed in an ad hoc manner to form a network. Sensor nodes are used along with onboard process data to monitor the environment in a particular area. Sensors are connected to the base station, which also functions as a processing unit within the WSN system. A base station is used to share the data with the help of the internet. Sensor nodes within WSN have limited power, resulting in a reducing lifespan, especially in human-inaccessible locations. This paper reviews the energy-efficient protocols for environmental monitoring and energy-harvesting WSNs. This paper investigates three protocols, viz., the low energy adaptive clustering protocol, the distributed energy-efficient clustering protocol, and the stable election protocol. The result-driven approach followed in this paper presents a comparative analysis of these protocols to find the best protocol for energy efficiency. Throughput indicating packets received successfully at the base station has been evaluated in this paper. This metric indicates the effectiveness of the protocols in achieving a longer lifespan for the sensors. Furthermore, the dynamic deployment and challenges associated with environmental monitoring applications, considering the physical, network, and medium access control layers, have been discussed in this paper. Given the above, this paper presents a systematic literature review to identify the interdisciplinary work done by researchers towards the applications of WSNs in the field of environmental monitoring.},

Understanding and identifying common behaviours such as apathy, depression, and wandering can enable caregivers and medical professionals to enhance the quality of care for patients and implement appropriate interventions to mitigate cognitive decline. This paper analyses localization data collected from patients with mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer’s disease residing in a healthcare facility. In particular, metrics and behavioural indices are computed to classify the behaviour of individuals. The proposed method was initially applied to the localization data of seven residents, each exhibiting distinct behaviours. Subsequently, validation was conducted using data from 46 patients monitored over three months. Classification results were compared with the observations made by healthcare operators and physicians. The study demonstrated a high level of accuracy in classifying patients into different behavioural domains, such as wandering and depressed–apathetic, with 42 out of 46 cases correctly classified.},

Traditional monitoring by road operators predominantly relies on fixed location cameras, yielding limited and sometimes ambiguous information. This study proposes leveraging Twitter (now known as ‘X’) as a more comprehensive data source alongside employing fuzzy techniques with Deep Learning (DL) neural networks such as CNN, VGG16, and Xception to analyze and classify traffic images. The innovative integration of these technologies augments the precision in categorizing varying traffic conditions, namely fluid and dense traffic, accidents and fires. Thus, this proposal mitigates the ambiguities prevalent in traffic image interpretation, and reduces the dependency on static data sources.

However, traditional elevators are unable to know passengers’ destination floors and waiting times in advance. Consequently, passengers often experience longer waiting times. With the flourishing advancement of the Internet of Things (IoT) and edge computing, it has become feasible to know the demands of passengers in advance and how long they have been waiting. In this work, we propose SmartRide, an intelligent elevator system that provides reservation, check-in, boarding, and scheduling features. SmartRide allows users to reserve elevators in advance through a mobile app from anywhere. Artificial intelligence (AI) image recognition technology is employed for efficient check-in and boarding confirmation. Additionally, a novel scheduling algorithm is proposed to minimize the average waiting time by leveraging the reservation information. Experimental results demonstrate that SmartRide can accurately manage check-ins and boarding confirmations. SmartRide can also reduce waiting times by at least 30% compared to traditional elevator scheduling using FCFS (First Come First Served), thereby optimizing elevator operational efficiency and improving user experience.},

Firstly, the EEG is subjected to a short-time Fourier transform to construct a time-frequency feature data set, which is used as input to DQN along with temperature. Secondly, the agent performs environmental interaction actions in each time step and returns a reward value. Finally, the optimal strategy for indoor temperature control is formulated by the agent.

The increase in the number of vehicles in cities, especially in urban areas, as well as the growth of network services in smart cities, has created the need to provide easy-to-use smart parking networks. However, the most critical challenge in building such a network is the secure storage of customer and service provider information. Using blockchain to store data securely requires powerful computing resources and high energy consumption. In this research, combining existing ideas in the field of smart parking and blockchain, a solution will be proposed to use blockchain in dynamic nodes with poor computing resources, such as sensors used in smart parking. As one of the layers introduced in smart parking, we simulated the proposed algorithm in a wireless sensor network (WSN). In light of the findings of previous studies demonstrating the efficacy of Zigbee technology as a mesh topology in WSNs with low-cost infrastructure and resource requirements and our simulation results, we employed this technology to evaluate its performance in our proposed smart parking application. On the other hand, functions created with the Solidity language can use online payment services on such a secure network.},

Main concern points like possible attacks and mitigation techniques, and privacy protection should be addressed. Certain regulation system should be implemented, and transportation habits should be considered. After thinking over those points, adaption of CAVs can be achieved more smoothly.

  abstract     = {In the modern era of sports training, the synergy between motion capture and Virtual Reality (VR) offers an innovative approach to enhancing training precision. This systematic review delves into the application of motion capture within VR for sports training, highlighting its transformative potential. Through a comprehensive literature search, we examined the myriad applications, from physical conditioning enhancements to accelerated rehabilitation processes. Our findings underscore the capability of real-time feedback, immersive training environments, and tailored regimes that this fusion provides. However, despite its promise, challenges such as hardware constraints, data processing complexities, and interaction interface limitations persist. Future trajectories indicate an increasing influence of AI and deep learning, promising more sophisticated hardware and a broader spectrum of applications, including niche sports disciplines. The review concludes with an emphasis on the wider societal implications, suggesting a shift towards a holistic athlete well-being approach.},
