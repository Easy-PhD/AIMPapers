  abstract     = {The concept of smart cities is becoming increasingly popular, driven by the goal of improving residents’ overall quality of life. Effective thermal management is a crucial component of smart cities, especially in light of significant changes in global weather patterns. These changes pose challenges for individuals seeking indoor comfort, particularly in workplaces and schools. Occupants often struggle with extreme temperatures, leading to increased energy consumption due to excessive use of air conditioners and heaters. In this work, we propose a novel edge machine learning-based smart controller for air conditioners to maintain user-preferred thermal comfort levels while minimizing energy consumption. The trained long short-term memory model is embedded in a mobile application designed to predict the predicted mean vote (PMV) based on temperature setpoints and the PMV index. Through this mobile application, personalized parameters such as clothing insulation, metabolic rate, and other environmental factors are communicated to the controller. The performance of the smart controller in maintaining PMV-based temperature setpoints for cooling is compared with fixed setpoints. The results reveal that by utilizing PMV-based setpoints for male occupants, the smart controller reduces energy consumption by 38.14% compared to a fixed setpoint of 26°C and by 60.68% compared to 25°C, while maintaining the user-preferred thermal comfort level.},

  abstract     = {With the increasing development of applications in smart homes, healthcare, and personal fitness, a broad scientific community has identified human activity recognition (HAR) as a critical study issue. This paper introduces a unique hybrid deep learning architecture for efficient human activity identification that combines multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) with convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The suggested CNN–MLP model provides a robust solution for HAR problems by leveraging the feature extraction capabilities of CNNs and the classification prowess of MLPs. Four different datasets were employed to comprehensively assess the model’s performance: WISDM, PAMAP2, and UCI HAR datasets for smartphone-based HAR, and the CASAS Aruba dataset that provided a novel perspective on activity detection in a home context, based on smart homes, while the smartphone-based UCI HAR, WISDM, and PAMAP2 datasets offered a variety of activity data. Across all datasets, our hybrid design outperformed all previous benchmarks, achieving high accuracy rates. These results underscore the model’s adaptability and efficiency in handling diverse sensor data types and activity scenarios. Furthermore, the model’s robustness and generalizability, demonstrated by its consistent performance across multiple datasets, establish it as a significant contribution to the field of HAR.},

  abstract     = {Virtual education (online education or e-learning) is a form of education where the primary mode of instruction is through digital platforms and the Internet. This approach offers flexibility and accessibility, making it attractive to many students. Many institutes also offer virtual professional courses for business and working professionals. However, ensuring the reachability of courses and evaluating students’ attentiveness presents significant challenges for educators teaching virtually. Various research works have been proposed to evaluate students’ attentiveness using facial landmarks, facial expressions, eye movements, gestures, postures, etc. However, no method has been proposed for real-time analysis and evaluation. This paper introduces a multi-modal student attentiveness detection (MMSAD) model designed to analyze and evaluate real-time class videos using two modalities: facial expressions and landmarks. Using a lightweight deep learning model, the model analyzes students’ emotions from facial expressions and identifies when a person is speaking during an online class by examining lip movements from facial landmarks. The model evaluates students’ emotions using five benchmark datasets, achieving accuracy rates of 99.05% on extended Cohn-Kanade (CK+), 87.5% on RAF-DB, 78.12% on Facial Emotion Recognition-2013 (FER-2013), 98.50% on JAFFE, and 88.01% on KDEF. The model identifies individuals speaking during the class using real-time class videos. The results from these modalities are used to predict attentiveness, categorizing students as either attentive or inattentive.},

  abstract     = {With the increasing application of construction robots on construction sites, autonomous path planning in unstructured and uneven construction sites has become an urgent challenge. Current path planning approaches face several issues, including prolonged computation times, low efficiency, and redundant nodes, often resulting in impractical paths for robots. Addressing these concerns, this study introduces a global path planning method based on an enhanced A* algorithm to ensure safe and robust navigation of construction robots in such challenging environments. The Improved A* algorithm initially incorporates a bidirectional alternating search strategy to expedite computational speed. Subsequently, it employs path node filtering to mitigate issues associated with bidirectional search and reduce the number of critical nodes, thereby enhancing search efficiency. Furthermore, the introduction of slope constraints decreases the robot's climbing and tilting angles, augmenting the safety of the planned paths. Finally, the paths are smoothed using Bézier curve fitting, facilitating better motion control for the robots. The efficacy of the improved algorithm was validated through experiments on elevation maps with varying terrain and obstacle densities. Simulation results indicate that, compared to the traditional A* algorithm, the Improved A* algorithm reduced computation time by 71.05% to 82.90% and the number of critical nodes by 51.94% to 70.53%, while only increasing the path length by 14.6% to 37.84%. Additionally, there was a significant reduction in climbing and tilting angles, and the paths have become smoother. Therefore, this method not only improves efficiency while generating safe and reliable paths in unstructured and uneven construction sites, but also enables robots to adapt to complex environments, and promotes automation and intelligent construction processes.},

This study uses mobile phone data, point-of-interest data, and publicly available socioeconomic indicators to present an integrated analysis of individual socioeconomic and behavioral profiles in Lisbon. To effectively segment users and identify mobility patterns, we employ multiple clustering techniques tailored to different data types: varied density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (VDBSCAN) detects meaningful places by identifying clusters of varying densities in mobile phone data, while K-Means and K-Modes cluster numerical and categorical data, respectively, to determine socioeconomic status (SES) and categorize work environments. Our analysis identifies four primary groups of individuals, each distinguished by different SES and behavioral tendencies, ranging from practical and family-oriented to lifestyle-driven patterns. The results show that SES strongly influences mobility behaviors and interactions with urban spaces, revealing disparities in housing access, services, and work environments between different population segments. These findings highlight the interaction between mobility, social habits, and economic conditions, offering key insights for urban planning and strategies to mitigate the impacts of gentrification. The proposed methodology can be applied to other cities to support inclusive policymaking, transportation planning, and spatial equity strategies, fostering more accessible and equitable urban environments.},

Moreover, even though many studies have been undertaken in recent years, real-time encrypted traffic classification continues to be an important challenge in the field of network traffic classification. Therefore, in this paper a real-time network traffic classification system is proposed together with five new models. The real-time classification system classified each incoming real-time packets into appropriate classes of interest and the five new models make use of a cost-sensitive learning strategy to deal with the unbalanced data problem during the training phase. The proposed models, which are called Cost-Sensitive Long-Short Term Memory (CSLSTM), Cost-Sensitive Gated Recurrent Unit (CSGRU), Cost-Sensitive Convolution Neural Network (CSCNN), CSNN with LSTM and CSCNN with GRU, can handle both traffic categorization and application identification. These proposed models were compared with prominent methods in this field and the proposed CSCNN was observed to outperform the researched deep learning models by at least 4% to 16% in correctly classifying packets from the ISCX VPN-nonVPN dataset.},

Test data is given by the user to access the cloud-based data processing framework. The training of the suitable model is carried out by utilizing the data stored in the cloud. The suggested model divides the entire model into two sections, namely, the untrusted cloud and the trusted edge. On the trusted edge side the data is directly provided to the developed advanced deep learning model called the Atrous Convolution based Cascaded Deep Temporal Convolution Network (ACC-DTCN) for the data analysis process. However, instead of giving the whole data directly to the untrusted cloud side, the test data is protected on the cloud side by utilizing a hybrid encryption technique called the Optimal Hybrid Encryption Model (OHEM). Both Attribute-Based Encryption (ABE) and Homomorphic Encryption (HE) are utilized in the recommended OHEM scheme. The OHEM variables are tuned with the help of an advanced algorithm called the Enhanced Ladybug Beetle Optimization algorithm (ELBOA). The confidence score vector among the testing and training data is predicted by the implemented ACC-DTCN model by utilizing the encrypted data on the cloud side. The suggested privacy preservation scheme provides higher prediction accuracy and prevents interference attacks while contrasting it against conventional methods during extensive experimentations.},

By constantly monitoring fluid intake, we gain information that can be extremely useful in dealing with unhealthy drinking habits. This paper deals with the problem of developing a machine learning method for drinking detection, intended for use on an edge device, with a specific focus on power consumption. The proposed approach is based on data from inertial sensors built into a practical, non-invasive wrist-worn device that monitors wrist movement throughout the day and automatically detects drinking events. It ensures low energy consumption by triggering the machine learning only when the probability of drinking is high, as well as by other energy saving measures. To develop and validate our methods, we collected data from 19 participants, which resulted in 135 hours of data, of which 2 hours and 30 minutes correspond to drinking activities. The algorithm was thoroughly assessed through both offline testing and by running the algorithm directly on the wristband in real life. During the offline evaluation, we obtained a precision of 94.5 %, a recall of 84.9 %, and an F1 score of 89.4 %. Testing in real life demonstrated a precision of 74.5 % and a recall of 89.9 %. Additionally, the energy efficiency analysis showed that our proposed technique for triggering the drinking detection method reduced the battery power consumption during the periods of inactivity by a factor of 5.8 compared to continuously monitoring for drinking events.},

  abstract     = {A wireless sensor network (WSN) is defined as an infrastructure-less wireless network containing a substantial amount of the sensor's data deployed in an ad hoc manner to form a network. Sensor nodes are used along with onboard process data to monitor the environment in a particular area. Sensors are connected to the base station, which also functions as a processing unit within the WSN system. A base station is used to share the data with the help of the internet. Sensor nodes within WSN have limited power, resulting in a reducing lifespan, especially in human-inaccessible locations. This paper reviews the energy-efficient protocols for environmental monitoring and energy-harvesting WSNs. This paper investigates three protocols, viz., the low energy adaptive clustering protocol, the distributed energy-efficient clustering protocol, and the stable election protocol. The result-driven approach followed in this paper presents a comparative analysis of these protocols to find the best protocol for energy efficiency. Throughput indicating packets received successfully at the base station has been evaluated in this paper. This metric indicates the effectiveness of the protocols in achieving a longer lifespan for the sensors. Furthermore, the dynamic deployment and challenges associated with environmental monitoring applications, considering the physical, network, and medium access control layers, have been discussed in this paper. Given the above, this paper presents a systematic literature review to identify the interdisciplinary work done by researchers towards the applications of WSNs in the field of environmental monitoring.},

  abstract     = {Dementia, especially Alzheimer’s disease, is increasing due to population ageing and is projected to nearly triple by 2050. Understanding and identifying common behaviours such as apathy, depression, and wandering can enable caregivers and medical professionals to enhance the quality of care for patients and implement appropriate interventions to mitigate cognitive decline. This paper analyses localization data collected from patients with mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer’s disease residing in a healthcare facility. In particular, metrics and behavioural indices are computed to classify the behaviour of individuals. The proposed method was initially applied to the localization data of seven residents, each exhibiting distinct behaviours. Subsequently, validation was conducted using data from 46 patients monitored over three months. Classification results were compared with the observations made by healthcare operators and physicians. The study demonstrated a high level of accuracy in classifying patients into different behavioural domains, such as wandering and depressed–apathetic, with 42 out of 46 cases correctly classified.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a novel Multi-DL Fuzzy Approach aimed at performing image recognition in the development of a real-time traffic alert system, addressing the problem of traffic congestion and related incidents. Traditional monitoring by road operators predominantly relies on fixed location cameras, yielding limited and sometimes ambiguous information. This study proposes leveraging Twitter (now known as ‘X’) as a more comprehensive data source alongside employing fuzzy techniques with Deep Learning (DL) neural networks such as CNN, VGG16, and Xception to analyze and classify traffic images. The innovative integration of these technologies augments the precision in categorizing varying traffic conditions, namely fluid and dense traffic, accidents and fires. Thus, this proposal mitigates the ambiguities prevalent in traffic image interpretation, and reduces the dependency on static data sources. The proposed models showed improved results by combining information from the DL models, elevating accuracy from 84% in crisp classification to 90% utilizing fuzzy information.},

  abstract     = {With the continuous growth of the global population and the concentration of people in urban areas, the development of high-rise buildings has thrived, making elevator waiting time a significant concern. However, traditional elevators are unable to know passengers’ destination floors and waiting times in advance. Consequently, passengers often experience longer waiting times. With the flourishing advancement of the Internet of Things (IoT) and edge computing, it has become feasible to know the demands of passengers in advance and how long they have been waiting. In this work, we propose SmartRide, an intelligent elevator system that provides reservation, check-in, boarding, and scheduling features. SmartRide allows users to reserve elevators in advance through a mobile app from anywhere. Artificial intelligence (AI) image recognition technology is employed for efficient check-in and boarding confirmation. Additionally, a novel scheduling algorithm is proposed to minimize the average waiting time by leveraging the reservation information. Experimental results demonstrate that SmartRide can accurately manage check-ins and boarding confirmations. SmartRide can also reduce waiting times by at least 30% compared to traditional elevator scheduling using FCFS (First Come First Served), thereby optimizing elevator operational efficiency and improving user experience.},

  abstract     = {To solve the problems of sleep disorders such as difficulty in falling asleep and insufficient sleep depth caused by uncomfortable indoor temperature, this paper proposes a deep reinforcement learning method based on deep Q-network (DQN) with human sleep electroencephalogram (EEG) as input to improve human sleep. Firstly, the EEG is subjected to a short-time Fourier transform to construct a time-frequency feature data set, which is used as input to DQN along with temperature. Secondly, the agent performs environmental interaction actions in each time step and returns a reward value. Finally, the optimal strategy for indoor temperature control is formulated by the agent. The simulation results show that this method can dynamically adjust the indoor temperature to the optimal temperature for human sleep, and can alleviate sleep disorders, which has certain practical significance.},

  abstract     = {One of the challenges drivers face in today’s fast-paced urban world is the ability to access parking spaces quickly. The increase in the number of vehicles in cities, especially in urban areas, as well as the growth of network services in smart cities, has created the need to provide easy-to-use smart parking networks. However, the most critical challenge in building such a network is the secure storage of customer and service provider information. Using blockchain to store data securely requires powerful computing resources and high energy consumption. In this research, combining existing ideas in the field of smart parking and blockchain, a solution will be proposed to use blockchain in dynamic nodes with poor computing resources, such as sensors used in smart parking. As one of the layers introduced in smart parking, we simulated the proposed algorithm in a wireless sensor network (WSN). In light of the findings of previous studies demonstrating the efficacy of Zigbee technology as a mesh topology in WSNs with low-cost infrastructure and resource requirements and our simulation results, we employed this technology to evaluate its performance in our proposed smart parking application. On the other hand, functions created with the Solidity language can use online payment services on such a secure network.},

  abstract     = {Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAVs) are rapidly evolving technology with great benefits such as reducing gas emissions and decreasing traffic congestion. They have the potential to change the traditional transportation industry due to their benefits. However, the implementation phase for CAVs decelerates with the uncertainties of legislation on privacy-preserving and public concerns. Perception of people needs to be understood beforehand. Main concern points like possible attacks and mitigation techniques, and privacy protection should be addressed. Certain regulation system should be implemented, and transportation habits should be considered. After thinking over those points, adaption of CAVs can be achieved more smoothly. In this survey paper, we aim to shed light on the obstacles to the widespread use of CAVs by collecting existing literature and creating a sophisticated bouquet of the issues. Public perception, common attacks and mitigation techniques, privacy protection, regulations, and possible transportation habit shifts related to CAVs are examined. With the information gathered from this survey, manufacturers and policymakers can determine an influential pathway for the development of CAVs.},
