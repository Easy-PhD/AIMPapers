  abstract     = {This research introduces an enhanced stratified sampling-density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (SS-DBSCAN), a scalable and robust density-based clustering algorithm designed to tackle challenges in high-dimensional and complex data analysis. The algorithm integrates advanced parameter optimization techniques to improve clustering accuracy and interpretability. Key innovations include a fast grid search method for optimizing the search of optimal minimum points (MinPts) by keeping the ϵ parameter obtained constant. Notably, this study emphasizes the often-overlooked MinPts parameter, introducing a dynamic approach that initiates by calculating density metrics within a specified ϵ distance and adjusting the MinPts range based on the standard deviation of these metrics. This approach identifies optimal MinPts values based on the maximum allowed range. Comprehensive experiments on five real-world datasets demonstrate SS-DBSCAN’s superior performance compared to density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN), hierarchical DBSCAN, and ordering points to identify the clustering structure (OPTICS), evidenced by higher silhouette and Davies–Bouldin index scores. The results highlight SS-DBSCAN’s ability to capture intrinsic clustering structures accurately, providing deeper insights across various research domains. SS-DBSCAN’s scalability and adaptability to diverse data densities make it a valuable tool for analyzing large, complex datasets.},

  abstract     = {The present study provides field based socio-economic data of women slum dwellers in the city of Lucknow, the administrative capital of Uttar Pradesh, India. Being one of the most developed cities in Uttar Pradesh, Lucknow attracts a lot of migrants most of whom come for better economic opportunities and settle in the low-income neighbourhood of the city. Consequently, the number and population of slum colonies have grown simultaneously. In the present times, an increasing number of women migrate independently and are the principal wage earners for themselves and their families. However, since women come with limited job skills and other limited resources, many of them end up in urban slums wherein they remain at a disadvantage in terms of equitable access to work and other resources compared to their male counterparts. In order to draw a holistic picture of the status of female slum dwellers, an exhaustive socio-economic field survey (2020–2021) for 240 women respondents, across a sample of 20 slum colonies was carried out, collecting data on 121 diverse aspects. This high granularity socio economic dataset can be used for carrying out interdisciplinary research as well as formulation and implementation of slum development and urban poverty alleviation programmes.},

  abstract     = {A new unsupervised predictive maintenance analysis method based on the renormalization group approach used to discover critical behavior in complex systems has been proposed. The algorithm analyzes univariate time series and detects critical points based on a newly proposed theorem that identifies critical points using a log-periodic power law function fit. Application of a new algorithm for predictive maintenance analysis of industrial data collected from reciprocating compressor systems is presented. Based on the knowledge of the dynamics of the analyzed compressor system, the proposed algorithm predicts valve and piston rod seal failures well in advance.},
