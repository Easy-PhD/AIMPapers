  abstract     = {This paper proposes a twin-type extreme learning machine based on the weighted linear loss function and projection technique called the weighted linear loss projection twin extreme learning machine (WLPTELM). By introducing the weighted linear loss function, the proposed WLPTELM balances the impact of each sample point on the model performance. By using the projection technique, more discriminant information can be retained and better classification performance can be obtained, which can effectively deal with linearly inseparable problems. Furthermore, it only needs to solve a pair of systems of linear equations, which not only improves the computational efficiency but also ensures the generalization ability of the model. Hence WLPTELM can handle large-scale binary classification problems simply and efficiently. Numerical experiments on artificial datasets and a number of benchmark datasets demonstrated the practicability and validity of the proposed WLPTELM.},

This study employs symbiotic theory to clarify and better comprehend the role of innovation ecosystems in economic resilience. To this end, it identifies five essential components of innovation ecosystems and proposes a conceptual model. Panel data fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) is utilized in the study to identify how these components combine and contribute to economic resilience. The findings reveal three primary configurations, classified as either platform-dominated or network-dominated. The platform-dominated configuration is favored in the eastern economic zone, while the network-dominated configuration is more prevalent in the central economic zone. Additionally, since the COVID-19 pandemic, innovation platforms and networks have become increasingly important in stimulating economic resilience. This study makes several contributions to the literature: (1) responding to the need for further exploration of economic resilience, especially in the post-epidemic era; (2) improving the theoretical comprehension of how innovation ecosystem components combine and interact to better illustrate economic resilience; (3) offering several innovation combinations that can enhance economic resilience through the application of panel data fsQCA methodology.},

The optimization model, developed under fuzzy conditions, utilized the fuzzy order function method. The NSGA-II meta-heuristic algorithm was employed to solve the model, and its results were compared against fuzzy optimization model's solution quality. FMEA results highlighted human resources’ carelessness or inaccuracy as the most critical risk based on Risk Priority Scores (RPN).

  abstract     = {Multi energy systems can flexibly adjust different energy supply ratios to meet real-time energy demand changes, optimize the demand side response of multi energy systems, and improve energy utilization efficiency. Therefore, a power demand side active response efficiency optimization method based on discrete particle swarm optimization algorithm is proposed. This method deeply analyzes the inherent characteristics of residential demand response and industrial demand response, and designs targeted optimization strategies in combination with the active response structure on the power demand side. Its core goal is to minimize the total cost of electricity demand side response and maximize its demand response capability, thereby achieving a dual improvement in economy and efficiency. In order to ensure the effectiveness and feasibility of the optimization process, a series of constraints have been set to ensure the applicability of the solution in practical operation. In the solving process, an improved discrete particle swarm optimization algorithm was adopted, which not only inherits the global search ability of traditional particle swarm optimization algorithms, but also makes it more suitable for solving power demand side response problems through discretization processing. The innovation of this method is mainly reflected in the following aspects: firstly, a targeted objective function is designed based on the actual characteristics of the power demand side; Secondly, an improved discrete particle swarm optimization algorithm was introduced to improve the efficiency and accuracy of optimization solutions; Finally, by comprehensively considering the total cost and maximum demand response capability, the comprehensive optimization of power demand side response efficiency was achieved. The experimental results show that after optimization, the demand side can actively and timely participate in the peak shaving of the distribution network, achieving load reduction; Improved the electrical, thermal, and gas responses of the power system; The loss results are all less than 0.41 MW; The annual response cost is less than 2.52 million yuan; The voltage deviation index of each node is less than 5.56%, which is at least 4% lower than other methods.},

Farmers are interested in conserving and adding additional soil organic carbon to certain fields in order to improve soil health and productivity. The relationship between soil and environment that has been discovered and standardized throughout time has enhanced the progress of digital soil-mapping techniques; therefore, a variety of machine learning techniques are used to predict soil properties. Studies are thriving at how effectively each machine learning method maps and predicts SOC, especially at high spatial resolutions. To predict SOC of soil at a 30 m resolution, four machine learning models—Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, Adaptive Boosting, and k-Nearest Neighbour were used. For model evaluation, two error metrics, namely R 2 and RMSE have been used. The findings demonstrated that the calibration and validation sets’ descriptive statistics sufficiently resembled the entire set of data. The range of the calculated SOC content was 0.06 to 1.76%. According to the findings of the study, Random Forest showed good results for both cases, i.e., evaluation using cross validation and without cross validation. Using cross validation, RF confirmed highest R 2 as 0.5278 and lowest RMSE as 0.1683 for calibration dataset while without cross validation it showed R 2 as 0.8612 and lowest RMSE as 0.0912 for calibration dataset. The generated soil maps will help farmers adopt precise knowledge for decisions that will increase farm productivity and provide food security through the sustainable use of nutrients and the agricultural environment.},

The complexity and confusion of target emotions lead to low accuracy of FER. This study proposes an attentional residual network based spatial transformer mechanism for FER to establish an effective emotion recognition model. First, the learnable module Spatial Transformer Network (STN) was introduced to actively transform the feature map in order to learn the feature map's more general distortion invariance. Second, the parameters and structure of ResNet18 were adjusted, and it was connected to the STN in an end-to-end manner. Finally, by introducing the Squeeze and Excitation (SE) block, which replaces the ReLu function with the Mish function, we improved the stability and precision of the channel weight adjustment. The verification was carried out on three public datasets FER2013, CK+, and JAFFE. Among them, the FER2013 dataset is separated into three sections, training set, public validation set, and private validation set. The ten-fold cross-validation approach was used for the sparse CK + and JAFFE datasets. On the FER2013, CK+, and JAFFE datasets, accuracy rates of 73.25%, 99.18%, and 97.10% were attained, respectively.},

  abstract     = {Named entity recognition is a highly relevant research topic in the field of natural language processing owing to its widespread application, which mainly involves three types of nested entities, discontinuous entities and flat named entities. Notably, nested named entities are characterized by one entity containing multiple sub-entities, ambiguous boundary definitions, and flexible structural formats. These features give rise to challenges such as semantic ambiguity, slow decoding efficiency, error propagation, and information loss. Therefore, to effectively address these issues and enhance classification performance, it is critical to integrate information sources such as internal markers, neighbouring word pairs, first and last word pairs, labels, and related spans. This is achieved in the present study via a newly proposed nested named entity recognition model based on triple cross affine attention. The proposed model encodes the input text using the BERT model and Bi-LSTM before extracting relevant features from the input text by applying DCNN. The extracted feature sequences are used as input into the triple cross affine attention module which computes the scores, allowing the model to classify and predict the outputs using the MLP layer. The experimental results demonstrate that the precision, recall, and F1 value metrics of the proposed method outperform other existing benchmark algorithmic models when applied to the ACE2004, ACE2005, and GENIA standard datasets. Additionally, it exhibits superior recognition performance in nested named entity recognition.},

The presence of dynamic feature points decreases the localization accuracy and robustness of SLAM. In light of this, we propose YER-SLAM, a dynamic SLAM system employing object detection and region-growing algorithm, which fully utilizes the semantic and geometric information contained in images to identify and eliminate dynamic features in the environment. Firstly, we use YOLOv5 object detection to classify the image into static, dynamic, and potentially dynamic regions to generate a semantic mask that incorporates a priori knowledge. Secondly, we utilize a dynamic object detection algorithm that tightly couples object detection with epipolar constraints to initially identify dynamic features in the scene. Subsequently, we propose a novel strategy for the elimination of dynamic feature points, which integrates the acquired dynamic point with a region-growing algorithm to generate a mask for the dynamic region, thereby enabling the exclusion of the region’s feature points in the tracking process. Finally, the experimental results from the TUM dataset reveal that our algorithm achieves a 94.71% reduction in the average absolute trajectory error in highly dynamic environments, compared to ORBSLAM2. YER-SLAM presented in this paper effectively improves localization accuracy in dynamic environments.},

There are ways to identify its presence before it seriously harms the body because it affects all bodily parts and organs. Diabetes also affects the retina of the eyes, rupturing blood vessels there and ultimately leading to irreversible blindness due to complications. This study suggests an enhanced activation function for diagnosing DR using fundus images automatically lowers processing time and loss. In this work, the proposed system design is constructed using a stacking-based Explainable AI model. The increased activation process within the various CNN models was trained and tested using the “Asia Pacific Tele-Ophthalmology Society 2019 Blindness Detection” (APTOS 2019) dataset. The pre-processing phase following data collection revealed data segmentation and augmentation. The deep learning prediction approach is used in the recommended work. Robust stacked model is generated by applying CNN, VGG, and custom-versed model methods. The classification of DR and the operation of explainable AI algorithms are explained in this recommended section. The LIME and SHAP approaches shape the stages of doctoral education. Based on the profile-rated, moderate, and severe phases of DR, the suggested figure illustrates the procedures. The accuracy of the current model was 76.78%. The study contributes by proposing a novel hybrid-stacked model architecture tailored for diabetic retinopathy detection. The future scope for this study could be the integration of additional explain ability techniques such as attention mechanisms or saliency maps to provide more detailed insights into the model's decision-making process.},

  abstract     = {Stock market plays a vital role in country's economy. The estimation of stock market trends and price is important for the investors. Stock forecasting has piqued the interest of investors worldwide. Investors are looking for a forecasting model that is accurate and reliable enough to account for volatile and nonlinear market behavior. The problem of stock price prediction becomes a complicated one due to multiple inputs like technical indicators, financial factors, trends of international markets, and social media data. This research seeks to collect and correlate multiple inputs to analyse their impact on the stock market and improve stock price prediction accuracy. Researchers are attempting to refine effective indicators to aid in stock market forecasting by taking the advantage of ever-growing world wide web. Effective indicators like stock-related events and public sentiment towards the stock plays a significant role in stock volatility, hence can be used in improving prediction accuracy. The paper provides an efficient framework for optimizing the error in short-term stock market prediction with diverse data sources, based on a novel Mayfly Adam Optimization Algorithm (MAOA) and Deep Residual Network (DRN). This novel approach uses Deep Q Network (DQN) with dice coefficient similarity for feature fusion and DRN for prediction. We have considered historical stock market prices of Apple Inc. (AAPL), commodity time-series dataset, news articles and reviews on social media to evaluate the model's effectiveness. The proposed technique accuracy is found to be 96%, with average accuracy of 98.27%. The existing techniques like, Deep Neural Network (DNN), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and Random Forest (RF) models provided accuracy of 82.4%, 85.5%, 88.8%, and 92.39%, respectively. This shows that the proposed model is 13.6% better than DNN, 10.5% better than ANN, 7% better than LSTM and 3.61% better than RF in terms of accuracy.},

  abstract     = {There is a rising need for secure and effective ways to store and retrieve data as data privacy takes on more significance. Due to its decentralized and unchangeable nature, blockchain technology has shown potential in this sector. However, the efficiency and scalability of conventional Blockchain systems are constrained. It is suggested an Inter Planetary File System (IPFS) storage and retrieval system on the Blockchain using Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) with Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) for file encryption, Access Control Lists (ACLs) for data access management, a Name Server for decentralized naming, Layered Radix Tree with Adaptive Hashing (LRT-AH) for indexing and Proof of Fair Chance (PoFC) consensus mechanism to overcome these restrictions. Before storing the data on the IPFS network, the system encrypts it using ECC-AES and uses ACLs to restrict access to only approved users. The Name Server offers a practical method of accessing the saved information without jeopardizing user privacy. PoFC is a fair and effective consensus process since the PoFC algorithm, a revolutionary approach, guarantees that each user has an equal probability of being chosen as the next block minor. LRT-AH provides a scalable and adaptive indexing structure, optimizing data storage and retrieval operations in blockchain environments. The proposed system has demonstrated 50% improvement in efficiency for both insertion and retrieval times over traditional blockchain systems and those utilizing only IPFS. The system performance is analyzed along with scalability and efficiency, proving that it is appropriate for applications requiring massive amounts of data storage and retrieval.},

However, existing methods only make document category predictions based on document nodes in the word-document graph, neglecting the auxiliary role of word nodes in classification. Based on this, this paper proposes a novel GCN structure based on Token-Task Learning (TTL) for text classification. This paper performs part of speech (POS) tagging or Named Entity Recognition (NER) as auxiliary tasks for text classification. By establishing the relationship between token classification and text classification, text category prediction can take into account the information implied by word nodes, thereby enhancing the accuracy of text classification. In addition, this paper replaces Relu in TextGCN with Mish to enhance data fitting capability of GCN. The experiments are carried out on five text classification datasets, and the experimental results show that the proposed method effectively improves the accuracy of text classification while outperforming the comparison methods.},

  abstract     = {This paper investigates information diffusion on online social networks with an emphasis on the network evolution perspective. Unlike most previous works on information diffusion, the structural dynamics of the networks takes center-stage in this work. The proposed work identifies fundamental network structural properties that affect diffusion and generates a corpus of synthetic networks similar to a standard dynamic social network interactions dataset, using a random-rewiring strategy. The work uses machine learning models built for multi-target regression to model and predict the diffusion process on a network, given the structural evolution of a network. This modeling is done based on the data captured at three granularity levels: snapshot-wise, based on an evolution window of 100 snapshots, and an end-to-end evolution. The generated synthetic network corpus is validated using a graph kernel based on the Weisfeiler-Lehman graph isomorphism test for similarity with respect to the selected baseline dataset, and the multi-target regression models’ performance is analyzed based on standard metrics. The proposed model successfully learns from information flow patterns to reveal the complex relationships between network structure evolution and information propagation. The findings highlight the complex relationship between network structure and information movement in dynamic social networks. The multi-target regression models demonstrate robust predictive power, as indicated by the R 2 scores, which quantify the accuracy of the model’s ability to capture the underlying patterns of information diffusion in dynamic social networks.},

  abstract     = {At this stage, network communication technology is increasingly mature, and intelligent wearable products are also widely used in human daily life. Wearable products are popular with users because of their numerous types, complete functions and convenient services. Wearable products integrate interaction technology, and users can interact with products. However, how to improve the user’s interaction experience and reduce the user’s cognitive burden on the interaction interface is an urgent problem in the current product interaction design. Therefore, based on the analysis of the types and related technologies of wearable products, this paper made a specific analysis of the interaction design of wearable products, and established an interaction design model. At the same time, the wearable fall detection system was also tested by machine learning algorithm. The experimental results showed that the average test result of the algorithm in this paper was 87.39%, while the average test result of the traditional algorithm was 83.79%. In terms of the missed alarm rate of fall detection, the average test result of this algorithm was 6.4%, while the average test result of the traditional algorithm was 12.33%. In terms of fall detection sensitivity, the average test result of this algorithm was 92.50%, while the average test result of the traditional algorithm was 88.24%. Compared with traditional algorithms, this method performs better, with lower missed detection rate and higher sensitivity. Innovative combination of machine learning algorithm, through three-dimensional coordinate system, differentiation and vector sum formula, improves the accuracy and reliability of fall detection. In conclusion, the algorithm in this paper can effectively optimize the relevant performance of the system, thus improving the accuracy of the system’s fall detection.},

In order to effectively achieve the classification and localization of surface defects on the cylinder liner, this paper establishes a dataset for surface defects on cylinder liner and proposes a based on improved YOLOv5 algorithm for detecting surface defects on cylinder liner. Firstly, a machine vision system is established to acquire on-site images and perform manual annotation to build the dataset of surface defects on cylinder liner. Secondly, the GSConv SlimNeck mechanism is introduced to reduce the model complexity; the Bi-directional Feature Pyramid Network (BiFPN) is used to fuse the feature information at different scales to enhance the detection accuracy of small surface defects on cylinder liner; and embedding the SimAM attention mechanism to focus on the object region of interest and improve the accuracy and robustness of the model. The final improved YOLOv5 model reduces the number of model parameters by 15.8% compared to the non-improved YOLOv5. And the experimental results on our self-built dataset for cylinder liner defects show that the mAP0.5 is improved by 0.4%. This means that the accuracy of model detection was not compromised.

These studies are not merely endeavors; they represent concerted efforts to increase building energy efficiency and address mounting concerns regarding sustainability and resource utilization. In the intricate domain of heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems, energy optimization challenges are being meticulously confronted through rigorous exploration and the application of innovative problem-solving methodologies. This pioneering study introduces groundbreaking methodologies by seamlessly integrating two state-of-the-art optimization algorithms— the Red Fox Optimization and the Golden Eagle Optimizer— with the Decision Tree model. This fusion is aimed at enhancing the accuracy of heating load predictions and streamlining HVAC system optimization processes, marking a significant leap toward achieving heightened energy efficiency and operational efficacy in building management practices. The study emphasizes the significance of precise heating load prediction in advancing energy efficiency, realizing cost savings, and fostering environmental sustainability in building management. Furthermore, it delves into the multifaceted impact of various building features on heating load, encompassing variables such as glazing area, orientation, height, relative compactness, roof area, surface area, and wall area. These insights furnish actionable intelligence for refined decision-making processes in both building design and operation. Based on the results, the DT single model experienced the weakest performance among the three models, with R 2 = 0.975 and RMSE = 1.608. The model DTFO (DT + FOX) achieves an extraordinary R 2 value of 0.996 and RMSE value of 0.961 for heating load prediction, surpassing the performance benchmarks set by other models. This achievement holds considerable promise for aiding engineers in crafting energy-efficient buildings, particularly within the swiftly evolving landscape of smart home technologies.},

A dataset of 157 images (100 for training, 57 for testing) was used, and the models were evaluated based on Dice similarity coefficient and Jaccard index. FCN slightly outperformed U-Net in accuracy (94.88% vs. 94.21%), while U-Net had a slight advantage in validation (93.55% vs. 92.99%).

  abstract     = {To address the existing shortcomings in the research on the coupling of safety risk factors in subway tunnel construction using the shallow-buried excavation method, this paper conducts a coupled analysis and dynamic simulation of the safety risks associated with this construction method. Firstly, by analyzing the mechanisms and effects of risk coupling in shallow-buried excavation construction of subway tunnels, this study divides the risk system into four risk subsystems (human, material, management, and environment), establishes an evaluation index system for the coupling of safety risks, calculates the comprehensive weight values of the risk indicators using the AHP-entropy weight method, and constructs a risk coupling degree model by combining the inverse cloud model and efficacy function. Subsequently, based on the principles of system dynamics, a causal relationship diagram and a system dynamics simulation model for the coupling of “human-material” risks in construction are established using Vensim PLE software. Finally, the case study of the underground excavation section of Chengdu Metro Line 2 is employed to perform dynamic simulation using the established model. By adjusting the relevant risk coupling coefficients and simulation duration, the impact of the coupling of various risk factors on the safety risk level of the human-material coupling system is observed. The simulation results demonstrate that: 1) Heterogeneous coupling of human and material risks has a particularly significant effect on the system’s safety risks; 2) Violations by personnel and initial support structure defects are key risk coupling factors. The findings of this study provide new insights for decision-makers to assess the safety risk of shallow-buried excavation construction in subway tunnel.},

  abstract     = {Node classification in graph learning faces significant challenges due to imbalanced data, particularly for under-represented samples from minority classes. To address this issue, existing methods often rely on synthetic minority over-sampling techniques, introducing additional complexity during model training. In light of the challenges faced, we introduce GraphECC, an innovative approach that addresses numerical anomalies in large-scale datasets by supplanting the traditional CE loss function with an Enhanced Complementary Classifier (ECC) loss function’a novel modification to the CCE loss. This alteration ensures computational stability and mitigates potential numerical anomalies by incorporating a slight offset in the denominator during the computation of the complementary probability distribution. In this paper, we present a novel training paradigm, the Enhanced Complementary Classifier (ECC), which offers “imbalance defense for free” without the need for extra procedures to improve node classification accuracy.The ECC approach optimizes model probabilities for the ground-truth class, akin to the cross-entropy method. Additionally, it effectively neutralizes probabilities associated with incorrect classes through a “guided” term, achieving a balanced trade-off between the two aspects. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method not only enhances model robustness but also surpasses the widely used cross-entropy training objective.Moreover, we demonstrate the versatility of our method by seamlessly integrating it with various well-known adversarial training techniques, resulting in significant gains in robustness. Notably, our approach represents a breakthrough, as it enhances model robustness without compromising performance, distinguishing it from previous attempts.The code for GraphECC can be accessed from the following link: https://github.com/12chen20/GraphECC .},

Modern people have a higher pursuit for the spiritual food such as garden landscape after the material life is satisfied, which brings new challenges to the construction of urban garden landscape. As an advanced type of machine learning, deep learning applied to landscape image recognition can solve the problem of low quality and low efficiency of manual recognition. Based on this, this paper proposes a garden landscape image recognition algorithm based on SSD (Single Shot Multibox Detector), which realizes accurate extraction and recognition of image features by positioning the target, and can effectively improve the quality and efficiency of landscape image recognition. In order to test the feasibility of the algorithm proposed in this paper, experimental analysis was carried out in the CVPR 2023 landscape data set. The experimental results show that the algorithm has a high recognition accuracy for landscape images, and has excellent performance compared with traditional image recognition algorithms.},

Second, the skip convolution layer of ResNet serves as the foundation for developing a new residual module named QuickCut3-ResNet. A dual evaluation model is then developed to achieve the combined evaluation of the convolutional and complete connection process. Ultimately, the best network parameters of the Space Invariant Artificial Neural Network are determined after simulation experiments are used to examine the impact of various network parameters on the network performance.

  abstract     = {Due to its remarkable performance, the convolutional neural network (CNN) has gained widespread usage in image inpainting challenges. However, most of these CNN-based methods reconstruct images only in the spatial domain, which produces satisfactory outcomes for small-region inpainting tasks, but blurs the details and generates incomplete structures for large-region inpainting tasks with complex backgrounds. In this paper, we address the issue of large-region inpainting tasks by our novel Adaptive Fourier Neural Network . Specifically, in our network, a Fourier-based global receptive field module is introduced to incorporate frequency information and expand the receptive field by transforming local convolutions into global convolutions, enabling the proposed network to transmit global information to the missing region. Furthermore, to better fuse spatial and frequency features, an attention-based joint space-frequency module is proposed to combine spatial and frequency information. Finally, to validate the effectiveness and robustness of our proposed method, we conduct qualitative and quantitative experiments on two popular datasets Paris StreetView and Places. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods by generating sharper, more coherent, and visually plausible inpainting results.

  abstract     = {Current mainstream deep learning optimization algorithms can be classified into two categories: non-adaptive optimization algorithms, such as Stochastic Gradient Descent with Momentum (SGDM), and adaptive optimization algorithms, like Adaptive Moment Estimation with Weight Decay (AdamW). Adaptive optimization algorithms for many deep neural network models typically enable faster initial training, whereas non-adaptive optimization algorithms often yield better final convergence. Our proposed Adaptive Learning Rate Burst (Adaburst) algorithm seeks to combine the strengths of both categories. The update mechanism of Adaburst incorporates elements from AdamW and SGDM, ensuring a seamless transition between the two. Adaburst modifies the learning rate of the SGDM algorithm based on a cosine learning rate schedule, particularly when the algorithm encounters an update bottleneck, which is called learning rate burst. This approach helps the model to escape current local optima more effectively. The results of the Adaburst experiment underscore its enhanced performance in image classification and generation tasks when compared with alternative approaches, characterized by expedited convergence and elevated accuracy. Notably, on the MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100 datasets, Adaburst attained accuracies that matched or exceeded those achieved by SGDM. Furthermore, in training diffusion models on the DeepFashion dataset, Adaburst achieved convergence in fewer epochs than a meticulously calibrated AdamW optimizer while avoiding abrupt blurring or other training instabilities. Adaburst augmented the final training set accuracy on the MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100 datasets by 0.02%, 0.41%, and 4.18%, respectively. In addition, the generative model trained on the DeepFashion dataset demonstrated a 4.62-point improvement in the Frechet Inception Distance (FID) score, a metric for assessing generative model quality. Consequently, this evidence suggests that Adaburst introduces an innovative optimization algorithm that simultaneously updates AdamW and SGDM and incorporates a learning rate burst mechanism. This mechanism significantly enhances deep neural networks’ training speed and convergence accuracy.},

The influence of the number of pre-cracks on the Acoustic emission precursor characteristics of red sandstone creep is analyzed. The results show that near the destabilization of the specimen, the Acoustic emission accumulative ringing count surges in a stepwise manner, the Acoustic emission b -value decreases, the D 2 -value increases, the Acoustic emission amplitude shows high intensity and high frequency, and the ringing count increases sharply, all with the characteristics of failure precursors.

The whale optimization algorithm, with its advantages such as minimal parameter control, has garnered attention. In this study, a hybrid whale optimization algorithm (HWOA) is designed to settle the distributed no-wait flow-shop scheduling problem with batch delivery (DNWFSP-BD). Two objectives are considered concurrently, namely, the minimization of the makespan and total energy consumption. In the proposed algorithm, four vectors are proposed to represent a solution, encompassing job scheduling, factory assignment, batch delivery and speed levels. Subsequently, to generate high-quality candidate solutions, a heuristic leveraging the Largest Processing Time (LPT) rule and the NEH heuristic is introduced. Moreover, a novel path-relinking strategy is proposed for a more meticulous search of the optimal solution neighborhood. Furthermore, an insert-reversed block operator and variable neighborhood descent (VND) are introduced to prevent candidate solutions from converging to local optima. Finally, through comprehensive comparisons with efficient algorithms, the superior performance of the HWOA algorithm in solving the DNWFSP-BD is conclusively demonstrated.},

  abstract     = {With the rapid proliferation of substantial textual data from sources such as social media, online comments, and news articles, sentiment analysis has become increasingly crucial. However, existing deep learning methods have overlooked the significance of part-of-speech (POS) and emotional words in understanding the emotion of text. Based on this, this paper proposes a sentiment analysis approach that combines multiple features with a dual-channel network. Firstly, the vector representation of the text is obtained through Robustly Optimized BERT Pretraining Approach (RoBERTa). Secondly, the POS features and word emotional features are separately updated using self-attention to calculate weights. Concatenating words, POS and emotion, feature dimension reduction and fusion are achieved through a linear layer. Finally, the fused feature vector is input into a dual-channel network composed of Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (BiGRU) and Deep Pyramid Convolutional Neural Network (DPCNN). Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves higher classification accuracy than the comparative methods on three sentiment analysis datasets. Moreover, the experimental results fully validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

  abstract     = {The Hilbert spectrum images of intrinsic mode functions (IMF) of empirical mode decomposition (EMD) analysis and variational mode decomposition (VMD) analysis of faulty machine vibration signals are used in deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) for machine fault classification in which the DCNN automatically learns the features from spectral images using convolution layer. Though both EMD and VMD analysis suit well for non-stationary signal analysis, VMD has the merit of aliasing free IMFs. In this paper, the performance improvement of DCNN classification for a non-stationary vibration signal dataset using VMD is brought out. The numerical experiment uses the Hilbert spectrum images of 4 EMD-IMFs and 4 VMD-IMFs in DCNN to classify 10 different faults of the Case Western Reserve University (CWRU) bearing dataset. The confusion matrices are obtained and the plot of model accuracies in terms of epochs for the DCNN is analysed. It is shown that the spectrum images of one of the four EMD-IMFs, IMF 0 , give a validation accuracy of 100% and in the case of VMD the spectrum images of two of the four VMD-IMFs, IMF 0 , and IMF 1 give a validation accuracy of 100%. This reveals that non-aliasing IMFs of VMD are better at classifying bearing faults. Further to bring out the merits of VMD analysis for non-stationary signals the numerical experiment is conducted using VMD analysis for binary fault classification of the milling dataset which is more non-stationary than the bearing dataset which is proved by plotting the statistical parameters of both datasets against time. It is found that the DCNN classification is 100% accurate for IMF 3 of VMD analysis which is much better than the 81% accuracy provided by EMD analysis as per existing literature. The performance comparison highlights the merits of VMD analysis over EMD analysis and other state-of-the-art methods and ensemble learning methods.},

Determining the Young modulus during CPB mix design is crucial. Utilizing machine learning (ML) tools for Young modulus evaluation and prediction streamlines the CPB mix design process. This study employed six ML models, including three shallow models Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB), Gradient Boosting (GB), Random Forest (RF) and three hybrids Extreme Gradient Boosting-Particle Swarm Optimization (XGB-PSO), Gradient Boosting-Particle Swarm Optimization (GB-PSO), Random Forest-Particle Swarm Optimization (RF-PSO).

Shapley Additive Explanation (SHAP) values and Partial Dependence Plots (PDP) provided insights into component influences. Cement/Tailings ratio emerged as the most crucial factor for enhancing Young modulus in CPB.

However, existing methods still face problems such as difficulties in obtaining key feature words for charges, which impose limitations on the improvement of prediction results. To this end, we propose a legal judgment prediction model with legal feature Word subgraph Label-Embedding and Dual-knowledge Distillation(WLEDD). Compared with traditional methods, our method has two contributions: (1) To mitigate the impact of overly sparse tail class data and high similarity text representations, we capture the critical features related to the charges by fusing LDA and legal feature word subgraphs. Then we encode them as label information to obtain highly distinguished representations of legal documents. (2) To solve the problem of high difficulty in some subtasks in LJP, we perform subtask-oriented compression of models to construct a student model with lower complexity and higher accuracy through dual knowledge distillation. Moreover, we exploit the logical association between the subtasks to constrain the labels of articles by charge prediction results. It greatly reduces the difficulty of article prediction. Experimental results on four datasets show that our approach significantly outperforms the baseline models. Compared with the state-of-art method, the F1 value of WLEDD for charge prediction has increased by an average of 2.57% . For article prediction, the F1 value has increased by an average of 1.09% . In addition, we demonstrate its effectiveness through ablation experiments and analytical experiments.},

  abstract     = {Cattle detection and counting is one of the most important topics in the development of modern agriculture and animal husbandry. The traditional manual monitoring methods are inefficient and constrained by factors such as site. To solve the above problems, a SCS-YOLOv5 cattle detection and counting model for complex breeding scenarios is proposed. The original SPPF module is replaced in the YOLOv5 backbone network with a CSP structured SPPFCSPC. A CA (Coordinate Attention) mechanism is added to the neck network, as well as the SC (Standard Convolution) of the Neck network is replaced with a light convolution GSConv and Slim Neck is introduced, and training strategies such as multi-scale training are also employed. The experimental results show that the proposed method enhances the feature extraction ability and feature fusion ability, balances the localization accuracy and detection speed, and improves the use effect in real farming scenarios. The Precision of the improved network model is improved from 93.2% to 95.5%, mAP@0.5 is improved from 94.5% to 95.2%, the RMSE is reduced by about 0.03, and the FPS reaches 88. Compared with other mainstream algorithms, the comprehensive performance of SCS-YOLOv5 s is in a leading position, with fewer missed and false detections, and the strong robustness and generalization ability of this model are proved on multi-category public datasets. Applying the improvement ideas in this paper to YOLOv8 s also yields an increase in accuracy. The improved method in this study can greatly improve the accuracy of cattle detection and counting in complex environments, and has good real-time performance, so as to provide technical support for large-scale cattle breeding.},

  abstract     = {Distraction and fatigue are serious issues in online learning, and they directly impact educational outcomes. To achieve excellent academic achievement, students need to focus on their studies without being distracted or fatigued. Learners frequently overlook crucial information, directions, and concepts while they are passive and sleepy. They tend to miss important content, instructions, and concepts. Iris Angle Position (IAP) and electroencephalography (EEG) were used in this model to identify the behaviour of learners. Specifically, a Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) is constructed to extract IAP in order to accurately capture the learner’s facial area. EEG signals are effectively handled and sorted using deep reinforcement learning (DRL). The learners’ facial landmarks are retrieved from a frame using the dlib toolbox. Only eye landmark points from face landmarks alone are focused on in order to determine the learner’s behaviour. When the learners EEG signals and Iris positions are monitored simultaneously, it’s helpful to identify the learner’s fatigue state (LFS) and the learner’s distraction state (LDS). The Brain Vision Algorithm (BVA) uses iris position and minimal facial landmarks, along with brain activity, to properly identify the learner’s level of distraction and exhaustion. When a student is detected as being preoccupied or sleepy, an alert goes off automatically, and the educator gets performance feedback. Iris position data and brain-computer interface-based EEG signal values are utilised to identify distraction and sleepiness. Comparative tests have demonstrated that this innovative method offers fast and high-accuracy student activity detection in virtual learning settings. Applying the suggested approach to different existing classifiers yields an F-Score of 91.92%, a recall of 93.87%, and a precision of 92.37% . The results showed that the detection rates for both distracted and sleepy phases were higher than those attained with other currently used techniques.},

However, it is difficult to obtain sufficient and comprehensive fault data in industrial applications, and changes in vibration signals caused by machine operating conditions can also hinder the accuracy of the model. The problem of limited data and frequent changes in operating conditions can seriously affect the effectiveness of deep learning methods. To tackle these challenges, a novel transformer model named the Differential Window Transformer (Dwin Transformer), which employs a new differential window self-attention mechanism, is presented in this paper. Meanwhile, the model introduces a hierarchical structure and a new patch merging to further improve performance. Furthermore, a new fault diagnosis model dealing with limited training data is proposed, which combines the Auxiliary Classifier Generative Adversarial Network with the Dwin Transformer(DT-ACGAN). The DT-ACGAN model can generate high-quality fake samples to facilitate training with limited data, significantly improving diagnostic capabilities. The proposed model can achieve excellent results under the dual challenges of limited data and variable working conditions by combining Dwin Transformer with GAN. The DT-ACGAN owns superior diagnostic accuracy and generalization performance under limited sample data and varying working environments when compared with other existing models. A comparative test about cross-domain ability is conducted on the Case Western Reserve University dataset and Jiang Nan University dataset. The results show that the proposed method achieves an average accuracy of 11.3% and 3.76% higher than other existing methods with limited data respectively.},

Our algorithm starts from an empty matching and iteratively constructs a maximum stable matching of students to projects. At each iteration, our algorithm finds an unassigned student and assigns her/his most preferred project to her/him to form a student-project pair in the matching. If the project or the lecturer who offered the project is over-subscribed, our algorithm uses two heuristic functions, one for the over-subscribed project and the other for the over-subscribed lecturer, to remove a student-project pair in the matching. To reach a stable matching of a maximum size, our two heuristics are designed such that the removed student has the most opportunities to be assigned to some project in the next iterations. Experimental results show that our algorithm is efficient in execution time and solution quality for solving the problem.},

  abstract     = {With the development of information technology, the number and methods of cyber attacks continue to increase, making network security issues increasingly important. Intrusion detection has become a vital means of dealing with cyber threats. Current intrusion detection methods predominantly rely on machine learning. However, machine learning suffers from limitations in detection capability and the requirement for extensive feature engineering. Additionally, current intrusion detection datasets face the challenge of data imbalance. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel solution leveraging Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to balance the dataset and introduces an attention mechanism into the generator to efficiently extract key feature information, the mechanism can effectively sort the key information of the data and quickly capture important features. Subsequently, a combination of 1D Convolutional Neural Networks (1DCNN) and Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Units (BiGRU) is employed to construct a classification model capable of extracting both spatial and temporal features. Furthermore, Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is utilized to optimize the input weights and hidden biases of the model, so as to further improve the accuracy and robustness of the model. Finally, the model is trained and implemented for network intrusion detection. To demonstrate the applicability of the model, experiments were conducted using the NSL-KDD dataset and the UNSW-NB15 dataset. The final results showed that the proposed model outperformed other models, achieving accuracies of 99.15% and 97.33% on the respective datasets. This indicates that the model improves the efficiency of network intrusion detection and better ensures the effectiveness of network security.},

  abstract     = {Accurate prediction of short-term electricity price is the key to obtain economic benefit and also an important index of power system planning and management. Support vector regression (SVR) based ensemble works have gained remarkable achievements in terms of high accuracy and steady performance, but they are highly dependent on data representativeness and have a high computational complexity O ( k * N 3 ) of data samples and parameter selection. To further improve the data representativeness and reduce its computational complexity, this paper develops a new approach to forecast electricity price via optimal weighted ensemble. In the model, the cluster-based subsampling algorithm is proposed to categorize the inputs being seasonally decomposed into several groups, and representative data are drawn from each group in a certain proportion to ensure that each subset trained with SVR has the same representativeness and features. Moreover, the optimal weighted combination method is presented to assign weights to the sub-SVRs to obtain the optimal support vector regression ensemble model (OWSSVRE). The experimental results show that the improved support vector regression ensemble model with the same features and representativeness of the subset has better performance in electricity price forecasting. As a result, it is suitable to support decision making in the energy and other sectors.},

  abstract     = {A nation’s progress is directly linked to the effective functioning of its agricultural sector. The detection and classification of plant disease is an essential component of the agricultural industry. Plant diseases may result in substantial financial losses due to decreased crop production. As per the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, it is estimated that plant diseases result in a reduction of approximately 10-16% in global crop yields annually. Farmers are traditionally relying on visual inspection, using naked eye observation, as the primary method for detecting plant diseases. This involves a meticulous examination of crops to identify any visible signs of diseases. However, manual disease detection can lead to delayed identification, resulting in significant crop losses. Various methods, coupled with machine learning classifiers, were demonstrated effectiveness in scenarios involving manual feature extraction and limited datasets. However, to handle larger datasets, deep learning models such as Inception V4, ResNet-152, EfficientNet-B5, and DenseNet-201 were studied and implemented. Among these models, DenseNet-201 exhibited superior performance and accuracy compared to the previous methodology. Additionally, A Fine-tuning Deep Learning Model called SympDense was developed, which surpassed other deep learning models in terms of accuracy.},

  abstract     = {Accurate load forecasting is an important issue for safe and economic operation of power system. However, load data often has strong non-stationarity, nonlinearity and randomness, which increases the difficulty of load forecasting. To improve the prediction accuracy, a hybrid short-term load forecasting method using load feature extraction based on complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise (CEEMDAN) and refined composite multi-scale entropy (RCMSE) and improved bidirectional long short time memory (BiLSTM) error correction is proposed. Firstly, CEEMDAN is used to separate the detailed information and trend information of the original load series, RCMSE is used to reconstruct the feature information, and Spearman is used to screen the features. Secondly, an improved butterfly optimization algorithm (IBOA) is proposed to optimize BiLSTM, and the reconstructed components are predicted respectively. Finally, an error correction model is constructed to mine the hidden information contained in error sequence. The experimental results show that the MAE, MAPE and RMSE of the proposed method are 645 kW, 0.96% and 827.3 kW respectively, and MAPE is improved by about 10% compared with other hybrid models. Therefore, the proposed method can overcome the problem of inaccurate prediction caused by data and inherent defects of models and improve the prediction accuracy.},

With the continuous development of natural language semantic processing technology, it has become essential to augment the user-friendliness of multifaceted control and query operations in the agricultural measurement and control sector, ultimately leading to reduced operation costs for users. The study aims to focus on command parsing. The proposed AMR-OPO semantic parsing framework is based on the natural language understanding method of Abstract Meaning Representation of Rooted Markup Graphs (AMR). It transforms the user’s natural language inputs into structured ternary (OPO) statements (operation-place-object) and converts the corresponding parameters of the user’s input commands. The framework subsequently sends the transformed commands to the relevant devices via the IoT gateway. To tackle the intricate task of parsing instructions, we developed a BERT-BiLSTM-ATT-CRF-OPO entity recognition model. This model can detect and extract entities from agricultural instructions, and precisely populate them into OPO statements. Our model shows exceptional accuracy in instruction parsing, with precision, recall, and F-value all measuring at 92.13%, 93.12%, and 92.76%, correspondingly. The findings from our experiment reveal outstanding and precise performance of our approach. It is anticipated that our algorithm will enhance the user experience offered by agricultural measurement and control systems, while also making them more user-friendly.},

  abstract     = {The rapid advancements in satellite imaging technology have brought about an unprecedented influx of high-resolution satellite imagery. One of the critical tasks in this domain is the automated detection of buildings within satellite imagery. Building detection holds substantial significance for urban planning, disaster management, environmental monitoring, and various other applications. The challenges in this field are manifold, including variations in building sizes, shapes, orientations, and surrounding environments. Furthermore, satellite imagery often contains occlusions, shadows, and other artifacts that can hinder accurate building detection. The proposed method introduces a novel approach to improve the boundary detection of detected buildings in high-resolution remote sensed images having shadows and irregular shapes. It aims to enhance the accuracy of building detection and classification. The proposed algorithm is compared with Customized Faster R-CNNs and Single-Shot Multibox Detectors to show the significance of the results. We have used different datasets for training and evaluating the algorithm. Experimental results show that SESLM for Building Detection in Satellite Imagery can detect 98.5% of false positives at a rate of 8.4%. In summary, SESLM showcases high accuracy and improved robustness in detecting buildings, particularly in the presence of shadows.},

  abstract     = {To address the issue of final delivery route planning in the community group purchase model, this study takes into full consideration logistics vehicles of different energy types. With the goal of minimizing the sum of vehicle operating costs, delivery timeliness costs, goods loss costs, and carbon emissions costs, a multi-objective optimization model for community group purchase final delivery route planning is constructed. An improved genetic algorithm with a hill-climbing algorithm is utilized to enhance adaptive genetic operators, preventing the algorithm from getting stuck in local optima and improving the solution efficiency. Finally, a case study simulation is conducted to validate the feasibility of the model and algorithm. Experimental results indicate that currently, among the three types of vehicles, fuel logistics vehicles still have an advantage in terms of vehicle usage cost. Electric logistics vehicles exhibit the poorest performance with the highest cost per hundred kilometers, but their sole advantage lies in their high energy release efficiency, enabling optimal low-carbon vehicle performance. Battery-swapping logistics vehicles perform the best in terms of carbon emissions, combining the advantages of both fuel-based and electric logistics vehicles. Therefore, battery-swapping logistics vehicles are a favorable choice for replacing fuel-based logistics vehicles in the future, offering promising prospects for future development.},

Researchers classify plagiarism into copy-paste and text-rewriting plagiarism, but existing models need help with problems such as the single way of checking and unsatisfactory results. Aiming at the copy-paste problem in English writing plagiarism, this paper proposes a digital fingerprint model based on the N-Gram window jumping mechanism. The model incorporates a sliding window and an improved matching tool to solve the problems of excessive fingerprint density and low checking efficiency in text extraction. Meanwhile, the model adds a Fisher-Yates shuffle algorithm with a salt parameter to crack the hash collision in text matching. The experiments show that the model can detect copy-paste plagiarism in English composition. For text rewriting plagiarism, this paper designs a TextCNN-BiGRU-based model, which combines TextCNN and BiGRU so that the extracted text semantic information considers the text’s local and contextual features. The experiments show that the model improves the accuracy by 1.9 percentage points and the F1 value by 1.2 percentage points on the MRPC dataset compared with other models.},

The proposed GBIFM method employs GBDT for data processing, which can flexibly handle various types of data without the need for one-hot encoding of discrete features. An Input-aware strategy is introduced to refine the weight vector and embedding vector of each feature for different instances, adaptively learning the impact of each input vector on feature representation. Furthermore, a fully connected network is incorporated to capture high-order features in a non-linear manner, enhancing the method’s ability to express and generalize complex structured data. A comprehensive experiment is conducted on the Criteo and Avazu datasets, the results show that compared to typical methods such as DeepFM, AFM, and IFM, the proposed method GBIFM can increase the AUC value by 10% –12% and decrease the Logloss value by 6% –20%, effectively improving the accuracy of click-through rate prediction.},

In this article, modified AlexNet deep leaning model is proposed to category the source retinal images into either healthy or Glaucoma through the detection and segmentations of optic disc (OD) and optic cup (OC) regions in retinal pictures. The retinal images are preprocessed and OD region is detected and segmented using circulatory filter. Further, OC regions are detected and segmented using K-means classification algorithm. Then, the segmented OD and OC region are classified and trained by the suggested AlexNet deep leaning model. This model classifies the source retinal image into either healthy or Glaucoma. Finally, performance measures have been estimated in relation to ground truth pictures in regards to accuracy, specificity and sensitivity. These performance measures are contrasted with the other previous Glaucoma detection techniques on publicly accessible retinal image datasets HRF and RIGA. The suggested technique as described in this work achieves 91.6% GDR for mild case and also achieves 100% GDR for severe case on HRF dataset. The suggested method as described in this work achieves 97.7% GDR for mild case and also achieves 100% GDR for severe case on RIGA dataset.},

  abstract     = {Semi-supervised learning (SSL) aims to reduce reliance on labeled data. Achieving high performance often requires more complex algorithms, therefore, generic SSL algorithms are less effective when it comes to image classification tasks. In this study, we propose ComMatch, a simpler and more effective algorithm that combines negative learning, dynamic thresholding, and predictive stability discriminations into the consistency regularization approach. The introduction of negative learning is to help facilitate training by selecting negative pseudo-labels during stages when the network has low confidence. And ComMatch filters positive and negative pseudo-labels more accurately as training progresses by dynamic thresholds. Since high confidence does not always mean high accuracy due to network calibration issues, we also introduce network predictive stability, which filters out samples by comparing the standard deviation of the network output with a set threshold, thus largely reducing the influence of noise in the training process. ComMatch significantly outperforms existing algorithms over several datasets, especially when there is less labeled data available. For example, ComMatch achieves 1.82% and 3.6% error rate reduction over FlexMatch and FixMatch on CIFAR-10 with 40 labels respectively. And with 4000 labeled samples, ComMatch achieves 0.54% and 2.65% lower error rates than FixMatch and MixMatch, respectively.},

Therefore, if vulnerability is exploited directly affects the IoT device and the applications. In this paper we investigated and assessed the various real-world critical IoT attacks/vulnerabilities that have affected IoT deployed in the commercial, industrial and consumer sectors since 2010. Subsequently, we evoke the vulnerabilities or type of attack, exploitation techniques, compromised security factors, intensity of vulnerability and impacts of the expounded real-world attacks/vulnerabilities. We first categorise how each attack affects information security parameters, and then we provide a taxonomy based on the security factors that are affected. Next, we perform a risk assessment of the security parameters that are encountered, using two well-known multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) techniques namely Fuzzy-Analytic Hierarchy Process (F-AHP) and Fuzzy-Analytic Network Process (F-ANP) to determine the severity of severely impacted information security measures.},

However, due to the significant variation observed in EEG signals from different individuals, the field of EEG-based speech recognition faces challenges related to individual differences across subjects, which ultimately impact recognition performance. In this investigation, a novel approach is proposed for EEG-based speech recognition that combines the capabilities of Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) and Graph Attention Network (GAT). The LSTM component of the model is designed to process sequential patterns within the data, enabling it to capture temporal dependencies and extract pertinent features. On the other hand, the GAT component exploits the interconnections among data points, which may represent channels, nodes, or features, in the form of a graph. This innovative model not only delves deeper into the connection between connectivity features and thinking as well as speaking states, but also addresses the challenge of individual disparities across subjects. The experimental results showcase the effectiveness of the proposed approach. When considering the thinking state, the average accuracy for single subjects and cross-subject are 65.7% and 67.3% respectively. Similarly, for the speaking state, the average accuracies were 65.4% for single subjects and 67.4% for cross-subject conditions, all based on the KaraOne dataset. These outcomes highlight the model’s positive impact on the task of cross-subject EEG speech recognition. The motivations for conducting cross subject are real world applicability, Generalization, Adaptation and personalization and performance evaluation.},

  abstract     = {Precise video moment retrieval is crucial for enabling users to locate specific moments within a large video corpus. This paper presents Interactive Moment Localization with Multimodal Fusion (IMF-MF), a novel interactive moment localization with multimodal fusion model that leverages the power of self-attention to achieve state-of-the-art performance. IMF-MF effectively integrates query context and multimodal features, including visual and audio information, to accurately localize moments of interest. The model operates in two distinct phases: feature fusion and joint representation learning. The first phase dynamically calculates fusion weights for adapting the combination of multimodal video content, ensuring that the most relevant features are prioritized. The second phase employs bi-directional attention to tightly couple video and query features into a unified joint representation for moment localization. This joint representation captures long-range dependencies and complex patterns, enabling the model to effectively distinguish between relevant and irrelevant video segments. The effectiveness of IMF-MF is demonstrated through comprehensive evaluations on three benchmark datasets: TVR for closed-world TV episodes and Charades for open-world user-generated videos, DiDeMo dataset, Open-world, diverse video moment retrieval dataset. The empirical results indicate that the proposed approach surpasses existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of retrieval accuracy, as evaluated by metrics like Recall (R1, R5, R10, and R100) and Intersection-of-Union (IoU). The results consistently demonstrate IMF-MF’s superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art methods, highlighting the benefits of its innovative interactive moment localization approach and the use of self-attention for feature representation and attention modeling.},

  abstract     = {In the expansive domain of data-driven research, the curse of dimensionality poses challenges such as increased computational complexity, noise sensitivity, and the risk of overfitting models. Dimensionality reduction is vital to handle high-dimensional datasets effectively. The pilot study disease dataset (PSD) with 53 features contains patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) and Osteoarthritis (OA). Our work aims to reduce the dimension of the features in the PSD dataset, identify a suitable feature selection technique for the reduced-dimensional dataset, analyze an appropriate Machine Learning (ML) model, select significant features to predict the RA and OA disease and reveal significant features that predict the arthritis disease. The proposed study, Progressive Feature Reduction with Varied Missing Data (PFRVMD), was employed to reduce the dimension of features by using PCA loading scores in the random value imputed PSD dataset. Subsequently, notable feature selection methods, such as backward feature selection, the Boruta algorithm, the extra tree classifier, and forward feature selection, were implemented on the reduced-dimensional feature set. The significant features/biomarkers are obtained from the best feature selection technique. ML models such as the K-Nearest Neighbour Classifier (KNNC), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Logistic Regression (LR), Naïve Bayes Classifier (NBC), Random Forest Classifier (RFC) and Support Vector Classifier (SVC) are used to determine the best feature selection method. The results indicated that the Extra Tree Classifier (ETC) is the promising feature selection method for the PSD dataset because the significant features obtained from ETC depicted the highest accuracy on SVC.},

  abstract     = {Although many scholars say that their algorithms are better than others in the state estimation problem, only a fewer convincing algorithms were applied to engineering practices. The reason is that their algorithms outperform others only in some aspects such as the estimation accuracy or the computation load. To solve the problem of performance evaluation of state estimation algorithms, in this paper, the comprehensive evaluation measures (CEM) for evaluating the nonlinear estimation algorithm (NEA) is proposed, which can comprehensively reflect the performance of the NEAs. First, we introduce three types of the NEAs. Second, the CEM combining the flatness, estimation accuracy and computation time of the NEAs, is designed to evaluate the above NEAs. Finally, the superiority of the CEM is verified by a numerical example, which helps decision makers of nonlinear estimation algorithms theoretically and technically.},

However, mainstream ESG rating methods ignore the distinction between companies with incomplete information disclosure and companies without information disclosure, which decreases the initiative and enthusiasm of companies to disclose information. In this study, a self-disclosure ESG (SDESG) rating method is proposed to evaluate companies’ ESG performance capabilities. First, based on the fuzzy set, fuzzy data is defined and applied to the SDESG rating method. Second, analogous to the academic reward system of a university, a reward mechanism of disclosure is used in the SDESG rating method. Finally, the effectiveness and reliability of the SDESG rating method are demonstrated through Refinitiv’s case. The results show that the SDESG rating method can distinguish companies with incomplete information disclosure from companies without information disclosure and allow companies that proactively disclose information to obtain better ESG scores under each industry. The implications of the study would increase companies’ enthusiasm to disclose information and maintain transparency within a company.},

The objective of this paper is to develop a robust license plate authentication framework, based on the Vehicle Make and Model Recognition (VMMR) and the License Plate Recognition (LPR) algorithms that is implementable at the edge devices. The contributions of this paper are (i) Development of license plate database for 547 Indian cars, (ii) Development of an image dataset with 3173 images of 547 Indian cars in 8 classes, (iii) Development of an ensemble model to recognize vehicle make and model from frontal, rear, and side images, and (iv) Development of a framework to authenticate the license plates with frontal, rear, and side images. The proposed ensemble model is compared with the state-of-the-art networks from the literature. Among the implemented networks for VMMR, the Ensembling model with a size of 303.2 MB achieves the best accuracy of 89%. Due to the limited memory size, Easy OCR is chosen to recognize license plate. The total size of the authentication framework is 308 MB. The performance of the proposed framework is compared with the literature. According to the results, the proposed framework enhances FLP recognition due to the recognition of vehicles from side images.

  abstract     = {Accurate SARS-CoV-2 screening is made possible by automated Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD) which reduces the stress on healthcare systems. Since Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is highly contagious, the transition chain can be broken through an early diagnosis by clinical knowledge and Artificial Intelligence (AI). Manual findings are time and labor-intensive. Even if Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) delivers quick findings, Chest X-ray (CXR) imaging is still a more trustworthy tool for disease classification and assessment. Several studies have been conducted using Deep Learning (DL) algorithms for COVID-19 detection. One of the biggest challenges in modernizing healthcare is extracting useful data from high-dimensional, heterogeneous, and complex biological data. Intending to introduce an automated COVID-19 diagnosis model, this paper develops a proficient optimization model that enhances the classification performance with better accuracy. The input images are initially pre-processed with an image filtering approach for noise removal and data augmentation to extend the dataset. Secondly, the images are segmented via U-Net and are given to classification using the Fused U-Net Convolutional Neural Network (FUCNN) model. Here, the performance of U-Net is enhanced through the modified Moth Flame Optimization (MFO) algorithm named Chaotic System-based MFO (CSMFO) by optimizing the weights of U-Net. The significance of the implemented model is confirmed over a comparative evaluation with the state-of-the-art models. Specifically, the proposed CSMFO-FUCNN attained 98.45% of accuracy, 98.63% of sensitivity, 98.98% of specificity, and 98.98% of precision.},

By taking Gaussian linear fuzzy information granules as inputs and outputs, GF-Prophet predicts with significantly smaller cumulative error. Second, noticing that trend extraction affects prediction accuracy seriously, a novel granulation modification algorithm is proposed to merge adjacent information granules that do not have significant differences. This is the first attempt to establish Prophet based on fuzzy information granules to predict trend characteristics. Experiments on public datasets show that the introduction of Gaussian linear fuzzy information granules significantly improves prediction performance of traditional Prophet model. Compared with other classical models, GF-Prophet has not only higher prediction accuracy, but also better interpretability, which can clearly give the change information, fluctuation amplitude and duration of a certain trend in the future that investors actually pay attention to.},

Some of the factors are weather, wind speed, road conditions, and construction work. On highways, the low speed of vehicles can cause traffic congestion or delays. Machine learning can play a vital role in the detection of traffic congestion and hence in avoiding delays. When accurate parameters and correct structure are fed to the machine learning model, traffic congestion can be predicted accurately. This paper designs a technique to predict traffic congestion states with the help of the Extra Tree Classifier machine learning model. The proposed Extremely Randomized Machine Learning (ERML) system model predicts 94% accuracy for congestion state classification.

Any malicious attack found during sensing is identified using our proposed algorithm (DETMAL-Detection of malicious users algorithm). This paper proposes a noval algorithm ’DETMAL algorithm’, which is designed in such a way that it can handle both reliant strike and self reliant strike made by the attackers. Detected attackers who are sending falsified reports are removed from the honest local decisions to make an authorised global decision. Legitimate secondary users who are the participants of the smart contract are rewarded with incentives of ethers.

Additionally, the common problem of class imbalance in intrusion detection datasets exacerbates these challenges. This paper introduces a novel approach to network intrusion detection classification, termed SGAN-RL, which integrates ResNet and LSTM models based on the semi-supervised generative adversarial network (SGAN) framework. This method utilizes SGAN to generate synthetic data resembling real intrusion detection data and continually trains the discriminator to produce high-quality data, thereby enhancing data distribution balance and quality. Moreover, a fusion intrusion detection classification model is presented, leveraging the strengths of ResNet and LSTM architectures to capture spatial and temporal features, respectively. This synergistic fusion enhances the model’s capacity for comprehensive data representation, resulting in improved performance in intrusion detection data classification tasks. Experiments conducted on intrusion detection datasets NSL-KDD, UNSW-NB15, and CIC-IDS2017 demonstrate that the proposed model enhances accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC, PR-AUC, respectively, showcasing its robust performance and reliability in network intrusion detection classification.},

In these computations, sparsity (a small number of non-zero elements in a matrix) and symmetry (certain patterns in the structure of the matrix) are often exploited to optimize efficiency.

The HARDCL Network employs an innovative hybrid attention mechanism within a residual learning framework, effectively distinguishing between benign and melanoma skin lesions with a high degree of precision. The encoder-decoder network segments the lesion from dermoscopic images, followed by feature extraction and classification, achieving a maximum accuracy of 97.11%, precision of 98.10%, recall of 98.81%, and an F1-score of 98.45%. This performance surpasses conventional deep learning algorithms such as AlexNet, InceptionV3, and ResNet18, demonstrating the effectiveness of the attention-based features in identifying critical lesion characteristics.

  abstract     = {With the rapid development of the society, decision-making methods with single attribute are becoming increasingly difficult to satisfy the needs of practical problems. And in real life, it is usually only possible to obtain the range of attribute values because of the measurement error or the complexity and uncertainty of objective things, that is, the interval number values of decision information are easily obtainable. Interval number multi-attribute decision-making problems have gradually become a research hotspot for scholars. However, most current studies have not discussed the distribution on interval numbers, resulting in partial loss of decision information. Therefore, this paper considers the case of normal distribution interval numbers (NDINs) and proposes a multi-attribute decision-making method based on symmetric relative entropy with completely unknown attribute weights. Firstly, based on the idea of maximal deviation, a model for determining attribute weights is established by the symmetric relative entropy of NDINs. Secondly, the possibility degree formula for comparison between two NDINs is used to determine the positive ideal solution (PIS) and negative ideal solution (NIS) under each attribute. Thirdly, the total closeness degree between each scheme and the ideal point is calculated using the TOPSIS method and symmetric relative entropy. Then, the ranking of schemes is obtained based on the total closeness degree. Finally, a numerical example is offered to prove the feasibility and validity of the proposed method.},

This method employs fuzzy logic for nonlinear pixel mapping and adaptively identifies the bounds of Interval Type-2 Fuzzy Sets through fuzzy convolution operations. By incorporating multivariate Type-1 membership functions into conventional convolutional kernels, we have engineered fuzzy convolutional kernels. These kernels, along with fuzzy rule libraries, activate features derived from fuzzy convolutions, facilitating the iterative refinement of the model’s fuzzy sets. This hierarchical process culminates in the development of the IT2FCNN model. When applied to the Wuhan dense labeling dataset (WHDLD), our proposed method outperformed the latest Interval Type-2 Fuzzy Neural Network by 5.27% in accuracy across nine land cover categories. Furthermore, it demonstrated a 17.52% increase in accuracy on the UC Merced Land Use Dataset (UCM Dataset), particularly in dense residential areas, and an 18.3% improvement in sparse residential areas across eleven land cover categories. These results highlight the approach’s effectiveness in mitigating the impact of regional noise on land cover classification, showcasing its strong generalization capability and superior classification accuracy.},

  abstract     = {To address the issues of inaccurate expert weight allocation in existing large-group decision-making methods and information loss in multi-attribute group emergency decision-making processes, we propose a clustering-based method using the probabilistic hesitant fuzzy set. Recognizing the diverse contributions of the decision makers within each cluster-to-cluster consistency and the varied impacts of preferences in different clusters on overall group preference, we introduce a two-layer weight model. Specifically, from a two-dimensional viewpoint, we determine the weights of decision members within each cluster using an expert evaluation distance formula and the weights of each cluster using fuzzy entropy. Subsequently, by incorporating the Maclaurin symmetric mean operator (MSMO), we establish the ranking of decision alternatives. Finally, we assess the effectiveness and applicability of the proposed method by applying it to analyze the case of the Tonga volcanic eruption.},

  abstract     = {The short text matching models can be roughly divided into representation-based and interaction-based approaches. However, current representation-based text matching models often lack the ability to handle sentence pairs and typically only perform feature interactions at the network’s top layer, which can lead to a loss of semantic focus. The interactive text matching model has significant shortcomings in extracting differential information between sentences and may ignore global information. To address these issues, this article proposes a model structure that combines a dual-tower architecture with an interactive component, which compensates for their respective weaknesses in extracting sentence semantic information. Simultaneously, a method for integrating semantic information is proposed, enabling the model to capture both the interactive information between sentence pairs and the differential information between sentences, thereby addressing the issues with the aforementioned approaches. In the process of network training, a combination of cross-entropy and cosine similarity is used to calculate the model loss. The model is optimized to a stable state. Experiments on the commonly used datasets of QQP and MRPC validate the effectiveness of the proposed model, and its performance is stably improved.},

  abstract     = {The evolving landscape of decision-making, especially in complex scenarios, poses a challenge in accurately capturing decision-makers’ cognitive information. This challenge becomes even more intricate in group decision-making situations due to the diverse cognitive perspectives of the participants. In response to these complexities, this study delves into the realm of dual probabilistic linguistic 2-tuple sets, an extension of dual-hesitant fuzzy sets known for their effectiveness in handling perplexing data. Dual probabilistic linguistic 2-tuple sets introduces a nuanced approach, considering multiple linguistic memberships, non-membership degrees, and their associated probabilistic and deviation information. We have devised diverse mechanisms aimed at augmenting the comprehension and utilization of dual probabilistic linguistic 2-tuple sets. These mechanisms encompass transformation functions, scoring methodologies and accuracy metrics. In this study, we introduce two aggregation operators for dual probabilistic linguistic 2-tuple sets based on prioritized averaging and Maclaurin symmetric mean principles. These operators serve as the cornerstone for a pioneering hybrid approach meticulously crafted for multiple criteria decision making within the framework of dual probabilistic linguistic 2-tuple sets. To demonstrate the practicality and efficacy of our approach, we present a real-world case study. The subsequent analytical comparison and discussion underscore the effectiveness of our methodology. The outcomes of this study not only showcase the excellent performance of our proposed method but also offer valuable practical implications for decision-makers navigating complex and diverse decision environments. Our work stands as a significant stride toward enhancing decision-making processes amid contemporary challenges.},

The security of IoT is a significant concern for ensuring secure communications that must be appropriately protected to address key distribution challenges and ensure high security during data transmission. Therefore, in the critical context of IoT environments, secure data aggregation can provide access privileges for accessing network services. "Most data aggregation schemes achieve high computational efficiency; however, the cryptography mechanism faces challenges in finding a solution for the expected security desecration, especially with the advent of quantum computers utilizing public-key cryptosystems despite these limitations. In this paper, the Secure Data Aggregation using Quantum Key Management scheme, named SDA-QKM, employs public-key encryption to enhance the security level of data aggregation. The proposed system introduces traceability and stability checks for the keys to detect adversaries during the data aggregation process, providing efficient security and reducing authentication costs. Here the performance has been evaluated by comparing it with existing competing schemes in terms of data aggregation. The results demonstrate that SDA-QKM offers a robust security analysis against various threats, protecting privacy, authentication, and computation efficiency at a lower computational cost and communication overhead than existing systems.},

  abstract     = {Image classification using polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (Pol-SAR) is becoming more important in image processing for remote sensing applications. However, in the existing techniques, during the feature extraction process, there exist some limitations including laborious endeavour for Pol-SAR image classification, identifying intrinsic features for target recognition is difficult in feature selection, and pixel-level Pol-SAR image classification is difficult for obtaining more precise and coherent interpretation consequences. Hence to overcome these issues, a novel Multifarious Stratification Stratagem in machine learning is proposed to achieve pixel-level Pol-SAR classification. In this proposed model, a novel Scrumptious Integrant Wrenching method is used for efficient feature extraction. It is compatible with the orientation-sensitive of the Pol-SAR image which increases the variety of intra-layer features. To remove the difficulty in feature selection, a novel Episodicical Proximity Selection method is proposed in which a Split-level parallel feature selection strategy is used to select the best qualities from the extracted features. To tackle the difficulty in classification, an Elastic Net Classifier (ENC) is used that find the coefficient vector for the linear combination of the training sets. This efficiently classified the best features in the Pol-SAR images and improved the proposed system’s accuracy. As a result, the performance measures of the proposed system demonstrate that the accuracy is increased by 99.69%, precision is increased by 98.99%, recall is increased by 98.99%, sensitivity is increased by 98.99%, and F1-score is increased by 98.99% as a response.},

  abstract     = {Due to the relatively high cost of labeling data, only a fraction of the available data is typically labeled in machine learning. Some existing research handled attribute selection for partially labeled data by using the importance of an attribute subset or uncertainty measure (UM). Nevertheless, it overlooked the missing rate of labels or the choice of the UM with optimal performance. This study uses discernibility relation and the missing rate of labels to UM for partially labeled data and applies it to attribute selection. To begin with, a decision information system for partially labeled data (pl-DIS) can be used to induce two equivalent decision information systems (DISs): a DIS is constructed for labeled data (l-DIS), and separately, another DIS is constructed for unlabeled data (ul-DIS). Subsequently, a discernibility relation and the percentage of missing labels are introduced. Afterwards, four importance of attribute subset are identified by taking into account the discernibility relation and the missing rate of labels. The sum of their importance, which is determined by the label missing rates of two DISs, is calculated by weighting each of them and adding them together. These four importance may be seen as four UMs. In addition, numerical simulations and statistical analyses are carried out to showcase the effectiveness of four UMs. In the end, as its application for UM, the UM with optimal performance is used to attribute selection for partially labeled data and the corresponding algorithm is proposed. The experimental outcomes demonstrate the excellence of the proposed algorithm.},

The proposed model is developed using project-based profitability data collected from 134 REIP professionals and comprises 61 factors categorized into 13 groups. The model was validated through case studies via the deployment of the model in two real estate projects. The first case study highlighted F2.5 financial management, F5.2 market research, and F7.2 exchange rate as the most critical factors, while the second case study emphasized F1.3 cost of reworks, F5.3 sales and marketing strategy, and F13.3 cost management as the most critical factors for the overall profitability performance. This study provides two significant contributions. Firstly, it presents a factor list and a model that professionals can utilize to effectively estimate and assess the profitability of REIPs.

  abstract     = {Demand prediction for shared bicycles based on historical trip data helps bicycle management organizations plan the scheduling of bicycles. However, the current prediction methods have the following problems: (1) the bicycle trip station data hides the temporal and spatial information, which is crucial for demand prediction, and the traditional methods cannot effectively use that information. (2) each bicycle organization manages its region, and local region data cannot accurately predict the demand of the whole region. Due to the privacy trip data, organizations cannot share raw data directly, which makes it a challenge to achieve federated multi-participant analyses. To address these issues, we propose a federated learning framework for demand prediction of shared bicycles (FedCGAT). Firstly, we propose a spatio-temporal graph neural network based on an attention mechanism for feature modeling of data. Meanwhile, we propose a graph data augmentation method to eliminate noisy data and capture spatial correlations. Then, we construct an auxiliary task based on contrastive learning to assist model training, which can learn the data features fully. Finally, we conducted experiments on two real-world bicycle datasets. The experiments demonstrate that FedCCAT achieves high prediction accuracy while preserving data privacy. Compared to the best-performing baseline model on both datasets, our model achieves reductions in MAPE values of 1.67% and 1.94%, respectively.},

A project of the TBM diversion tunnel is taken as the research object to ensure the normal operation of the diversion tunnel. Based on measured data and considering multiple safety aspects such as structural response, durability, and external factors of the diversion tunnel, a TBM diversion tunnel structural health evaluation index system is established. A new method for the TBM diversion tunnel structural health comprehensive evaluation based on Analytic Hierarchy Process-Matter Element Extension-Variable Weight Theory (AMV) is proposed to explore the impact of AMV fluctuation with the measured results of the indicators on the weight, closeness, and health grade of each evaluation index. The high sensitivity and high-risk evaluation indicators for the structural health of the diversion tunnels are identified. It is found that the variable weight varies with the changes in various indicator values, which can accurately evaluate the health status of tunnels in real-time. The characteristic values of the tunnel grade calculated by the AHP and the AMV are 1.589 and 1.695, respectively. The results of the corresponding interval diversion tunnel are the basic safety state of grade B. Except for the two evaluation indicators of concrete strength and slurry properties, the variable weight values and grade characteristic values of other evaluation indicators increase with the increase of indicator values. The four indicators of segment settlement, segment opening, segment misalignment, and segment cracks are more sensitive to the health of the TBM diversion tunnel. This AMV can accurately evaluate the health status of the diversion tunnel structure. The research results can provide references for later maintenance work and similar projects.},

Then, by taking the flexible job-shop scheduling problem (FJSP) as an example and considering decoding times, study how the parameters of HSLSs affect their performance, where the performance is evaluated by the difference rate based on the decoding times. The simulation results mainly show that (I) as the harmony memory size (HMS) gradually increases, the performance of HSLSs first increases rapidly and then tends to remain unchanged, and HMS is not the larger the better; (II) as harmony memory considering rate increases, the performance continues to improve, while the performance of pitch adjusting rate on HSLSs goes to the opposite; Finally, more benchmark instances are also used to verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.

  abstract     = {Rough set and fuzzy set theory are two distinct but related mathematical techniques, and both theories deal with uncertain and incomplete information in data analysis. Approximation operators and accuracy measures are the key points of rough set theory. Various generalizations on rough approximations have been proposed by many authors to reduce the boundary region and increase the accuracy percentage. One of these generalizations is the neighborhood system. The concept of the neighborhood system is a mathematical tool for handling inconsistent and limited knowledge. It can be applied to find the approximations to resolve the vagueness of data collection. This paper aims to examine j -neighborhoods in the context of a binary fuzzy relation and to introduce the concept of j -fuzzy neighborhoods. j -fuzzy approximations are proposed and studied using these neighborhoods. Further, an example related to heart disease is discussed to demonstrate the significance of the proposed work and the result is compared with existing ones. A medical application is described using j -fuzzy neighborhoods to categorise patients based on their COVID-19 infection.},

  abstract     = {Chaos maps and chaotic systems have made significant strides in the field of cryptography over recent decades. This is primarily because both cryptographic algorithms and chaotic maps share a wide range of common characteristics that render them effective and valuable for communication, stability, and security purposes. Consequently, image encryption based on chaos systems is regarded as one of the most effective methods for safeguarding digital images from attackers. In light of this, a new encryption scheme is proposed to protect digital images, utilizing a fusion of piecewise linear and coupled logistic-chaotic maps to enhance sensitivity to encryption. To further bolster the security of the encryption algorithm, the proposed system preprocesses high-quality pseudo-random sequences into integers ranging from 0 to 255. The cipher structure is designed based on permutation-diffusion processes, where permutation is controlled by four pixels, while diffusion is controlled by rows and columns. An extensive analysis of experimental results, including various types of security analyses, has been conducted. The security analyses have demonstrated that the proposed approach exhibits excellent performance, with high scores for NPCR = 99.61%, UACI = 33.48%, entropy of the cipher image (7.9999 ≅ 8), and correlation coefficient (–0.0009 ≅ 0). In addition to the security and performance analyses, the findings indicate that the proposed algorithm is efficient, secure, fast, and resistant to attacks. Moreover, the algorithm is versatile and can be applied to encrypt images of any size.},

  abstract     = {A dynamic path planning algorithm, named TOACA-DWA, is proposed by fusing the TOACA (two-layer optimal ant colony algorithm) and DWA (improved dynamic window approach). Firstly, in the TOACA algorithm, the pseudo-random state transfer rules are used for path selection, and the state transfer function is optimized to enhance search efficiency and global search capability. Secondly, a reward-punishment mechanism is proposed to update the pheromone, and we also limit the maximum and minimum bounds of pheromone concentration. These two measures can accelerate the algorithm’s convergence speed and prevent the algorithm from falling into the local optimum. By introducing a dynamic penalty factor, we reduce the pheromone concentration on the deadlock position. Finally, the algorithm introduces a crucial node screening strategy to delete the redundant nodes on the global path and use the improved DWA for local path planning between every two adjacent critical nodes of the global path. Simulation in dynamic environment is conducted to verify the real-time obstacle avoidance ability of the proposed algorithm. Furthermore, the real environment experiments further demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in practical applications.},

However, traditional methods are prone to data leakage and threaten patient privacy. To ensure data security and realize sharing and access control, combining blockchain technology, attribute-based encryption and ciphertext policy (CP-ABE) and AES symmetric encryption algorithm, this paper proposes a hierarchical attribute-based encryption algorithm based on master-sidechain (MSC-CP-ABE) and a collaborative access control and sharing model with on-chain and off-chain (AC-CSS). The algorithm encrypts hierarchically based on data sensitivity, the ciphertext is stored in the interplanetary file system (IPFS), and the encrypted address and key are stored in the side chain, which is convenient for indexing in the main chain. The vectorized access policy implements policy hiding, combines on-chain and off-chain, saves blockchain space, achieves hierarchical access control, and improves security and efficiency. Simulation experiments show that the main sidechain model proposed in this paper has better performance in terms of transaction delay and throughput. Compared with existing models, the algorithm proposed in this paper has certain advantages in data encryption and decryption time and key generation time.},

  abstract     = {The paper aims to present a hybrid model for measuring the performance of business processes in complex organizations based on the subjective decision-making of expert teams. The subject of the research is finding ways to measure, analyze and improve the key performance indicators (KPIs) process. Obtaining the values of KPIs, which reflect the real state of the process, creates a basis for their ranking, i.e. insight into KPIs that are extremely important for the process as well as KPIs that are of lesser importance, but as such are not excluded from consideration because they are necessary for the beginning, realization and completion of the process. The model was compiled through five phases and was tested through a case study in a real business organization, which deals with the maintenance of complex combat systems. The obtained results helped the management to take certain measures in order to improve the performance of the maintenance process. In the model, it is proposed to form two expert teams, which make assessments based on experience and express them in linguistic terms according to a predefined scale. Modeling of linguistic expressions is realized using intuitive fuzzy sets of a higher order, more precisely Fermatean fuzzy sets (FFS). Selecting KPIs, decomposing the process into sub-processes and assessing the relative importance of sub-processes is carried out by one team of experts, while another team carries out the assessment of KPIs at the level of each sub-process. Determining the relative importance of sub-processes is realized using the Delphi method extended to FFS while reaching a consensus. The measurement of process performance, i.e. the value of KPIs, is realized using Multi-Criteria Group Decision-Making (MCGDM), such as the ELECTRE method extended with FFS. The sensitivity analysis of the developed model is realized by uncertainty modeling with q-rung orthopair fuzzy sets.},

The method’s key innovation lies in its use of interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy numbers to represent an agent’s stance, addressing the psychological dimensions and risk tendencies of decision-makers that have been largely overlooked in previous studies. The IVIFTWCA method categorizes conflict situations into affirmative, impartial, and adverse coalitions, leveraging the evaluation of the closeness function and predefined thresholds. It incorporates a reference point, value functions and cumulative weight functions to assess risk preferences, leading to the formulation of precise decision rules and thresholds. The method’s efficacy and applicability are demonstrated through detailed examples and comparative analysis, and its exceptional performance is confirmed through a series of experiments, offering a robust framework for real-world decision-making in conflict situations.},

  abstract     = {A problem with the neutrosophic sets, as other fuzzy set extensions, is that they require decimal numbers for truthiness, falsity, and indecision degrees of an element from experts, which cannot be easily assigned. This will be more difficult when three or more digits’ membership degrees are required to assign. Instead, proportion-based relations between the elements of a neutrosophic set can make easier to determine the truthiness, falsity, and indecision degrees. We introduce proportional neutrosophic sets in this study, together with associated aggregation operators and arithmetic operations. The proportional judgments between truthiness, falsity, and indeterminacy are enough for proportional neutrosophic sets. With these data more accurately reflecting the opinions of experts, proportional neutrosophic sets facilitate the use of neutrosophic sets. The provided models also incorporate the ambiguous concept of proportionality. According to the application and comparative analyses, proportional neutrosophic sets yield reliable results and are readily applicable to any kind of issue. Multi-criteria decision methodology using proportional neutrosophic sets based analytic hierarchy process and TOPSIS methods has been developed and used in a personnel selection problem. Additionally, we compare the proposed methodology with its classical version. Proportional neutrosophic sets are very successful in determining the degrees and ease neutrosophic multi-criteria decision making process.},

However, existing multi-view clustering algorithms have shortcomings in view information extraction, weight parameter selection, and noisy data processing. To overcome these drawbacks, we proposed a robust multi-view fuzzy clustering algorithm based on self-weighting that can handle noisy image segmentation. The algorithm first introduces the consistent fuzzy division matrix and balance coefficient into the general model to actively learn common and individual information among different views; secondly, it adopts a self-weighting strategy to judge the importance degree of each view for clustering; and finally, we construct fuzzy factors for each view based on the local space information and map the improved multi-view algorithm to the kernel space, thereby enhancing its robustness. In addition, we use an alternating optimization method to solve the optimization model and Zangwill’s theorem to prove the convergence of our algorithm. The algorithm has optimal evaluation metrics in the segmentation tasks of synthetic, natural, and remote sensing images, where the ACC values are all greater than 0.91 and the PSNR values are all greater than 20, giving superior segmentation capability and interference resistance compared to several comparative algorithms.},

However, current GCN-based approaches for collaborative filtering recommendation have limitations in effectively embedding neighboring nodes during node and neighbor information aggregation. Furthermore, weight allocation for the user (or item) representations after convolution of each layer is too uniform. To resolve these limitations, we propose a new Graph Convolutional Collaborative Filtering recommendation method based on temporal information during the node aggregation process (TA-GCCF). The method aggregates and propagates information using Gated Recurrent Units, while dynamically updating features based on the timing and sequence of interactions between nodes and their neighbors. Concurrently, we have developed a convolution attention coefficient to ascertain the significance of embedding at distinct layers. Experiments on three benchmark datasets show that our method significantly outperforms the comparison methods in the accuracy of prediction.},

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are excellent at automatic feature extraction, whereas Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) produce realistic images. Transfer learning uses pre-trained models, whereas semantic segmentation identifies pixels in images. Super-resolution, style transfer, and attention mechanisms can increase the quality of images and understanding. Adversarial defenses address purposeful manipulations, while 3D image processing handles three-dimensional data. These advancements make use of improved computational power and massive datasets to revolutionize image processing capabilities. Traditional image processing algorithms frequently fail to handle the complex and multidimensional structure of color images, particularly when dealing with uncertainty and imprecision. In this study, the 3D-EIFIM frame work is extented and scaled aggregation operations 3D-EIFIM tailored for image data are proposed. By representing each pixel as an entry of 3D-EIFIM and applying aggregation techniques to enable more effective image analysis, manipulation, and enhancement.

However, most patterns derived from subjective expertise without quantitative analysis. In this article, combining bullish/bearish patterns with ensemble learning, we present an intelligent system for making stock trading decisions. The Ensemble Classifier through Multimodal Perturbation (ECMP) is designed to generate a diverse set of precise base classifiers to further determine the candlestick patterns. It achieves this by: first, introducing perturbations to the sample space through bootstrap sampling; second, employing an attribute reduction algorithm based on neighborhood rough set theory to select relevant features; third, perturbing the feature space through random subspace selection. Ultimately, the trading decisions are guided by the classification outcomes of this procedure. To evaluate the proposed model, we apply it to empirical investigations within the context of the Chinese stock market. The results obtained from our experiments clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach.},

  abstract     = {Recently, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) using aggregating neighborhood collaborative information have shown effectiveness in recommendation. However, GNNs-based models suffer from over-smoothing and data sparsity problems. Due to its self-supervised nature, contrastive learning has gained considerable attention in the field of recommendation, aiming at alleviating highly sparse data. Graph contrastive learning models are widely used to learn the consistency of representations by constructing different graph augmentation views. Most current graph augmentation with random perturbation destroy the original graph structure information, which mislead embeddings learning. In this paper, an effective graph contrastive learning paradigm CollaGCL is proposed, which constructs graph augmentation by using singular value decomposition to preserve crucial structure information. CollaGCL enables perturbed views to effectively capture global collaborative information, mitigating the negative impact of graph structural perturbations. To optimize the contrastive learning task, the extracted meta-knowledge was propagate throughout the original graph to learn reliable embedding representations. The self-information learning between views enhances the semantic information of nodes, thus alleviating the problem of over-smoothing. Experimental results on three real-world datasets demonstrate the significant improvement of CollaGCL over state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract     = {Folk dance is an important intangible cultural heritage in China. In the environment where movement recognition technology is widely used, there is still no research field on the protection and inheritance of folk dance culture. In order to better protect and inherit the minority dance, screening the typical movements of 5 types of minority dance, through the dance video frame processing, obtain the key movements of 19 class dance sequence, build the national dance typical action data set, put forward a 3D CNN fusion Transformer national dance recognition network model (FCTNet), the recognition rate of 96.7% in the experiment. The results show that the construction method of the folk dance data set is reasonable, the identification model has good performance for the classification of folk dance, and can effectively identify and record the folk dance movements, which also makes new contributions to the digital protection of folk dance.},

  abstract     = {Electronic commerce (EC) has become the most critical business activity in the world. China has become the world’s largest market for EC. Over the past three decades, numerous researches have examined the current status of the development of monolingual EC research in specific scenarios. However, the paradigm shift in EC development through the analysis of the dynamic evolution of semantic information has not yet been examined, and the distinctions and connections between multilingual EC studies have not yet been established. This study analyzed 16,207 English and 17,850 Chinese EC-related articles from the Web of Science database and CNKI by combining the BERTopic topic model and SBERT sentence embedding-based similarity computations. The results reveal the distributions of global and local topics in the English and Chinese EC literature, analyze the semantic intricacies of topic convergence and evolution across continuous time, as well as the distinctions and connections between English and Chinese topics. Finally, the evolutionary patterns and life cycle of three crucial English and Chinese topics are explored respectively, including their emergence, development, maturity, and decline. Overall, this study provides a comprehensive overview of EC studies from a topic perspective.},
