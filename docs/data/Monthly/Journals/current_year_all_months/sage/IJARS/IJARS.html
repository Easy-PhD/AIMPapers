  abstract     = {To address the trajectory tracking problem of unmanned surface vessels (USVs) when all dynamics parameters are unknown. This study designs a trajectory tracking controller for USVs based on Lyapunov theory and composite adaptive control technology. And based on dual feedback signals from tracking error and forecast error, an adaptive update law for dynamics parameters is designed using the Bounded Gain Forgetting Least Squares method. The adaptive update law enables the online identification of all dynamics parameters of USVs. Next, a concise nonlinear disturbance observer is designed based on error feedback signals to compensate for unknown time-varying environmental disturbances. A control law incorporating dynamics parameters adaptive update law and disturbance estimation is developed using composite adaptive control techniques. Subsequently, the convergence of trajectory tracking errors and dynamics parameters estimation errors is proven based on Lyapunov theory. Finally, numerical simulation experiments are conducted. The results of simulation experiments demonstrate that the proposed controller achieves precise trajectory tracking for the USV even when all dynamics parameters are completely unknown. Additionally, the controller exhibits robust disturbance rejection capabilities.},

A MATLAB/Simulink model was developed for simulation and compared with a traditional PD controller. The results show that the proposed controller outperforms the PD controller, maintaining position errors under 10% and impedance errors under 30% of those seen with the PD controller under external force input.

  abstract     = {Infrared object detection plays a key role in tasks such as autonomous robot navigation, industrial inspection, and search and rescue. However, the small gray-scale difference between the object and the background region in the infrared grayscale image and the single gray-scale information lead to the blurring of the semantic information of the image, which makes the robot unable to detect the object effectively. To address the above problems, this paper proposes a robot visual infrared object detection (MFDTIA-Detection) based on multiple focus diffusion and task interaction alignment. The feature extraction module adopts a dual-stream fusion structure in the backbone network, which combines the local feature extraction of CNN with the global feature modeling of transformer. The task-aligned dynamic detection header enhances inter-task interaction by sharing convolutional and task-aligned structures, exploiting task interaction features to optimize detection accuracy while reducing the number of parameters to accommodate resource-constrained devices. Experimental results on public datasets show that the model in this paper improves precision by 1.3%, recall by 1%, mAP50 by 0.6%, and mAP50-95 by 1.4%.},

Starting from the Optimization-based Collision Avoidance framework, a new warm start method is introduced, in which the Fast Likelihood-based Collision Avoidance algorithm is modified to find a coarse trajectory which maximizes the likelihood to reach the goal. The constrained optimal control problem is reformulated to improve the smoothness and efficiency. To speed up the smoothing process, an iterative bounding box adjustment method is adopted to satisfy collision avoidance constraints. The proposed Smooth Likelihood-based Collision Avoidance (SLBCA) algorithm is robust and enables real-time optimization-based trajectory planning.

This article proposes intelligent MWMR path planning based on the real-time rapidly exploring random tree* (RT-RRT*) and optimal interval type 2 fuzzy logic controller (IT2FLC). First, the path planning of the MWMRs in dynamic environments is developed by RT-RRT*. Second, the optimal IT2FLC is designed for MWMRs based on the genetic algorithm. The pre-treatment and post-treatment coefficients of IT2FLC are optimized with the goal of achieving the best trajectory quality of the robot. This helps the robot to operate independently and accurately, and complete tasks in environments with many complex disturbances. Various trajectories are given to test the performance of the proposed approach. The results show that the efficiency of the designed method is better than that of a type 1 fuzzy logic controller (traditional fuzzy logic controller) and proportional–integral–derivative under the same conditions.},

This study evaluates the robustness of existing offline reinforcement learning methods using legged robots from OpenAI Gym based on average episodic rewards. For robustness evaluation, we simulate failures by incorporating both random and adversarial perturbations, representing worst-case scenarios, into the joint torque signals. Our experiments show that existing offline reinforcement learning methods exhibit significant vulnerabilities to these action perturbations and are more vulnerable than online reinforcement learning methods, highlighting the need for more robust approaches in this field.},

Rapid victim detection enhances response efficiency and enables timely rescue actions. Integrating advanced detection with mobile robots minimizes human risk, with snake robots offering a promising solution due to their flexible, modular design for navigating complex and confined environments. This article focuses on developing a snake-like robot (His Hands version-1/HH-I) for search and rescue missions. This article concentrates on two aspects of the robot: one is the design and development of the mechanism for traversal in a cluttered environment, and the other is establishing a fast communication system for sending victim detection information (based on a previously developed victim detection model) to rescue victims. The highlight of the work is the robust design made using CAD. The model was then developed and tested in real time, and most of the components in the prototype were built based on 3D printing and other in-house fabrications. The tracks on all four sides ensure self-recovery after rollovers, with a maximum slope climbing capacity of 40°. Experimental tests demonstrated a top speed of 6.8 cm/s on flat terrain and successful traversal on rubble, sand, and gravel surfaces. Victim detection is achieved using a transfer learning-based ResNet-50 model with 97.2% accuracy in an average detection time of 11.5 s. Then, the victim detection information is sent to the rescue teams’ mobile app with IoT using the IBM cloud and node-red.},

This article proposes a novel adaptive optimal clearance compensation tracking control method for dynamic manipulator systems with joint clearance. The method simultaneously computes feedforward and feedback control actions through an enhanced system approach based on Adaptive Dynamic Programming (ADP) and a performance index function. To implement the optimal control strategy, a generalized policy learning algorithm is developed, which reduces the dependency on known system dynamics. Additionally, the algorithm enables continuous, synchronous updates of adaptive evaluation and control actions, eliminating the need for iterative steps. Unlike traditional approaches, this method discards the use of behavioral neural networks (ANNs), thereby reducing computational complexity. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed learning algorithm and control method for manipulator clearance compensation. The effectiveness of the clearance compensation method was further validated through experiments conducted on the robotic arm test platform. By implementing clearance compensation-based optimization control, the Integral Absolute Error (IAE) of manipulator link1 and link2 displacement was reduced by 54.2% and 40.8%, respectively, compared to the uncompensated clearance state.},

To address this issue, this paper proposes an anti-windup control method for tiltable-rotors fully-actuated hexarotor unmanned aerial vehicles. This method applies anti-windup principles to control allocation and controllers, obtaining the optimal actuator solution within saturation constraints.

With this novel approach, a soft manipulator comprising three constant curvature segments can be accurately fitted to a designated multi-curvature backbone. Notably, the method eliminates the need to select a backbone curve with identical curvature to that of the manipulator, enabling the use of a specific backbone to solve the inverse kinematics for soft manipulators with diverse configurations. Consequently, the solution can be swiftly and accurately computed within the workspace. Furthermore, drawing inspiration from snake locomotion, a “head traction” path-following algorithm is proposed in conjunction with the modified backbone inverse kinematics. This algorithm facilitates the manipulator's maneuvering along with a predefined path in complex environments, avoiding collisions with obstacles.

  abstract     = {Due to edge feature defects of markers, the visual measurements for the servo control of planar manipulators often exhibit systematically distributed errors even after conventional distortion correction and camera calibration. Then, the measurement errors of visual servo system have strongly limited the absolute positioning accuracy for the feedback control of the planar manipulators. In this paper, a monocular visual measurement error prediction and feedback control method is proposed for a planar manipulator. First, the monocular vision captures markers and extracts pixel information regarding the manipulator's endpoint, while the data from the laser tracker is converted into the same coordinate system to compare and compensate the visual measurement errors. Second, the visual measurement errors of the entire workspace are obtained using visual measurement error prediction based on radial basis function neural network spatial interpolation. The measurement accuracy of the visual measurement system was improved by 91.1%. Finally, the visual measurement error prediction-based feedback controls are conducted for the positioning of planar manipulator. The experiments demonstrate that the positioning accuracy of the planar manipulator is significantly improved via the applications of the proposed method. Its positioning accuracy can reach ±0.2 mm.},

  abstract     = {We report on the development of an implementable physics-data hybrid dynamic model for an articulated manipulator to plan and operate in various scenarios. Meanwhile, the physics-based and data-driven based dynamic models are studied in this research to select the best model for planning. The physics-based model is constructed using the Lagrangian method, and the loss terms include inertia loss, viscous loss, and friction loss. As for the data-driven model, three methods are explored, including deep neural network, long short-term memory, and XGBoost. Our modeling results demonstrate that, after comprehensive hyperparameter optimization, the XGBoost architecture outperforms deep neural network and long short-term memory in accurately representing manipulator dynamics. With approximately 500k training data points, the XGBoost model closely matches the performance of the physics-based model, as assessed by the root mean square error between actual and estimated manipulator torque. The hybrid model with physics-based and data-driven terms has the best performance among all models based on the same root mean square error criteria, and it only needs about 24k of training data. In addition, we developed a virtual force sensor of a manipulator using the observed external torque derived from the dynamic model and designed a motion planner through the physics-data hybrid dynamic model. The external torque contributes to forces and torque on the end effector, facilitating interaction with the surroundings, while the internal torque governs manipulator motion dynamics and compensates for internal losses. By estimating external torque via the difference between measured joint torque and internal losses, we implement a sensorless control strategy which demonstrated through a peg-in-hole task. Lastly, a learning-based motion planner based on the hybrid dynamic model assists in planning time-efficient trajectories for the manipulator. This comprehensive approach underscores the efficacy of integrating physics-based and data-driven models for advanced manipulator control and planning in industrial environments.},

One of its critical tasks is the monitoring and processing of abnormal transaction data. However, the openness and complexity of the network environment make the system vulnerable to a variety of attacks, such as internal data tampering and eavesdropping attacks. Consequently, the storage and communication security of abnormal transaction data pose significant challenges within the architecture and communication framework of the smart grid. To address these issues, this paper proposes a security protection scheme for abnormal transaction data in smart grid system. By employing a private blockchain network composed of consensus nodes, the scheme ensures the integrity and availability of abnormal transaction data. Additionally, the proposed authentication protocol facilitates secure communication among smart meters, consensus nodes, and servers within the blockchain-based smart grid system. Security analyses demonstrate that the proposed protocol effectively mitigates security threats while offering lower computational overhead compared to related protocols.},

  abstract     = {In clinical practice, prostate particle implantation surgery is performed by a robot control puncture needle; it is a safe and effective treatment method for prostate cancer. During surgery, the tissue deformation is caused by interaction forces between the needle and soft tissue, which results in the displacement error between the needle tip and the target point in the axial direction, thus affecting the precision of particle implantation and treatment effect. Therefore, an axial compensation precision puncture control method for prostate puncture robot is proposed in this article. Firstly, the position action relationship between the puncture needle and the target point is analyzed in the needle’s entry into the tissue, and the force analysis is carried out by the biomechanical Kelvin model; the interaction model between the puncture needle and the soft tissue is established, so as to obtain the axial compensation precision puncture control model. Then, an improved adaptive particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm based on Levy Flight is proposed to identify parameters of this control model for puncture prostate in this article. Matlab–Adams co-simulation mode is used to simulate and analyze the axial compensation precision puncture control method when the puncture needle enters soft tissue, and thus the optimal parameters of this control model for puncture prostate are obtained. Finally, the experiment of puncture velocity with the axial compensation and comprehensive experiment of axial compensation puncture control method are carried out in combination with the robot. The results of the puncture velocity verification experiment show that when the puncture velocity is 12.3 mm/s, the parameters values (elastic coefficient of 2.165 N/m and damping coefficient of 0.754 Ns/m) obtained by identification are reasonable. In the experimental analysis for parameters identification, bionic soft tissue and pig kidney are used for experimental identification, and the results are basically consistent with the simulation. In the comparison experiment of axial compensation positioning performance, the coincidence degree between the tip of the puncture needle and the designated position reached 80% (higher than 35% of direct puncture). Meanwhile, in the comparison experiment of different puncture depths, the axial puncture deviation is 0.54–0.62 mm when the puncture depth is 50–80 mm, which is significantly smaller than the direct puncture of 1.58–2.15 mm. The experimental results further demonstrate the effectiveness of the axial compensation precision puncture control method proposed in this article and the identification of parameter values, which can better improve the puncture accuracy and ensure the treatment effect of particle implantation for prostate cancer. The contents of this article can provide reference for the research of minimally invasive puncture surgery.},

Traditional robotic control methods, using frameworks like ROS2 (Robot Operating System) combined with tools like SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) and NAV2 (Navigation 2), often require specialized programming knowledge, limiting accessibility for non-expert users. Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs), could offer a promising alternative, enabling robots to be controlled through natural language commands. These LLM-driven systems have the potential to simplify robot interaction by translating high-level language prompts into detailed movement, mapping, and exploration tasks. There is a lack of existing solutions for utilizing natural language commands in certain movement and trajectory tasks, particularly in exploration scenarios. Current approaches are not equipped to effectively translate contextual references (e.g. next to the corner, between doors, towards the nearest unexplored area, etc.) into concrete robot commands. This proposal integrates LLMs with ROS2, SLAM, and NAV2, allowing users to issue natural language commands for detailed navigation, path planning, and mapping tasks including unexplored areas. By reducing the technical barrier to robot control, our system enables more intuitive and flexible human–robot interaction in complex environments, making robotic systems accessible to a broader range of users. In the explored scenarios, the proposed approach successfully transforms most of the users’ textual prompts into a set of robot commands, achieving an F1-score of 0.913 for the successful transformation of entire prompts (composed of multiple sub-prompts) and an F1-score of 0.975 for individual commands.},

  abstract     = {Locking state recognition is one of the key tasks of railway freight monitoring. However, accurate localization and recognition of small locking mechanisms remain major challenges. Current approaches that focus on existing object recognition methods lead to high false detection and miss rates. This paper introduces TrainNet for efficient locking state detection for Open-top wagon doors. A dataset was collected using a robot with a camera to validate our method. We designed an efficient layer aggregation network (ELAN)-S module in our TrainNet, which can be used with YOLOv7. The module efficiently extracts curvilinear features and is integrated into the backbone feature extraction network to enhance the feature representation capability. An LSKCSPC module is also introduced to capture a dynamic receptive field, enabling TrainNet to adjust its receptive field dynamically to the scale of the object, improving its feature representation capacity. Furthermore, the detection head for small-scale objects is redesigned, the feature layer size is increased to enhance the ability to extract and detect fine-grained features. Finally, the loss function is modified to a dynamic fusion-based CNIOU, which reduces the sensitivity of original loss to small objects and improves performance. Experimental results show that the algorithm achieves a mean average precision (mAP50) of 91.5%, which is a 3.6% improvement over the baseline YOLOv7 algorithm. The model weight file size of new algorithm is 60.2MB with 19.5% reduction compared to the baseline. The proposed method achieves 91.5% for detecting the lock status of railway freight open-top wagon side doors, while reducing the complexity of the original algorithm and achieving a real-time detection speed of 39.8fps, meeting the requirements for practical application. The algorithm also exhibits good robustness as demonstrated by experiments on the WiderPerson dataset.},

  abstract     = {Hierarchical federated learning (HFL) is an effective “cloud-edge-device” distributed model training framework that protects data privacy. During HFL training, poisoning attacks on local data and transmitted models can affect the accuracy of the global model. Existing methods for defending against unauthorized attacks primarily rely on single-feature anomaly detection approaches, such as calculating distances or densities between data or model parameters. These methods fail to integrate multiple characteristics and metrics to capture anomalous model updates,thus exhibiting significant limitations in model robustness and accuracy. Therefore, we propose a robust hierarchical federated learning method with a dual-layer filtering mechanism (DF-HFL). This method first uses Kernel density estimation to infer the approximate data distribution of devices, ensuring minimal differences among devices within each cluster. It then calculates the density weight of each cluster and the local weight of each device, comparing the difference between local and global weights. Anomalous weights are filtered through a threshold during aggregation. DF-HFL amplifies the distance between malicious updates and normal updates using the dual-layer filtering mechanism, effectively identifying anomalous weights that do not significantly deviate from the normal weight distribution. This helps in accurately detecting anomalies. Additionally, mean filtering is employed to reduce the impact of anomalous data on the original normal gradients, enhancing system robustness. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, experiments were conducted on MNIST, FMNIST, Heart Disease and Bank Market datasets. Compared to existing methods like FedAvg, Krum, Random, and Multi-Krum, the global model accuracy improved by 5.18%, 38.98%, 29.96%, and 6.44%.},

Firstly, a state observer and a radial basis function (RBF) neural network are combined to form an equivalent extended state observer (ESO). The observed values of state observer are used as the inputs of the RBF neural network to compensate for unknown disturbances affecting the AGV, diminishing the complexity of manual parameter tuning of traditional ESO, and the disturbance estimation error can be demonstrated to converge to zero. Subsequently, a sliding mode controller is proposed based on an improved piecewise variable speed reaching law, which incorporates both the hyperbolic tangent function and a special power function. The higher convergence rate of the reaching law can be guaranteed when the system states are outside the boundary layer and the convergence rate progressively decreases to ensure smooth and effective arrival of the state when the system states are inside the boundary layer. Additionally, the RBF neural network is utilized for estimating and optimizing the controller parameters, aiming to reduce the system chattering and achieve precise path tracking. The asymptotic stability of the system can be proved via the Lyapunov stability theory. Finally, simulation results demonstrate the validity and superiority of the sliding mode controller based on the improved piecewise variable speed reaching law and equivalent ESO proposed in this article.},

  abstract     = {Aerial-ground robotic system is a potential candidate for autonomous applications such as target tracking, inspection, agriculture, and environmental mapping. Tracking motion between UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle) and AGV (autonomous ground vehicle) is one of the basic collaborative tasks of the system during execution of collaborative missions. UAV is spatially omnidirectional, thus, can trivially track AGV to provide navigation guidance from a vantage point. AGV is also required to track UAV for providing continuous support (payload and tethered charging) during a mission. However, ground vehicle tracking aerial vehicle is not given much attention in literature. Moreover, nonholonomic AGVs are not suitable for effective collaboration due to their poor mobility. Consequently, they hinder the overall efficiency of collaborative missions. Thus, in this work, we introduce the combination of 4-WISD (4 wheeled independent steering and driving) vehicle and UAV to address these problems. As 4-WISD ground vehicles are expensive in the market from the research perspective, a 4-WISD vehicle is also developed in the current research. ROS (Robot Operating System)-based control package is developed for the vehicle for general usage. Then, vision-based strategies for ground vehicles (nonholonomic and 4-WISD vehicles) are developed to track aerial vehicle in GPS (Global Positioning System) denied and outdoor conditions. Ground vehicles are localized using monocular camera of UAV and IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) sensors. Kinematic tracking controllers have been developed for ground vehicles using sliding mode control method. Lyapunov stability is proven for the controllers. Experiments have been performed on the hardware to validate the tracking strategies. Tracking controllers show satisfactory performance and are suitable for outdoor and GPS denied conditions. A basic qualitative comparison of tracking performance of both ground vehicles is also presented. Combination of UAV and 4-WISD vehicle becomes partially omnidirectional which leverages the mobility and overall collaboration of the system.},

  abstract     = {We introduce a novel visual-assisted relocalization method for autonomous robots, enhancing both indoor and outdoor navigation. Recognizing the limitations of relying solely on light detection and ranging (LiDAR) sensors for simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), our approach integrates visual sensors to complement existing LiDAR-based systems without necessitating a complete overhaul. The proposed relocalization strategy, which treats both point and object features in image frames as scene descriptions, can be seamlessly integrated with multiple indoor–outdoor LiDAR-based SLAM algorithms. Establishing a link between these features and the robot’s poses transforms them into natural landmarks. Via an efficient feature-matching procedure, initial pose estimates can be obtained and provided to the primary LiDAR-based relocalization scheme to compute final pose estimates. The novelty of our method lies in its flexible add-on design, its compatibility with various LiDAR-based SLAM algorithms, and its ability to significantly boost the robustness and adaptability of robotic navigation. Extensive experiments across diverse environments confirm the performance superiority of the proposed strategy, demonstrating its practical value for real-world applications.},

  abstract     = {This work introduces Deep Policy Similarities (DeePS), a learning-based bisimulation approach designed to enhance generalization in reinforcement learning for robotic control. Traditional reward-based bisimulation metrics often fail to enable effective policy transfer, particularly in environments with inconsistent reward structures. DeePS overcomes these limitations by leveraging policy similarities and approximating the policy similarity metric using a forward dynamics model. This approach facilitates more efficient and effective policy transfer across semantically equivalent environments. Through a series of control experiments, DeePS is shown to significantly outperform standard reinforcement learning methods and reward-based bisimulation approaches. In the noisy cartpole environment with randomized rewards, DeePS achieved 53.5% and 79.0% higher test rewards compared to Soft Actor-Critic and Deep Bisimulation for Control (DBC), respectively. Additionally, in a zero-shot evaluation on the Minigrid simple crossing environment, DeePS outperformed existing approaches, with test rewards 79.9% and 99.5% higher than DBC and RAPID, respectively. These results demonstrate that DeePS significantly enhances the ability of reinforcement learning models to generalize to diverse, unseen environments. This makes DeePS a valuable advancement for reinforcement learning, particularly in robotic applications where adaptability and robustness are critical.},

Finger rehabilitation may be required to restore key functions like range of motion, strength, agility, neurological recovery, and pain relief, especially after events like a stroke. Besides several rehabilitation devices being investigated, there is still a need for a reliable and user-friendly solution. Thus, this paper presents the first steps in the development of an innovative mechanism for rehabilitation of the human finger that allows flexion and extension of individual movements of each phalanx or combined movements for each finger. The proposed device consists of an exoskeleton with an articulated mechanism placed on each finger. The mechanical structure for moving each phalanx consists of a six-bar articulated mechanism with a slider, whose movement is made by a linear actuator. The design process is carefully described, starting from the finger kinesiology, followed by a kinematic modeling of the proposed device, 3D CAD modeling, and the construction of a prototype to index finger, including its control architecture. Both simulations and experimental tests are carried out, showing a suitable behavior of the proposed device in performing both individual and combined flexion/extension exercises of a human finger.},

  abstract     = {In the realm of autonomous highway navigation, a critical initial task is accurately localizing the vehicle on the road. This necessitates the integration of data from various sensors alongside information gleaned from road maps to ensure precision and reliability. This research addresses the critical need for precise localization of autonomous road vehicles, essential for safe and efficient navigation in complex urban environments. Traditional GPS-based systems often face limitations in accuracy, especially in urban canyons and environments with tall buildings. Thus, alternative localization methodologies are essential to ensure reliable autonomous driving. Two novel localization methodologies are explored: an Ultrasonic Indoor Positioning System with a Single Beacon Range-Based Localization Approach. The Ultrasonic Indoor Positioning System involves deploying ultrasonic transmitters on vehicles and receivers at known locations, utilizing time-of-flight calculations for distance estimation. Calibration techniques and outlier rejection enhance system accuracy. Conversely, the single beacon method integrates beacon range measurements with vehicle speed and heading information using an Extended Kalman Filter algorithm for iterative position estimation. Experimental evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of both methodologies. The Ultrasonic Indoor Positioning System achieves position accuracies of 3–4 cm for static targets and 4–7 cm for moving targets, with a minimal error rate. In comparison, the single beacon approach achieves localization within approximately 30 cm of the true position, with a range measurement accuracy of 1–4 cm and a settling time of around 50 s. These results highlight the feasibility and reliability of employing these methodologies for autonomous road vehicle localization. The research underscores the significance of alternative localization techniques in enhancing the autonomy and safety of road vehicles. By leveraging ultrasonic and beacon-based systems, the proposed methodologies offer robust solutions for precise localization, even in challenging urban environments. These findings contribute to the advancement of autonomous driving technologies, paving the way for safer and more efficient transportation systems of the future.},

By elucidating the state transitions of the shape of the paper during dynamic manipulation, we achieved dynamic bending of the paper without creating creases. Two operation patterns were proposed: one using two hands to manipulate the paper from both sides and the other utilizing the inertia of rapidly swinging down the arm with one hand. Additionally, by clarifying the state transitions of the shape that appear during dynamic paper manipulation, we propose a method for bending paper dynamically without creating folds. This task was completed using image processing with high-speed vision to respond to paper deformation during the operation.

Existing research mainly focuses on the optimization of automated guided vehicle (AGV) path planning and scheduling, emphasizing on the minimization of conflicts and deadlocks, multi-objective task scheduling, and metaheuristic algorithm optimization, while ignoring path stability and real-time path planning in dynamic environments. Therefore, this paper aims to address these issues to better handle dynamic changes in actual operating environments. This paper establishes a mathematical model with the optimization objective of minimizing the overall running time of material distribution tasks and proposes an improved ant colony algorithm to optimize the model. First, the concept of prior time is introduced to improve the traditional ant colony algorithm. The path of the ongoing task is introduced with a time calculation, and the occupancy time window of each grid point on the path is calculated. Based on this, the initial pheromone distribution on subsequent paths is altered dynamically, which accelerates the convergence of the ants to a collision-free path. Second, in the pheromone update stage, the method of calculating the pheromone increment in the traditional ant colony algorithm is modified. The original distance influence factor is changed to a time influence factor, which ensures that all tasks still have the minimum running time when calculating a collision-free path. Finally, through 30 sets of simulation experiments on material distribution tasks, it is shown that the proposed algorithm shortens the total running time by 15.14%, 12.87%, and 10.59% compared to two ant colony algorithms and one strategic multi-AGV scheduling algorithm, respectively, thus verifying the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

A transportable platform for hand support powered by two actuators and a nonwearable sensing system comprised the basic, user-friendly design of the proposed exoskeleton robotic device. A specialized assist-as-needed control was installed to make the necessary movements with the robotic device. Transferring the data to the exoskeleton for rehabilitation, the control approach was combined with a computer vision system that imitated the therapist's wrist motions. Utilizing a computer algorithm, hand landmarks were produced to mimic the therapist's wrist movements. A total of 20 participants (Male: 55 % and Female: 45 %) were involved in the experimental procedure. High-accuracy ROM readings were obtained: 87.5 % for flexion, 90.0 % for extension, 92.5 % for ulnar deviation, and 90.0 % for radial deviation. In the conventional method, the healthy persons have a ROM for wrist flexion and extension of 71.6° and 63.0°, respectively, but Carpal Tunnel Syndrome (CTS) patients have a reduced ROM of 49.4° and 38.9°. Healthy participants have ulnar and radial deviations of 45.6° and 27.0°, respectively, while CTS patients have lower values of 28.7° and 20.1°. Using an exoskeleton, healthy people exhibit ROM flexion and extension of 64.9° and 59.0°, compared to 42.9° and 34.5° in CTS patients. This pattern is also shown in the ulnar and radial deviations, which are 44.1° and 25.6° for healthy individuals and 27.1° and 18.9° for CTS patients, respectively.
