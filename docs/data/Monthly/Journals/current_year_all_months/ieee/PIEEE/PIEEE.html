  abstract     = {Analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) are a standard building block of most Internet of Things (IoT) devices, used to convert between analog signals of the physical world and digital values for efficient storage and computation. While decades of research have explored methods to optimize the traditional power, performance, and area parameters of these circuits, a new requirement has emerged in the last five years for ADCs—security. Due to the deployment of these devices at the edge outside of a trusted computing base, there is a potential for various eavesdropping and tampering attacks. This can have a severe impact on the privacy and integrity of sensor data, which cannot be corrected for through the secure design of other blocks that follow the front end. In this article, we explore the recent work in ADC security and analyze what has been accomplished as well as what remains to be done for the successful deployment of secure ADCs in commercial systems.},

  abstract     = {The rapid evolution of modern electric power distribution systems into complex networks of interconnected active devices, distributed generation (DG), and storage poses increasing difficulties for system operators. The large-scale integration of distributed energy resources (DERs) and the rapid exchange of measurement data via communication networks present major opportunities for advancing grid operations but also introduce greater uncertainty, higher data dimensionality, more complex network and device models, and challenging control and optimization problems. Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms are promising in addressing these challenges. However, they have not been effectively adapted for power systems applications, requiring extensive customization for implementation and evaluation. This has resulted in reproducibility challenges and a steep learning curve for researchers new to applying DRL algorithms to the power systems domain. To bridge these gaps, this tutorial aims to serve as a valuable resource for researchers interested in exploring learning-based algorithms to operate active power distribution networks. Specifically, this work presents a generalized process for translating sequential decision-making problems in power distribution systems into Markov decision process (MDP) formulations, illustrated through concrete grid service examples. Additionally, we introduce a simple environment design strategy to develop and evaluate example DRL algorithms for distribution system applications, complete with an included code repository to guide users through environment construction.},

Here, we present an in-depth review of diverse SR methods, encompassing single-image SR (SISR), video SR (VSR), stereo SR (SSR), and light field SR (LFSR). We extensively cover over 150 SISR methods, nearly 70 VSR approaches, and approximately 30 techniques for SSR and LFSR. We analyze methodologies, datasets, evaluation protocols, empirical results, and complexity. In addition, we conducted a taxonomy based on each backbone structure according to the diverse purposes.

  abstract     = {Machine learning (ML) typically relies on the assumption that training and testing distributions are identical and that data are centrally stored for training and testing. However, in real-world scenarios, distributions may differ significantly, and data are often distributed across different devices, organizations, or edge nodes. Consequently, it is to develop models capable of effectively generalizing across unseen distributions in data spanning various domains. In response to this challenge, there has been a surge of interest in federated domain generalization (FDG) in recent years. FDG synergizes federated learning (FL) and domain generalization (DG) techniques, facilitating collaborative model development across diverse source domains for effective generalization to unseen domains, all while maintaining data privacy. However, generalizing the federated model under domain shifts remains a complex, underexplored issue. This article provides a comprehensive survey of the latest advancements in this field. Initially, we discuss the development process from traditional ML to domain adaptation (DA) and DG, leading to FDG, as well as provide the corresponding formal definition. Subsequently, we classify recent methodologies into four distinct categories: federated domain alignment (FDAL), data manipulation (DM), learning strategies (LSs), and aggregation optimization (AO), detailing appropriate algorithms for each. We then overview commonly utilized datasets, applications, evaluations, and benchmarks. Conclusively, this survey outlines potential future research directions.},

Aspects of power electronics (PE) and digital communication are presented in a structured form, including new perspectives such as multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) techniques applied to TPC, adaptive modulation and channel coding, and advanced receiver design with adaptive channel and load estimation.

A key challenge in this context is to design embedded systems to process EMG signals and generate motor commands with miniaturized, unobtrusive, and low-power devices, reliably and in real time, at a relatively low cost to provide continuous monitoring without causing stigma or discomfort. This article presents an in-depth review of the current status and future research challenges in systems and circuits for EMG acquisition and processing.

  abstract     = {Given the availability of more comprehensive measurement data in modern power systems, reinforcement learning (RL) has gained significant interest in operation and control. Conventional RL relies on trial-and-error interactions with the environment and reward feedback, which often leads to exploring unsafe operating regions and executing unsafe actions, especially when deployed in real-world power systems. To address these challenges, safe RL has been proposed to optimize operational objectives while ensuring safety constraints are met, keeping actions and states within safe regions throughout both training and deployment. Rather than relying solely on manually designed penalty terms for unsafe actions, as is common in conventional RL, safe RL methods reviewed here primarily leverage advanced and proactive mechanisms. These include techniques such as Lagrangian relaxation, safety layers, and theoretical guarantees like Lyapunov functions to rigorously enforce safety boundaries. This article provides a comprehensive review of safe RL methods and their applications across various power system operations and control domains, including security control, real-time operation, operational planning, and emerging areas. It summarizes existing safe RL techniques, evaluates their performance, analyzes suitable deployment scenarios, and examines algorithm benchmarks and application environments. This article also highlights real-world implementation cases and identifies critical challenges such as scalability in large-scale systems and robustness under uncertainty, providing potential solutions and outlining future directions to advance the reliable integration and deployment of safe RL in modern power systems.},

  abstract     = {In today’s competitive and fast-evolving business environment, it is critical for organizations to rethink how to make talent-related decisions in a quantitative manner. Indeed, the recent development of big data and artificial intelligence (AI) techniques has revolutionized human resource management (HRM). The availability of large-scale talent and management-related data provides unparalleled opportunities for business leaders to comprehend organizational behaviors and gain tangible knowledge from a data science perspective, which, in turn, delivers intelligence for real-time decision-making and effective talent management for their organizations. In the last decade, talent analytics has emerged as a promising field in applied data science for HRM, garnering significant attention from AI communities and inspiring numerous research efforts. To this end, we present an up-to-date and comprehensive survey on AI technologies used for talent analytics in the field of HRM. Specifically, we first provide the background knowledge of talent analytics and categorize various pertinent data. Subsequently, we offer a comprehensive taxonomy of relevant research efforts, categorized based on three distinct application-driven scenarios at different levels: talent management, organization management, and labor market analysis. In conclusion, we summarize the open challenges and potential prospects for future research directions in the domain of AI-driven talent analytics.},

  abstract     = {In the children’s story of the Tortoise and the Hare, the speedier Hare is outpaced by a Tortoise with other advantages (diligence). An analogous contest is happening in computing, between a Quantum Tortoise and a Classical Hare. Here, the Classical Hare’s speed advantage is literal—classical computers run faster than quantum ones. Like his namesake, the Quantum Tortoise is slower, but also has an advantage—in this case, the ability to run algorithms that are unavailable to classical computers. When this algorithmic advantage is substantial enough, the Quantum Tortoise can beat the Classical Hare and solve a problem faster. This article analyzes when the Quantum Tortoise will beat the Classical Hare—and when it will not.},

  abstract     = {Transitioning to net-zero emission energy systems is currently on the agenda in various countries to tackle climate change, a global challenge that threatens the lives of future generations. To fully decarbonize energy systems, a radical paradigm shift through deep integration of renewable resources supported by storage technologies is envisaged in multisector energy systems, especially in the electric power sector. As a result, inverter-based resources (IBRs), mainly wind, photovoltaics (PVs), and batteries, will dominate the electric power grids. This transition involves phasing out conventional fossil fuel-based plants and decommissioning associated synchronous machines, the grid’s primary reactive power sources. The ongoing removal of these primary reactive power sources introduces critical operational challenges that could compromise the reliability and stability of the grid. The inverters used for integrating IBRs can deliver diverse crucial ancillary services, particularly reactive power support. However, the potential of IBRs to address reactive power requirements in future decarbonized grids still needs to be fully addressed. The existing literature lacks a comprehensive approach to coordinating and harmonizing the efforts of various stakeholders and drivers to leverage the reactive power capability of IBRs. To bridge this gap, this article thoroughly reviews the reactive power implications for future grids with a considerable share of primary IBRs, comprising distributed and large-scale wind, PV and battery storage plants. This article starts with a summary of the concept, measurement methods, and importance of reactive power for voltage control and how it is managed today utilizing conventional sources. The reactive power transition from current to future grids within the context of the greater energy transition is then discussed by shedding light on its diverse aspects. Afterward, the reactive capability curve of each IBR is derived from the equivalent circuits and equations. Various grid codes and integration requirements of IBRs are then analyzed from a reactive power support viewpoint. Also, the concepts related to reactive power and voltage control comprising control extents, modes, and techniques are elaborated. Finally, recommendations are provided to set the stage for leveraging the capabilities of IBRs to address the reactive power requirements of future grids. The presented material sheds light on the pivotal role of reactive power in future grids and provides a roadmap for policymakers, utilities, and grid operators to manage a seamless transition to a decarbonized grid.},

  abstract     = {Several interesting problems in multirobot systems can be cast in the framework of distributed optimization. Examples include multirobot task allocation, vehicle routing, target protection, and surveillance. While the theoretical analysis of distributed optimization algorithms has received significant attention, its application to cooperative robotics has not been investigated in detail. In this article, we show how notable scenarios in cooperative robotics can be addressed by suitable distributed optimization setups. Specifically, after a brief introduction on the widely investigated consensus optimization (most suited for data analytics) and on the partition-based setup (matching the graph structure in the optimization), we focus on two distributed settings modeling several scenarios in cooperative robotics, i.e., the so-called constraint-coupled and aggregative optimization frameworks. For each one, we consider use-case applications, and we discuss tailored distributed algorithms with their convergence properties. Then, we revise state-of-the-art toolboxes allowing for the implementation of distributed schemes on real networks of robots without central coordinators. For each use case, we discuss its implementation in these toolboxes and provide simulations and real experiments on networks of heterogeneous robots.},

  abstract     = {Information technology (IT) security has been, and largely is, based on compartmentalization. To implement compartmentalization, system access privileges are granted depending on the topological location of systems, grouped into perimeters, with network mechanisms (firewalls, VLANs, ...) enforcing isolation between perimeters, thus implicitly trusting systems based on their location. However, history has shown that such trust is misplaced. This has led to the emergence of an alternative paradigm, called zero trust. After contextualizing the history of IT and the emergence of zero trust for securing networks, this article presents a taxonomy of zero trust models and architectures, summarizing the goals and core principles of zero trust. Furthermore, an in-depth description of state-of-the-art technologies and methods, for transforming perimeter-based architectures to mature zero-trust architectures, is provided. This article presents a formalization of zero trust and of optimal zero-trust architectures, to which traditional architectures migrate, as well as a method for positioning migrating architectures relative to this ideal of zero trust, with as purpose of enabling a clearer understanding of the benefits and risks induced by a migration to zero trust. Finally, this article analyses the benefits, and drawbacks, of zero trust, focusing on the security properties granted by zero trust, as well as the vulnerabilities introduced.},
