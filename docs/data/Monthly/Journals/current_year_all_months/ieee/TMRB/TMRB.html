  abstract     = {Force sensing for multi-degree-of-freedom articulated forceps is challenging for several reasons, including size constraints, the harsh environment inside the patient’s body, and sterilizability. This paper proposes a sensing method that overcomes the fragility and production cost disadvantages of conventional force/tension sensors that use flexure elements. Vibration-based tension sensing induced vibrations in forceps’ driving cables. The resulting fundamental frequencies were measured using photo interrupters. A rotating shaft was mounted on an axis parallel to cables suspended between two pulleys, with a small protrusion in the radial direction that plucked at the middle of those concentrically arranged cables. Cable tensions were estimated from the measured fundamental frequencies with satisfactory accuracy, repeatability, and vibration-to-noise magnitude ratio. The plucking negatively affects the wear of the protrusion and cables while inducing undesired vibration transmission and changes in the contact/grasping force at the forceps tip. A nylon protrusion and nylon-coated cables were used because nylon is wear-resistant, low-friction, biocompatible, and sterilizable. The results revealed minimal wear after 106 plucking cycles, minimal vibration transmissions and changes in contact force, and little interference with the photo interrupter signal from the plucking on another cable.},

  abstract     = {Bladder cancer and urinary dysfunctions present significant challenges to patient health and quality of life. Considering that radical cystectomy remains the standard treatment for muscle-invasive bladder cancer, there is an urgent need for the implantation of artificial bladders (ABs). In this study, we present the optimization and validation of a novel, collapsible, origami-based AB through Finite Element Method (FEM) simulations. We evaluated various materials and wall thicknesses to improve unfolding capability and minimize structural stress concentrations. Simulations were conducted under different filling conditions, replicating the in-body constraints posed by surrounding organs. The optimal material-thickness combination, namely MoldStar 15 with a 2:1 wall-to-fold ratio, effectively maintained low intravesical pressures during filling (0.5-1.96 kPa), meeting the clinical requirements for renal function preservation. Stress analysis showed Von Mises stresses lower than 2.5 MPa, well below the material’s tensile stress limit, thus ensuring the structural integrity of the device. The AB model was validated by comparing FEM simulation results with a physical prototype, showing a pressure difference of approximately 15% and a volumetric overlap deviation under 10%.},

In this study, a compact and versatile soft fluidic sensor-actuator (SA) capable of measuring both force and displacement in static and dynamic conditions is presented. Pressure and resistance are shown to be interchangeable, although best used in combination, when predicting the load on the SA, and show good repeatability and distinction between the loaded and constrained conditions. Using a single sensing medium and across the different diameters tested, the best estimated resolution of just under 4g and 0.07mm is achieved with the 12mm sensor, filled with 1.5mL using pressure sensing only. Furthermore, the SA is demonstrated in two probe applications and as part of a soft robotic implant for tissue-loading based tissue regeneration. The SA showed the ability to distinguish between different objects or areas of varying stiffness, as part of both a rigid-bodied and soft-bodied probe, as well as being able to predict force and displacement from the lengthening and retraction of a soft implant. Overall, this SA has the potential to be a key building block for biomedical robots’ monitoring of both displacement and force.},

In this paper, a high-accuracy hybrid continuum manipulator (HCM) consisting of a notch continuum manipulator section and a concentric tube manipulator section is proposed. The static model of the manipulator is established, and an optimization algorithm of the manipulator has been carried out to enhance the precision of the kinematic model. This algorithm can optimize the accuracy of the model while retaining the high computational speed. Then, three different modes, namely the trajectory planning mode, operation mode, and hybrid mode are introduced to cater to distinct surgical requirements. The mechanical structure of the HCM is specifically designed to realize the modes above. The experimental results demonstrate a repetition positioning error of 0.4745 mm and an operation error of 1.7801 mm. The kinematic model error of the optimized manipulator was reduced by 77.4% compared to its pre-optimization state. Finally, the feasibility of the manipulator is demonstrated through function testing experiments. The proposed manipulator design provides a more versatile and adaptable solution to meet the diverse requirements of surgical procedures.},

  abstract     = {Echocardiography is a critical tool for diagnosing cardiovascular diseases, offering detailed insights into heart functions. However, its accessibility is currently limited by a shortage of trained sonographers, specific skill requirements, and the physical strain imposed on professionals during repetitive procedures. This article introduces a new robotic system designed to automate the acquisition of transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) images. The system autonomously adjusts the position and orientation of the ultrasound transducer based on analysing real-time ultrasound images, without relying on tomographic data or depth sensors. Initially, the transducer is manually placed on the subject’s skin, and the system uses a deep learning approach to grade the quality of ultrasound images captured at each position. The robot then adjusts its position by spiralling outwards from the starting point, moving to the location with the highest image quality score. Next, the system fine-tunes the transducer’s orientation in 5-degree increments along all three axes of rotation, informed by another deep learning module to identify the field of view. The robotic system was tested using a cardiac simulator, achieving approximately 80% accuracy in acquiring the A4Ch view when the probe was initially positioned randomly in a 6 by 6 cm area beneath the left nipple. The impact of this work would be rapid diagnostics in the Emergency Departments to reduce the length of stay in hospitals, a reduction of hospital admissions related to heart disease by accessing local healthcare communities, acceleration of clearing the post-Covid backlog, and improved quality of life and longevity of patients.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, an existing physiological muscle model that predicts muscular force in response to electrical stimulation is adapted to be compatible with gradient-based optimization, in particular with numerical optimal control/estimation problems. The objective is to integrate biomechanical models with those that correlate muscle force generation with electrical pulses from a physiological perspective, with the aim of achieving optimal stimulation patterns in activities assisted by functional electrical stimulation. To this end, the activation dynamics of the original model, initially constrained to a stimulation train of predefined and constant length, is reformulated to account for stimulation sequences that dynamically change over time. This is typically necessary to simulate complex motions, which would otherwise be impossible to achieve with the earliest formulation. To identify the model parameters, experimental torque data of 3 participants with spinal cord injury performing electrically evoked isometric quadriceps contractions at different knee angles are used. We then employ an optimal control framework to demonstrate the model’s ability to predict knee torques and the possibility of achieving optimized stimulation patterns in simulation for controlling muscle force and knee extension. Our results reveal that the identified model allows accurate prediction of knee torque and optimization of stimulation patterns while satisfying the system’s dynamics at the skeletal and physiological muscle levels. This proof of concept is a first step towards physiological muscle model-based control of functional electrical stimulation to achieve movements that best exploit an individual’s physiological and biomechanical characteristics.},

The sensor exhibits high linearity over the bending range of 0°-65° and offers 100% elongation at break and excellent mechanical properties, also showing good biocompatibility and environmental adaptability. A $3{\times }3$ array of these sensors is attached to the continuum surgical robot to realize shape sensing. The angle change of the continuum at each position is determined from the resistance change of each sensor during bending. The position information of five key points can be obtained from these angles, and the shape is reconstructed by fitting each point. Experimental results show that the proposed sensor can accurately sense various bending shapes of the continuum within the stable linear bending range, and the position error of the distal end fluctuates about 2% of the overall shape. This study provides a new solution for shape sensing of continuum surgical robots, demonstrating strong application potential.},

  abstract     = {In robot-assisted endoscopic procedures, a guiding sheath must be flexibly advanced through anatomic paths via natural orifices, while maintaining sufficient rigidity to serve as a base for the surgical instruments used in dexterous diagnostic and therapeutic tasks. Therefore, developing a guiding sheath with the capacity of both flexible access and variable stiffness is imperative and challenging. To address these challenges, we have developed a novel robotic guiding sheath. Its stiffness can be managed using the innovatively-manufactured variable stiffness coating layer (VSCL), which has a thickness of only 1 mm and is composed of polycaprolactone (PCL) and conductive graphene. An active water heating and cooling mechanism was designed to regulate the temperature of the VSCL, thereby controlling the stiffness of the guiding sheath. Through detailed performance evaluation, the guiding sheath achieved a fixed-end bending stiffness gain of 25.76 and a mid-span bending stiffness gain of 25.01, reaching a fixed-end bending stiffness of 739.63 N/m and a mid-span bending stiffness of 5779.33 N/m. The fast switching between the rigid and flexible states was realized with switching times of 6.5 s (from rigid state to flexible state) and 10.0 s (from flexible state to rigid state). The sheath was also validated with phantom and ex-vivo experiments. The capability of this guiding sheath to traverse the tortuous digestive tract in a flexible state was proved. Additionally, the guiding sheath in a rigid state can significantly improve instrument manipulation stability during the ex-vivo trials. The experimental results demonstrated the potential clinical value of this system.},

We measured energy expenditure, joint work, and user preferences during treadmill walking. Results showed a 15.6% reduction in metabolic rate with stance flexion decreasing from 12° to 5° (p<0.05). User preferences favored lower stance flexion and personalized swing initiation. Personalized-best settings reduced the metabolic rate by 4.1% (stance flexion) and 9.8% (swing initiation) compared to the best-on-average settings (p<0.05). These reductions were also significant when compared to the device default and clinically tuned settings (p<0.05). We proposed an offline learning approach using anthropometric, gait, and prosthesis-related data to estimate optimal settings, yielding a 7.1% reduction in metabolic rate (p<0.05). Our results suggest that this approach achieves comparable energy efficiency without lengthy experiments, enabling automatic parameter tuning with initial measurements.},

This study bridges this gap by integrating a functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) into real-time lower-limb prosthesis control with preliminary clinical tests on the above-knee amputee, enabling a more reliable volitional control of the prosthesis. Cerebral hemodynamic responses were measured using a 56-channel fNIRS headset, and lower-limb kinematics were recorded with a optical motion capture system. Artifacts in fNIRS were mitigated using short-separation regression, and eight features of the fNIRS data were extracted. ANOVA revealed the means, slope, and entropy as top-performing features across all subjects. Among eight classifiers tested, k-nearest neighbor (KNN) emerged as the most accurate. In this study, we recruited eleven healthy subjects and one unilateral transfemoral amputee. Classification rates surpassed 97% for all classes, maintaining an average accuracy of $99.86\pm 0.01$ %. Notably, the amputee exhibited higher precision, sensitivity, and F1 scores than healthy subjects. Maximum temporal latencies for healthy subjects were $120.00\pm 49.40$ ms during sit-down and $119.09\pm 45.71$ ms during stand-up, while the amputee showed maximum temporal latencies of 90 ms and 190 ms, respectively.

This study introduces a novel neuromechanical control framework integrating a passivity observer with Quantum-Enhanced Deep Reinforcement Learning (QDRL) for adaptive impedance scaling in wrist rehabilitation robotics. The passivity observer continuously monitors energy exchanges to classify patient states into passive (patient requiring robotic assistance) and non-passive (patient actively participating) categories, dynamically guiding the robot’s impedance adjustments. Experiments were conducted with ten unimpaired human subjects (eight male and two female), who were instructed to simulate rehabilitation scenarios, focusing on three key wrist movements, flexion/extension (FL/EX), abduction/adduction (AB/AD), and pronation/supination (PR/SU). Experimental results showed high correlations (> 0.83) between energy-based and electromyography (EMG)-based passivity classifications, confirming the reliability of the proposed approach. Furthermore, the designed QDRL model significantly outperformed traditional reinforcement learning methods, achieving superior adaptability, stability, and higher average rewards during robotic impedance control. The framework offers advancement in optimizing robotic assistance during motor recovery, promoting personalized rehabilitation by tailoring interventions to the specific needs of each patient.},

The modular and variable stiffness structure of exoskeleton enable the adaptation to different human joint, improving the characteristics of physical human-robot interaction. The DTS-VSA is designed based on the pulley-cable-spring preloading principle and tendon sheath transmission, and its stiffness model is developed through quasi-static force balance analysis. To realize coordinated and active power argumentation, a fuzzy adaptive assistive controller integrated with human joint torque and stiffness estimation is proposed based on surface electromyography. Feasibility is experimentally verified via three typical load-carrying experiments and ten volunteers. The experimental results show that the average assistance efficiencies of elbow motion and knee motion in different experiment conditions are higher than 44.72% and 38.41%.},

  abstract     = {The increasing demand for responsive and intuitive assistive walking devices, driven by an aging population, underscores the need for intelligent systems powered by emerging machine learning (ML) technologies. This study introduces a novel feature fusion framework based on the Nondominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II) to fuse surface electromyography (sEMG) signals with inertial measurement unit (IMU) data and a high-level control architecture, enabling accurate and robust motion intention detection for robotic assistive walking systems. The proposed feature fusion method consistently outperformed statistical filter-based techniques such as mutual information (MI), minimum redundancy maximum relevance (MRMR), correlation coefficient (CC), and Fisher score (FS). It significantly improved the classification metrics of random forest (RF), K-nearest neighbour (KNN), and support vector machine (SVM) classifiers across varying feature counts. For example, the feature fusion algorithm improved RF’s accuracy by 6.74%, 7.67%, 6.35%, and 3.60% and enhanced precision by 6.77%, 7.67%, 6.36%, and 3.61% relative to FS, CC, MRMR, and MI, respectively. Similarly, the algorithm increased RF’s recall by 6.79%, 7.71%, 6.38%, and 3.62%. The proposed feature fusion and high-level and low-level control frameworks were implemented on SoloWalk for real-time interaction, enabling participants to perform daily walking activities. Real-time validation confirmed system stability across gait patterns and user variations, demonstrating its effectiveness in assistive walking robots.},

  abstract     = {Surface electromyography (sEMG) signals from the coactivation of agonist and antagonist muscles can provide precise and powerful control of a lower limb prosthesis along with proprioceptive sensory feedback. However, the analysis of coactivation is challenging due to the inherent nonlinearity of the signals and the nonlinear interactions within the muscular systems during dynamic contractions. In this study, a novel nonlinear approach based on symbolic transfer entropy (STE) is proposed to characterize the coactivation of muscles at different speeds of gait. For this purpose, the sEMG is recorded from the rectus femoris (RF) and vastus lateralis (VL) of the quadriceps, as well as the biceps femoris (BF) and semitendinosus (SEM) of the hamstring muscles. The signals are collected from 20 healthy subjects walking on a treadmill at gait speeds of 2.5, 3.5, and 4.5 kilometres per hour (km/h). In addition, the knee joint angles are also obtained from the inertial measurement units. The sEMG signals are pre-processed, and eight distinct phases of gait are segmented using joint angles. A suitable symbolic scale is selected after a detailed analysis, and STE is extracted to characterize the coactivation of agonist and antagonist muscle pairs: RF-BF, RF-SEM, VL-BF and VL-SEM. The results show that STE increases with gait speed irrespective of muscle combinations, which indicates the stronger coactivation during faster locomotion. The variation of STE with respect to each phase exhibits a complex dynamic pattern in muscle coactivation. The information transfer is bidirectional and the distribution of STE is found to have significant differences across directions, phases and speeds (p¡0.001). Furthermore, the proposed STE is superior to traditional transfer entropy in terms of capturing nonlinear interactions. The study facilitates researchers in developing gait phase-based features that account for coactivation, enabling them to achieve significantly more natural and efficient gait patterns in prosthetic lower limbs.},

  abstract     = {Electrical stimulation-based therapies are vital in managing post-spinal cord injury complications, particularly during physical rehabilitation. However, the nonlinear muscle response to electrical stimuli and the subjective, physiological variability make it challenging to predict stimulation levels for precise limb movements. The electromechanical delay (EMD), corresponding to the lag between electrical stimulation and muscle actuation, also alleviates rehabilitation outcomes. We propose a dynamic linearization-based sliding mode controller with Smith predictor configuration, compensating for EMD and regulating limb movement using electrical stimulation. Unlike model-based approaches, the proposed controller relies solely on real-time input/output data, eliminating the need for complex system modelling. Experiments with thirteen healthy and two spinal cord-injured participants demonstrated a root mean square error in the range of 2.31° to 8.63° and 1.22° to 3.21° in stimulus-assisted trajectory tracking and disturbance rejection scenarios, respectively. The proposed controller significantly outperformed (Man-Whitney U Test, p¡0.05) the conventional dynamic linearization-based sliding mode controller with an average (SD) RMSE improvement of 2.13°(0.96°). Additionally, the results indicate the robust performance of the proposed controller during impulsive disturbances during seated knee flexion and extension tasks. The proposed controller may potentially eliminate the need for extensive mathematical modelling of the subject while giving excellent trajectory-tracking performance.},

However, depending on the scanning speed and the physician’s experience, the size of the physical features in the body can be miscategorized or overlooked entirely. By designing tactile sensors and signal processing algorithms that mimic the body’s ability to account for variations in speed when scanning an object, we can solve the problem described above in an artificial system. We utilized a piezoresistive tactile sensor attached to a robotic arm to palpate fractures at different speeds. The analog tactile signals generated from the tactile sensor are converted into spike trains which are then scaled in time to encode the sensor data invariant of the speed of palpation. With a few principal components, the scaled dataset achieves a higher classification accuracy compared to the original dataset. Additionally, the scaled data was more robust to both spike timing noise and untrained speed conditions compared to the original data. Lastly, we demonstrated that this system could be applied in a medical setting by discriminating between 3 different fracture conditions (none, transverse, and communicated) in the ulna of a chicken wing with 99.8% accuracy at 3 different speeds.},

In this study, we aimed to design a hinge-less exosuit knee brace that combines flexible materials to improve comfort at the brace-body interface while providing dynamic support forces during walking tasks using an offboard actuation system. We recruited 11 participants: 5 for design tests and 6 for walking tests. Our active exosuit knee brace was able to produce up to 88.9 N of cable force during a portion of the stance phase with a rise time of 111-150 milliseconds at different load settings and under 10N during the swing phase. Comfort scores were high (> 7) during most walking tests. The range of knee flexion was reduced by about 5 degrees when the exosuit knee brace was activated during walking, and brace migration was within 10 mm in most cases.},

Adopting exoskeletons is emerging as a preventive measure in alleviating the musculoskeletal system’s workload. This work investigates the effect of a semi-active exoskeleton, a new class of wearable devices, in a simulated industrial environment. The study found a consistent decrease in the average activity of the Anterior Deltoid, Upper Trapezius, and Rectus Abdominis in four different material handling and lifting tasks when the exoskeleton was used. Using the exoskeleton to move a weight between two shelves reduced the activity of 10 measured muscles belonging to the arm and trunk, with a notable 42.6% reduction for the Anterior Deltoid and 46.4% for the Upper Trapezius. The study also showed reduced peak force and slower lifting motion, potentially decreasing the likelihood of WRMSDs. Lastly, using the exoskeleton did not require additional cognitive exertion from the subjects, who also consistently reported a 44.9% reduction in their perceived Effort and a 34.0% reduction in Physical Demand. Despite some negative feedback regarding limited mobility, the study demonstrated the potential of semi-active exoskeletons, achieving good results in tasks and with weights where passive upper-limb exoskeletons are not typically used.},

We thus present a neural-network-informed scheduler methodology that monitors patient exercise performance and dynamically assigns patients to robots based on their performance. These schedulers were trained and tested using synthetic datasets from a simulated rehabilitation gym. They were evaluated in 36 scenarios that differed in several ways (e.g., number of robots/patients, degree of stochasticity). Results showed that our neural-network-informed schedulers led to greater mean skill improvement compared to several baseline schedulers (e.g., only switching robots once). Additionally, the outcome difference between neural-network-informed schedulers and baseline schedulers increased as skill improvement became more stochastic. We also performed secondary studies where we showed that our schedulers still outperform baselines when patients can arrive or leave midsession and analyzed how the training dataset size affects scheduler performance. While several limitations need to be addressed before the scheduler is ready for use in real-world gyms, our study represents a step toward the use of artificial intelligence for patient monitoring in group settings.},

  abstract     = {Surgical training remains a crucial milestone in modern medicine, with procedures such as laminectomy exemplifying the high risks involved. Laminectomy drilling requires precise manual control to mill bony tissue while preserving spinal segment integrity and avoiding breaches in the dura–the protective membrane surrounding the spinal cord. Despite unintended dural tears occurring in up to 11.3% of cases, no assistive tools are currently utilized to reduce this risk. Variability in patient anatomy further complicates learning for novice surgeons. This study introduces CAPTAiN, a critical anatomy-preserving and terrain-augmenting navigation system that provides layered, color-coded voxel guidance to enhance anatomical awareness during spinal drilling. CAPTAiN was evaluated against a standard non-navigated approach through 110 virtual laminectomies performed by 11 orthopedic residents and medical students. CAPTAiN significantly improved surgical completion rates of target anatomy (87.99% vs. 74.42%) and reduced cognitive load across multiple NASA-TLX domains. It also minimized performance gaps across experience levels, enabling novices to perform on par with advanced trainees. These findings highlight CAPTAiN’s potential to optimize surgical execution and support skill development across experience levels. Beyond laminectomy, it demonstrates potential for broader applications across various surgical and drilling procedures, including those in neurosurgery, otolaryngology, and other medical fields.},

Although human Activities of Daily Living (ADL) tasks differ substantially from surgical tasks, they encompass fundamental motor skills that can serve as a foundation for robot learning. Notably, skilled surgeons often develop their advanced surgical abilities by building upon these basic motor skills acquired through daily activities. Inspired by this progressive learning trajectory, we propose a novel surgical skill training framework that enables robots to learn basic motor skills from the ADL dataset and quickly adapt to advanced surgical skills. Specifically, we propose a unified predictive representation space, constructed using probabilistic successor features, which capture the dynamic patterns of motion primitives common to both ADL and surgical tasks. To investigate the transferability of skills from human ADL tasks to robotic surgical tasks, we conducted a mathematical analysis to evaluate transferable policies and performed simulation experiments to assess transfer performance. Furthermore, we validated the practicality and effectiveness of our method through real-world experiments. Results show that our method significantly reduces the need for extensive surgical datasets, and enables efficient learning in robotic surgical tasks.},

The novel navigation frames enable in-bore stereotactic targeting through multiple burr holes with a single registration procedure and 3-degree-of-freedom pivoting about each burr hole, while simultaneously support the actuator-equipped manipulator across a large workspace. Kinematic modeling and design optimization were performed for the navigation components to achieve Pareto balance between large laser coverage and sufficient stiffness for the manipulator support. The unique setting enables in the clinical workflow intuitive navigation frames adjustment for stereotactic targeting and iterative laser tip steering to adapt to targeting error and various tumor geometries. Experiments demonstrate high tip positioning accuracy (RMSE 1.45 mm), minimal MR imaging interference ( $\lt 1.71\%~\Delta $ SNR, <0.71 mm distortion), and precise MRI-guided tip steering (RMSE 2.1 mm). Compared to existing MRI-guided neurosurgical systems, our system offers practical and accurate navigation, distal robot dexterity, and minimal MR image disruption, potentially improving clinical LITT outcomes and facilitating autonomous MRI-guided ablation strategies.},

Results: The proposed system is evaluated using precise registration instruments, human phantom models, and ex vivo ovine models, demonstrating less than 2 mm of error with fiducials and less than 4 mm of error without fiducials. Conclusion: The registration procedure takes less than one minute and can be performed intuitively by a single operator without an assistant.

  abstract     = {In this paper, we propose a novel unsupervised learning-based non-rigid 3D point set registration method, Learning Coherent Point Drift Network (LCNet), for image-guided liver surgery. We reformulate the classical probabilistic registration approach, i.e., Coherent Point Drift (CPD) into a learning-based paradigm. We first utilise the feature extraction module (FEM) to extract the features of two original point sets, which are robust to rigid transformation. Subsequently, we establish reliable correspondences between the point sets using the optimal transport (OT) module by leveraging both original points and learned features. Then, rather than directly regressing displacement vectors, we compute the displacements by solving the involved matrix equation in the transformation module, where the point localization noise is explicitly considered. In addition, we present three variants of the proposed approach, i.e., LCNet, LCNet-ED and LCNet-WD. Among these, LCNet outperforms the other two, demonstrating the superiority of the Chamfer loss. We have extensively evaluated LCNet on the simulated and real datasets. Under experimental conditions with the rotation angle lies in the range of $[{-}45^{\circ },45^{\circ }]$ and the translation in the range of $[{-}30 mm, 30 mm]$ , LCNet achieves the root-mean-square-error (rmse) value being 3.46 mm on the MedShapeNet dataset, while those using CPD and RoITr are 7.65 mm $(p\lt 0.001)$ and 6.71 mm $(p\lt 0.001)$ respectively. Experimental results show that LCNet exhibits significant improvements over existing state-of-the-art registration methods and shed light on its promising use in image-guided liver surgery.},

Additionally, it improves image stability when zooming with an oblique-viewing scope by developing a custom laparoscope integrated with an embedded distance sensor, allowing the LapARM to dynamically adjust the scope’s orientation during zooming, ensuring that the imaged object remains centered in the image throughout the zooming process. Furthermore, an eye tracker provides surgeons with a contactless interface for intuitive solo control of the laparoscope via head movements.

  abstract     = {Vascular interventional robot enables surgeons to perform percutaneous coronary interventions remotely from the cardiac catheterization room, significantly reducing their radiation exposure. However, the teleoperation mode inherently causes the loss of force perception, increasing surgical risks and limiting the clinical application of vascular interventional robots. Furthermore, existing robot systems lack the ability to enhance surgeons’ force perception and operational transparency. To address these limitations, we developed an intuitive interface with enhanced haptic feedback for vascular interventional robot. Our approach involved three key innovations: Firstly, we designed a magnetism-based feedback mechanism based on the equivalent magnetic charge method to provide high-precision and real-time force feedback. Secondly, we proposed a feedback enhancement model based on surgeons’ experience to reduce damage to vulnerable vascular areas. Thirdly, a dynamic feedback compensation strategy was presented, aiming at addressing the issue of vascular wall rupture resulted from the rapid decay of feedback force during instantaneous guidewire penetration through lesions in surgical procedures. Finally, we conducted a series of experiments to assess the accuracy, dynamic tracking ability, and overall effectiveness of our system. The results demonstrate the developed haptic interface not only improves surgical transparency but also reduces the risk of vascular injury and puncture, thereby advancing the clinical applicability of vascular interventional robots.},

  abstract     = {Oral cavity cancer, a common head and neck cancer, is typically treated through precise tumor excision via electrosurgery. Autonomous robotic electrosurgery has demonstrated the potential to achieve more accurate and consistent resection margins compared to manual methods, thereby improving surgical outcomes. However, current autonomous systems face challenges in tracking tissue deformation during electrosurgical cutting due to unpredictable and complex soft tissue dynamics. Failure to monitor and adapt to tissue deformation can significantly compromise resection precision. This paper presents an autonomous closed-loop robotic electrosurgery system to enhance surgical precision via 3D tissue tracking and image-based feedback control utilizing a Red Green Blue – Depth (RGB-D) sensor. The developed 3D tissue tracker employs CoTracker, a deep learning-based model for markerless tracking, complemented by a tool-occlusion algorithm to achieve tissue deformation tracking with no prior knowledge of the tissue model. The estimated deformation is fed into a fuzzy logic controller, which dynamically adjusts the cutting velocity to minimize cutting error during electrosurgery. The system’s efficacy was validated using ex vivo porcine tongues, demonstrating a 55% reduction in average cutting error (from 1.2 mm to 0.54 mm, $p\lt 0.001$ ) in closed-loop operations (N=6) compared to open-loop cutting without feedback control (N=3). The results demonstrate the effectiveness of image-based closed-loop control in improving margin accuracy, a key factor in reducing the likelihood of cancer recurrence.},

  abstract     = {Endovascular surgeries generally rely on push-based catheters and guidewires, which require significant training to master and can still result in high stress being exerted on the anatomy, especially in tortuous paths. Because these procedures are so technically challenging to perform, many patients have limited access to high-quality treatment. Although various robotic systems have been developed to enhance navigation capabilities, they can also apply high stresses due to sliding against the vascular walls, impeding movement and raising the risk of vascular damage. Soft growing robots offer a promising alternative since their method of movement via eversion minimizes interaction forces with the environment and enables follow-the-leader navigation through tortuous paths. However, reliable steering of small-scale growing robots remains a significant challenge. We propose a robot architecture that combines a hydraulically-actuated, soft growing robot with a soft, tendon-driven notched continuum robot to overcome the challenges of steering for small-scale growing robots in endovascular procedures. The soft notched continuum robot successfully steers around the most difficult aortic arch type, and a 2.67 mm diameter growing robot—comparable in size to current catheters—deploys from the tip, pulling an aspiration catheter through extremely tortuous vessels. We present the design, manufacturing, and control of the notched continuum robot, growing robot, and proximal actuation subsystem. Overall, this robotic architecture facilitates active steering in proximal anatomy and navigation in tortuous distal vessels, with potential to reduce procedure times and expand access to care.},

  abstract     = {Minimally invasive surgery (MIS) is a widely adopted surgical approach in contemporary medicine, significantly reducing patient trauma. However, it imposes demands on the surgeon’s operation. To reduce the surgical complexity, this study developed a highly dexterous operative tool for MIS procedures. The tool utilizes the widely adopted radiofrequency ablation (RFA) technology in surgical to separate tissues by generating heat through high-frequency currents. It consists of three sets of grippers and radiofrequency (RF) transmitters at their tips. The tool enables intact capture and separation the lesion, thereby eliminating the need for an additional abdominal incision compared to traditional methods and reducing the complexity of liver tumor resection in confined spaces. To minimize the impact on healthy tissue, this paper proposed a calculation method that determines the tool’s key structural parameters and singularity position based on the lesion size, resulting in a lesion volume that constitutes approximately 48.4% of the excised area. Given the high-resistance lever mechanisms in the usage scenario, auxiliary tensiles utilizing RF transmitters are introduced. Simulation analysis confirms that this method reduces the tool’s maximum hinge forces and torques to one-quarter of its original value. Finally, comprehensive experiments validate the feasibility of the gripping tool in MIS.},

This paper investigates surgical robots’ optimal configuration by considering variations in the operator’s suturing accuracy and muscle burden across trials and between individual operators. The design factors were the motion scale, viewing angle, pivot point, tip length, and needle gripping angle. We developed a virtual surgical simulator implementing haptic feedback. As 20 participants manipulated the simulator in three trials for 27 surgical robot configurations, we evaluated each participant’s suturing error and joint burden. Considering the variation among trial and individual differences, we investigated the best-fitted probability distribution model, calculated the expectation and deviation in each index using the reliability design method, and constructed the response surface for the relationship between factors. Furthermore, we optimized the surgical robot using the satisficing trade-off method. Finally, when comparing theoretical and experimental values for the best solution, relative errors in suturing error and muscle burden were less than 7.14% and 15.1%, respectively. Moreover, the optimized surgical robot improved suturing error and joint energy by 18% relative to the average values across the 27 configurations.},

  abstract     = {Little attention has been paid to how scoliosis movements deviate from intact spines and the consequent response to surgical instrumentation. Embedding such deviations into scoliosis simulation models can significantly improve their predictive capability for surgical outcome and to mitigate complication risks and thus bring more satisfaction to patients and clinicians. Scoliosis models are mainly intact spine models adapted by merely adjusting model parameters to produce scoliotic-like asymmetry, overlooking that the scoliosis condition results in significant deviations of movements. Thus, these adapted models might provide misleading predictive information. This paper aims to uncover the behaviors emerging out of scoliotic spine movements for simulation. A multibody model with micro-scale motion segments was utilized to study movement of nine adolescent idiopathic scoliosis patients. Statistical analysis was used to identify the shared movement behavior and to test their significance in terms of occurrence and their effects on the simulation results and prediction accuracy. Four movement behaviors were uncovered: (1) negligible change of spinal length, (2) bounded rotational displacements, (3) unilateral rotational displacements of certain vertebrae, (4) negligible rotational displacements around inflection vertebrae. Simulation results were improved significantly by incorporating these findings: location and orientation errors of vertebrae from $2.9\pm 2$ .5 mm to $1.1\pm 0$ .4 mm and $2.0\pm 1.3^{\circ }$ to $1.0\pm 0.4^{\circ }$ , respectively, approximation error of spine curvature from $2.1\pm 2$ .0 mm to $0.6\pm 0$ .3 mm. Therefore, scoliosis exhibits unique movements, and it is essential that scoliosis models comply for improved predictive capability.},

All sensors are manufactured using inexpensive off-the-shelf components. The proposed sensor system was characterized on a robotic test bench and validated in a colon phantom study. The results demonstrate the feasibility and robustness of the proposed sensor fusion approach in colonoscopy which has the potential for safer and more effective inspection of the bowels.

To address this issue, we propose an unsupervised domain-adaptive semantic segmentation approach for surgical instruments, leveraging Dropout-enhanced Dual Heads and Coarse-Grained classification branch (D2HCG). The proposed approach comprises dropout-enhanced dual heads for diverse feature representation, and a coarse-grained classification branch for capturing complexities across varying granularities. This incorporates consistency loss functions targeting fine-grained features and coarse-grained granularities, aiming to reduce cross-scene domain gaps. Afterwards, we perform experiments in cross-scene surgical-instrument semantic segmentation cases, with the experimental results reporting the effectiveness for the proposed approach, compared with state-of-the-art semantic segmentation ones.},

  abstract     = {Skin cancer affects over 2 million people worldwide each year. Although dermoscopy is the gold standard screening technique, it only assesses the superficial features of skin lesions. Novel approaches based on thermal investigation have revealed a correlation between thermal recovery and vascular pattern alterations, which is an important factor in discriminating malignant and benign lesions. In this study, a dynamic thermal-imaging system was designed, developed, and validated in a real clinical scenario. The system is non-invasive, compact, and cost-effective, comprising a cooling probe and an image acquisition system equipped with RGB and thermal cameras. The system incorporates a machine-learning classification algorithm for skin cancer screening. The system showed an accuracy of 89.7% in distinguishing between malignant and benign lesions in a case study involving 58 patients and classified sub-classes of lesions (i.e., melanoma and nevi) with an accuracy of 95.5%. These findings underscore the potential benefit of the proposed dynamic thermal-imaging system as a support tool for non-invasive screening and early detection of malignant skin lesions.},

  abstract     = {The optimized hardware implementation of neurons and biological cells in the neuromorphic domain is of significant importance. In this paper, a novel method is presented that reduces any number of nonlinear terms in the differential equations describing the behavior of neurons or biological cells with a common variable to a single nonlinear term with high precision. This approach significantly improves implementation efficiency by reducing hardware resource consumption while maintaining high frequency and accuracy. The proposed method was applied to Cardiac Purkinje Fiber Cells, and its validity was demonstrated through time-domain analysis, noise condition analysis, Lyapunov stability analysis, and bifurcation analysis to validate the model under various conditions. These validations ensure the accuracy and stability of the proposed approach across different operating conditions. To assess large-scale applicability, the model was tested in a 300-cell Purkinje fiber network, demonstrating accurate synchronization, equilibrium states, and cross-spectral consistency while maintaining computational efficiency. The digital hardware implementation on a Virtex-7 FPGA board demonstrated a frequency improvement of 3.49 times compared to the original model and 1.79 times compared to the best implementation of this model to date. We also simulated a network of 4500 cells to analyze correlation and implemented it on hardware to demonstrate that the proposed model, based on the method presented in this paper, can efficiently and accurately scale to large-scale applications. This efficient and scalable approach paves the way for applications in medical research, bioengineering, and neuromorphic hardware development, including the creation of hardware-accelerated tools for simulating biological systems, designing bio-inspired devices, and enabling large-scale real-time simulations for understanding and treating cardiac or neurological conditions.},

While colonoscopy is generally safe and effective at reducing CRC mortality, lesions can be missed during procedures, with adverse impacts on the patient. Latest innovations in hardware and software led to the development of adjunct tools for complementing standard colonoscopy to ensure optimal outcomes. Such tools aim to enhance the detection of lesions, standardize procedures, enhance safety, and minimize discomfort. Ultimately, they contribute to reducing the morbidity and mortality rates associated with CRC. This survey comprehensively explores both clinically tested and emerging advanced hardware and software adjunct tools, categorizing them based on their role in targeting three clinical challenges: mucosal visualization, lesion detection and classification, and navigation and procedure assessment.

Flexible bronchoscope robots (FBRs) have emerged over the past decade, revealing broad prospects for the safe, precise, and reliable diagnosis of peripheral pulmonary nodules (PPNs), which is crucial for enabling early lung cancer treatment. However, in advancing FBR development, roboticists sometimes stray from or overlook practical surgical considerations, which might impede its clinical implementation. This review aims to bridge this gap by offering an engineering-focused perspective enriched with critical medical insights to drive the clinical translation of next-generation FBRs. We begin by highlighting the medical significance and current state of FBR research. Then, we outline the “ambient environments” of FBRs: the supported procedure, robotic system, steering tools, and deployment modes. Subsequently, we summarize recent progress in FBR technology, focusing on two key areas: procedure-specific design and modeling to improve intervention capabilities, and autonomous navigation and control strategies to enhance autonomy. Based on the given analysis, we discuss the development directions of next-generation FBRs according to the current clinical challenges and the engineering approaches to their realization.},

Achieving closed-loop control over in-vivo musculotendon mechanics during movement could revolutionize injury prevention and personalized rehabilitation. Here, we introduce a framework utilizing musculoskeletal modeling and nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) to close the loop around tendon force in a simulation of cyclic force production of the human ankle plantarflexors in parallel with a powered exoskeleton. The proposed framework integrates a computationally efficient model comprising explicit closed-form ordinary differential equations governing musculotendon and ankle joint with parallel actuation dynamics. The model’s computational time, in the microsecond range, allows prediction of future states in real-time closed-loop control. Compared to a predictive proportional-derivative controller, the NMPC-based framework more effectively maintained Achilles tendon force within a predetermined threshold across varying levels of muscle excitation amplitude and frequency. Remarkably, the NMPC framework demonstrates robustness to muscle excitation variations during cyclic motions, making it suitable for real-world applications.},

This article presents a patient-specific bio-mechanical model (PSBM) of the diaphragm, as well as ribs kinematics. To determine the appropriate values of specific diaphragm forces for each patient, during a whole respiratory cycle, inverse finite element (FE) analysis methodology has been implemented to match the experimental results to the FE simulation results. Ribs kinematics extracted and calculated directly from 4D Computed Tomography (CT) scan images. We have investigated the effect of element type, finite deformation and elasticity on the accuracy and computation time. The results demonstrate that the proposed FE model including ribs kinematics can accurately predict the diaphragm motion with an average surface error in diaphragm/lungs contact region less than $2.2\pm 2.1mm$ .

By optimizing the cost function associated with the wires’ straightness, we can estimate the pose of the B-scan in the robot flange coordinate frame precisely and reliably without significant limitations, e.g., complex scanning trajectories.

Nevertheless, the conventional echocardiography examination heavily relies on the manual dexterity of the sonographer, leading to the suboptimal repeatability. Despite the extensive exploration of robot-assisted ultrasound systems, achieving a heightened level of automation in examinations and enhancing the practicality of these robotic platforms for primary utilization remain formidable challenges within the field. In this study, we introduce an innovative automatic acquisition method for cardiac views using a novel ultrasound robot. The method is designed to autonomously traverse and scan target positions and angular ranges to search and identify the target cardiac views. First, the target positions and angular ranges were derived from a professional sonographer’s practice on 14 cases. Then, an automatic traversal scanning method is designed integrating visual guidance, human-machine collaboration, and path planning within the framework of a novel parallel mechanism-based ultrasound robot. Finally, we explore deep metric learning to search for target ultrasound images in the traversed ultrasound video. Experiments on the test set to evaluate the target ultrasound view searching algorithm achieved a mAP of 98.8% and a Rank-1 accuracy of 98.23%. Our method has been successfully validated by data from five subjects, achieving the acquisition of standard parasternal long-axis and short-axis cardiac views essential for diagnosis, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {Lung ultrasound scanning is essential for diagnosing lung diseases. The scan effectiveness critically depends on both longitudinal and transverse scans through intercostal spaces to reduce rib shadowing interference, as well as maintaining the probe perpendicular to pleura for pathological artifact generation. Achieving this level of scan quality often depends heavily on the experience of doctors. Robotic ultrasound scanning shows promise, but currently lacks a direct path planning method for intercostal scanning, and probe orientation does not consider imaging differences between lungs and solid organs. In this paper, we aim to fully automate two fundamental operations in lung ultrasound scanning: longitudinal and transverse scans. We propose pioneering path planning methods along intercostal spaces and innovative solutions for adaptive probe posture adjustment using real-time pleural line feedback, specifically addressing the unique characteristics of lung ultrasound scanning. This ensures the acquisition of high-quality, diagnostically meaningful ultrasound images. In addition, we develop a robotic lung ultrasound system to validate the proposed methods.

  abstract     = {Robotic ultrasound (US) scanning of the spine is becoming an increasingly viable radiation-free alternative to CT scans and fluoroscopy. However, due to the complex shape of the vertebra, three-dimensional (3D) US reconstructions generated from two-dimensional (2D) US scans often lack important anatomic information, such as the spinous process. This paper investigates scanning strategies that reorient the probe during US scanning to improve surface coverage of 3D US reconstructions. A two-scan procedure with a path re-planning algorithm is presented. The proposed algorithm uses information from a first exploratory scan to generate an improved imaging trajectory whereby the US probe is near-perpendicular to the targeted bone surface. The results show a 30.4%, 42.3%, and 75.0% improvement in surface coverage on a synthetic phantom, cadaver, and human volunteers, respectively, achieving up to 56% surface coverage on human volunteers. These results emphasise the value of exploiting information about the underlying anatomy to optimise the scanning trajectory. The increased surface coverage of the 3D US reconstructions will provide higher quality radiation-free visualisation, extending the role of US as a complementary imaging modality for safe and effective diagnosis and spine interventions.},

The proposed design is a constrained cable robot with a vertical workspace, capable of supporting and measuring the motion of a stroke survivor’s arm and hand during therapy activities, with a modular end effector design to simulate a variety of activities of daily living. The technical requirements of the design are described and linked to research on therapy activities, activities of daily living, and anthropometry.

  abstract     = {Clear and effective communication between humans and robots is crucial when they work closely together. As wearable robots become more intelligent and automated, anticipatory control is limited for amputees because they lack prior knowledge of the timing and nature of changes in the robot’s motion, making human-machine collaboration more challenging. This study addresses the need for improved wearable robot transparency by enhancing a prosthetic controller to provide users with advanced notifications of locomotion mode changes. Five transfemoral amputees (TFA) wore our designed knee prosthesis and walked on a treadmill. We simulated a terrain misrecognition error by switching the locomotion mode from treadmill walking to stair ascent. Our study focused on three main questions: 1) What is the ideal timing that the TFAs need to mitigate for machine errors? 2) How do TFAs compensate for prosthetic knee errors? And 3) How does the robotic prosthetic leg respond to the TFAs’ corrective actions? We found that the enhanced transparency system helps TFAs anticipate changes and adjust their gait to compensate for the terrain misrecognition error. Specifically, providing notifications about 650 milliseconds before a locomotion mode change significantly reduced the effect of robot errors. Although the error compensation from TFAs resulted in a larger magnitude of error induced by the prosthetic knee, the TFAs were able to tolerate it and improve balance stability. According to questionnaires on user preferences, with notification of prosthetic knee motion, the TFAs could trust the device more even though the devices might have occasional errors. This study demonstrates that simple notifications of the robot’s movement intent enhance the predictability of prosthetic motion, facilitating anticipatory adjustments that improve safety and user trust.},

  abstract     = {Hand Gesture Recognition (HGR) employing surface electromyography (sEMG) and accelerometer (ACC) signals has garnered increasing interest in areas of bionic prostheses and human-machine interaction. However, existing multimodal approaches predominantly extract global specificity at a single temporal scale, which neglects local dynamic characteristics. This limitation hinders the effective capture of global-local temporal information, resulting in restricted performance and frequent misclassification of dynamic gestures. To this end, we propose a novel global-local Fusion model, termed Temporal-spatial Dependence Fusion (TsdFusion), for sEMG-ACC-based HGR. TsdFusion harnesses temporal-spatial dependencies (Tsd) from multi-time scale handcrafted features and employs a Convolution-Transformer framework for global-local fusion, thus enriching local dynamic information while preserving global insights. Specifically, the Tsd inputs are independently constructed from sEMG and ACC through multi-time scale window segmentation and feature engineering. Furthermore, the global and local temporal-spatial correlations within unimodal Tsd inputs are characterized by the unimodal transformer and dimension-wise convolution modules, respectively. Subsequently, a Convolution-coupled-transformer progressive hierarchical fusion module effectively integrates intramodal specificity and intermodal hierarchical relationship for final prediction. Evaluations on four public datasets, including transradial amputees and healthy subjects, demonstrate TsdFusion outperforms the state-of-the-art multimodal HGR methods. The TsdFusion effectively recognizes dynamic gestures, facilitating promising HGR-based interaction for prostheses or assistance robotics.},

  abstract     = {This study introduces a novel continual learning algorithm that incrementally improves the performance of deep-learning-based walking speed estimators during level-ground walking with a powered knee-ankle prosthesis. While user-dependent (DEP) estimators generally outperform user-independent (IND) estimators, they require the pre-collection of DEP training data. In contrast, our real-time algorithm adapts IND estimators to self-labeled DEP data generated during walking, eliminating the need for pre-collected datasets. The algorithm also features a biomimetic scaling mechanism that adjusts prosthetic assistance based on speed estimates. We evaluated our algorithm on novel subjects (N=10) with unilateral above-knee amputations during treadmill and overground walking. For treadmill trials, when adapted with estimated and ground truth labels, estimators achieved mean absolute errors (MAEs) of 0.074 [0.023] (mean, [standard deviation]) and 0.074 [0.018] m/s, respectively, reflecting a significant 28% (p ¡ 0.05) reduction in MAE compared to non-adapted estimators. For overground trials, treadmill-adapted estimators demonstrated a significant 18% (p ¡ 0.05) reduction in MAE compared to non-adapted estimators. Our algorithm significantly reduced speed estimation errors within one minute of walking and delivered biomimetic assistance (r ${=}0.91$ ) across speeds. This approach allows off-the-shelf powered prostheses to seamlessly adapt to new users, delivering biomimetic assistance through precise, real-time walking speed estimation.},

To date, ankle exoskeleton designs have either placed the motors on the shanks (direct or quasi-direct drive) or around the waist with Bowden cable transmissions. The former offers better transmission efficiency, while the latter reduces added mass biomechanical penalty. The biomechanical effects of motor placement may be magnified for individuals with CP due to weakened lower limb strength. To date, no study has compared how motor placement alters the biomechanical responses and user perceptions of individuals with or without gait impairment (e.g., CP). In this study involving 7 individuals with CP and 9 unimpaired individuals, we compared their metabolic cost of transport, lower limb muscle activities, and user perceptions when using ankle exoskeletons with either waist-mounted motors (and Bowden cables) or shank-mounted motors that were otherwise identical. Despite changes in lower leg muscle recruitment, results showed no statistical differences in the metabolic cost of transport. Shank-mounted motors were preferred by more participants in both cohorts (e.g., 6/7 in CP). These results help inform the ergonomics and mechanical designs of ankle exoskeletons and how they may be perceived.},

This paper presents a comfort-centered mechatronics design of portable hip exoskeletons, comprising of three factors: (i) actuation, (ii) wearable interface, (iii) and assistive controller. We introduced an analytical multibody model to predict the human-exoskeleton contact forces during gait. Informed by this model, we designed a wearable interface that significantly improved the three considered objective metrics: (i) undesired contact forces at the wearable interface, (ii) wobbling, and (iii) metabolic reduction, and also the post-test evaluation via a System Usability Scale questionnaire as a subjective metric. Our experiments with two exoskeleton controllers (gait-based and reinforcement learning-based) demonstrated that the design of the wearable physical interface has a greater impact on reducing metabolic rate and minimizing wobbling than the choice of controller. Our actuation design method leads to highly backdrivable, lightweight quasi-direct drive actuators with high torque tracking performance. By leveraging this wearable design, we achieved up to 60% reduction in undesired contact forces, and a 74% reduction in exoskeleton wobbling in the frontal axis compared to a traditional configuration. Additionally, the net metabolic cost reduction was 18% compared to the no exoskeleton condition.},

Functional Electrical Stimulation (FES) has emerged as a promising intervention, utilizing electrical pulses to stimulate muscles and thereby restore impaired motor functions. However, existing closed-loop FES systems depend on pre-calibrated angles or forces specific to individual objects, which limits their practicality in dynamic, real-world environments with varying object properties.This paper presents a novel closed-loop FES (CLFES) system with visual feedback, designed to dynamically adjust stimulation parameters based on real-time interaction states without requiring object-specific calibration. The system employs a finite state machine to manage sequential grasp-release tasks and integrates a visual perception module for slip detection and intent recognition. The system was tested with two individuals with disabilities on five common household objects. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements, including a 42.6% increase in success rate and a 45.9% reduction in task completion time compared to tasks performed without the system. These results underscore the system’s potential to improve daily task performance for individuals with neural impairments.},

To assist balance recovery during a slip, a detection algorithm that can work with an assistive device, such as an exoskeleton, needs to be able to detect slips rapidly after onset, which remains a critical gap in the field. Here, we compared the ability of linear discriminant analysis (LDA), extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), and convolutional neural networks (CNN) to detect slip using only native sensors on a hip exoskeleton. We trained and evaluated user-independent models on early-stance (ES) and late-stance (LS) slips of various magnitudes collected through treadmill-based slips. All models, except LDA with LS slips, detected slips with ¿90% accuracy. Overall, the best model was XGBoost, with its fastest results achieving average detection times and median accuracies of 155.06 ms at 96.25% for ES slips and 228.88 ms at 93.75% for LS slips, while also achieving 100% sensitivity at 195.64 ms (ES) and 266.24 ms (LS).

  abstract     = {In this study, we propose a robust myoelectric intention recognition framework to recognize human locomotion mode and detect irrelevant locomotion intention. The framework is integrated into the control system of the lower limb exoskeleton robot for experimental validation. Most conventional electromyography (EMG) intention detection methods aim to accurately detect the target motion intentions but ignore the possible effects of irrelevant intentions. In traditional action intention recognition strategies, most researchers did not consider entering irrelevant action intentions into the model during training. Therefore, when using a classification model, if irrelevant action intentions are input, the model will still recognize it as a type of target action intention. That can lead to incorrect recognition results, which will cause the robot to perform wrong movements and pose a safety risk to the wearer. To detect and reject irrelevant motion intentions, we first used the dual-purpose autoencoder-guided temporal convolution network (DA-TCN) to obtain discriminative features of the surface EMG signal. Autoencoders (AE)/Variable Autoencoders (VAE) are then trained for each of the seven deep features of the target motion intention. In addition, irrelevant motion intentions are detected according to the value of their reconstruction error. The recall rate of this method for the detection of irrelevant motion intentions exceeds 99% and the accuracy rate exceeds 99%.At the same time, we replaced the TCN with the LSTM model and compared the performance of the two after adding irrelevant motion discrimination. We collected data on seven goals and three unrelated motor intentions from seven experimenters for testing and completed an online experimental validation. The motion recognition accuracy of all the experimenters can be maintained above 86%.},

Robots can enhance therapy by systematically delivering support in gait training, but often use one-size-fits-all control methods, which can be suboptimal. Here, we describe a model-based optimisation method for designing and fine-tuning personalised robotic controllers. As a case study, we formulate the objective of providing assistance as needed as an optimisation problem, and we demonstrate how musculoskeletal modelling can be used to develop personalised interventions. Eighteen healthy participants (age $ = 26~\pm ~4$ ) were recruited and the personalised control parameters for each were obtained to provide assistance as needed during a unilateral tracking task. A comparison was carried out between the personalised controller and the non-personalised controller. In simulation, a significant improvement was predicted when the personalised parameters were used. Experimentally, responses varied: six subjects showed significant improvements with the personalised parameters, eight subjects showed no obvious change, while four subjects performed worse. High interpersonal and intra-personal variability was observed with both controllers. This study highlights the importance of personalised control in robot-assisted gait training, and the need for a better estimation of human-robot interaction and human behaviour to realise the benefits of model-based optimisation.},

  abstract     = {Electroencephalography (EEG) based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) offer a promising way for individuals with motor impairments to control prosthetic or rehabilitation devices. Accurately decoding movement intention (MI) is crucial for translating subjects’ motor execution plans into action. Common challenges in EEG-based BCIs include performance discrepancies, often requiring frequent recalibration of decoding algorithms. The objective of this study was enhancing BCI decoding performance of upper-limb MI identification by exploiting both machine and subjects’ learning and maintaining stable decoding algorithms. Significant performance improvements were observed across most subjects from the first to the last session of the experiment. Some subjects also demonstrated stable performance without requiring any model recalibration between sessions. All subjects achieved high efficacy in online decoding of movement intention, as reflected in improvement of the F1 score from $0.58\pm 0.26$ in the first session, to $0.84\pm 0.13$ in the final session. We emphasize the critical importance of allowing users sufficient time to improve their performance in BCIs for upper-limb MI decoding. Unlike existing studies, we specifically evaluate the effect of stable decoding strategies in online and longitudinal BCI sessions, which are key to achieving more reliable and effective BCIs.},

The proposed device conforms to the nonlinear behavior of the tibiofemoral contact force during squat motions, by means of patient-custom cams. Using pneumatic cylinders as springs, the unloading assistance provided by the brace is tailored to the patient’s pathology and adjusted during the rehabilitation process. To assess the performance of our orthosis, various tests are conducted to evaluate its efficiency in terms of tibiofemoral contact load reduction. For this purpose, a robotic test-bench, equipped with a robotic arm, emulates upper leg motion under applied forces (hybrid force-motion control). A pseudo-leg is attached to the robot end-effector, and the orthosis is mounted onto it. The test bench is instrumented with two six degrees of freedom force-torque sensors. Using these force sensors as ground truth, tibiofemoral contact force measurements are obtained with and without our orthosis and compared. A pair of cams is fabricated based on data from a patient whose information is retrieved from the Orthoload database. Experimental results demonstrate a contact force reduction of up to 100% within the force range corresponding to the robot’s maximum capacity.},

  abstract     = {Exoskeletons used for rehabilitation must operate together with the patient to adapt to the biomechanical-inspired movements of the regular human gait cycle rather than operate by following a predefined trajectory without considering the human-robot interaction effects. This work presents the assessment of a lower limb exoskeleton whose motion is performed according to a collaborative approach given the movements of the human user and the relative force concerning the exoskeleton structure. The Opensim™ software serves to define the force and position reference trajectories to follow during the gait cycle, which serves as a reference for the hybrid control. These forces and movements are compared to the results of a virtual model that considers the interaction between the user and the exoskeleton in two possible scenarios. The first scenario contemplates the implementation of a position controller to generate interaction-independent movement of the exoskeleton. The second scenario considers the force exerted by the exoskeleton on the patient to trigger a force-based controller after trespassing a predefined value. This leads to a hybrid control scheme, which considers the position restrictions in the closed-loop feedback control strategy. Using this approach, the exoskeleton can collaborate actively with the user and provide motion as required, responding to position-controlled motion if the user is not opposed to the exoskeleton motion. This novel strategy permits the evaluation of a hybrid position-force controller for wearing the active orthosis. Numeric simulations show the performance of the proposed system. These outcomes confirm the supposed advantages of the proposed controller.},

An autonomous robotic deformable tissue retraction system has the potential to help surgeons reduce cognitive burdens and focus more on critical aspects of the surgery. However, the uncertain deformation and complex constraints of deformable tissues pose significant challenges. We propose an autonomous deformable tissue retraction framework that incorporates visual representation and learning models, along with a 7-degree-of-freedom robotic system. For extracting deformation representations and learning to manipulate deformable tissues based on 2D images, we introduce a Sequential-information-based Contrastive State Representation Learning (SC-SRL) algorithm and a reinforcement learning model with asymmetric inputs and auxiliary losses. Experimental results show that the proposed framework achieved a 93.0% success rate of tissue retraction task in a simulated environment. Furthermore, our method demonstrates a safe retraction trajectory proportion of 92.5% based on a novel evaluation method using the histogram of feature angles of the tissue particles. The proposed framework can also be deployed on a real robotic system through a sim-to-real transfer pipeline, acquire policies for nearby tasks and perform resistance to visual dynamic disturbance. This study paves a new path for the application of vision-based intelligent systems in surgical robotics.},

Whereas most RAS systems are directly controlled by surgeons, the development and application of autonomous RAS are growing owing to their repeatability and precision. Although full autonomy is a long-term goal, human intervention in RAS is still essential. In this work, we develop and test a shared control strategy for robotic electrosurgery in which autonomous robot controllers and human operators collaborate. We designed and implemented identification tests that assessed the effectiveness of autonomous and manual control strategies and the cost of switching between the control modes. Based on the results, we propose a control mode switching strategy and examine it via an experiment on precision cutting on porcine tongue samples. The results indicate that by combining the best elements of autonomous and manual control, we can achieve more accurate soft-tissue incisions as compared to single-mode control strategies. Furthermore, the proposed strategy reduces the required human-in-the-loop time by 69.29%.},

  abstract     = {The advent of robotic surgery has brought about a paradigm shift in the medical field, necessitating the development of corresponding surgical skills training and assessment methods. These methods aim to enable surgeons to acquire the requisite skills for robotic surgery in the most efficient manner. Despite the progression from a master-apprentice system to manual objective assessment and then automated performance assessment methods, certain limitations have been observed. Our research aims to address these limitations by exploring muscle activity and state information during training via surface electromyography (sEMG) signals. This approach is intended to eventually provide interpretable information that can enhance the trainee’s understanding of assessment feedback and facilitate skill improvement. Building on our first study that validated the feasibility of motion primitive recognition based on sEMG signals, this work compares the performance of various machine learning (ML) methods for motion primitive recognition. It also investigates the effect of different parameters of the sliding window on recognition accuracy. Our findings indicate that the deep neural network (DNN) when paired with optimal sliding window parameters, can achieve the best average accuracy of 61.76% in this study. The discoveries also provide a reference of parameter settings for variable-length sliding window approach and ML methods in recognition of robotic surgery motion based on sEMG data. By demonstrating the feasibility and exploring the most effective analysis method, this work lays down the first stone to address the research topic of integrating muscle information into multimodal surgical skill training and assessment.},

To address these challenges, a significant research interest is growing in automating these manual procedures. Continuum robots represent a promising approach, thanks to their ability to navigate confined spaces. However, their nonlinear behavior presents challenges in modeling and control. In this study, we developed a robust position control method for a variable-length tendon-driven continuum robot. We designed a control system that effectively tracks the desired target positions by employing a constant curvature model and a Jacobian-based control algorithm with real-time position feedback. We assessed the stability of our system through Lyapunov analysis, demonstrating reliable convergence to these target positions. Experimental validation conducted in a cardiovascular phantom demonstrated significant improvements with respect to the state of the art. Our method achieved a trajectory following error of approximately 2.43 mm [1.63, 3.23] and a target position error of about 1.92 mm [1.73, 3.13]. Moreover, the computation time per trajectory point was reduced to approximately 0.04 seconds, highlighting enhanced computational efficiency. These results showcase improved accuracy and efficiency in minimally invasive mitral valve repair procedures.},

However, surgeons require advanced techniques, and several studies have evaluated surgical skills through motion measurements to improve skill proficiency. However, existing measurement systems have a low tolerance for occlusion and are difficult to use in operating rooms with many obstacles. Therefore, a hybrid measurement system was developed for laparoscopic surgery. This system consists of an inertial measurement unit (IMU), a distance sensor, and an optical motion capture (MoCap). When MoCap data are unavailable, surgical instrument motion is calculated using the IMU and distance sensor data, and when it is available, the IMU drift is corrected using MoCap data. The MoCap markers were arranged individually, thus facilitating the measurement of multiple instruments simultaneously. The validation experiment in the wet-lab training confirmed that the error was smaller than that measured using MoCap alone, and the subjects expressed that the subjective disturbance caused by the sensors was very small during the procedure. The measurement experiment was conducted in cadaver surgical training, and 15 cases of nephrectomy were successfully recorded. This system facilitated highly accurate measurements during practical surgical training and surgical skills analysis.},

The proposed 4-DOF mechanism employs parallelogram motion replication to relocate the bulky instrument insertion drive from the end-effector to the proximal linkage on the base, minimizing obstruction to the microscope’s field of view and the surgical environment. The mechanism’s orthogonal or coincident arranged degrees of freedom, paired with independent drive units, facilitate calibration and enhance control accuracy. A minimized internal constraint force optimization method was proposed to improve RCM point stability and tip positioning accuracy. The mechanism’s configuration and parameters were optimized through an analytical mechanics model, effectively reducing the constraint force on the internal components under the same external loads, thereby minimizing deformation and maintaining accuracy. To enhance robot compatibility, modular surgical instruments with a quick-change coupler were developed based on the analysis of traditional instruments’ characteristics. The prototype was built and kinematically calibrated to reduce manufacturing and assembly errors and thus improve accuracy. Following kinematic calibration to minimize manufacturing and assembly errors, experimental validation revealed positioning accuracies of $49~\pm ~23~\mu $ m and $22~\pm ~13~\mu $ m, repeatabilities of $25~\pm ~10~\mu $ m and $9~\pm ~4~\mu $ m, and RCM deviations of $13~\pm ~10~\mu $ m and $18~\pm ~11~\mu $ m on the X-Z and Y-Z planes, respectively.

In this navigation-operation dual-robot collaborative robotic system for orthopedic surgery (NOR2CORS), a comprehensive range of functions are realized, including CT image segmentation, path planning, intraoperative operation, and active navigation. In this paper, pedicle screw placement is adopted as an example to assess the effectiveness and performance of the NOR2CORS. An assessment criterion is also proposed to assess the accuracy of pedicle screw placement based on the widely-used Gertzbein and Robbins classification. Experiments are conducted on a human spine model (24 pedicles) and ex-vivo porcine spine (10 pedicles). According to the proposed assessment criterion, 96% pedicles on human spine model can be classified as grade A and 4% grade B, with 67% of them as grade A2 and above. In the ex-vivo porcine spine experiment, all pedicle screw placements can be classified as grade A, with 80% of them as grade A2 and above. In the surgical process, all positioning targets can be observed without any interruption in navigation. These results demonstrated the efficiency and accuracy of the NOR2CORS.},

  abstract     = {Tissue retraction, one of the basic steps in orthopedic surgery, is related to the smooth entry of surgical instruments into the surgical area and provides a clear surgical perspective for surgeons. This work introduces the first robot-assisted retraction system (RARS) specifically designed for orthopedic surgery. The RARS allows surgeons to set a safe retraction force and roughly set the posture of the retraction device at the beginning. To ensure that the RARS automatically completes the task in a safe manner, we propose a safety control framework that employs iterative enhanced control based on interaction model to handle the retraction interaction problem, and avoids interference with the operation of surgeons through null-space optimization. First, we performed a performance test of the RARS on a phantom model, and the results showed that the maximum tracking error of the retraction force was 0.51N, demonstrating satisfactory tracking performance. Second, we validated the effectiveness of null-space optimization by observing the evolution of joint positions. Finally, we conducted experiments on in-vivo animal and the results showed that the proposed RARS exhibited superior performance in safe retraction force tracking accuracy and tissue damage compared to traditional manual retractions.},

  abstract     = {In natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES), the twist steering of the flexible endoscope plays an important role in tracking the preoperative path during cavity intervention. However, the flexible endoscope’s twisting motion has high nonlinearity and uncertainty, which bring challenges for accurate modeling and controller design. In this study, a novel active modeling-based improved control (AMIC) scheme is proposed, which achieves precise control of the robotic flexible endoscope’s twisting motion. First, the Coleman-Hodgdon (C-H) model is modified to serve as the reference model to describe the twist steering. Then, the model error in the C-H model is introduced as an extended state. Upon this, an active modeling algorithm is developed by using the unscented Kalman filter. The proposed model estimates both the twisting angle and the model error in real time. Based on the proposed model, the AMIC strategy is developed to enhance the tracking performance of a proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller for a reference trajectory. Finally, comparative experiments were conducted on a self-built robotic flexible endoscope under various insertion depths and tip-part configurations. Compared to the PID controller, the experimental results demonstrate that the proposed AMIC scheme achieves a 63.1% reduction in tracking error under a sinusoidal trajectory.},

  abstract     = {The nasopharyngeal (NP) swab test is a method for collecting cultures to diagnose for different types of respiratory illnesses, including COVID-19. Delegating this task to robots would be beneficial in terms of reducing infection risks and bolstering the healthcare system, but a critical component of the NP swab test is having the swab aligned properly with the nasal cavity so that it does not cause excessive discomfort or injury by traveling down the wrong passage. Existing research towards robotic NP swabbing typically assumes the patient’s head is held within a fixture. This simplifies the alignment problem, but is also dissimilar to clinical scenarios where patients are typically free-standing. Consequently, our work creates a vision-guided pipeline to allow an instrumented robot arm to properly position and orient NP swabs with respect to the nostrils of free-standing patients. The first component of the pipeline is a precomputed joint lookup table to allow the arm to meet the patient’s arbitrary position in the designated workspace, while avoiding joint limits. Our pipeline leverages semantic face models from computer vision to estimate the Euclidean pose of the face with respect to a monocular RGB-D camera placed on the end-effector. These estimates are passed into an unscented Kalman filter on manifolds state estimator and a pose based visual servo control loop to move the swab to the designated pose in front of the nostril. Our pipeline was validated with human trials, featuring a cohort of 25 participants. The system is effective, reaching the nostril for 84% of participants, and our statistical analysis did not find significant demographic biases within the cohort.},

  abstract     = {Tube thoracostomy (chest tube insertion) is a surgical procedure that treats pneumothorax, a potentially life-threatening condition where air accumulates between the chest wall and the lungs. The literature reports high complication rates for this procedure, including accidental fatality due to poor manual depth control during tool insertion. We hypothesize that an instrumented needle-holder could help operators recognize pleural puncture and improve depth control, and we present a puncture-detection experiment that contributes toward this goal. An operator manually inserted a bevel-tip needle into ex vivo porcine ribs and through the parietal pleura via a sensorized percutaneous device that records position, force, and videos. We use this rich dataset of 63 insertions to thoroughly test four previously published data-driven puncture-detection (DDPD) algorithms against two new real-time algorithms: a custom recursive digital filter with coefficients optimized for our application, and a difference equation that compares standard deviations between adjacent sliding windows. Our algorithms achieve a precision (true positives over total identified punctures) of 23% and 22%, respectively, while the precision of existing DDPD algorithms ranges from 0% to 21%. Despite these performance improvements, our results show the limitations of DDPD algorithms and motivate new methods for detecting pleural membrane punctures in thoracostomy.},

The adoption of robotic technology offers the potential to bring intra-operative radiation exposure down to a minimum, or even eliminate it. Non-ionizing approaches, such as Intravascular Ultrasound (IVUS), are progressively explored as standalone or fluoroscopy-adjunct techniques for 3D vasculature reconstruction. We have previously demonstrated the feasibility of real-time 3D Main Vessel (MV) modeling from the fusion of IVUS and EM pose data obtained from sensors embedded at the tip of a robotic catheter. This paper proposes to advance MV modeling towards a comprehensive radiation-free 3D guidance framework by means of intra-operative Side Branch (SB) detection and modeling. Two models are proposed to approximate the geometry of SB vessel ostia: a sphere and a cylinder. An Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) recursively estimates the state of these models considering the MV model, while the catheters navigates through the vessel. In silico and in vitro validation results show the potential clinical value of the proposed strategy for facilitating safer robotic catheter steering.},

  abstract     = {For many decades, developments of knee prostheses have shown a dichotomy regarding fundamental working principles. The industry has mainly emphasized on quasi-passive hydraulic solutions, whereas most research works have focused on powered devices, employing electric actuation. The former have an energetically passive effect at the knee joint, for which they often lack in providing versatility and movement robustness for the wearer. Powered prostheses can address these deficiencies, but are often rejected as they struggle to fulfill other user needs (e.g., weight and acoustic noise). Correspondingly, recent studies have emerged that attempt to significantly attenuate the deficiencies of fully powered prosthesis knees, partially sacrificing on device versatility. Recognizing the state-of-the art difficulties in balancing active assistance and user needs fulfilment, this work analyses human-centered design perspectives and their prospects for prosthetic development, in light of the often diverging user needs. We conclude that various types of both explored and yet unexplored semi-powered solutions may have the potential to provide the better trade-off between quasi-passive and fully powered prosthetic devices.},

The 7 DoF robotic system allows for translation, rotation, and bending of the bronchoscope; delivery and bending of the catheter; delivery and control of biopsy tools; as well as stiffness adjustment of the catheter, which adapts to the dynamic pulmonary environment to provide stable support during tissue sampling. Key contributions include the robotic platform integrated with the variable-stiffness catheter and the implementation of a novel three-stage procedure for tissue sampling. The robotic system has been thoroughly evaluated through a series of tests, including the system accuracy, characterization of the variable-stiffness catheter’s flexibility, force exertion, safety during operation, temperature control, and in-vivo experiment. The results demonstrated the system’s feasibility and effectiveness, with metrics such as safe force limits, system flexibility, and positioning accuracy, showing its potential to improve the accuracy and safety of traditional bronchoscopy procedures.},

  abstract     = {Laryngectomy, a surgical intervention for laryngeal cancer, effectively treats the condition but results in the loss of natural speech. Voice restoration post-laryngectomy typically involves manual control, limiting patients’ ability to multitask while speaking. Surface electromyography (sEMG) offers a hands-free alternative for controlling artificial voice systems. However, challenges arise from daily, orofacial activities like chewing or coughing, activating the same muscles used for sEMG control, potentially causing false triggers. To address this, we perform a detailed analysis of facial and neck muscles during speech and non-speech activities to identify potential false triggers for sEMG-controlled artificial voice systems. We propose a five-step algorithm to prepare noisy sEMG data for analysis and to detect accurate speech onset and termination times within the muscle activity. A two-stage classification approach is suggested to effectively distinguish speech from non-speech activities. The classifier in the first stage detects the presence of any activity versus non-activity with an F1-score of 95.8%, while the classifier in the second stage recognizes speech among other activities with an F1-score of 96.3%. This research marks a significant advancement in differentiating speech from other daily activities, thereby minimizing false triggers in sEMG-controlled artificial voice systems.},

Geometrically varying stiffness profiles provide additional design freedom to influence the motions and workspaces of continuum robots. These results are timely, because with recent rapid advancements in multimaterial additive manufacturing techniques, it is now straightforward to create more complex stiffness profiles in robots. The key insight of this paper is to project forces and moments applied to the robot onto its center of stiffness (i.e., the Young’s modulus-weighted center of each cross section). We show how the center of stiffness can be thought of as analogous to a “precurved backbone” in a robot with uniform stiffness. This analogy enables a large body of prior work in Cosserat Rod modeling of such robots to be applied directly to those with stiffness variations. We experimentally validate this approach using multimaterial, soft, tendon-actuated robots. Lastly, to illustrate how these results can be used in practice, we investigate how stiffness variation can improve performance in a neurosurgical task.},

However, there is still a lack of comprehensive solutions to handle hysteresis, creep, input delay, and other inherent characteristics of PAMs, as well as synchronous control and obstacle avoidance that are important to multiple muscles working together. To this end, this paper proposes a new neuroadaptive synchronization controller for 3-D antagonistic PAM-actuated robot hands, which also elaborately designs auxiliary terms to realize obstacle avoidance in Cartesian space and motion constraints in joint space together. Here, dynamic obstacles are regarded as external independent objects, whose nonlinear dynamics are introduced into the proposed controller to restrict end-effectors. Meanwhile, the constraint terms of joint angles and angle velocities are designed as time-varying proportional-differential gains, instead of common barrier functions that may induce overlarge inputs. Particularly, this paper proposes an accelerated gradient-based learning term to relax the linear parameterization condition of uncertain/unmodeled dynamics and obtain accurate weight estimates, based on which, it is proven that both tracking errors and synchronous errors rapidly converge to zero. In addition to complete theoretical analysis, some hardware experiments also verify the effectiveness and adaptability of the proposed controller.},

  abstract     = {Myoelectric control models enabling accurate hand gesture recognition via electromyography (EMG) have attracted increasing attentions in rehabilitation robotics. Adapting pre-trained models to new users is a main challenge in real world applications due to the inter-user different EMG characteristics. Most previous transfer learning approaches employed a rigid model calibration process, usually in a supervised manner with ground truth labels, or in an unsupervised manner but still requiring users to perform pre-defined hand gestures to update model parameters. We argue that such a rigid model calibration process lacks flexibility and limit the translation of myoelectric control into real world practice. In this work, we gradually “flexibilize” the standard model calibration process toward a highly flexible version, which does not require the labels of calibration data, and can be performed on only a subset of pre-defined hand gestures or even unknown user-defined hand gestures. We identify those key components contributing to the performance difference along the way. Compared with the supervised method, the unsupervised model calibration even contributed to a 10% improvement ( ${p}\lt 0.05$ ) in case where only a subset of gesture categories were available for model calibration. Moreover, the unsupervised model calibration achieved a highest recognition accuracy of 86.57% using unknown user-defined gestures, with no significant difference compared to the accuracy with pre-defined gestures ( ${p}\gt 0.05$ ).},

  abstract     = {This paper proposes an underactuated hand exoskeleton designed to assist in recovering lost grasp function. Structurally, the design incorporates a multi-link coupling mechanism driven by a single motor equipped with a series elastic actuator (SEA). The SEA enables bidirectional compliant drive and fore feedback without the need for a force sensor. The connecting rod is optimized to facilitate the natural flexion and extension of the fingers. For control, an admittance control strategy based on real-time fusion of electromyography (EMG) and electroencephalogram (EEG) signals is proposed. EMG signals are used to estimate muscle strength and control the movement of the exoskeleton. EEG signals reflect the active intention of the subjects, and admittance control adjusts the rehabilitation strategy in real-time. For the first time, the degree of concentration is used as a parameter for subject adjustment of rehabilitation training. Finally, experiments on stiffness calibration, muscle force estimation, and admittance control based on EEG-EMG fusion were conducted. The results indicate that the normalized root-mean-square-error (NRMSE) of stiffness calibration is 8.32%. The average inconsistence of concentration and joint torque (ICJT) is 73.18%. The experimental results indicate that the proposed method can enhance the subjective participation of the subjects in the rehabilitation process, thereby improving the overall rehabilitation outcomes.},

  abstract     = {Decoding human movements using electromyography (EMG) signals is important for the development of EMG-based human-machine interfaces (HMIs). This study proposed a novel muscle synergy-based musculoskeletal model (MM) for prediction of hand and wrist movements, including wrist flexion/extension, wrist adduction/abduction, wrist pronation/supination, and metacarpophalangeal (MCP) flexion/extension. Ten limb-intact subjects were recruited for the offline experiment, and 15-channel EMG signals from the subject’s forearm were recorded. Using the non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) algorithm, four pairs of excitation signals were extracted from the multi-channel EMG signals. Then the MM driven by the extracted muscle excitations was adopted to predict hand and wrist movements. The proposed method was compared with the NMF algorithm and artificial neural network (ANN), and the prediction performance of the three was evaluated with Pearson’s correlation coefficient (r) and normalized root mean square error (NRMSE). The total average r of the proposed MM was 0.8475 across all subjects and all movement types, approximately 0.123 higher than NMF algorithm and 0.106 higher than ANN. In addition, the total average NRMSE of the proposed MM was 0.16125 across all subjects and all movement types, approximately 0.074 lower than NMF algorithm and 0.037 lower than ANN. In brief, the proposed MM showed significantly improved prediction accuracy over the NMF algorithm and ANN. This study provides a promising approach for the control of robotic arms and prostheses in EMG-based HMIs.},

  abstract     = {KineticoMyoGraphy (KMG) is an emerging sensor technology offering innovative solutions for tracking amputees’ fine muscle movements, promising better hand gesture recognition with greater sustainability than existing methods. The primary challenge in KMG technology lies in the required number and placement of magnetic sensors to balance accuracy, sustainability, and cost-efficiency for practical hand gesture interpretation. To tackle this issue, we propose a Stochastic Sequential Strategy for Magnetic Sensory Selection (S3MSS). We apply this strategy to a configuration of 16 magnetic sensors surrounding surgically implanted magnets in a patient’s forearm. The method uses an Error-Correcting Output Codes (ECOC) framework with Multiclass Linear Discriminant Analysis (MCLDA) and Multiclass Support Vector Machines (MCSVM). Our approach emphasizes robust sensory selection and consistent performance through time-based seeding and K-fold cross-validation. Clinical results indicate consistency in sensory selection across two independent trials, underlining this factor as crucial for reliability. Statistical significance test confirms the superiority of the MCLDA over the MCSVM approach, achieving a 93% accuracy in the classification of Fingers, Wrist, and Thumb gestures using only five sensors near the magnets’ motion range. This underscores our strategy’s effectiveness in accurately detecting hand movements, highlighting its potential for clinical application and improving amputees’ quality of life.},

Here, we demonstrated an enhanced version of a soft inflatable robot that assists the shoulder against gravity, previously tested with different neurological conditions. Noteworthy improvements include a single-layer actuator, simplifying manufacturing, a built-in bending angle and a nylon hammock, for better armpit conformity. We characterized the actuator (approximately $8 Nm$ at 90° at $70 kPa$ ) and demonstrated its good transparency, both from a kinematic and a muscular standpoint. Then, on 11 healthy individuals, we showed reductions in shoulder muscle activity (both at the anterior and middle deltoid) while performing a lift and hold task, ranging from 16% to almost 60% of the maximum voluntary contraction. More importantly, we confirmed these effects on two SCI individuals SCI, at two different stages of recovery. While preliminary, considering the limited exploration of soft wearable robots for the shoulder in SCI cases, this is a significant advancement playing an important role in the development of future soft technology for SCI assistance.},

  abstract     = {Robotic exoskeletons are being increasingly used in clinics for the treatment of medicable disabilities. These exoskeletons, which closely couple with patients’ limbs, need to move in harmony with the endoskeleton motions. To achieve coordination, exoskeletons should be transparent; in other words, they should not interfere with natural human motion or their underlying coordination strategies. Transparency can be achieved through a bio-inspired exoskeleton design and also by implementing appropriate force control methods to maneuver exoskeleton motions. A new hybrid active-passive Gait Exoskeleton-Assisted Rehabilitation (GEAR) robot is presented here for the rehabilitation of lower limb disabilities. The GEAR robot is designed to enhance transparency incorporating a flexible hip joint and a biomimetic knee joint. The proposed GEAR robot also integrates a Remote Centered Motion (RCM) based passive mechanism to support torso and pelvic motions in two planes and features actuated exoskeleton legs in the sagittal plane for treadmill-assisted walking. The exoskeleton legs are actuated at their hip and knee joints using backdrivable actuators. To provide a natural walking experience, the hip joints of the exoskeleton legs offer two passive degrees of freedom in the frontal and transverse planes in addition to the actuated sagittal plane motion. The biomimetic design of the exoskeleton knee joint ensures alignment with the human anatomical knee joint by closely tracking the latter’s instantaneous center of rotation (ICR). To evaluate GEAR robot’s transparency, a comparative study was conducted, involving three healthy subjects. The participants walked freely on a treadmill and then with the GEAR robot operated first in a completely backdrivable (i.e., passive) mode and subsequently in an active mode. The sEMG data collected during these experiments were analyzed to assess robot’s transparency.},

However, very few of these robots are capable of actively engaging with humans and undertaking physical manipulation tasks. This limitation is largely attributed to the absence of tools that can realistically simulate physical interactions, especially the contact mechanisms between a robotic gripper and a human body. In this study, we aim to address key limitations in current developments towards robotic casualty manipulation. Firstly, we present an integrative simulation framework for casualty manipulation. We adapt a finite element method (FEM) tool into the grasping and manipulation scenario, and the developed framework can provide accurate biomechanical reactions resulting from manipulation. Secondly, we conduct a detailed assessment of grasping stability during casualty grasping and manipulation simulations. To validate the necessity and superior performance of the proposed high-fidelity simulation framework, we conducted a qualitative and quantitative comparison of grasping stability analyses between the proposed framework and the state-of-the-art multi-body physics simulations. Through these efforts, we have taken the first step towards a feasible solution for robotic casualty manipulation.},

  abstract     = {Surgical workflow anticipation is the task of predicting the timing of relevant surgical events from live video data, which is critical in Robotic-Assisted Surgery (RAS). Accurate predictions require the use of spatial information to model surgical interactions. However, current methods focus solely on surgical instruments, assume static interactions between instruments, and only anticipate surgical events within a fixed time horizon. To address these challenges, we propose an adaptive graph learning framework for surgical workflow anticipation based on a novel spatial representation, featuring three key innovations. First, we introduce a new representation of spatial information based on bounding boxes of surgical instruments and targets, including their detection confidence levels. These are trained on additional annotations we provide for two benchmark datasets. Second, we design an adaptive graph learning method to capture dynamic interactions. Third, we develop a multi-horizon objective that balances learning objectives for different time horizons, allowing for unconstrained predictions. Evaluations on two benchmarks reveal superior performance in short-to-mid-term anticipation, with an error reduction of approximately 3% for surgical phase anticipation and 9% for remaining surgical duration anticipation. These performance improvements demonstrate the effectiveness of our method and highlight its potential for enhancing preparation and coordination within the RAS team. This can improve surgical safety and the efficiency of operating room usage.},

  abstract     = {In robot-assisted minimally invasive surgery (RMIS), the smoke generated by energy-based surgical instruments blurs and obstructs the endoscopic surgical field, which increases the difficulty and risk of robotic surgery. However, current desmoking research primarily focuses on natural weather conditions, with limited studies addressing desmoking techniques for endoscopic images. Furthermore, surgical smoke presents a notably intricate morphology, and research efforts aimed at uniform, non-uniform, thin, and dense smoke remain relatively limited. This work proposes a Local-Global U-Shaped Transformer Model (LGUformer) based on the U-Net and Transformer architectures to remove complex smoke from endoscopic images. By introducing a local-global multi-head self-attention mechanism and multi-scale depthwise convolution, the proposed model enhances the inference capability. An enhanced feature map fusion method improves the quality of reconstructed images. The improved modules enable efficient handling of variable smoke while generating superior-quality images. Through desmoking experiments on synthetic and real smoke images, the LGUformer model demonstrated superior performance compared with seven other desmoking models in terms of accuracy, clarity, absence of distortion, and robustness. A task-based surgical instrument segmentation experiment indicated the potential of this model as a pre-processing step in visual tasks. Finally, an ablation study was conducted to verify the advantages of the proposed modules.},

  abstract     = {This paper addresses the problem of reconstructing textured colon surface maps using a sequence of monocular colonoscopic images together with a 3D colon mesh model that has been segmented in CT colonography. The problem is formulated as a direct bundle adjustment (BA) problem which simultaneously optimizes all camera poses and the intensity of vertices on the pre-operative mesh model. This optimization is achieved by maximizing photometric consistency among multiple views of 2D images and the pre-operative 3D mesh model. The key properties of our proposed direct BA formulation involve eliminating the need for reference image specification, data association (feature extraction and matching), and image depth information. Thus, the proposed method is particularly suitable for scenarios where distinct features and image depth are not available, such as 2D colonoscopic images. Furthermore, we have proven that solving the proposed direct BA using the Gauss-Newton (GN) algorithm has the merit of optimizing camera poses only, which is equivalent to optimizing camera poses and the intensities of 3D vertices on the mesh together. Thus, a direct camera-only BA algorithm is proposed and used for 3D textured colon reconstruction from textureless 2D colonoscopic images. Validations using simulation, phantom, and in-vivo datasets are performed to demonstrate the accuracy and feasibility of the proposed algorithm.},

  abstract     = {Cardiovascular diseases, driven by pollution and unhealthy lifestyle factors, are commonly treated with cardiac catheterization. However, this exposes medical staff to harmful X-ray radiation, leading to the development of robot-assisted catheterization systems for safer procedures. Despite their advantages, existing robotic systems are frequently complex and struggle with catheter maneuverability without a guidewire. This paper introduces a novel two-degree-of-freedom robot-assisted cardiac catheterization system, detailing its development, evaluation, and mathematical modeling. The system is designed for precise control of catheter motion through both translational and rotational movements, enhancing procedural efficiency and safety. We provide an in-depth analysis of deformation forces, stress, and strain characteristics based on catheter materials, supported by comprehensive mathematical modeling of applied forces and torques. Simulation results show that the system requires a torque of 1.870 Nm, a displacement of 0.089 m, and a velocity of 1.450 m/s for translational motion. For rotational motion, the system demands 0.915 Nm of torque, an angle of 5.102 rad, and an angular velocity of 88.735 rad/s. These results are validated against pre-existing models to confirm the system’s performance. The study concludes by presenting a three-dimensional (3D) model of the system, demonstrating its ability to improve the safety and precision of cardiac catheterization.},

  abstract     = {In manufacturing, construction, logistics, and other industrial tasks, human workers are required to handle and manipulate heavy loads such as loading packages in and out of warehouses, manipulating physical components on assembly lines, and more. However, repetitive manipulation of heavy loads can disrupt balance and lead to strains and injuries on the body, causing issues such as back pain. This concern is particularly significant in jobs involving awkward postures, e.g., aircraft and vehicle assembly and maintenance. To help address this challenge, we present a comprehensive scoping review examining robots capable of supporting physical balance in healthy individuals. Our analysis involved evaluating their capabilities, observing their functionality, and assessing their practicality. The majority of our findings (81%) were lower body exoskeletons, which, though highly mobile, can be constrained by slow control systems. Conversely, supernumerary robotic limbs and wearable gyroscopes allow unrestricted movement with less constrained control systems. Many experiments lack baseline comparisons without the robot, and some have limited participant recruitment, affecting representation. We recommend universally available testing procedures to effectively demonstrate and compare the capabilities of balance-supporting robots.},

  abstract     = {Steerable needles have been extensively studied in the medical robotics society for the past two decades, evolving from passive needles to active ones that enable independent motion at their distal tip via robotics technology. Extensive design and actuation options have been proposed for the more capable active needles, followed by a few studies on their path-planning and control techniques; however, no commercial systems are available for the clinical environment yet despite their clear benefit, i.e., improved steerability and versatility compared to the other existing types of needles. This paper reviews the state-of-the-art steerable needle studies to identify research gaps and aims to deepen understanding the mechanics of active needles in soft tissue, which is critical for design optimization, precise control, and preoperative planning but currently remains unclear. To simplify the analysis, this review suggests separating the mechanics of an active needle into two parts: one for each of the tip and the shaft, where the shaft can be understood similarly to the passive needle whose mechanics has been thoroughly studied compared to the active one. Therefore, investigating the tip mechanics, including tissue properties, tip loadings, and tip kinematics, can lead to the complete understanding of active needle mechanics, the next challenges.},

These innovations not only propel dentistry into the digital age, but also introduce novel, non-invasive, and immersive treatment methodologies. This review collates and summarizes the latest developments and applications of AR and MR in digital dentistry. In contemporary practice, digital information, such as CT scans, is predominantly used for presurgical verification. However, integrating patients digital 3D information into real-world environments through AR and MR allows dental professionals to visualize diagnostic and therapeutic data using a Head-Mounted Display (HMD). This integration enhances not only efficiency and safety, but also elevates surgical training. Despite these benefits, further enhancements are required for these technologies to achieve broader acceptance in clinical dentistry. In this review, we have dedicated a separate section discussing the prospective applications and future directions of AR and MR, including optimizing HMD technology, developing intraoperative feedback navigation technology, advancing human-machine interaction (HMI) technology, and improving soft-tissue visualization technology. The literature suggests that AR and MR applications are particularly advantageous in dentistry, despite some limitations. With ongoing developments in areas such as haptics and robotics, it is expected that AR and MR will become increasingly integral to dental practices in the near future.},

Although automatic detection of compensatory movements has been studied in the literature, the impact of sensor locations on detection performance has not been previously explored. To investigate how sensor locations affect the ability to automatically detect compensatory movements of the upper limb, sixteen surface electromyography sensors were placed on key muscles involved in these movements. Thirty-one healthy participants performed a door-opening task in three conditions: without elbow restrictions (healthy pattern), and two conditions with limited elbow range of motion (60° of flexion-full flexion and 30°–80° of flexion to simulate injury). Statistical analyses identified sensor locations with significant differences between the conditions. Support vector machine classifiers demonstrated notably higher performance using data from six sensors on the middle deltoid, the upper trapezius, the latissimus dorsi, the external obliques, and the erector abdominis. This study highlights the importance of thoughtful muscle selection for effective automatic detection and correction of upper-limb compensatory movements, which is crucial for a wearable mechatronic device to be effective in improving the movement quality of patients.},

The collected data were processed to extract the kinematic synergies of the hand by means of singular value decomposition. A novel, unbiased metric to determine hand manipulation complexity was based on the cumulative variance accounted for. This Variance-Accounted-For Complexity Index (VAF-CI) reliably distinguished between different manipulation tasks. Moreover, an unsupervised learning method (k-means clustering) was able to use the index to accurately identify the 3 distinct manipulation tasks.

Researchers have attempted to elicit sensation through direct stimulation of peripheral nerves or through stimulation of reinnervated skin or muscle.

The purpose of this study was to determine if this sensation could be used to improve performance of a functional task. Two participants with upper limb loss completed the Box and Blocks Test in a virtual environment under four feedback conditions on a single day of testing. These conditions included no feedback, vibration triggered by object contact, and two conditions where RPNIs were electrically stimulated upon object contact. For the RPNI conditions, one was somatotopic, meaning the referred sensation and virtual sensor were collocated and the other was non-somatotopic, where the referred sensation and virtual sensor locations differed. Participants moved the most blocks when somatotopic feedback was provided. Both participants expressed a preference for the somatotopic sensation, noting that it made their movements feel more natural. Overall, this study demonstrates that RPNI-elicited sensation has the potential to improve functional performance.},

  abstract     = {In ankle-foot orthosis development, it is challenging to both specify the appropriate ankle mechanics and design systems that can physically render them. Recently, a new ankle-foot orthosis-the Variable Stiffness Orthosis (VSO)–was introduced to allow customization of the shape of the joint’s torque-angle relationship via a cam-based transmission. A module in the VSO permits switching between two coupled torque-angle relationships at desired kinematic transitions. This module decouples energy storage and return (DESR), enabling new functionality, including varying the ankle’s equilibrium position and exchanging energy between gait phases. However, the torque-angle relationships are defined by many parameters and subject to substantial constraints. We developed an optimization framework to design two versions of the DESR module to address foot drop. The angle module was designed to maximize swing ankle angle, and the energy module was designed to maximize energy recycled from early stance phase to augment push off. We validated the results of the optimization with brute-force searching and empirically tested the DESR mechanics in a rotary dynamometer. The angle module facilitated swing angles of up to 0.63° dorsiflexion, while simultaneously permitting a plantarflexed standing angle, and the energy module recycled up to 1.84 J.},

Here, we fabricate ultra-deformable magnetic microrobots, consisting of ferrofluid-loaded lipid vesicles, and we magnetically pull them through chambers that exert upon them a gradually more forceful confinement. We thus analyze their capability to face interstices comparable to or smaller than their characteristic size and their consequent behavior in terms of stability, velocity, and deformation. The results show that the inherent compliance of these vesicle-based magnetic microrobots allows them to infiltrate successfully in interstices slightly smaller than their size. Further enhancement of their compliance and the development of specific control strategies may lead to microrobots able to move through interstices and traverse complex biological environments.},

This study explores the impact of kinematic constraints imposed by exoskeletons on user gait, stability, and perceived discomfort. Specifically, it examines how the varying degrees of freedom (DoF) in an ankle exoskeleton influence these factors. The exoskeleton utilized in this study can be configured to allow one, two, or three DoF, thereby simulating different levels of mechanical complexity and kinematic compatibility. A pilot study was conducted with six participants walking on a straight path to evaluate these effects. The findings indicate that increasing DoF of the exoskeleton improves several criteria, including kinematics and stability. In particular, the transition from 1 DoF to 2 DoF yielded a larger improvement than the transition from 2 DoF to 3 DoF, although the 3 DoF configuration produced the best overall results. Higher DoF configurations also resulted in stability values that resemble more closely those of walking without the exoskeleton, despite the added weight. Subjective feedback from participants corroborated these results, indicating the lowest discomfort with the 3 DoF ankle exoskeleton.},

  abstract     = {In telemanipulation, supplementary feedback can enhance operator perception and control precision. This study introduces a haptic interface designed to convey temporally discrete tactile cues when remotely controlling a robot. Low-profile piezoelectric sensors were integrated in the thumb of a robotic hand to capture the key events of the manipulation task (i.e., object contact and release). Synchronously with such events, pressure bursts were delivered to the operator’s fingertip through a soft textile thimble equipped with inflatable pockets. Both this haptic display and the sensing module were individually evaluated. The pneumatic system responsible for pockets inflation was characterized in terms of reaction time, proving suitable for the application with a latency of less than 70 ms. Regarding the sensing module, the behavior of the sensorized thumb was first evaluated under static conditions, identifying contact and release events when grasping with the robotic hand differently shaped objects fixed on a table. Then, the accuracy of the touch event detection was assessed while performing a more complex manipulation task (i.e., a pick and lift task). This evaluation was conducted first with the robot programmed to grasp and lift an object following pre-defined trajectories, where we measured accuracy of 100% for contact and 90% for release event detection. Then, we performed a telemanipulation pilot study involving eight participants, where the system proved capable of correctly detecting object contact and release events with an accuracy of 100% and 86.4%. Despite preliminary, these results confirmed proper functioning of the system and paved the way for the exploration of a new haptic feedback policy in telemanipulation based on temporally discrete tactile events.},

In recent years, methods based on machine learning and sensor fusion have offered advances in GP estimation, but their high computational costs and reliance on training and numerous sensors present practical challenges. Estimation methods using phase variables, such as phase-portrait-based methods, can circumvent these drawbacks. However, their lower accuracy has limited their application. To address this limitation, we introduce a novel human-in-the-loop (HIL) optimization approach for improving the accuracy of GP estimation in phase-portrait-based methods. The approach is based on geometric manipulation of the phase portraits with linear transformations, which are adapted online by employing Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES). The performance of this adaptive method (termed AM) is compared against using a fixed transformation (FM) at different walking speeds on level and inclined treadmill. The results demonstrate the superior performance of AM in all tested conditions in terms of accuracy and linearity, with an average RMS error of $1.97 \pm 0.20\%$ . Convergence times for one round of optimization on a low-end single-board computer were less than 11 s on average. This study confirms the potential of leveraging HIL optimization for enhancing the performance of phase-portrait-based methods to reach accuracy levels comparable to more complex state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract     = {Upper motor neuron injuries such as traumatic brain injury and stroke can cause hemiparesis and subsequent hand impairment. Repeated hand movements in physical therapy are shown to maintain flexibility and potentially facilitate regaining functionality. To further understand the impact of hand exoskeletons on motor impairment and recovery, we aim to study brain activation during rehabilitation and assistive hand exoskeleton use. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) can be used to measure brain activation with high spatial resolution, but devices used within a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) machine must be designed within several constraints. We present the design of a pneumatic hand orthosis with powered extension—the PneuHOPE Hand—a wearable MRI conditional research platform to enable the studying of brain activation in the presence of hand spasticity. To demonstrate its use as an MRI compatible platform, we conducted MRI conditionality testing. Additionally, we collected brain activation data from two healthy control subject’s using fMRI to show that the exoskeleton can be comfortably worn in the MRI scanner and that appropriate brain activation data can be collected during use. The results indicate the PneuHOPE Hand platform can be safely used for neuroimaging studies in the MRI with < 12% reduction in SNR for T1 images, < 32% reduction for T2, and no visible paramagnetic artifacts.},

This paper presents a novel fabrication method to manufacture pressure-driven actuators of submillimeter-scale. The proposed fabrication method utilizes magnetorheological (MR) elastomer and magnetic field to determine the geometric dimensions of the actuator with micro-scale precision. An actuator of the diameter of 0.7 mm and the eccentricity of $80~\mu $ m is designed and fabricated with absolute errors of $12~\mu $ m and $3~\mu $ m, respectively. The steering performance of the fabricated micro actuator is tested through experiments. The actuator can achieve a sharp bending angle of 124 degrees with a length of 5.41 mm, by optimizing the eccentricity through the finite-element analysis.},

However, this feature also makes them weak in scalability and load capacity, making it difficult to complete fine care operations and daily grasping tasks. In this paper, a large deploy/fold ratio variable stiffness hyper-redundant robot based on the origami principle is proposed, which has a large deploy/fold ratio, and realizes large stiffness change based on the bionic muscle-driven variable stiffness principle. Based on the analysis of origami theory, the robot uses rigid origami mechanisms as the skeleton support, flexible gasbags as the backbones, and the hybrid actuation is used to realize the extension, contraction, variable stiffness, and omnidirectional bending motion. Based on the motion/stiffness model of the hyper-redundant robot, the characteristics of the single-joint and the 6-joint hyper-redundant robot are verified by experiments. These experiments confirm that the hyper-redundant robot has a large deploy/fold and variable stiffness range, obtains a large bending deformation and working range, can overcome the gravity generated by itself and the load, and has a high load capacity.},

  abstract     = {Tracking permanent magnets represents a low-footprint and passive approach to monitoring objects or human motion by attaching or embedding magnets therein. Recent tracking techniques achieved high-bandwidth detection considering a simplified model for the magnetic sources, i.e., the dipole model. Nonetheless, such a model can lead to inaccurate results any time a non-spherical magnet approaches the sensor array. Here, we present a novel tracking algorithm based on an analytical model for permanent magnet cylinders with uniform arbitrary magnetization. By means of a physical system mounting 20 magnetometers, we compared the tracking accuracy obtained with our algorithm vs. results obtained by using the dipole model and with respect to a ground-truth reference. With a single magnetic target, our algorithm can significantly lower position (up to 0.68 mm) and orientation errors (up to 2.5°) while enabling online tracking (computation time below 19 ms). We also accurately tracked two magnets, by obtaining a reduction in position error (up to 0.92 mm) vs. the dipole-based algorithm. These findings broaden the applicability of accurate magnetic tracking to real-time applications, facilitating the tracking of multiple magnetic targets in proximity of the magnetic sensors. This advancement opens avenues for applications in wearable devices, advancing the field of motion detection beyond traditional inertial measurement units.},

  abstract     = {Hemiparetic gait is often characterized by ankle weakness, resulting in decreased propulsion and clearance, as well as knee hyperextension. These gait deviations reduce speed and efficiency while increasing the risk of falls and osteoarthritis. Powered ankle exoskeletons have the potential to address these issues. However, only a handful of studies have investigated their effects on hemiparetic gait. The results are often inconsistent, and the biomechanical analysis rarely includes the knee or hip joint or a direct clearance measure. In this case study, we assess the ankle, knee, and hip biomechanics with and without a new autonomous powered ankle exoskeleton across different speeds and inclines. Exoskeleton assistance resulted in more normative kinematics at the subject’s self-selected walking speed. The paretic ankle angle at heel strike increased from 10° plantarflexed without the exoskeleton to 0.5° dorsiflexed with the exoskeleton, and the peak plantarflexion angle during swing decreased from 28° without the exoskeleton to 12° with the exoskeleton. Furthermore, stance knee flexion increased from 7° without the exoskeleton to 20° with the exoskeleton. Finally, foot clearance increased with the exoskeleton for all conditions between 3.1 cm and 5.4 cm. This case study highlights new mechanisms for powered ankle exoskeletons to improve hemiparetic gait.},

Results from seven participants showed a significant reduction in the metabolic cost of transport when the exosuit was active.

This phase information can be used in the exoskeleton’s controller to compensate the dynamics of the exoskeleton and to assign impedance parameters. Typically the weight distribution is calculated using data from sensors such as treadmill force plates or insole force sensors. However, these solutions increase both the setup complexity and cost. For this reason, we propose a deep-learning approach that uses a short time window of joint kinematics to predict the weight distribution of an exoskeleton in real time. The model was trained on treadmill walking data from six users wearing a four-degree-of-freedom exoskeleton and tested in real time on three different users wearing the same device. This test set includes two users not present in the training set to demonstrate the model’s ability to generalize across individuals. Results show that the proposed method is able to fit the actual weight distribution with $R^{2}=0.9$ and is suitable for real-time control with prediction times less than 1 ms. Experiments in closed-loop exoskeleton control show that deep-learning-based weight distribution estimation can be used to replace force sensors in overground and treadmill walking.},

These models provide personalized estimates of the parameters using information from many sensors. However, to advance technology from labs to workplaces, there is a need for sensor reduction to improve wearability and applicability. Therefore we introduce an EMG sensor reduction approach based on inverse synergy extrapolation, to reconstruct unmeasured EMG signals for different box-lifting techniques. 12 participants performed an array of tasks (squat, stoop, unilateral twist and bilateral twist) with different weights (0 kg, 7.5 kg and 15 kg). We found that two synergies were sufficient to explain the different lifting tasks (median variance accounted for of 0.91). Building upon this, we used two sensors at optimal subject-specific muscle locations to reconstruct the EMG of four unmeasured channels. Evaluation of the reconstructed and reference EMG showed median coefficients of determination $(R^{2})$ between 0.70 and 0.86, with median root mean squared errors (RMSE) ranging from 0.02 to 0.04 relative to maximal voluntary contraction. This indicates that our proposed method shows promise for sensor reduction for driving a trunk EMS for ambulatory biomechanical risk assessment in occupational settings and exoskeleton control.},

Instabilities generate complex interaction forces that render the system unpredictable. And yet, humans interact with these objects with ease. Nonlinear dynamic analysis shows that the initial conditions and frequencies of input forces determine the system’s stability. Taking inspiration from carrying a cup of coffee, participants rhythmically moved a cup with a ball rolling inside which was modeled as a cart-pendulum system. They were encouraged to prepare the cup-and-ball system by ‘jiggling’ the cup before moving it back and forth on a horizontal line. We tested the hypothesis that humans initialize the system and choose interaction frequencies that stabilize their interactions. To create uncertainty about the specific cup-and-ball system, the pendulum length was varied without providing cues to the participant. Stability was quantified by variability of relative phase between cup and ball. Results showed that participants nonlinearly co-varied the initial ball angle at the end of preparation and the cup frequency during the rhythmic phase. Mapping participants’ choices onto the highly nonlinear manifold of stable solutions generated by forward-simulations verified that they indeed achieved stable solutions.},
