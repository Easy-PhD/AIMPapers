  abstract     = {We investigate the phase retrieval problem perturbed by dense bounded noise and sparse outliers that can change an adversarially chosen s-fraction of the measurement vector. The adversarial sparse outliers may depend on both the observation and measurements. We demonstrate that the nonlinear least absolute deviation based on amplitude measurements can tolerate adversarial outliers up to a fraction of $s^{*,1}\approx 0.2043$ , while the intensity-based model can tolerate a fraction of $s^{*,2}\approx 0.1185$ . Furthermore, we construct adaptive counterexamples to show that these thresholds are theoretically sharp, thereby showing the presentation of phase transition in the adversarial phase retrieval problem when the corruption fraction exceeds the sharp thresholds. This implies that the amplitude-based model exhibits superior adversarial robustness in comparison with the intensity-based model. Corresponding experimental results are presented to further illustrate our theoretical findings. To the best of our knowledge, our results provide the first theoretical examination of the differences in robustness performance between amplitude and intensity measurement. A crucial aspect of our analysis is the exploration of the exact distribution of a combination of two non-independent Gaussian random variables, leading to the presentation of novel probability density functions to derive the sharp thresholds.},

  abstract     = {Automated cryptanalysis has taken center stage in the arena of cryptanalysis since the pioneering work by Mouha et al. which showcased the power of Mixed Integer Linear Programming ( $\textsf {MILP}$ ) in solving cryptanalysis problems that otherwise, required significant effort. Since the inception, research in this area has moved in primarily two directions. One is to model more and more classical cryptanalysis tools as optimization problems to leverage the ease provided by state-of-the-art solvers. The other direction is to improve existing models to make them more efficient and/or accurate. The current work is an attempt to contribute to the latter. In this work, a general model referred to as $\textsf {DEEPAND}$ has been devised to capture the correlation between $\textsf {AND}$ gates in $\textsf {NLFSR}$ -based lightweight block ciphers. $\textsf {DEEPAND}$ builds upon and generalizes the idea of joint propagation of differences through $\textsf {AND}$ gates captured using refined $\textsf {MILP}$ modeling of $\textsf {TinyJAMBU}$ by Saha et al. in FSE 2020. The proposed model has been applied to $\textsf {TinyJAMBU}$ , $\textsf {KATAN}$ , $\textsf {KTANTAN}$ and can detect correlations that were missed by earlier models. This leads to more accurate differential bounds for both the ciphers. In particular, a 384-round (full-round as per earlier specification) $\textsf {Type-IV}$ trail is found for $\textsf {TinyJAMBU}$ with 14-active $\textsf {AND}$ gates using the new model, while the refined model reported this figure to be 19. This also reaffirms the decision of the designers to increase the number of rounds from 384 to 640. Moreover, the model succeeds in searching a full round $\textsf {Type-IV}$ trail of $\textsf {TinyJAMBU}$ keyed permutation ${\mathcal {P}}_{1024}$ with probability $2^{-105} (\gg 2^{-128})$ . This reveals the non-random properties of ${\mathcal {P}}_{1024}$ thereby showing it to be non-ideal. Hence it cannot be expected to provide the same security levels as robust block ciphers. Further, the provable security of $\textsf {TinyJAMBU}$ $\textsf {AEAD}$ scheme should be carefully revisited. Similarly, for the variants of $\textsf {KATAN}$ , several previously reported trails are improved upon by employing the $\textsf {DEEPAND}$ model. Moreover, in the related-key setting, the $\textsf {DEEPAND}$ model is able to make a better 140-round boomerang distinguisher (for both the data and time complexity) in comparison to the previous boomerang attack by Isobe et al. in ACISP 2013. Furthermore, for enhanced applicability, we employ the $\textsf {DEEPAND}$ model on another multiple $\textsf {AND}$ -based cipher, $\textsf {KTANTAN}$ , in the related-key setting. Our analysis reveals practical differential distinguishers with low data and time complexities for all full-round $\textsf {KTANTAN}$ variants. In summary, $\textsf {DEEPAND}$ seems to capture the underlying correlation better when multiple $\textsf {AND}$ gates are at play and can be adapted to other classes of ciphers as well.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we study a multiclass spatial birth-and-death (SBD) processes on a compact region of the Euclidean plane modeling wireless interactions. In such a setup, users arrive at a constant rate and leave at a rate inversely proportional to a shot noise created by interfering users in the network. The novelty of this work lies in the addition of service differentiation, inspired by bandwidth partitioning present in 5G networks: users are allocated a fixed number of frequency bands and only interfere with transmissions on these bands. The first result of our work lies in the determination of the critical user arrival rate below which the system is always stochastically stable, and above which it is unstable. The analysis requires symmetry assumptions which are defined in the paper. The proof for this result uses stochastic monotonicity and fluid limit models to bound the dynamics from above and below by two adequate discrete-state Markov jump processes, for which we obtain stability and instability results. This leads to a closed form formula for the critical arrival rate. In a second part, we propose two heuristics to estimate the steady-state densities of users in the network: the first one relies on a Poisson approximation of the steady-state processes. The second one uses a cavity approximation leveraging second-order moment measures, which leads to more accurate estimates of the steady-state user densities of all classes of users. The Poisson heuristic also gives a good estimate for the critical arrival rate.},

  abstract     = {The problem of T-colluding private information retrieval (PIR) enables the user to retrieve one out of M files from a distributed storage system with N servers without revealing anything about the index of the desired file to any group of up to T colluding servers. In the considered storage system, the M files are stored across the N distributed servers in an X-secure K-coded manner such that any group of up to X colluding servers learns nothing about the files; the storage overhead at each server is reduced by a factor of $\frac {1}{K}$ compared to the total size of the files; and the files can be reconstructed from any $K+X$ servers. However, in practical scenarios, when the user retrieves the desired file from the distributed system, some servers may respond to the user very slowly or not respond at all. These servers are referred to as stragglers, and particularly their identities and numbers are unknown in advance and may change over time. This paper considers the adaptive PIR problem that can be capable of tolerating the presence of a varying number of stragglers. We propose a general coding method for designing adaptive PIR schemes by introducing the concept of a feasible PIR coding framework. We demonstrate that any feasible PIR coding framework over a finite field $\mathbb {F}_{q}$ with size q can be used to construct an adaptive PIR scheme that achieves a retrieval rate of $1-\frac {K+X+T-1}{N-S}$ simultaneously for all numbers of stragglers $0\leq S\leq N-(K+X+T)$ over the same finite field. Additionally, we provide an implementation of the feasible PIR coding framework, ensuring that the adaptive PIR scheme operates over any finite field $\mathbb {F}_{q}$ with size $q\geq N+\max \{K, N-(K+X+T-1)\}$ .},

A user wishes to retrieve a desired message from N non-colluding servers efficiently, such that the identity of the desired message is not leaked in a significant manner; however, some servers can be more trustworthy than others. We propose a code construction for this setting and optimize the probability distribution for this construction. For the Max-L metric, it is shown that the optimal probability allocation for the proposed scheme essentially separates the delivery patterns into two parts: a completely private part that has the same download overhead as the capacity-achieving PIR code, and a non-private part that allows complete privacy leakage but has no download overhead by downloading only from the most trustful server. The optimal solution is established through a sophisticated analysis of the underlying convex optimization problem and a reduction between the homogeneous setting and the heterogeneous setting. For the MI metric, the homogeneous case is studied first for which the code can be optimized with an explicit probability assignment, while a closed-form solution becomes intractable for the heterogeneous case. Numerical results are provided for both cases to corroborate the theoretical analysis.},

Empirical investigations demonstrate that KANs optimized via stochastic gradient descent (SGD) are capable of achieving near-zero training loss in various machine learning (e.g., regression, classification, and time series forecasting, etc.) and scientific tasks (e.g., solving partial differential equations). In this paper, we provide a theoretical explanation for the empirical success by conducting a rigorous convergence analysis of gradient descent (GD) and SGD for two-layer KANs in solving both regression and physics-informed tasks. For regression problems, we establish using the neural tangent kernel perspective that GD achieves global linear convergence of the objective function when the hidden dimension of KANs is sufficiently large. We further extend these results to SGD, demonstrating a similar global convergence in expectation. Additionally, we analyze the global convergence of GD and SGD for physics-informed KANs, which unveils additional challenges due to the more complex loss structure. This is the first work establishing the global convergence guarantees for GD and SGD applied to optimize KANs and physics-informed KANs.},

  abstract     = {Multi-objective reinforcement learning (MORL) has shown great promise in many real-world applications. Existing MORL algorithms often aim to learn a policy that optimizes individual objective functions simultaneously with a given prior preference (or weights) on different objectives. However, these methods often suffer from the issue of gradient conflict such that the objectives with larger gradients dominate the update direction, resulting in a performance degeneration on other objectives. In this paper, we develop a novel dynamic weighting multi-objective actor-critic algorithm (MOAC) under two options of sub-procedures named as conflict-avoidant (CA) and faster convergence (FC) in objective weight updates. MOAC-CA aims to find a CA update direction that maximizes the minimum value improvement among objectives, and MOAC-FC targets at a much faster convergence rate. We provide a comprehensive finite-time convergence analysis for both algorithms. We show that MOAC-CA can find a $\epsilon +\epsilon _{\text {app}}$ -accurate Pareto stationary policy using $\mathcal {O}({\epsilon ^{-5}})$ samples, while ensuring a small $\epsilon +\sqrt {\epsilon _{\text {app}}}$ -level CA distance (defined as the distance to the CA direction), where $\epsilon _{\text {app}}$ is the function approximation error. The analysis also shows that MOAC-FC improves the sample complexity to $\mathcal {O}(\epsilon ^{-3})$ , but with a constant-level CA distance. Our experiments on MT10 demonstrate the improved performance of our algorithms over existing MORL methods with fixed preference.},

While recent advances in robust RL focus on Markov decision processes (MDPs), robust non-Markovian RL is limited to planning problem where the transitions in the uncertainty set are known. In this paper, we study the learning problem of robust offline non-Markovian RL. Specifically, when the nominal model admits a low-rank structure, we propose a new algorithm, featuring a novel dataset distillation and a lower confidence bound (LCB) design for robust values under different types of the uncertainty set. We also derive new dual forms for these robust values in non-Markovian RL, making our algorithm more amenable to practical implementation. By further introducing a novel type-I concentrability coefficient tailored for offline low-rank non-Markovian decision processes, we prove that our algorithm can find an $\epsilon $ -optimal robust policy using $O(1/\epsilon ^{2})$ offline samples. Moreover, we extend our algorithm to the case when the nominal model does not have specific structure. With a new type-II concentrability coefficient, the extended algorithm also enjoys polynomial sample efficiency under all different types of the uncertainty set.},

  abstract     = {Clustering is a fundamental tool in statistical machine learning in the presence of heterogeneous data. Most recent results focus primarily on optimal mislabeling guarantees when data are distributed around centroids with sub-Gaussian errors. Yet, the restrictive sub-Gaussian model is often invalid in practice, since various real-world applications exhibit heavy-tail distributions around the centroids or suffer from possible adversarial attacks that call for robust clustering with a robust data-driven initialization. In this paper, we present initialization and subsequent clustering methods that provably guarantee near-optimal mislabeling for general mixture models when the number of clusters and data dimensions are finite. We first introduce a hybrid clustering technique with a novel multivariate trimmed mean type centroid estimate to produce mislabeling guarantees under a weak initialization condition for general error distributions around the centroids. A matching lower bound is derived, up to factors depending on the number of clusters. In addition, our approach also produces similar mislabeling guarantees even in the presence of adversarial outliers. Our results reduce to the sub-Gaussian case in finite dimensions when errors follow sub-Gaussian distributions. To solve the problem thoroughly, we also present novel data-driven robust initialization techniques and show that, with probabilities approaching one, these initial centroid estimates are sufficiently good for the subsequent clustering algorithm to achieve the optimal mislabeling rates. Furthermore, we demonstrate that Lloyd‚Äôs algorithm is suboptimal for more than two clusters even when errors are Gaussian and for two clusters when error distributions have heavy tails. Both simulated data and real data examples further support our robust initialization procedure and clustering algorithm.},

Despite many methodological and theoretical developments in the past two decades, the theoretical guarantees of the popular SPCA algorithm proposed by Zou et al. (2006) based on the elastic net are still unknown. This paper aims to address this critical theoretical gap. We first revisit the SPCA algorithm of Zou et al. (2006) and present our implementation. We also study a computationally more efficient variant of the SPCA algorithm in Zou et al. (2006) that can be considered as the limiting case of SPCA. We provide the guarantees of convergence to a stationary point for both algorithms and prove that, under a sparse spiked covariance model, both algorithms can recover the principal subspace consistently under mild regularity conditions. We show that their estimation error bounds match the best available bounds of existing works or the minimax rates up to some logarithmic factors. Moreover, we demonstrate the competitive numerical performance of both algorithms in numerical experiments.},

  abstract     = {Given a sequence of tokens, such as words, the task of next-token prediction is to predict the next-token conditional probability distribution. Decoder-only transformers have become effective models for this task, but their properties are still not fully understood. In particular, the largest number of distinct context sequences that a decoder-only transformer can interpolate next-token distributions for has not been established. To fill this gap, we prove upper and lower bounds on this number, which are equal up to a multiplicative constant. We prove these bounds in the general setting where next-token distributions can be arbitrary as well as the empirical setting where they are calculated from a finite number of document sequences. Our lower bounds are for one-layer multi-head decoder-only transformers and our proofs highlight an important injectivity property satisfied by self-attention. Furthermore, we provide numerical evidence that the minimal number of parameters for memorization is sufficient for being able to train the model to the entropy lower bound.},

The setting is extended to a multiplex version, where all layers have the same collection of nodes and follow the SGRDPG. The only common feature of the layers of the network is that they can be partitioned into groups with common subspace structures, while otherwise matrices of connection probabilities can be all different. The setting above is extremely flexible and includes a variety of existing multiplex network models, including GRDPG, as its particular cases. By employing novel methodologies, our paper ensures strongly consistent clustering of layers and highly accurate subspace estimation, which are significant improvements over the results of Pensky and Wang (2024). All algorithms and theoretical results in the paper remain true for both signed and binary networks. In addition, the paper shows that keeping signs of the edges in the process of network construction leads to a better precision of estimation and clustering and, hence, is beneficial for tackling real world problems such as, for example, analysis of brain networks.},

When instantiated in appropriate Markov categories, these algorithms specialize to existing ones such as the Kalman filter, forward-backward algorithm, and the Rauch-Tung‚ÄìStriebel smoother. We also prove that the sequence of outputs of our abstract Bayes filter is itself a Markov chain with a concrete formula for its transition maps. There are two main features of this categorical framework. The first is its abstract generality, as manifested in our unified account of hidden Markov models and algorithms for filtering and smoothing in discrete probability, Gaussian probability, measure-theoretic probability, possibilistic nondeterminism and others at the same time.

We employ this inequality to obtain a uniform continuity bound for the quantum conditional entropy of two states whose marginals on the conditioning system coincide.

  abstract     = {Determining the optimal fidelity for the transmission of quantum information over noisy quantum channels is one of the central problems in quantum information theory. Recently, [Berta-Borderi-Fawzi-Scholz, Mathematical Programming, 2021] introduced an asymptotically converging semidefinite programming hierarchy of outer bounds for this quantity. However, the size of the semidefinite programs (SDPs) grows exponentially with respect to the level of the hierarchy, thus making their computation unscalable. In this work, by exploiting the symmetries in the SDP, we show that, for a fixed output dimension of the quantum channel, we can compute the SDP in time polynomial with respect to the level of the hierarchy and input dimension. As a direct consequence of our result, the optimal fidelity can be approximated with an accuracy of $\epsilon $ in $\mathrm {poly}(1/\epsilon, \text {input dimension})$ time, compared to the $\exp (1/\epsilon, \text {input dimension})$ running time required for direct computation.},

The problem setting we investigate involves an exponentially distributed delay channel for transmissions and a constraint on the average sampling rate. We first show that the optimum sampling and transmission policy is a multi-threshold policy, where the thresholds depend on both the estimation value and the state of the original process, and sampling and transmission need to be initiated when the instantaneous AoII exceeds the corresponding threshold, called the estimation- and state-aware transmission (ESAT) policy. Subsequently, we formulate the problem of finding the thresholds as a constrained semi-Markov decision process (CSMDP) and the Lagrangian approach. Additionally, we propose two lower complexity sub-optimum policies, namely the estimation-aware transmission (EAT) policy, and the single-threshold (ST) policy, for which it is possible to obtain these thresholds for CTMCs with relatively larger number of states. The underlying CSMDP formulation relies on the multi-regime phase-type (MR-PH) distribution which is a generalization of the well-known phase-type distribution, which allows us to obtain the first two moments of time until absorption in a CTMC whose transition rates change with respect to time, in a piece-wise manner. The effectiveness of the proposed ESAT, EAT, and ST sampling and transmission policies are shown through numerical examples, along with comparisons with a baseline scheme that transmits packets according to a Poisson process in out-of-sync periods.},

  abstract     = {This paper aims to answer a fundamental question in the area of Integrated Sensing and Communications (ISAC): What is the optimal communication-centric ISAC waveform for ranging? Towards that end, we first established a generic framework to analyze the sensing performance of communication-centric ISAC waveforms built upon orthonormal signaling bases and random data symbols. Then, we evaluated their ranging performance by adopting both the periodic and aperiodic auto-correlation functions (P-ACF and A-ACF), and defined the expectation of the integrated sidelobe level (EISL) as a sensing performance metric. On top of that, we proved that among all communication waveforms with cyclic prefix (CP), the orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) modulation is the only globally optimal waveform that achieves the lowest ranging sidelobe for quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) and phase shift keying (PSK) constellations, in terms of both the EISL and the sidelobe level at each individual lag of the P-ACF. As a step forward, we proved that among all communication waveforms without CP, OFDM is a locally optimal waveform for QAM/PSK in the sense that it achieves a local minimum of the EISL of the A-ACF. Finally, we demonstrated by numerical results that under QAM/PSK constellations, there is no other orthogonal communication-centric waveform that achieves a lower ranging sidelobe level than that of the OFDM, in terms of both P-ACF and A-ACF cases.},

  abstract     = {This paper considers a massive connectivity setting in which a base-station (BS) aims to communicate sources $(X_{1},\cdots ,X_{k})$ to a randomly activated subset of k users, among a large pool of n users, via a common message in the downlink. Although the identities of the k active users are assumed to be known at the BS, each active user only knows whether itself is active and does not know the identities of the other active users. A naive coding strategy is to transmit the sources alongside the identities of the users for which the source information is intended. This requires $H(X_{1},\cdots ,X_{k}) + k\log (n)$ bits, because the cost of specifying the identity of one out of n users is $\log (n)$ bits. For large n, this overhead can be significant. This paper shows that it is possible to develop coding techniques that eliminate the dependency of the overhead on n, if the source distribution follows certain symmetry. Specifically, if the source distribution is independently and identically distributed (i.i.d.) then the overhead can be reduced to at most $O(\log (k))$ bits, and in case of uniform i.i.d. sources, the overhead can be further reduced to $O(1)$ bits. For sources that follow a more general exchangeable distribution, the overhead is at most $O(k)$ bits, and in case of finite-alphabet exchangeable sources, the overhead can be further reduced to $O(\log (k))$ bits. The downlink massive random access problem is closely connected to the study of finite exchangeable sequences. The proposed coding strategy allows bounds on the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between finite exchangeable distributions and i.i.d. mixture distributions to be developed and gives a new KL divergence version of the finite de Finetti theorem, which is scaling optimal.},

  abstract     = {The capacity of a discrete-time channel with correlated phase noises is investigated. In particular, the electro-optic frequency comb system is considered, where the phase noise of each subchannel is a combination of two independent Wiener phase-noise sources. Capacity upper and lower bounds are derived for this channel and are compared with lower bounds obtained by numerically evaluating the achievable information rates using quadrature amplitude modulation constellations. Capacity upper and lower bounds are provided for the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime. The multiplexing gain (pre-log) is shown to be $M-1$ , where M represents the number of subchannels. A constant gap between the asymptotic upper and lower bounds is observed, which depends on the number of subchannels M. For the specific case of $M=2$ , capacity is characterized up to a term that vanishes as the SNR grows large.},

  abstract     = {The classical Rician Weichselberger channel and the emerging holographic multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channel share a common characteristic of non-separable correlation, which captures the interdependence between transmit and receive antennas. However, this correlation structure makes it very challenging to characterize the fundamental limits of non-centered (Rician), non-separable MIMO channels. In fact, there is a dearth of existing literature that addresses this specific aspect, underscoring the need for further research in this area. In this paper, we investigate the mutual information (MI) of non-centered non-separable MIMO channels, where both the line-of-sight and non-line-of-sight components are considered. By utilizing random matrix theory (RMT), we set up a central limit theorem for the MI and give the closed-form expressions for its mean and variance. The derived results are then utilized to determine the ergodic MI and outage probability of holographic MIMO channels. Numerical simulations validate the accuracy of the theoretical results.},

It should be emphasized that the upper bounds build a connection between the RT-metric and the Hamming metric. Constructions of linear matrix codes are presented and their parameters for the RT-metric are investigated. It is shown that every linear matrix code can be expressed by using the trace function, which is a generalization of the well-known defining-set construction of linear codes.

  abstract     = {In their fundamental paper published in 1965, G. Solomon and J. J. Stiffler invented infinite families of codes meeting the Griesmer bound. These codes are then called Solomon-Stiffler codes and have motivated various constructions of codes meeting or close the Griesmer bound. However weight distributions of Solomon-Stiffler codes have been only determined for very special cases. In this paper, we give a geometric construction of affine and modified affine Solomon-Stiffler codes. Projective Solomon-Stiffler codes are special cases of our modified affine Solomon-Stiffler codes. Several infinite families of q-ary Griesmer, optimal, almost optimal, two-weight, three-weight, four-weight and five-weight linear codes are constructed as special cases of our construction. Weight distributions of these Griesmer, optimal or almost optimal codes are determined explicitly. Many optimal linear codes documented in Grassl‚Äôs list are re-constructed as (modified) affine Solomon-Stiffler codes. Several infinite families of optimal or Griesmer codes were constructed in Shi et, al., IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory, vol. 63, no. 10, 2017, and in Liu et, al., IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory, vol. 65, no. 5, 2019, via Gray images of codes over finite rings. Parameters and weight distributions of these Griesmer or optimal codes can be realized as very special cases in our construction. We also indicate that more general optimal binary linear codes than that constructed in Mondal, IEEE Trans. Inf.

In an additive white Gaussian noise channel, optimal linear codes with the smallest error coefficients achieve the best possible asymptotic frame error rate (AFER) among all optimal linear codes under maximum likelihood decoding. Such codes are referred to as AFER-optimal linear codes. The Griesmer bound is essential for determining the optimality of linear codes. However, establishing tight lower bounds on the error coefficients of Griesmer optimal linear codes is challenging, and the linear programming bound often performs inadequately. In this paper, we propose several iterative lower bounds for the error coefficients of Griesmer optimal linear codes. Specifically, for binary linear codes, our bounds are tight in most cases when the dimension does not exceed 5. To evaluate the performance of our bounds when they are not tight, we also determine the parameters of the remaining 5-dimensional AFER-optimal linear codes. Our final comparison demonstrates that even when our bounds are not tight, they remain very close to the actual values, with a gap of less than or equal to 2.},

In this work, we are interested in the maximum size of permutation codes in the Ulam metric and aim to design permutation codes that can correct multiple deletions with efficient decoding algorithms. We first present an improvement on the Gilbert-Varshamov bound of the maximum size of these permutation codes by analyzing the independence number of the auxiliary graph. The idea is widely used in various cases and our contribution in this section is to enumerate the number of triangles in the auxiliary graph and show that it is small enough. Next, we design permutation codes correcting multiple deletions with a decoding algorithm. In particular, the constructed permutation codes can correct t deletions with at most $(3t-1) \log (n+1)+o(\log n)$ bits of redundancy where n is the length of the code. Our construction is based on a new mapping that yields a new connection between permutation codes in the Hamming metric and permutation codes in various metrics. Furthermore, we construct permutation codes that correct multiple bursts of deletions using this new mapping. Finally, we extend the new mapping for multi-permutations and construct the best-known multi-permutation codes in the Ulam metric.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we propose and study r-minimal codes, a natural extension of minimal codes which have been extensively studied with respect to Hamming metric, rank metric and sum-rank metric. We first propose r-minimal codes in a general setting where the ambient space is a finite dimensional left module over a division ring and is supported on a lattice. We characterize minimal subcodes and r-minimal codes, derive a general singleton bound, and give existence results for r-minimal codes by using combinatorial arguments. We then consider r-minimal rank metric codes over a field extension $\mathbb {E}/\mathbb {F}$ of degree m, where $\mathbb {E}$ can be infinite unless otherwise specified. We characterize these codes in terms of cutting r-blocking sets, generalized rank weights of the codes and those of the dual codes, and classify codes whose r-dimensional subcodes have constant rank support weight. Next, with the help of the evasiveness property of cutting r-blocking sets and some upper bounds for the dimensions of evasive subspaces, we derive several lower and upper bounds for the minimal length of r-minimal codes. Furthermore, when $\mathbb {E}$ is finite, we establish a general upper bound which generalizes and improves the counterpart for minimal codes in the literature. As a corollary, we show that if $m=3$ , then for any $k\geqslant 2$ , the minimal length of k-dimensional minimal codes is equal to $2k$ . To the best of our knowledge, when $m\geqslant 3$ , there is no known explicit formula for the minimal length of k-dimensional minimal codes for arbitrary k in the literature.},

  abstract     = {We study message identification over a noiseless q-ary uniform permutation channel, where the transmitted vector is permuted by a permutation chosen uniformly at random. The channel is noiseless in the sense that the channel only rearranges the symbols in a different order, without changing the symbol values. For discrete memoryless channels (DMCs), the number of identifiable messages grows doubly exponentially. Identification capacity, the maximum second-order exponent, is known to be the same as the Shannon capacity of the DMC. Permutation channels support reliable communication of only polynomially many messages. A simple achievability result shows that message sizes growing as $2^{\epsilon _{n}n^{q-1}}$ are identifiable for any $\epsilon _{n}\rightarrow 0$ . We prove two converse results. A ‚Äúsoft‚Äù converse shows that for any $R\gt 0$ , there is no sequence of identification codes with message size growing as $2^{Rn^{q-1}}$ with a power-law decay ( $n^{-\mu }$ ) of the error probability. We also prove a ‚Äústrong‚Äù converse showing that for any sequence of identification codes with message size $2^{R_{n} n^{q-1}}$ , where $R_{n} \rightarrow \infty $ , the sum of Type I and Type II error probabilities approaches at least 1 as $n\rightarrow \infty $ . To prove the soft converse, we use a sequence of steps to construct a new identification code with a simpler structure which relates to a set system, and then use a lower bound on the normalized maximum pairwise intersection of a set system. To prove the strong converse, we use results on approximation of distributions. The achievability and converse results are generalized to the case of coding over multiple blocks. We also show that under deterministic encoding, the number of messages that can be identified per block is the number of types, i.e., $\binom {n+q-1}{q-1}$ , and this is same as the message size for reliable communication. We finally study message identification over a q-ary uniform permutation channel in the presence of causal block-wise feedback from the receiver, where the encoder receives an entire n-length received block after the transmission of the block is complete. We show that in the presence of feedback, the maximum number of identifiable messages grows doubly exponentially even under deterministic encoding, and we present a two-phase achievability scheme.},

  abstract     = {Minimum storage regenerating (MSR) codes are a class of maximum distance separable (MDS) array codes capable of repairing any single failed node by downloading the minimum amount of information from each of the helper nodes. However, MSR codes require large sub-packetization levels, which hinders their usefulness in practical settings. This led to the development of another class of MDS array codes called $\varepsilon $ -MSR codes, for which the repair information downloaded from each helper node is at most a factor of $(1+\varepsilon)$ from the minimum amount for some $\varepsilon \gt 0$ . The advantage of $\varepsilon $ -MSR codes over MSR codes is their small sub-packetization levels. In previous constructions of epsilon-MSR codes, however, several specific nodes are required to participate in the repair of a failed node, which limits the performance of the code in cases where these nodes are not available. In this work, we present a construction of $\varepsilon $ -MSR codes without this restriction. For a code with n nodes, out of which k store uncoded information, and for any number d of helper nodes ( $k\le d\lt n$ ), the repair of a failed node can be done by contacting any set of d surviving nodes. Our construction utilizes group algebra techniques, and requires linear field size. We also generalize the construction to MDS array codes capable of repairing h failed nodes using d helper nodes with a slightly sub-optimal download from each helper node, for all $h \le n-k$ and $k \le d \le n-h$ simultaneously.},

The rate was derived under the assumption of independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) input. In this work, focusing on the ReRAM channel with a single selector failure in the memory array, we derive an upper bound on achievable rate under arbitrary input distribution. This upper bound is within 0.02 bits from the achievable rate of i.i.d. input, indicating that i.i.d. is very close to optimal for large memory arrays. Moreover, we analyze the achievable rate of random code over ReRAM channel with suboptimal decodings where the decoder ignores the channel correlation. Our result indicates that in this case the achievable rate is limited by the capacity of a memoryless channel. We reveal both weak and strong asymptotic properties of ReRAM channel to prove this. The proof can be directly extended to the case of ReRAM with an arbitrary number of selector failures in the memory array.},

By employing analytical techniques rooted in cyclotomic numbers and Gaussian period theory over finite fields, we characterize the admissible symbol-pair weights of these codes. Significantly, we demonstrate that their minimum symbol-pair distances attain twice the minimum Hamming distances under specific algebraic constraints. Furthermore, we identify and rigorously determine the symbol-pair weight distributions for several three-weight code families.

The task of outlier hypothesis testing is to identify the set of outliers that are generated from an anomalous distribution among all observed sequences where the rest majority are generated from a nominal distribution. In the sequential setting, one obtains a symbol from each sequence per unit time until a reliable decision could be made. For the case with exactly one outlier, our exponent bounds are tight, providing exact large deviations characterization of sequential tests and strengthening a previous result of Li et al. (2017). In particular, the average sample size of our sequential test is bounded universally under any pair of nominal and anomalous distributions and our sequential test achieves larger Bayesian exponent than the fixed-length test, which could not be guaranteed by the sequential test of Li et al. (2017). For the case with at most one outlier, we propose a threshold-based test that has bounded expected stopping time under mild conditions and we bound the exponential decay rate of error probabilities, a.k.a., error exponents, under each non-null hypothesis and the null hypothesis. Our sequential test resolves the tradeoff among the exponential decay rates of misclassification, false reject and false alarm probabilities for the fixed-length test of Zhou et al. (2022). Finally, with a further step towards practical applications, we generalize our results to the cases of multiple outliers and show that there is a penalty in the error exponents when the number of outliers is unknown.},

  abstract     = {We consider the problem of covert communication with random slot selection over binary-input Discrete Memoryless Channels (DMCs) and Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) channels, in which a transmitter attempts to reliably communicate with a legitimate receiver while simultaneously maintaining covertness with respect to (w.r.t.) an eavesdropper. Covertness refers to the inability of the eavesdropper to distinguish the transmission of a message from the absence of communication, modeled by the transmission of a fixed channel input. Random slot selection refers to the transmitter‚Äôs ability to send a codeword in a time slot with known boundaries selected uniformly at random among a predetermined number of slots. Our main contribution is to develop bounds for the information-theoretic limit of communication in this model, called the covert capacity, when the number of time slots scales sub-exponentially with the codeword length. Our upper and lower bounds for the covert capacity are within a multiplicative factor of $\sqrt {2}$ independent of the channel. This result partially fills a characterization gap between the covert capacity without random slot selection and the covert capacity with random selection among an exponential number of slots in the codeword length. Our key technical contributions consist of 1) a tight upper bound for the relative entropy characterizing the effect of random slot selection on the covertness constraint in our achievability proof; 2) a careful converse analysis to characterize the maximum allowable weight or power of codewords to meet the covertness constraint. Our results suggest that, unlike the case without random slot selection, the choice of covertness metric does not change the covert capacity in the presence of random slot selection.},

Moreover, our achievability analysis is based on a coded-index strategy, implying that such strategies attain the highest error exponents within the broader class of codes that we consider. We then extend our results to other scaling regimes, including a super-linear number of reads, as well as several low-rate regimes.

  abstract     = {Reliability of sequential hypothesis testing can be greatly improved when the decision maker is given the freedom to adaptively take an action that determines the distribution of the current collected sample. Such advantage of sampling adaptivity has been realized since Chernoff‚Äôs seminal paper in 1959. While a large body of works have explored and investigated the gain of adaptivity, in the general multiple-hypothesis setting, the fundamental limits of individual error probabilities have not been fully understood. In particular, in the asymptotic regime as the expected stopping time tends to infinity, the error exponents are only characterized in specific cases, such as that of the total error probability. In this paper, we consider a general setup of active sequential multiple-hypothesis testing where at each time slot, a temporally varying subset of data sources (out of a known set) emerges from which the decision maker can select to collect samples, subject to a family of expected selection budget constraints. The selection of sources, understood as the ‚Äúaction‚Äù at each time slot, is constrained in a predefined action space. At the end of each time slot, the decision maker either decides to make the inference on the M hypotheses, or continues to observe the data sources for the next time slot. The optimal tradeoffs among $M(M-1)$ types of error exponents are characterized. A companion asymptotically optimal test that strikes the balance between exploration and exploitation is proposed to achieve any target error exponents within the region. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time in the literature to identify such tradeoffs among error exponents in active sequential hypothesis testing, and it uncovers the tension among different action taking policies even in the basic setting of Chernoff (1959).},

Using real-algebraic methods, we identify sufficient and almost necessary conditions for majorization in large samples or when using catalytic states under these support conditions. These conditions are given in terms of multivariate divergences that generalize the R√©nyi divergences. We notice that varying support conditions dramatically affect the relevant set of divergences.

If all possible sequences are transmitted with the same probability, then studying the input and output entropies becomes equivalent. For both the 1-deletion and 1-insertion channels, it is shown that among all sequences with a fixed number of runs, the input entropy is minimized for sequences with a skewed distribution of run lengths, and it is maximized for sequences with a balanced distribution of run lengths. Among our results, we establish a conjecture by Atashpendar et al., which claims that for the 1-deletion channel, the input entropy is maximized by the alternating sequences among all binary sequences. This conjecture is also verified for the 2-deletion channel, where it is proved that sequences with a single run minimize the input entropy.},

  abstract     = {Frequency-hopping sequences (FHSs) with low Hamming correlation and wide gaps significantly contribute to the anti-interference performance in FH communication systems. This paper investigates FHSs with optimal Hamming correlation and controlled minimum gaps. We start with the discussion of the upper bounds on the minimum gaps of uniform FHSs and then propose a general construction of optimal uniform wide-gap FHSs with length $2l$ and $3l$ , which includes the work by Li et al. in IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory, vol. 68, no. 1, 2022 as a special case. Furthermore, we present a recursive construction of FHSs with length $2l$ , which concatenate shorter sequences of known minimum gaps. It is shown that the resulting FHSs have the same Hamming correlation as the concatenation-ordering sequences. As applications, several known optimal FHSs are used to produce optimal FHSs with controlled minimum gaps.},

  abstract     = {In the realm of modern digital communication, cryptography, and signal processing, binary sequences with good correlation properties play a pivotal role. In the literature, considerable efforts have been dedicated to constructing good binary sequences of various lengths. As a consequence, numerous constructions of good binary sequences have been put forward. However, the majority of known constructions leverage the multiplicative cyclic group structure of finite fields $\mathbb {F}_{p^{n}}$ , where p is a prime and n is a positive integer. Recently, the authors made use of the cyclic group structure of all rational places of the rational function field over the finite field $\mathbb {F}_{p^{n}}$ , and firstly constructed good binary sequences of length $p^{n}+1$ via cyclotomic function fields over $\mathbb {F}_{p^{n}}$ for any prime p. This approach has paved a new way for constructing good binary sequences. Motivated by the above constructions, we exploit the cyclic group structure of rational points of elliptic curves to design a family of binary sequences of length $2^{n}+1+t$ with low correlation for many given integers $|t|\leqslant 2^{(n+2)/2}$ . Specifically, for any positive integer d with $\gcd (d,2^{n}+1+t)=1$ , we introduce a novel family of binary sequences of length $2^{n}+1+t$ , size $q^{d-1}-1$ , correlation bounded by $(2d+1) \cdot 2^{(n+2)/2}+ |t|$ , and large linear complexity via elliptic curves.},

  abstract     = {The ChaCha cipher holds significance due to its widespread use in real-world applications, which is crucial in ensuring secure communication protocols such as TLS and SSH. The cryptanalysis of ChaCha involves a differential-linear attack which exploits the idea of Probabilistic Neutral Bits (PNBs). For a long period, researchers predominantly focused on incorporating single-bit differences at the beginning of differential-linear distinguishers for devising key-recovery attacks on ChaCha. Notably, at ToSC 2023, Bellini et al. introduced an innovative approach: a differential-linear distinguisher spanning five rounds, which takes into account 2-bit differences at the beginning. The aforementioned 5-round distinguisher integrated with the PNB framework, resulting in an enhanced key recovery attack specifically tailored for a 7-round ChaCha cipher. In this paper, first, we revisit the work of Bellini et al. and show that their 7-round key recovery attacks on ChaCha are impractical due to insufficient data. Furthermore, upon a thorough reassessment of the syncopation technique outlined in Wang et al.‚Äôs paper, we observe that introducing specific conditions in the computation of backward bias amplifies the data complexity. In response to this hurdle, we introduce a novel technique to effectively leverage rejected data in the backward bias calculation with conditions. Subsequently, we formulate an adjusted data complexity formula incorporating all backward biases for the PNB-based attack approach. Second, we present a strategic data reduction technique to reduce the total data required for backward computation in each guess of non-PNB bits, consequently yielding a notable improvement in time complexity analysis. For the first time since 2008, our analysis reveals an important advancement in backward computation, reducing the number of non-PNB bit guesses and decreasing the amount of data required for each non-PNB bit guess during backward computation. These enhancements significantly elevate the effectiveness of PNB-based key recovery attacks. Finally, utilizing the aforementioned ideas, we propose an enhanced framework for a key recovery attack, specifically formalized for round-reduced ChaCha. Using novel techniques, our approach successfully breaks seven rounds of ChaCha, achieving a data complexity of $2^{101.15}$ and a time complexity of $2^{192.15}$ . Along with that, we have successfully presented our improved key recovery attack on ChaCha $7.5^{\oplus }$ (7.5 rounds of ChaCha without the last xor and left rotation) with data and time complexity as $2^{101.14}$ , and $2^{230.58}$ , respectively.},

  abstract     = {In this work, we consider the problem of distributed matrix-vector product, where a server distributes the task of the computation among n worker nodes. In particular, it is assumed that T matrix-vector products have to be computed, where the matrix remains constant, whereas the vector changes each time. It is assumed that L out of the n workers are compromised (but non-communicating) and may return incorrect results to the task assigned to them. Moreover, these compromised workers are unreliable, that is, each compromised worker may return an incorrect and correct result with probabilities $\alpha $ and $1-\alpha $ , respectively, at any given time. The server aims to identify this set of unreliable compromised workers so that it can remove them from future computations. This work proposes and analyzes three probabilistic group testing schemes to achieve this: 1) a noise-level-independent non-adaptive scheme, 2) a noise-level-dependent non-adaptive scheme, and 3) a noise-level-dependent two-stage adaptive scheme. In particular, the third scheme is shown to be order-optimal, up to a constant multiplicative factor, for certain regimes of $\alpha $ and L. Using the proposed group testing schemes, sparse parity-check codes are constructed, which are used in the considered distributed computing framework for encoding, decoding, and identifying the unreliable workers. This methodology has two distinct features: 1) the computational cost of identifying the set of L unreliable workers at the server is considerably lower than existing distributed computing methods in the literature, and 2) the encoding and decoding functions are computationally efficient.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we propose ByzSecAgg, an efficient secure aggregation scheme for federated learning that is resistant to Byzantine attacks and privacy leakages. Processing individual updates to manage adversarial behavior, while preserving the privacy of the data against colluding nodes, requires some sort of secure secret sharing. However, the communication load for secret sharing of long vectors of updates can be very high. In federated settings, where users are often edge devices with potential bandwidth constraints, excessive communication overhead is undesirable. ByzSecAgg solves this problem by partitioning local updates into smaller sub-vectors and sharing them using ramp secret sharing. However, this sharing method does not admit bilinear computations, such as pairwise distances calculations, which are needed for distance-based outlier-detection algorithms, and effective methods for mitigating Byzantine attacks. To overcome this issue, each user runs another round of ramp sharing, with a different embedding of the data in the sharing polynomial. This technique, motivated by ideas from coded computing, enables secure computation of pairwise distance. In addition, to maintain the integrity and privacy of the local update, ByzSecAgg also uses a vector commitment method, in which the commitment size remains constant (i.e., does not increase with the length of the local update), while simultaneously allowing verification of the secret sharing process. In terms of communication load, ByzSecAgg significantly outperforms the related baseline scheme, known as BREA.},

This class of risk measures not only includes established measures such as Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) as special cases but also broadens the horizon for exploring new risk measures. We propose a trajectory-based policy gradient method specifically tailored for PhiD-R, applicable across all forms of risk measures formed by different $\phi $ -divergence.

  abstract     = {The generalization error of a learning algorithm refers to the discrepancy between the loss of a learning algorithm on training data and that on unseen testing data. Various information-theoretic bounds on the generalization error have been derived in the literature, where the mutual information between the training data and the hypothesis (the output of the learning algorithm) plays an important role. Focusing on the individual sample mutual information bound by (Bu et al., 2020), which itself is a tightened version of the first bound on the topic by (Russo and Zou, 2016) and (Xu and Raginsky, 2017), this paper investigates the tightness of these bounds, in terms of the dependence of their convergence rates on the sample size n. It has been recognized that these bounds are in general not tight, readily verified for the exemplary quadratic Gaussian mean estimation problem, where the individual sample mutual information bound scales as $O(\sqrt {1/n})$ while the true generalization error scales as $O(1/n)$ . The first contribution of this paper is to show that the same bound can in fact be asymptotically tight if an appropriate assumption is made. In particular, we show that the fast rate can be recovered when the assumption is made on the excess risk instead of the loss function, which was usually done in existing literature. A theoretical justification is given for this choice. The second contribution of the paper is a new set of generalization error bounds based on the $(\eta, c)$ -central condition, a condition relatively easy to verify and has the property that the mutual information term directly determines the convergence rate of the bound. Several analytical and numerical examples are given to show the effectiveness of these bounds.},

  abstract     = {We study the problem of estimating a function in the presence of both speckle and additive noises, commonly referred to as the de-speckling problem. Although additive noise has been thoroughly explored in nonparametric estimation, speckle noise, prevalent in applications such as synthetic aperture radar, ultrasound imaging, and digital holography, has not received as much attention. Consequently, there is a lack of theoretical investigations into the fundamental limits of mitigating the speckle noise. This paper is the first step in filling this gap. Our focus is on investigating the minimax estimation error for estimating a $\beta $ -H√∂lder continuous function and determining the rate of the minimax risk. Specifically, if n represents the number of data points, f denotes the underlying function to be estimated, $\hat {\nu }_{n}$ is an estimate of f, and $\sigma _{n}$ is the standard deviation of the additive Gaussian noise, then $\inf _{\hat {\nu }_{n}} \sup _{f} \mathbb {E}_{f}\| \hat {\nu }_{n} {-} f \|^{2}_{2}$ decays at the rate $\left ({{\max (1,\sigma _{n}^{4})/n}}\right)^{\frac {2\beta }{2\beta +1}}$ . Comparing this rate with the rate achieved under purely additive noise, namely $\left ({{\sigma _{n}^{2}/n}}\right)^{\frac {2\beta }{2\beta +1}}$ , leads to the following insights: 1) When $ \sigma _{n} = \omega (1) $ , the additive noise appears to be the dominant component in the de-speckling problem. However, the presence of speckle noise significantly complicates the task of mitigating its effects. As a result, the risk increases from the rate $ \left ({{ \sigma _{n}^{2} / n }}\right)^{\frac {2\beta }{2\beta +1}} $ , which characterizes the problem with only additive noise, to $ \left ({{ \sigma _{n}^{4} / n }}\right)^{\frac {2\beta }{2\beta +1}} $ in the presence of both speckle and additive noise. 2) When $ \sigma _{n} = o(1) $ , the variance of the additive noise does not contribute to the risk in the de-speckling problem. This suggests that, in this regime, speckle noise is the primary bottleneck. Interestingly, the resulting risk rate matches the rate for mitigating purely additive noise with $ \sigma _{n} = \Theta (1) $ . 3) When $\sigma _{n} = \Theta (1)$ , the two rates coincide, suggesting that both the speckle noise and additive noise are contributing to the overall error.},

  abstract     = {In contemporary deep learning practice, models are often trained to near zero loss i.e. to nearly interpolate the training data. However, the number of parameters in the model is usually far more than the number of data points n, the theoretical minimum needed for interpolation: a phenomenon referred to as overparameterization. In an interesting piece of work that contributes to the considerable research that has been devoted to understand overparameterization, Bubeck and Sellke considered a natural notion of what it means for a model to interpolate: the model is said to interpolate when the model‚Äôs training loss goes below the loss of the conditional expectation of the response given the covariate. For this notion of interpolation and for a broad class of covariate distributions (specifically those satisfying a natural notion of concentration of measure), they showed that overparameterization is necessary for robust interpolation i.e. if the interpolating function is required to be Lipschitz. Their main proof technique applies to regression with square loss against a scalar response, but they remark that via a connection to Rademacher complexity and using tools such as the Ledoux-Talagrand contraction inequality, their result can be extended to more general losses, at least in the case of scalar response variables. In this work, we recast the original proof technique of Bubeck and Sellke in terms of a bias-variance type decomposition, and show that this view directly unlocks a generalization to Bregman divergence losses (even for vector-valued responses), without the use of tools such as Rademacher complexity or the Ledoux-Talagrand contraction principle. Bregman divergences are a natural class of losses since for these, the best estimator is the conditional expectation of the response given the covariate, and in particular, include other practical losses such as the cross entropy loss. Our work thus gives a more general understanding of the main proof technique of Bubeck and Sellke and demonstrates its broad utility.},

  abstract     = {Adversarial training (AT) is a canonical method for enhancing the robustness of deep neural networks (DNNs). However, recent studies empirically demonstrated that it suffers from robust overfitting, i.e., a long time AT can be detrimental to the robustness of DNNs. This paper presents a theoretical explanation of robust overfitting for DNNs. Specifically, we non-trivially extend the neural tangent kernel (NTK) theory to AT and prove that an adversarially trained wide DNN can be well approximated by a linearized DNN. Moreover, for squared loss, closed-form AT dynamics for the linearized DNN can be derived, which reveals a new AT degeneration phenomenon: a long-term AT will result in a wide DNN degenerates to that obtained without AT and thus cause robust overfitting. Based on our theoretical results, we further design a method namely Adv-NTK, the first AT algorithm for infinite-width DNNs. Experiments on real-world datasets show that Adv-NTK can help infinite-width DNNs enhance comparable robustness to that of their finite-width counterparts, which in turn justifies our theoretical findings.

It takes advantage of approximation capabilities of neural networks for functions in some Barron classes and leads to reduced computation cost compared to other dimension reduction methods in the literature.

  abstract     = {In this paper, under the assumption that the dimension is much larger than the sample size, i.e., $p \asymp n^{\alpha }, \alpha \gt 1$ , we consider the sample covariance matrices $Q = \Sigma ^{1/2} XX^{*}\Sigma ^{1/2}$ , where $X=(x_{ij})$ is a $p \times n$ random matrix with centered i.i.d. entries whose variances are $(pn)^{-1/2}$ , and $\Sigma $ is the deterministic population covariance matrix. This ultra-high dimensional setting is increasingly relevant in various applications in information theory, communications, and signal processing, such as massive MIMO, compressed sensing, and large-scale sensor networks. We establish two classes of central limit theorems (CLTs) for the linear spectral statistics (LSS) of Q, the global CLTs on the macroscopic scales where all the eigenvalues will be used, and the local CLTs on the mesoscopic scales where only part of the eigenvalues will be utilized. We prove that the LSS converge to some Gaussian processes whose mean and covariance functions, depending on $\Sigma $ , the ratio $p/n$ , and the test functions, can be identified explicitly on both macroscopic and mesoscopic scales. We also show that even though the global CLTs depend on the fourth cumulant of $x_{ij}$ , the local CLTs do not. Leveraging these results, we propose two classes of statistics for testing the structures of $\Sigma $ , the global statistics and the local statistics, and analyze their superior power under general local alternatives. To our best knowledge, the local LSS testing statistics, which do not rely on the fourth moment of $x_{ij}$ , are used for the first time in hypothesis testing while the literature mostly uses the global statistics and requires prior knowledge of the fourth moment. Numerical simulations also confirm the accuracy and powerfulness of our proposed statistics and illustrate better performance compared to the existing methods in the literature.},

  abstract     = {Deep neural networks (DNNs) exhibit an exceptional capacity for generalization in practical applications. This work aims to capture the effect and benefits of depth for supervised learning via information-theoretic generalization bounds. We first derive two hierarchical bounds on the generalization error in terms of the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence or the 1-Wasserstein distance between the train and test distributions of the network internal representations. The KL divergence bound shrinks as the layer index increases, while the Wasserstein bound implies the existence of a layer that serves as a generalization funnel, which attains a minimal 1-Wasserstein distance. Analytic expressions for both bounds are derived under the setting of binary Gaussian classification with linear DNNs. To quantify the contraction of the relevant information measures when moving deeper into the network, we analyze the strong data processing inequality (SDPI) coefficient between consecutive layers of three regularized DNN models: $\textsf {Dropout}$ , $\textsf {DropConnect}$ , and Gaussian noise injection. This enables refining our generalization bounds to capture the contraction as a function of the network architecture parameters. Specializing our results to DNNs with a finite parameter space and the Gibbs algorithm reveals that deeper yet narrower network architectures generalize better in those examples, although how broadly this statement applies remains a question.},

Two regularizations are considered: $(a)$ the relative entropy of the measure to be optimized with respect to a reference measure (Type-I ERM-RER); and $(b)$ the relative entropy of the reference measure with respect to the measure to be optimized (Type-II ERM-RER). The main result is the characterization of the solution to the Type-II ERM-RER problem and its key properties. By comparing the well-understood Type-I ERM-RER with Type-II ERM-RER, the effects of entropy asymmetry are highlighted. The analysis shows that in both cases, regularization by relative entropy forces the support of the solution to collapse into the support of the reference measure, introducing a strong inductive bias that negates the evidence provided by the training data. Finally, it is shown that Type-II regularization is equivalent to Type-I regularization with an appropriate transformation of the empirical risk function.},

However, they are not well explored for high-dimensional or non-Euclidean data. This paper proposes a new method, Rank INduced by Graph Change-Point Detection (RING-CPD), which utilizes graph-induced ranks to handle high-dimensional and non-Euclidean data. The new method is asymptotically distribution-free under the null hypothesis, and an analytic p-value approximation is provided for easy type-I error control. Simulation studies show that RING-CPD effectively detects change points across a wide range of alternatives and is also robust to heavy-tailed distribution and outliers. The new method is illustrated by the detection of seizures in a functional connectivity network dataset, changes in digit images, and travel pattern changes in the New York City Taxi dataset.},

  abstract     = {Quantum channel capacities give the fundamental performance limits for information flow over a communication channel. However, the prevalence of superadditivity is a major obstacle to understanding capacities, both quantitatively and conceptually. In contrast, examples exhibiting additivity, though relatively rare, offer crucial insights into the origins of nonadditivity and form the basis of our strongest upper bounds on capacity. Degradable channels, whose coherent information is provably additive, stand out as among the few classes of channels for which the quantum capacity is exactly computable. In this paper, we introduce two families of non-degradable channels whose coherent information remains additive, making their quantum capacities tractable. First, we demonstrate that channels capable of ‚Äúoutperforming‚Äù their environment, under conditions weaker than degradability, can exhibit either strong or weak additivity of coherent information. Second, we explore a complementary construction that modifies a channel to preserve coherent information additivity while destroying the ‚Äúoutperforming‚Äù property. We analyze how structural constraints guarantee strong and weak additivity and investigate how relaxing these constraints leads to the failure of strong additivity, with weak additivity potentially persisting.},

Bosonic quantum systems constitute the mathematical model for the electromagnetic radiation in the quantum regime, which provides the most promising platform for quantum communication and quantum key distribution. We apply our multimode conditional quantum Entropy Power Inequality to determine new lower bounds to the squashed entanglement of a large family of bosonic quantum Gaussian states. The squashed entanglement is one of the main entanglement measures in quantum communication theory, providing the best known upper bound to the distillable key. Exploiting this result, we determine a new lower bound to the squashed entanglement of the multimode bosonic Gaussian channels that are extreme, i.e., that cannot be decomposed as a non-trivial convex combination of quantum channels. The squashed entanglement of a quantum channel provides an upper bound to its secret-key capacity, i.e., the capacity to generate a secret key shared between the sender and the receiver. Lower bounds to the squashed entanglement are notoriously hard to prove.

  abstract     = {Understanding the classical communication cost of simulating a quantum channel is a fundamental problem in quantum information theory, which becomes even more intriguing when considering the role of non-locality in quantum information processing. This paper investigates the bidirectional classical communication cost of simulating a bipartite quantum channel assisted by non-signalling correlations, which are permitted across the spatial dimension between the two parties. By introducing non-signalling superchannels, we present lower and upper bounds on the one-shot $\epsilon $ -error one-way classical communication cost of a bipartite channel via its smooth max-relative entropy of one-way classical communication, and establish that the asymptotic exact cost is given by its max-relative entropy of one-way classical communication. For the bidirectional scenario, we derive semidefinite programming (SDP) formulations for the one-shot exact bidirectional classical communication cost via non-signalling bipartite superchannels. We further introduce a channel‚Äôs bipartite conditional min-entropy as an efficiently computable lower bound on the asymptotic cost of bidirectional classical communication. Our results in both one-shot and asymptotic settings provide lower bounds on the entanglement-assisted simulation cost in scenarios where entanglement is available to the two parties. Moreover, we propose a seesaw-based algorithm to compute an upper bound on the minimum simulation error via local operations and shared entanglement, which provides valuable insights into the relationship between non-signalling bipartite superchannels and more physically realizable protocols. Numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our bounds in estimating communication costs for various quantum channels, showing that our bounds can be tight in different scenarios. Our results elucidate the role of non-locality in quantum communication and pave the way for exploring quantum reverse Shannon theory in bipartite scenarios.},

  abstract     = {Quantum communication relies on the existence of high quality quantum channels to exchange information. In practice, however, all communication links are affected by noise from the environment. Here we investigate the ability of quantum channels to perform quantum communication tasks by restricting the participants to use only local operations and one-way classical communication (one-way LOCC) along with the available quantum channel. In particular, a channel can be used to distill a highly entangled state between two parties, which further enables quantum or private communication. In this work, we invoke the framework of superchannels to study the distillation of a resourceful quantum state, such as a maximally entangled state or a private state, using multiple instances of a point-to-point quantum channel. We use the idea of k-extendibility to obtain a semidefinite relaxation of the set of one-way LOCC superchannels and define a class of entanglement measures for quantum channels that decrease monotonically under such superchannels; therefore these measures, dubbed collectively the ‚Äúunextendible entanglement of a channel‚Äù, yield upper bounds on several communication-theoretic quantities of interest in the regimes of resource distillation and zero error. We then generalize the formalism of k-extendibility to bipartite superchannels, thus obtaining functions that are monotone under two-extendible superchannels. This allows us to analyze probabilistic distillation of ebits or secret key bits from a bipartite state when using a resourceful quantum channel. Moreover, we propose semidefinite programs to evaluate several of these quantities, providing a computationally feasible method of comparison between quantum channels for resource distillation.},

  abstract     = {The recently-emerging field of higher order MDS codes has sought to unify a number of concepts in coding theory. Such areas captured by higher order MDS codes include maximally recoverable (MR) tensor codes, codes with optimal list-decoding guarantees, and codes with constrained generator matrices (as in the GM-MDS theorem). By proving these equivalences, Brakensiek et al. (2024) showed the existence of optimally list-decodable Reed-Solomon codes over exponential sized fields. Building on this, recent breakthroughs by Guo and Zhang (2023) and Alrabiah et al. (2024) have shown that randomly punctured Reed-Solomon codes achieve list-decoding capacity (which is a relaxation of optimal list-decodability) over linear size fields. We extend these works by developing a formal theory of relaxed higher order MDS codes. In particular, we show that there are two inequivalent relaxations which we call lower and upper relaxations. The lower relaxation is equivalent to relaxed optimal list-decodable codes and the upper relaxation is equivalent to relaxed MR tensor codes with a single parity check per column. We then generalize the techniques of Guo-Zhang and Alrabiah-Guruswami-Li to show that both these relaxations can be constructed by randomly puncturing suitable algebraic-geometric codes over constant size fields. For this, we crucially use the generalized GM-MDS theorem for polynomial codes recently proved by Brakensiek et al. (2024). We obtain the following corollaries from our main result: 1) randomly punctured algebraic-geometric codes of rate R are list-decodable up to radius $\frac {L}{L+1}(1-R-\epsilon)$ with list size L over fields of size $\exp (O(L/\epsilon))$ . In particular, they achieve list-decoding capacity with list size $O(1/\epsilon)$ and field size $\exp (O(1/\epsilon ^{2}))$ . Prior to this work, AG codes were not even known to achieve list-decoding capacity; and 2) by randomly puncturing algebraic-geometric codes, we can construct relaxed MR tensor codes with a single parity check per column over constant-sized fields, whereas (non-relaxed) MR tensor codes require exponential field size.},

  abstract     = {Projection-aggregation decoding provides state-of-the-art performance for decoding Reed-Muller codes. This type of decoding relies on projecting onto subspaces, decoding the projections, and voting with the decoded projections. This paper investigates the decoding with a limited number of subspaces. By defining a false vote matrix, it demonstrates that this decoding suffers from coset error patterns, even when all projections are decoded successfully. These error patterns are of very small weights and thus induce a significant performance loss. Two rules are then proposed of which one reveals a trade-off between the subspace number and the error-correcting capability and the other provides a guideline for subspace selection. Simulation results verify that following the two rules alleviates the performance loss caused by the coset error patterns.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we introduce an explicit family of subcodes of Reed-Solomon (RS) codes that efficiently achieve list decoding capacity with a constant output list size. The codes are constructed by initially forming the tensor product of two RS codes with carefully selected evaluation sets, followed by specific cyclic shifts to the codeword rows. This process results in each codeword column being treated as an individual coordinate, reminiscent of prior capacity-achieving codes, such as folded RS codes and univariate multiplicity codes. This construction is easily shown to be a subcode of an interleaved RS code, equivalently, an RS code evaluated on a subfield. Alternatively, the codes can be constructed by the evaluation of bivariate polynomials over orbits generated by two affine transformations with coprime orders, extending the earlier use of a single affine transformation in folded RS codes and the recent affine folded RS codes introduced by Bhandari et al. (IEEE T-IT, Feb. 2024). While our codes require large, yet constant characteristic, the two affine transformations facilitate achieving code length equal to the field size, without the restriction of the field being prime, contrasting with univariate multiplicity codes.},

We use this function dependent graph to get a lower bound on the redundancy required for function correction codes. Considering the function to be a bijection, leads to a lower bound on the redundancy required for classical systematic error correcting codes (ECCs). We propose a range of parameters for which this bound is tight. For single error correcting codes, we show that this bound is at least as good as a bound proposed by Zinoviev et al. in 1998. Thus, this framework helps to study classical systematic error correcting codes. Further, we study the structure of this function dependent graph for linear functions, which leads to bounds on the redundancy of linear-function correcting codes. We show that the Plotkin-like bound for function-correcting codes proposed by Lenz et.al 2023 is simplified for linear functions. We identify a class of linear functions for which an upper bound proposed by Lenz et al., is tight and also identify a class of functions for which coset-wise coding is equivalent to a lower dimensional classical error correction problem.},

  abstract     = {Nanopore sequencing is a promising technology for DNA sequencing. In this paper, we investigate a specific model of the nanopore sequencer, which takes a q-ary sequence of length n as input and outputs a vector of length $n+\ell -1$ referred to as an $\ell $ -read vector where the i-th entry is a multi-set composed of the $\ell $ elements located between the $(i-\ell +1)$ -th and i-th positions of the input sequence. Considering the presence of substitution errors in the output vector, we study $\ell $ -read codes under the Hamming metric. An $\ell $ -read $(n,d)_{q}$ -code is a set of q-ary sequences of length n in which the Hamming distance between $\ell $ -read vectors of any two distinct sequences is at least d. Here, the Hamming distance between two $\ell $ -read vectors is defined as the number of positions at which the corresponding multi-sets differ. We first improve the result of Banerjee et al., who studied $\ell $ -read $(n,d)_{q}$ -codes with the constraint $\ell \geq 3$ and $d=3$ . Then, we investigate the bounds and constructions of 2-read codes with a minimum distance of 3, 4, and 5, respectively. Our results indicate that when $d \in \{3,4\}$ , the optimal redundancy of 2-read $(n,d)_{q}$ -codes is $o(\log _{q} n)$ , while for $d=5$ it is $\log _{q} n+o(\log _{q} n)$ . Additionally, we establish an equivalence between 2-read $(n,3)_{q}$ -codes and classical q-ary single-insertion reconstruction codes using two distinct noisy reads. We improve the lower bound on the redundancy of classical q-ary single-insertion reconstruction codes as well as the upper bound on the redundancy of classical q-ary single-deletion reconstruction codes when using two distinct noisy reads.},

  abstract     = {This paper investigates three closely related topics‚ÄîR√©nyi resolvability, noise stability, and anti-contractivity. The R√©nyi resolvability problem refers to approximating a target output distribution of a given channel in the R√©nyi divergence when the input is set to a function of a given uniform random variable. This problem for the R√©nyi parameter in ( $0,2]\cup \{\infty \}$ was first studied by the present author and Tan in 2019. In the present paper, we provide a complete solution to this problem for the R√©nyi parameter in the entire range $\mathbb {R}\cup \{\pm \infty \}$ . We then connect the R√©nyi resolvability problem to the noise stability problem, by observing that maximizing or minimizing the q-stability of a set is equivalent to a variant of the R√©nyi resolvability problem. By such a connection, we provide sharp dimension-free bounds on the q-stability. We lastly relate the noise stability problem to the anti-contractivity of a Markov operator (i.e., conditional expectation operator), where the terminology ‚Äúanti-contractivity‚Äù introduced by us refers to as the opposite property of the well-known contractivity/hyercontractivity. We derive sharp dimension-free anti-contractivity inequalities. All of the results in this paper are evaluated for binary distributions. Our proofs in this paper are mainly based on the method of types, especially strengthened versions of packing-covering lemmas.},

  abstract     = {The R√©nyi Information Dimension (RID) is a fundamental measure for quantifying the compressibility of random variables with singularities in their distributions, extending beyond classical notions of sparsity. At a high level, RID represents the average number of bits required to encode i.i.d. samples of a random variable with high precision. For stochastic processes, two main extensions of RID exist: the information dimension rate (IDR) and the block information dimension (BID). A more recent approach to characterizing the compressibility of stochastic processes is through $\epsilon $ -achievable compression rates, which treat a random process as the limit of finite-dimensional random vectors and leverage tools from compressed sensing. However, the interplay between BID, IDR, and $\epsilon $ -achievable compression rates remains poorly understood. Furthermore, explicit values of IDR and BID are known only for a limited class of processes, such as i.i.d. sequences (i.e., discrete-time white noise) and moving-average (MA) processes. This paper investigates the IDR and BID of discrete-time Auto-Regressive Moving-Average (ARMA) processes and their relationship with $\epsilon $ -achievable compression rates when the excitation noise follows a discrete-continuous distribution. Specifically, we show that the RID and $\epsilon $ -achievable compression rates of such ARMA processes are equal to those of their excitation noise. In other words, despite the fact that ARMA process samples are not sparse, their compressibility matches that of their sparse excitation noise. To establish this result, we demonstrate that the singular components of the sample distribution are supported on affine sets, with relative dimensions that concentrate around the BID. Leveraging a known result on typical affinely singular sources, we further prove that in this setting, the RID coincides with $\epsilon $ -achievable compression rates. The findings of this paper provide new insights into the compressibility of locally correlated data with finite- or infinite-memory, which are commonly modeled using ARMA processes.},

The proof relies on analyzing how additive noise, determined by a random element of the code from the ensemble, acts on the source distribution. This action leads to the transformation of the source distribution into an approximately uniform one, a process commonly referred to as distribution smoothing.

  abstract     = {A $(v,k,\lambda)$ -difference set in a group G of order v is a subset $\{d_{1}, d_{2}, \ldots ,d_{k}\}$ of G such that $D=\sum d_{i}$ in the group ring ${\mathbb {Z}}[G]$ satisfies: $D D^{-1} = n + \lambda G$ , where $n=k-\lambda $ . In other words, the nonzero elements of G all occur exactly $\lambda $ times as differences of elements in D. A $(v,k,\lambda ,t)$ -almost difference set has t nonzero elements of G occurring $\lambda $ times, and the other $v-1-t$ occurring $\lambda +1$ times. When $\lambda =0$ , this is equivalent to a modular Golomb ruler. In this paper we investigate existence questions on these objects, and extend previous results constructing almost difference sets by adding or removing an element from a difference set. We also show for which primes the octic residues, with or without zero, form an almost difference set.},

In previous works, the restriction that each channel provides a unique output word has been essential. In this work, we assume only that each channel introduces a unique set of errors to the transmitted word and hence, some output words can also be identical. As we will discuss, this interpretation is both natural and useful for deletion and insertion errors. We give properties, techniques and (optimal) results for this situation. Quaternary alphabets are relevant due to applications related to DNA-memories. Hence, we introduce an efficient Las Vegas style decoding algorithm for simultaneous insertion, deletion and substitution errors in q-ary Hamming spaces for $q \geq 4$ .},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we first explore the underlying mathematical structure of edge subsets on a finite directed acyclic graph in using a lattice-theoretic approach. We prove that a collection of edge subsets, depending on different conditions it satisfies, together with the corresponding ‚Äúcut-separating‚Äù partial order, can form a meet-semilattice, a join-semilattice or a lattice. The bottom and top thus derived generalize the concept of the primary minimum cut introduced by Guang and Yeung (2018) and hence we provide a new way from the lattice-theoretic point of view to understand the primary minimum cut and its existence and uniqueness. The introduced concepts and obtained results regarded as a bridge connect graph theory and lattice theory, which appear to be of fundamental interest in graph theory, lattice theory, and even beyond. In addition, we consider linear network error correction (LNEC) coding when errors may occur on edges of a communication network of which the topology is known. In LNEC coding, the minimum required field size for the existence of LNEC codes, in particular LNEC maximum distance separable (MDS) codes which are regarded as a most important type of optimal codes, is an open problem not only of theoretical interest but also of practical importance. By applying the approach of the above edge-subset (semi-)lattice, we obtain an improved upper bound on the minimum required field size for the existence of LNEC (MDS) codes. We quantify the improvement over the existing results by both theoretical analysis and numerical simulations and thus show that the improvement is in general significant. The improved upper bound, which is graph-theoretic, depends only on the network topology and requirement of the error correction capability but not on a specific code construction. We also develop an efficient algorithm that can compute the bound in a linear time of the number of edges.},

  abstract     = {Coded computation is an emerging paradigm of applying coding theory to large-scale distributed computing to provide resilience against slow or otherwise unavailable workers. We propose a new approach to view coded computation via the lens of the locality of codes. We do so by defining a new notion of locality, called computational locality, using the locality properties of an appropriately defined code for the function being computed. This notion of locality incorporates the unique aspects of locality arising in the context of coded computation. Our first major contribution is to demonstrate how to design a coded computation scheme for a function using the local recovery scheme of an appropriately defined code. The so-obtained scheme rederives the best known coded computation scheme for multivariate polynomial functions via the viewpoint of the locality of the Reed-Muller code. Our second major contribution is to show that the proposed locality-based approach enables new tradeoffs (e.g., communication bandwidth vs number of workers) compared to existing coded computation schemes. Specifically for the case when there is known linear dependence among inputs‚Äîcommon in many real-world applications‚Äîthe proposed approach significantly reduces resource overhead (i.e., number of workers) without incurring any tradeoffs.},

  abstract     = {Coding theory revolves around the incorporation of redundancy into transmitted symbols, computation tasks, and stored data to guard against adversarial manipulation. However, error correction in coding theory is contingent upon a strict trust assumption. In the context of computation and storage, it is required that honest nodes outnumber adversarial ones by a certain margin. However, in several emerging real-world cases, particularly, in decentralized blockchain-oriented applications, such assumptions are often unrealistic. Consequently, despite the important role of coding in addressing significant challenges within decentralized systems, its applications become constrained. Still, in decentralized platforms, a distinctive characteristic emerges, offering new avenues for secure coding beyond the constraints of conventional methods. In these scenarios, the adversary benefits when the legitimate decoder recovers the data, and preferably with a high estimation error. This incentive motivates them to act rationally, trying to maximize their gains. In this paper, we propose a game theoretic formulation for coding, called the game of coding, that captures this unique dynamic where each of the adversaries and the data collector (decoder) have respective utility functions to optimize. The utility functions reflect the fact that both the data collector and the adversary are interested in increasing the chance of data being recoverable by the data collector. Moreover, the utility functions express the interest of the data collector to estimate the input with lower estimation error, but the opposite interest of the adversary. As a first, still highly non-trivial step, we characterize the equilibrium of the game for the repetition code with a repetition factor of 2 for a wide class of utility functions with minimal assumptions.},

Detection performance with finite-length observations is also demonstrated through a simulation example of spectrum sensing.

In this paper, we focus on the problem of robust sequential change-point detection in the presence of a small proportion of random outliers. We first study the statistical detection properties of a general family of detection procedures under Huber‚Äôs gross error model. Moreover, we incorporate ideas of the breakdown point and the influence function from the classical offline robust statistics literature and propose their new definitions to quantify the robustness of general sequential change-point detection procedures. Then, we derive the breakdown points and influence functions of our proposed family of detection procedures, which provide a quantitative analysis of the robustness of these procedures. Moreover, we find the optimal robust bounded-influence procedure in that general family that has the smallest detection delay subject to the constraints on the false alarm rate influence function. It turns out the optimal procedure is based on truncation of the scaled likelihood ratio statistic and has a simple form. Finally, we demonstrate the robustness and the detection efficiency of the optimal robust bounded-influence procedure through extensive simulations and compute numerical approximations of breakdown points and influence functions of some procedures to have a quantitative understanding of the robustness of different procedures.},

This paper introduces a generalized framework for time-varying batch-averaged Q-learning, termed sample-averaged Q-learning (SA-QL), which extends traditional single-sample Q-learning by aggregating samples of rewards and next states to better account for data variability and uncertainty. We leverage the functional central limit theorem (FCLT) to establish a novel framework that provides insights into the asymptotic normality of the sample-averaged algorithm under mild conditions. Additionally, we develop a random scaling method for interval estimation, enabling the construction of confidence intervals without requiring extra hyperparameters. Extensive numerical experiments across classic stochastic OpenAI Gym environments, including windy gridworld and slippery frozenlake, demonstrate how different batch scheduling strategies affect learning efficiency, coverage rates, and confidence interval widths. This work establishes a unified theoretical foundation for sample-averaged Q-learning, providing insights into effective batch scheduling and statistical inference for RL algorithms.},

Most existing studies focus on the behavior of stand-alone single-agent learners. In comparison, this work studies adversarial training over graphs, where individual agents are subjected to perturbations of varied strength levels across space. It is expected that interactions by linked agents, and the heterogeneity of the attack models that are possible over the graph, can help enhance robustness in view of the coordination power of the group. Using a min-max formulation of distributed learning, we develop a decentralized adversarial training framework for multi-agent systems. Specifically, we devise two decentralized adversarial training algorithms by relying on two popular decentralized learning strategies-diffusion and consensus. We analyze the convergence properties of the proposed framework for strongly-convex, convex, and non-convex environments, and illustrate the enhanced robustness to adversarial attacks.},

When the target function is contained in the variation space corresponding to the dictionary, many impressive works over the past few decades have obtained upper and lower bounds on the error $\|f-f_{n}\|$ of matching pursuit, but they do not match. The main contribution of this paper is to close this gap and obtain a sharp characterization of the decay rate, $n^{-\alpha }$ , of matching pursuit. Specifically, we construct a worst-case dictionary which shows that the best-known upper bound cannot be substantially improved. It turns out that, unlike other greedy algorithm variants which converge at the optimal rate of $ n^{-1/2}$ , the convergence rate of $n^{-\alpha }$ is suboptimal. Here, $\alpha \approx 0.182$ is determined by the solution to a certain non-linear equation.},

LRMC involves recovering an $n \times q$ rank-r matrix ${\boldsymbol {X}}^{\star } $ from a subset of its entries when $r \ll \min (n,q)$ . Our theoretical bounds on the sample complexity and iteration complexity of AltGDmin imply that it is the most communication-efficient solution while also been one of the most computation- and sample-efficient ones. We also extend our guarantee to the noisy LRMC setting. In addition, we show how our lemmas can be used to provide an improved sample complexity guarantee for the Alternating Minimization (AltMin) algorithm for LRMC. AltMin is one of the fastest centralized solutions for LRMC; with AltGDmin having comparable time cost even for the centralized setting.},

  abstract     = {We generalise the implementation of logical quantum gates via Dehn twists from topological codes to the hypergraph and balanced products of cyclic codes. These generalised Dehn twists implement logical entangling gates with no additional qubit overhead and $\mathcal {O}(d)$ time overhead. Due to having more logical degrees of freedom in the codes, there is a richer structure of attainable logical gates compared to those for topological codes. To illustrate the scheme, we focus on families of hypergraph and balanced product codes that scale as $[[18q^{2},8,2q]]_{q\in \mathbb {N}}$ and $[[18q,8,\leq 2q]]_{q\in \mathbb {N}}$ respectively. For distance 6 to 12 hypergraph product codes, we find that the set of twists and fold-transversal gates generate the full logical Clifford group. For the balanced product code, we show that Dehn twists apply to codes in this family with odd q. We also show that the $[[{90,8,10}]]$ bivariate bicycle code is a member of the balanced product code family that saturates the distance bound, and find other balanced product codes that saturate the bound up to $q\leq 8$ through a numerical search.},

Rather, as in the preceding research, we use unitary t-designs to generate mixed tensor-product unitary channels acting on $(\mathbb C^{d})^{\otimes t}$ . Although our bounds in Schatten p-norm are valid only for $1\leq p \leq 2$ , we show that they are typically quantum $\epsilon $ -twirling channels with the tail bound proportional to $1/\mathrm {poly}(d^{t})$ , while such bounds were previously constants. The number of required Kraus operators was also improved by powers of $\log d$ and t, to be proportional to $td^{t}\log d / \epsilon ^{2}$ . Such random quantum channels are also typically quantum expanders, but the number of Kraus operators must grow proportionally to $t \log d$ in our case. Finally, a new non-unital model of super-operators generated by bounded and isotropic random Kraus operators was introduced, which can be typically rectified to yield almost randomizing quantum channels and quantum expanders.},

In this work, we propose the concept of virtual quantum Markov chains (VQMCs), focusing on scenarios where subsystems retain classical information about global systems from measurement statistics. As a generalization of quantum Markov chains, VQMCs characterize states where arbitrary global shadow information can be recovered from subsystems through local quantum operations and measurements. We present an algebraic characterization for virtual quantum Markov chains and show that the virtual quantum recovery is fully determined by the block matrices of a quantum state on its subsystems. Notably, we find a distinction between two classes of tripartite entanglement by showing that the W state is a VQMC while the GHZ state is not. Furthermore, we introduce the virtual non-Markovianity to quantify the non-Markovianity of a given quantum state, which also assesses the optimal sampling overhead for virtually recovering this state. Our findings elucidate distinctions between quantum Markov chains and virtual quantum Markov chains, extending our understanding of quantum recovery to scenarios prioritizing classical information from measurement statistics.},

  abstract     = {The optimal quantum communication cost of computing a classical sum of distributed sources is studied over a quantum erasure multiple access channel (QEMAC). K classical messages comprised of finite-field symbols are distributed across S servers, who also share quantum entanglement in advance. Each server $s\in [S]$ manipulates its quantum subsystem ${\mathcal {Q}}_{s}$ according to its own available classical messages and sends ${\mathcal {Q}}_{s}$ to the receiver who then computes the sum of the messages based on a joint quantum measurement. The download cost from Server $s\in [S]$ is the logarithm of the dimension of ${\mathcal {Q}}_{s}$ . The rate R is defined as the number of instances of the sum computed at the receiver, divided by the total download cost from all the servers. The main focus is on the symmetric setting with $K= {\binom {S }{\alpha }} $ messages where each message is replicated among a unique subset of $\alpha $ servers, and the answers from any $\beta $ servers may be erased. If no entanglement is initially available to the receiver, then we show that the capacity (maximal rate) is precisely $C= \max \left \{{{ \min \left \{{{ \frac {2(\alpha -\beta)}{S}, \frac {S-2\beta }{S} }}\right \}, \frac {\alpha -\beta }{S} }}\right \}$ . The capacity with arbitrary levels of prior entanglement $(\Delta _{0})$ between the S data-servers and the receiver is also characterized, by including an auxiliary server (Server 0) that has no classical data, so that the communication cost from Server 0 is a proxy for the amount of receiver-side entanglement that is available in advance. The challenge on the converse side resides in the optimal application of the weak monotonicity property, while the achievability combines ideas from classical network coding and treating qudits as classical dits, as well as new constructions based on the N-sum box abstraction that rely on absolutely maximally entangled quantum states.},

We provide a general theoretical framework, from which the proofs of a general formula for the UCR capacity and general bounds on the $\epsilon $ -UCR capacity of the specified model follow as special cases. The UCR capacity is defined as the maximum achievable CR rate such that the two terminals can agree on a common uniform or nearly uniform random variable with probability arbitrarily close to one, whereas the $\epsilon $ -UCR capacity is defined as the maximum CR rate that can be achieved such that the probability that the two terminals do not agree on a common uniform or nearly uniform random variable does not exceed $\epsilon $ , where $0 \lt \epsilon \lt 1$ is fixed. The established general formula for the UCR capacity depends on a formula characterizing the transmission capacity of arbitrary point-to-point channels, as elaborated by Verd√∫ and Han. The derived general lower and upper bounds on the $\epsilon $ -UCR capacity depend on corresponding lower and upper bounds on the $\epsilon $ -transmission capacity, as proved by Verd√∫ and Han for arbitrary point-to-point channels. Since we are considering general channels, the derived bounds are equal except possibly for at most countably many points, where discontinuity issues might arise. We further provide two examples of channels for which the established bounds are equal and investigate the left-continuity and monotonicity of the derived lower bound.},

We start by deriving the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM) for the channel parameters that are present in the signals received from LEOs in the same or multiple constellations during multiple transmission time slots. To accomplish this, we define a system model that captures i) time offset between LEOs caused by having relatively cheap clocks, ii) frequency offset between LEOs, iii) the unknown Doppler rate caused by high mobility LEOs, and iv) multiple transmission time slots from a particular LEO. We transform the FIM for the channel parameters to the FIM for the location parameters and determine the required conditions for localization. To do this, we start with the 3D localization cases: i) 3D positioning with known velocity and orientation, ii) 3D orientation estimation with known position and velocity, and iii) 3D velocity estimation with known position and orientation. Subsequently, we derive the FIM for the full 9D localization case (3D position, 3D orientation, and 3D velocity estimation) in terms of the FIM for the 3D localization. Using these results, we determine the number of LEOs, the operating frequency, the number of transmission time slots, and the number of receive antennas that allow for different levels of location estimation. We then provide insights into the interaction between the number of LEOs, the operating frequency, the number of transmission time slots, and the number of receive antennas. One key result is that in the presence of time and frequency offsets and Doppler rate, it is possible to perform 9D localization (3D position, 3D velocity, and 3D orientation estimation) of a receiver by utilizing the signals from three LEO satellites observed during three transmission time slots received through multiple receive antennas.},

  abstract     = {The Internet of Things interconnects billions of devices and forms a vast network where users sporadically transmit short messages through multi-path wireless channels. These channels are characterized by the superposition of a small number of scaled and delayed copies of Dirac spikes. At the receiver, the observed signal is a sum of these convolved signals, and the task is to find the amplitudes, continuous-indexed delays, and transmitted messages from a single signal. This task is inherently ill-posed without additional assumptions on the channel or messages. In this work, we assume the channel exhibits sparsity in the delay domain and that independent and identically distributed random linear encoding is applied to the messages at the devices. Leveraging these assumptions, we propose a semidefinite programming optimization capable of simultaneously recovering both messages and the delay parameters of the channels from only a single received signal. Our theoretical analysis establishes that the required number of samples at the receiver scales proportionally to the sum-product of sparsity and message length of all users, aligning with the degrees of freedom in the lifting-type optimization frameworks. Numerical experiments confirm the efficacy of the proposed method in accurately estimating closely-spaced delay parameters and recovering messages.},

  abstract     = {A low-power error-correcting cooling (LPECC) code was introduced as a coding scheme for communication over a bus by Chee et al. to control the peak temperature, the average power consumption of on-chip buses, and error-correction for the transmitted information, simultaneously. Specifically, an $(n, t, w, e)$ -LPECC code is a coding scheme over n wires that avoids state transitions on the t hottest wires and allows at most w state transitions in each transmission, and can correct up to etransmission errors. In this paper, we study the maximum possible size of an $(n, t, w, e)$ -LPECC code, denoted by $C(n,t,w,e)$ . When $w=e+2$ is large, we establish a general upper bound $C(n,t,w,w-2)\leq \lfloor \binom {n+1}{2}/\binom {w+t}{2}\rfloor $ ; when $w=e+2=3$ , we prove $C(n,t,3,1) \leq \lfloor \frac {n(n+1)}{6(t+1)}\rfloor $ . Both bounds are tight for large n satisfying some divisibility conditions. Previously, tight bounds were known only for $w=e+2=3,4$ and $t\leq 2$ . In general, when $w=e+d$ is large for a constant d, we determine the asymptotic value of $C(n,t,w,w-d)\sim \binom {n}{d}/\binom {w+t}{d}$ as n goes to infinity, which can be extended to q-ary codes.},

That is, the same decay rate as that of seminal polar codes for memoryless channels. This is stronger than prior art in which the square root is replaced by a cube root. Our coding scheme is similar yet distinct from prior art. The main differences are: 1) Guard-bands are placed in almost all polarization levels; 2) Trellis decoding is applied to the whole received word, and not to segments of it. As before, the scheme is capacity-achieving. The price we pay for this improvement is a higher decoding complexity, which is nonetheless still polynomial, $O(\Lambda ^{4})$ .},

It is meaningful to study the conditions under which TGRS codes are MDS. In this paper, we study a general class of TGRS (A-TGRS) codes which include all the known special ones. First, we obtain another expression of the inverse of the Vandermonde matrix. Based on this, we further derive an equivalent condition under which an A-TGRS code is MDS. According to this, the A-TGRS MDS codes include nearly all the known related results in the previous literatures. More importantly, we also give three constructions to obtain many other classes of MDS TGRS codes with new parameter matrices. In addition, we present a new method to compute the inverse of the lower triangular Toplitz matrix by a linear feedback shift register, which will be very useful in many research fields.},

  abstract     = {Suppose a distributed storage system containing M files is replicated across N servers, and a user wants to privately retrieve one file by accessing the servers such that the identity of the retrieved file is kept secret from any subset of up to T servers, where each file can be viewed as a vector over the q-ary finite field $\mathbb {F}_{q}$ . A scheme designed for this purpose is called a T-private information retrieval (T-PIR) scheme. We consider the problem of explicitly constructing capacity-achieving T-PIR schemes over small finite fields. In this paper, we first provide a general framework for constructing explicit capacity-achieving T-PIR schemes for all parameters, which only relies on an MDS array matrix with a special information set. To construct such an MDS array matrix, we propose a new family of matrices over finite fields, called the generalized minor matrices of the Moore matrix, and establish a series of key identities. By combining favourable properties of generalized minor matrices with our framework, we construct an explicit capacity-achieving T-PIR scheme with optimal sub-packetization over the field $\mathbb {F}_{q}$ , as small as possible, for three classes of parameters $N,T,M\geq 3$ . Specifically, the first class of construction works for all $N=d(2t-1), T=dt$ , and the field size q is the least prime power satisfying $q^{t-1}\geq N$ . Moreover, this construction generalizes the scheme proposed by Xu and Wang in 2022, which only considers the case of $N=d(2t-1), T=dt$ with $2^{t-1}\geq N$ . For all $N=d(2t+1), T=dt$ , our second T-PIR scheme is the first explicit construction, and the field size q is the least prime power satisfying $q^{t} \geq N$ , which is the smallest field size among all known explicit capacity-achieving T-PIR schemes. Particularly, when $2^{t}\geq N$ , the field size of such constructions can be reduced to 2. In the case of $N=4s$ and $T=2s+1$ , our scheme is the first one to reduce the field size to $q=2$ . Compared with all known explicitly capacity-achieving T-PIR schemes, the required field of our schemes has the smallest size.},

  abstract     = {Algebraic Chase decoding (ACD) is an effective soft-decision decoding approach for elliptic codes. By identifying $\eta $ least reliable symbols, $2^{\eta } $ test-vectors are formulated, each of which will be decoded through the interpolation and root-finding processes. To improve the ACD of elliptic codes, this paper proposes the generalized re-encoding transform (GReT) and improved root-finding (IRF) for reducing the decoding complexity. A systematic encoding method for elliptic codes with an arbitrary information set is proposed to re-encode the received symbols with the most reliable information set (MRIS). By assessing the likelihood of the re-encoded codeword, the ACD can be early terminated, saving the decoding computation for all test-vectors. The GReT, which allows arbitrary selection of re-encoding positions, is further proposed for the ACD in reducing the interpolation complexity. It transforms the interpolation polynomials and points using the Gr√∂bner basis associated to the MRIS. Furthermore, the IRF is proposed to reduce the root-finding complexity that also grows exponentially with $\eta $ . It can directly determine the codeword candidates from the interpolation outcomes and eliminate the restoration of interpolation polynomials in the context of GReT. Our numerical results show that the proposed GReT and IRF significantly reduce the interpolation and root-finding complexity of ACD, respectively. Moreover, with the early termination facilitated by the re-encoding with the MRIS, the average ACD complexity decreases as the channel conditions improve.},

Emerging DNA storage technologies use composite DNA letters, where information is represented by probability vectors, leading to higher information density and lower synthesizing costs than regular DNA letters. However, it faces the problem of inevitable noise and information corruption. This paper explores the channel of composite DNA letters in DNA-based storage systems and introduces block codes for limited-magnitude probability errors on probability vectors. First, outer and inner bounds for limited-magnitude probability error correction codes are provided. Moreover, code constructions are proposed where the number of errors is bounded by t, the error magnitudes are bounded by l, and the probability resolution is fixed as k. These constructions focus on leveraging the properties of limited-magnitude probability errors in DNA-based storage systems, leading to improved performance in terms of complexity and redundancy. In addition, the asymptotic optimality for one of the proposed constructions is established. Finally, systematic codes based on one of the proposed constructions are presented, which enable efficient information extraction for practical implementation.},

  abstract     = {This paper studies a multiaccess coded caching (MACC) problem where the connectivity topology between the users and the caches can be described by a class of combinatorial designs. Our model includes several MACC topologies considered in previous works as special cases. The considered MACC network includes a server containing N files, $\Gamma $ cache nodes and K cacheless users, where each user can access L cache nodes. The server is connected to the users via an error-free shared link, while the users can directly access the content in their connected cache nodes. Our goal is to minimize the worst-case transmission load on the shared link in the delivery phase. The main limitation of the existing MACC works is that only some specific access topologies are considered, including the only cases where the number of users K scales either linearly or exponentially in $\Gamma $ . We overcome this limitation by formulating a new access topology derived from two classical combinatorial structures, referred to as the t-design and the t-group divisible design. By leveraging the properties of these combinatorial structures, we propose two classes of coded caching schemes for a flexible number of users, where the number of users can scale linearly, polynomially or exponentially with the number of cache nodes. As a by-product, by extending the proposed scheme to the original dedicated coded caching scenario (i.e., each user has its own cache), the resulting scheme can unify several existing coded caching schemes.},

  abstract     = {Fast encoding and decoding of codes have always been an important topic in coding theory as well as complexity theory. Although encoding is easier than decoding in general, designing an encoding algorithm of codes of length N with quasi-linear complexity $O(N\log N)$ is not an easy task. Despite of the fact that algebraic geometry codes (AG codes) were discovered in the early 1980s, encoding algorithms of algebraic geometry codes with quasi-linear complexity $O(N\log N)$ have not been found except for the simplest algebraic geometry codes-Reed-Solomon codes. The best-known encoding algorithm of algebraic geometry codes based on a class of plane curves has quasi-linear complexity at least $O(N\log ^{2} N)$ (Beelen et al. IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory 2021). In this paper, we design an encoding algorithm for algebraic geometry codes with quasi-linear complexity $O(N\log N)$ . Moreover, for these fast encodable AG codes, the inverse of encoding, that is, interpolating the message function from the corresponding codeword, can be computed with the same complexity $O(N\log N)$ . Our algorithms are applicable to a large class of algebraic geometry codes based on both plane and non-plane curves, including Kummer extensions, Artin-Schreier extensions, and Hermitian field towers.},

  abstract     = {Although user cooperation cannot improve the capacity of Gaussian two-way channels (GTWCs) with independent noises, it can improve communication reliability. In this work, we aim to enhance and balance the communication reliability in GTWCs by minimizing the sum of error probabilities via joint design of encoders and decoders at the users. We first formulate general encoding/decoding functions, where the user cooperation is captured by the coupling of user encoding processes. The coupling effect renders the encoder/decoder design non-trivial, requiring effective decoding to capture this effect, as well as efficient power management at the encoders within power constraints. To address these challenges, we propose two different two-way coding strategies: linear coding and learning-based coding. For linear coding, we propose optimal linear decoding and discuss new insights on encoding regarding user cooperation to balance reliability. We then propose an efficient algorithm for joint encoder/decoder design. For learning-based coding, we introduce a novel recurrent neural network (RNN)-based coding architecture, where we propose interactive RNNs and a power control layer for encoding, and we incorporate bi-directional RNNs with an attention mechanism for decoding. Through simulations, we show that our two-way coding methodologies outperform conventional channel coding schemes (that do not utilize user cooperation) significantly in sum-error performance. We also demonstrate that our linear coding excels at high signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs), while our RNN-based coding performs best at low SNRs. We further investigate our two-way coding strategies in terms of power distribution, two-way coding benefit, different coding rates, and block-length gain.},

Under both decoding methods, we derive second-order achievable rate regions and compare the finite blocklength performance between JNN and SIC decoding. Our results indicate that although the first-order rate regions of JNN and SIC decoding are identical, JNN decoding has better second-order asymptotic performance. When specialized to the Gaussian noise, we provide an alternative achievability proof to the result by MolavianJazi and Laneman (T-IT, 2015). Furthermore, we generalize our results to the random access channel (RAC) where neither the transmitters nor the receiver knows the user activity pattern. We use spherical-type codebooks and a rateless transmission scheme combining JNN/SIC decoding and derive second-order achievability bounds. Comparing second-order achievability results of JNN and SIC decoding in a RAC, we show that JNN decoding achieves a strictly larger first-order asymptotic rate. When specialized to Gaussian noise, our second-order asymptotic results recover the corresponding results of Yavas, Kostina, and Effros (T-IT, 2021) up to second-order.},

We generalize these constructions by designing a mapping which recovers the Shannon entropy (and the information density) over general probability space. Moreover, it has an intuitive interpretation based on the arrival time in a Poisson process, allowing us to understand the union, intersection and difference between (sets corresponding to) random variables and events. Cross entropy, KL divergence, and conditional entropy given an event, can be obtained as set intersections. We propose a generalization of the information diagram that also includes events, and demonstrate its usage by a diagrammatic proof of Fano‚Äôs inequality.},

Traditionally, common information is measured in number of bits and thus such measures are mostly informative when the common information is finite. However, the common information between continuous variables can be infinite; in such cases, a real-valued random vector W may be needed to represent the common information, and to be used for instance for distributed simulation. In this paper, we propose the concept of Common Information Dimension (CID) and three variants. We compute the common information dimension for jointly Gaussian random vectors in a closed form. Moreover, we analytically prove, under two different formulations, that the growth rate of common information in the nearly infinite regime is determined by the common information dimension, for the case of two Gaussian vectors.},

We recover and slightly extend Hung‚Äôs result on the fourth-order derivative of the Tsallis entropy, and observe that the complete monotonicity holds for Tsallis entropy of order 2, which is equivalent to that the noise stability with respect to the heat semigroup is completely monotone.

To this end, we view the group testing problem as a function learning problem in the probably approximately correct (PAC) framework. We derive sufficiency bounds on the number of tests for popular binary group testing recovery algorithms, namely, combinatorial orthogonal matching pursuit under Bernoulli and near-constant row-weight test designs, and definite defectives under a Bernoulli test design. We compare the derived bounds with the existing ones in the literature for exact recovery both theoretically and using simulations.

  abstract     = {A blockchain is an important component in the design of secure distributed file systems, such as cryptocurrencies. One of the key components of the blockchain is the key-value commitment scheme, which constructs a commitment value from two inputs: a key and a value. In a conventional commitment scheme, a single user constructs a commitment value from an input value, whereas in a key-value commitment scheme, multiple users construct a commitment value from their keys and values. Both conventional and key-value commitment schemes must satisfy binding and hiding properties. The key-binding and key-hiding properties guarantee that neither the sender nor the verifier can act maliciously. The concept of a key-value commitment scheme was first proposed by Agrawal et al. in 2020 using a strong RSA assumption. Their scheme satisfies the key-binding but not key-hiding properties. In this paper, we propose two lattice-based key-value commitment schemes, ${\mathsf { Insert}}\text {-}{\mathsf { KVC}}_{m/2,n,q,\beta }$ and ${\mathsf {\text {KVC}}}_{m,n,q,\beta }$ , that satisfy both the key-binding and the key-hiding properties. The key-binding property of both ${\mathsf { Insert}}\text {-}{\mathsf { KVC}}_{m/2,n,q,\beta }$ and ${\mathsf {\text {KVC}}}_{m,n,q,\beta }$ are proven under the short integer solution ( ${\mathsf {\text {SIS}}}^{\infty } _{n,m,q,\beta }$ ) problem. The key-hiding property of both ${\mathsf { Insert}}\text {-}{\mathsf { KVC}}_{m/2,n,q,\beta }$ and ${\mathsf {\text {KVC}}}_{m,n,q,\beta }$ are proven under the Decisional- ${\mathsf {\text {SIS}}}^{\infty } _{n,m,q,\beta }$ -form problem, which is newly defined in this paper. We demonstrate the difficulty of the Decisional- ${\mathsf {\text {SIS}}}^{\infty } _{n,m,q,\beta }$ -form problem by showing that the Decisional- ${\mathsf {\text {SIS}}}^{\infty } _{n,m,q,\beta }$ -form problem is secure when the ${\mathsf {\text {SIS}}}^{\infty } _{n,m,q,\beta }$ problem is secure. Finally, we analyze the computational costs of ${\mathsf { Insert}}\text {-}{\mathsf { KVC}}_{m/2,n,q,\beta }$ and ${\mathsf {\text {KVC}}}_{m,n,q,\beta }$ . Our method is the first lattice-based key-value commitment scheme with proven the key-binding and the key-hiding properties.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we initiate the study of the Rank Decoding (RD) problem and Low Rank Parity Check (LRPC) codes with blockwise structure in rank-based cryptosystems. First, we introduce the blockwise errors ( $\ell $ -errors) where each error consists of $\ell $ blocks of coordinates with direct-sum supports, and define the blockwise RD ( $\ell $ -RD) problem as a natural generalization of the RD problem whose solutions are $\ell $ -errors (note that the RD problem is actually a special $\ell $ -RD problem with $\ell =1$ ). We adapt the typical attacks on the RD problem to the $\ell $ -RD problem, and find that the blockwise structure does not ease the problem too much: the $\ell $ -RD problem is still exponentially hard for appropriate choices of $\ell \gt 1$ . Second, we introduce the blockwise LRPC ( $\ell $ -LRPC) codes as generalizations of the LPRC codes whose parity-check matrices can be divided into $\ell $ sub-matrices with direct-sum supports, i.e., the intersection of two subspaces generated by the entries of any two sub-matrices is a null space, and investigate the decoding algorithms for $\ell $ -errors. We find that the gain of using $\ell $ -errors in decoding capacity outweighs the complexity loss in solving the $\ell $ -RD problem, which makes it possible to design more efficient rank-based cryptosystems with flexible choices of parameters. As an application, we show that the two rank-based cryptosystems submitted to the NIST PQC competition, namely, RQC and ROLLO, can be greatly improved by using the ideal variants of the $\ell $ -RD problem and $\ell $ -LRPC codes. Concretely, for 128-bit security, our RQC has total public key and ciphertext sizes of 2.5 KB, which is not only about 50% more compact than the original RQC, but also smaller than the NIST Round 4 code-based submissions HQC, BIKE, and Classic McEliece.},

Besides, the linear programming bound on FH sequences directly converted from that on error correcting codes can be made to be tighter due to the special structure of FH sequences. In this paper, we first give some properties of FH sequences and derive an inequality relationship between FH sequences and Krawtchouk polynomials. By utilizing those properties of FH sequences and the inequality relationship, we establish a linear programming bound on FH sequences. It is actually a nonlinear programming bound for $\gcd (H_{m}+1,N)\neq 1$ and $\sum _{j=0}^{H_{m}}A_{j}\geq q^{H_{m}+1}-q^{\frac {H_{m}+1}{\gcd (H_{m}+1,N)}}-1$ , but not difficult to be solved. It is showed that the linear programming bound is tighter than the Peng-Fan bound (Plotkin bound), the sphere-packing bound, the Singleton bound, and the improved Singleton bound in some cases.},

  abstract     = {Sequences with low/zero ambiguity zone (LAZ/ZAZ) properties are useful in modern communication and radar systems operating over mobile environments. This paper first presents a new family of ZAZ sequence sets motivated by the ‚Äúmodulating‚Äù zero correlation zone (ZCZ) sequences which were first proposed by Popovic and Mauritz. We then introduce a second family of ZAZ sequence sets with comb-like spectrum, whereby the local Doppler resilience is guaranteed by their inherent spectral nulls in the frequency domain. Finally, LAZ sequence sets are obtained by exploiting their connection with a novel class of mapping functions. These proposed unimodular ZAZ and LAZ sequence sets are cyclically distinct and asymptotically optimal with respect to the existing theoretical bounds on ambiguity functions.},

  abstract     = {The work considers the N-server distributed computing scenario with K users requesting functions that are linearly-decomposable over an arbitrary basis of L real (potentially non-linear) subfunctions. In our problem, the aim is for each user to receive their function outputs, allowing for reduced reconstruction error (distortion) $\epsilon $ , reduced computing cost ( $\gamma $ ; the fraction of subfunctions each server must compute), and reduced communication cost ( $\delta $ ; the fraction of users each server must connect to). For any given set of K requested functions ‚Äî which is here represented by a coefficient matrix $\mathbf {F} \in \mathbb {R}^{K \times L}$ ‚Äî our problem is made equivalent to the open problem of sparse matrix factorization that seeks ‚Äî for a given parameter T, representing the number of shots for each server ‚Äî to minimize the reconstruction distortion $\frac {1}{KL}\|\mathbf {F} - \mathbf {D}\mathbf {E}\|^{2}_{F}$ over all $\delta $ -sparse and $\gamma $ -sparse matrices $\mathbf {D}\in \mathbb {R}^{K \times NT}$ and $\mathbf {E} \in \mathbb {R}^{NT \times L}$ . With these matrices respectively defining which servers compute each subfunction, and which users connect to each server, we here design our $\mathbf {D},\mathbf {E}$ by designing tessellated-based and SVD-based fixed support matrix factorization methods that first split F into properly sized and carefully positioned submatrices, which we then approximate and then decompose into properly designed submatrices of D and E. For the zero-error case and under basic dimensionality assumptions, the work reveals achievable computation-vs-communication corner points $(\gamma ,\delta)$ which, for various cases, are proven optimal over a large class of $\mathbf {D},\mathbf {E}$ by means of a novel tessellations-based converse. Subsequently, for large N, and under basic statistical assumptions on F, the average achievable error $\epsilon $ is concisely expressed using the incomplete first moment of the standard Marchenko-Pastur distribution, where this performance is shown to be optimal over a large class of D and E. In the end, the work also reveals that the overall achieved gains over baseline methods are unbounded.},

  abstract     = {In this paper we analyze the distribution of the Age of Information (AoI) of a tagged data stream sharing a processor with a set of other data streams. We do so in the highly general setting in which the interarrival times pertaining to the tagged stream can have any distribution, and also the service times of both the tagged stream and the background stream are generally distributed. The packet arrival times of the background process are assumed to constitute a Poisson process, which is justified by the fact that it typically is a superposition of many relatively homogeneous streams. The first main contribution is that we derive an expression for the Laplace-Stieltjes transform of the AoI in the resulting GI+M/GI+GI/1 model. Second, we use stochastic ordering techniques to identify tight stochastic bounds on the AoI, leading to an explicit lower and upper bound on the mean AoI. In addition, when approximating the tagged stream‚Äôs inter-generation times through a phase-type distribution (which can be done at any precision), we present a computational algorithm for the mean AoI. As illustrated through a sequence of numerical experiments, the analysis enables us to assess the impact of background traffic on the AoI of the tagged stream. It turns out that the upper bound on the mean AoI is remarkably close to its true value, which yields an explicit expression (in terms of the model parameters) for an accurate proxy of the AoI-minimizing generation rate.},

The results include the first non-trivial closed-form finite-latency bound applicable across all delays and mining rates up to the ultimate fault tolerance. Notably, the gap between these upper and lower bounds is narrower than previously established bounds for a wide range of parameters relevant to Bitcoin and its derivatives, including Litecoin and Dogecoin, as well as Ethereum Classic.

The channel is controlled by an adversary who can freely choose the locations of the symbol reads, errors and erasures via a process with unbounded computational power. The AWTC-II is an extension of Ozarow‚Äôs and Wyner‚Äôs wiretap channel of type II to the adversarial channel setting. The semantic-secrecy (SS) capacity of the AWTC-II is partially known, where the best-known lower bound is non-constructive and proven via a random coding argument that uses a large number (that is, exponential in blocklength n) of random bits to describe the random code. In this work, we establish a new derandomization result in which we match the best-known lower bound via a non-constructive random code that uses only $O(n^{2})$ random bits. Unlike fully random codes, our derandomized code admits an efficient encoding algorithm and benefits from some linear structure. Our derandomization result is a novel application of random pseudolinear codes ‚Äì a class of non-linear codes first proposed for applications outside the AWTC-II setting, which have k-wise independent codewords where k is a design parameter. As the key technical tool in our analysis, we provide a novel concentration inequality for sums of random variables with limited independence, as well as a soft-covering lemma similar to that of Goldfeld, Cuff and Permuter that holds for random codes with k-wise independent codewords.},

However, in reality, different receivers may need to have different storage capacities. In this paper, inspired by the secret sharing scheme based on the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT) for polynomial rings where each participant holds the share with different sizes, we propose three new constructions of unconditionally secure MRA schemes for multiple messages using the CRT for polynomial rings, including a $(k,n)$ -threshold MRA scheme, a $(k,n,\omega)$ -weighted threshold MRA scheme, and a $(\mathcal {Q},\mathcal {F})$ -general MRA scheme. As far as we know, our proposed MRA schemes are the first MRA schemes with different storage capacities for different receivers and the first ones based on the CRT for polynomial rings. Moreover, the proposed schemes can be seen as extensions of the MRA scheme in Safavi-Naini and Wang. In particular, as for our $(\mathcal {Q},\mathcal {F})$ -general MRA scheme, it has generally more communication complexity and much less computation complexity than the existing $(\mathcal {Q},\mathcal {F})$ -general MRA scheme.},

This algorithm is designed to achieve adaptive inverse reinforcement learning (IRL). Adaptive IRL aims to estimate the cost function of a forward learner performing a stochastic gradient algorithm (e.g., policy gradient reinforcement learning) by observing their estimates in real-time. The PSGLD algorithm is considered passive because it incorporates noisy gradients provided by an external stochastic gradient algorithm (forward learner), of which it has no control. The PSGLD algorithm acts as a randomized sampler to achieve adaptive IRL by reconstructing the forward learner‚Äôs cost function nonparametrically from the stationary measure of a Langevin diffusion. This paper analyzes the non-asymptotic (finite-sample) performance; we provide explicit bounds on the 2-Wasserstein distance between PSGLD algorithm sample measure and the stationary measure encoding the cost function, and provide guarantees for a kernel density estimation scheme which reconstructs the cost function from empirical samples. Our analysis uses tools from the study of Markov diffusion operators. The derived bounds have both practical and theoretical significance. They provide finite-time guarantees for an adaptive IRL mechanism, and substantially generalize the analytical framework of a line of research in passive stochastic gradient algorithms.},

  abstract     = {This paper addresses the reconstruction of an unknown signal vector with sublinear sparsity from generalized linear measurements. Generalized approximate message-passing (GAMP) is proposed via state evolution in the sublinear sparsity limit, where the signal dimension N, measurement dimension M, and signal sparsity k satisfy $\log k/\log N\to \gamma \in [0, 1$ ) and $M/\{k\log (N/k)\}\to \delta $ as N and k tend to infinity. While the overall flow in state evolution is the same as that for linear sparsity, each proof step for inner denoising requires stronger assumptions than those for linear sparsity. The required new assumptions are proved for Bayesian inner denoising. When Bayesian outer and inner denoisers are used in GAMP, the obtained state evolution recursion is utilized to evaluate the prefactor $\delta $ in the sample complexity, called reconstruction threshold. If and only if $\delta $ is larger than the reconstruction threshold, Bayesian GAMP can achieve asymptotically exact signal reconstruction. In particular, the reconstruction threshold is finite for noisy linear measurements when the support of non-zero signal elements does not include a neighborhood of zero. As numerical examples, this paper considers linear measurements and 1-bit compressed sensing. Numerical simulations for both cases show that Bayesian GAMP outperforms existing algorithms for sublinear sparsity in terms of the sample complexity.},

Extensive study has been done on polynomial-time algorithms for the graph alignment problem under the Erd≈ës‚ÄìR√©nyi graph pair model, where the two graphs are Erd≈ës‚ÄìR√©nyi graphs with edge probability $q_{\mathrm {u}}$ , correlated under certain vertex correspondence. To achieve exact recovery of the correspondence, all existing algorithms at least require the edge correlation coefficient $\rho _{\mathrm {u}}$ between the two graphs to be non-vanishing as $n\rightarrow \infty $ . Moreover, it is conjectured that no polynomial-time algorithm can achieve exact recovery under vanishing edge correlation ${\rho _{\mathrm {u}}}\lt 1/\mathrm {polylog}(n)$ . In this paper, we show that with a vanishing amount of additional attribute information, exact recovery is polynomial-time feasible under vanishing edge correlation ${\rho _{\mathrm {u}}}\ge n^{-\Theta (1)}$ . We identify a local tree structure, which incorporates one layer of user information and one layer of attribute information, and apply the subgraph counting technique to such structures. A polynomial-time algorithm is proposed that recovers the vertex correspondence for most of the vertices, and then refines the output to achieve exact recovery. The consideration of attribute information is motivated by real-world applications like LinkedIn and Twitter, where user attributes like birthplace and education background can aid alignment.},

This paper initiates the study of space complexity for Euclidean $(k, z)$ -Clustering and offers both upper and lower bounds. Our space bounds are nearly tight when k is constant, indicating that storing a coreset, a well-known data compression approach, serves as the optimal compression scheme.

We suggest a natural small-batch version of the minimum-norm estimator and derive bounds on its quadratic risk. We then characterize the optimal batch size and show it is inversely proportional to the noise level, as well as to the overparametrization ratio. In contrast to minimum-norm, our estimator admits a stable risk behavior that is monotonically increasing in the overparametrization ratio, eliminating both the blowup at the interpolation point and the double-descent phenomenon. We further show that shrinking the batch minimum-norm estimator by a factor equal to the Weiner coefficient further stabilizes it and results in lower quadratic risk in all settings. Interestingly, we observe that the implicit regularization offered by the batch partition is partially explained by feature overlap between the batches. Our bound is derived via a novel combination of techniques, in particular normal approximation in the Wasserstein metric of noisy projections over random subspaces.},

  abstract     = {We solve the generalised quantum Stein‚Äôs lemma, proving that the Stein exponent associated with entanglement testing, namely, the quantum hypothesis testing task of distinguishing between $\boldsymbol {n}$ copies of an entangled state $\boldsymbol {\rho _{AB}}$ and a generic separable state $\boldsymbol {\sigma _{A^{n}:B^{n}}}$ , equals the regularised relative entropy of entanglement. Not only does this determine the ultimate performance of entanglement testing, but it also establishes the reversibility of all quantum resource theories under asymptotically resource non-generating operations, with the regularised relative entropy of resource governing the asymptotic transformation rate between any two quantum states. As a by-product, we prove that the same Stein exponent can also be achieved when the null hypothesis is only approximately i.i.d., in the sense that it can be modelled by an ‚Äòalmost power state‚Äô. To solve the problem we introduce two techniques. The first is a procedure that we call ‚Äòblurring‚Äô, which, informally, transforms a permutationally symmetric state by making it more evenly spread across nearby type classes. Blurring alone suffices to prove the generalised Stein‚Äôs lemma in the fully classical case, but not in the quantum case. Our second technical innovation, therefore, is to perform a second quantisation step to lift the problem to an infinite-dimensional bosonic quantum system; we then solve it there by using techniques from continuous-variable quantum information. Rather remarkably, the second-quantised action of the blurring map corresponds to a pure loss channel. A careful examination of this second quantisation step is the core of our quantum solution.},

We begin with networks with classical links, and characterize the generation of separable and classical-quantum correlations in three primary models: 1) a two-node network with limited common randomness (CR), 2) a no-communication network, and 3) a broadcast network, which consists of a single sender and two receivers. We establish the optimal tradeoff between the classical communication and CR rates in each setting, thus characterizing the minimal resources for simulating classical-quantum correlations. Next, we consider coordination in networks with quantum links. We study the following models: 1) a cascade network with limited entanglement, 2) a broadcast network, and 3) a multiple-access network with two senders and a single receiver. We establish the optimal tradeoff between quantum communication and entanglement rates in each setting, characterizing the minimal resources for entanglement coordination. The examples demonstrate that coordination of entanglement and coordination of separable correlations behave differently.

  abstract     = {We approach two interconnected problems of quantum information processing in networks: Conference key agreement and entanglement distillation, both in the so-called source model where the given resource is a multipartite quantum state and the players interact over public classical channels to generate the desired correlation. The first problem is the distillation of a conference key when the source state is shared between a number of legal players and an eavesdropper; the eavesdropper, apart from starting off with this quantum side information, also observes the public communication between the players. The second is the distillation of Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states by means of local operations and classical communication (LOCC) from the given mixed state. These problem settings extend our previous paper [IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory 68(2):976-988, 2022], and we generalise its results: using a quantum version of the task of communication for omniscience, we derive novel lower bounds on the distillable conference key from any multipartite quantum state by means of non-interacting communication protocols. Secondly, we establish novel lower bounds on the yield of GHZ states from multipartite mixed states. Namely, we present two methods to produce bipartite entanglement between sufficiently many nodes so as to produce GHZ states. Next, we show that the conference key agreement protocol can be made coherent under certain conditions, enabling the direct generation of multipartite GHZ states.},

  abstract     = {This paper considers the unsourced random access (URA) problem with a random and unknown number of active users in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) quasi-static Rayleigh fading channels. We derive non-asymptotic achievability bounds on the probability of incorrectly estimating the number of active users, and provide scaling laws on the gap between the estimated and true numbers of active users. We prove that the error probability reaches a plateau as the power P and blocklength n increase, whereas it decays exponentially with the number L of receive antennas and eventually vanishes. Then, we explore the fundamental limits of URA by deriving non-asymptotic achievability bounds and converse bounds (including two single-user converse bounds and one multi-user ensemble converse bound) on the minimum energy-per-bit required by each active user to transmit J bits with blocklength n under misdetection and false-alarm constraints. Numerical results show that the extra required energy-per-bit due to the uncertainty in the number ${\mathrm {K}}_{a}$ of active users decreases as L and $\mathbb {E}[{\mathrm {K}}_{a}]$ increase and the error requirement becomes milder. In the non-asymptotic regime, using codewords distributed on a sphere outperforms Gaussian random coding. Existing schemes are shown to exhibit a large gap to our bounds when the number of active users is large, calling for more advanced schemes that perform energy-efficiently in this case. In the asymptotic regime with $n\to \infty $ , we establish scaling laws on the minimum required P and L to reliably support ${\mathrm {K}}_{a}$ active users as functions of n, which highlight the potential of MIMO in enabling low-cost communication and indicate that it is possible for the minimum required P and L to remain on the same order when the number of active users increases but stays below a threshold.},

The outer bound is based on the ideas of dependence balance for communication rate, genie-aided state estimator and rate-limited constraints on sensing distortion.

The normalized transport applies so called self-avoiding codes that generalize comma-separated codes and specialize bijective stationary codes. The normalized transport is also connected to the usual measure transport via underlying asymptotically mean stationary measures. It preserves the ergodic decomposition. The normalized transport and self-avoiding codes arise in the problem of successive recurrence times. In particular, we show that successive recurrence times are ergodic for an ergodic measure, which strengthens a result by Chen Moy from 1959.

The SPLC problem allows the user to privately compute a linear combination of multiple files from a set of replicated servers, even in the presence of straggler servers that can bottleneck the entire computation. It is guaranteed that a certain number of colluding servers learn nothing about the coefficients of the linear combination, and the user must not learn any information about the files other than the desired linear computation. Unlike previous private computation literature that mainly focused on decreasing download cost from servers, we aim to establish a flexible tradeoff between communication costs and computational complexities. In particular, we propose a novel SPLC scheme under the assumption of a fixed number of stragglers. Additionally, by generalizing this SPLC scheme, we construct an adaptive SPLC scheme capable of tolerating the presence of a varying number of stragglers, even if their identities and numbers are unknown in advance. Compared to the SPLC scheme with a fixed number of stragglers, the adaptive SPLC scheme achieves a lower communication cost based on the actual number of stragglers, albeit at the cost of increased computational complexities. Both types of SPLC schemes achieve flexible performance tradeoffs and can be employed to optimize system efficiency in practice.},

First, we provide a novel description of trace codes by choosing suitable defining sets. Second, we determine the parameters of the codes and their trace codes whose defining sets are disjoint union of some affine subspaces in both non-projective cases and projective-cases. This result extends the main findings in Hu et al. (2022).

  abstract     = {The Plotkin construction combines two codes to a code of doubled length. It can be applied recursively. The class of Reed-Muller (RM) codes is a particular example. Exploiting a property of the code words constructed by the recursive Plotkin construction, we present novel soft-decision decoders. These are based on the decoding of hidden code words which are inherent contained in the constructed code words and can be uncovered by adding particular parts of the overall code word. The main idea is to use more than one decoding variant where each variant starts with the decoding of a different hidden code word. Given the decision of this first hidden code word allows error cancellation for the remaining decoding. The final decoding decision selects the best of the decisions of the used variants. The more variants are used the closer the performance gets to the maximum-likelihood (ML) decoding performance. This is verified by an ML-bound for the cases where the ML performance is not known. The decoding algorithms use only additions, comparisons, and sign operations. Further, due to the recursive structure, only relatively short codes have to be decoded, thus, the decoding complexity is very low. We also present a new decoder for first-order RM codes with low complexity. In addition, we introduce two novel classes of half-rate codes based on recursive Plotkin constructions with RM codes. We show that the novel soft decision decoders can also be applied to recursive Plotkin constructions with BCH codes and to particular classes of generalized concatenated codes (GCC).},

DNA-correcting codes are presented as a unique solution to the problem of ensuring that the output of the storage system is unique for any valid set of input strands. To this end, we introduce a novel distance metric to capture the unique behavior of the DNA storage system and provide necessary and sufficient conditions for DNA-correcting codes. We also establish bounds and constructions for these codes, including an exploration of the $\ell _{\infty } $ distance applied to permutations. Here, instead of interpreting permutation elements as numerical values and assessing absolute differences, we treat them as vectors and consider the Hamming distance to better model the DNA Storage System.},

The achievable guesswork complexity is defined as the number of test error patterns (TEPs) processed by OSD immediately upon finding the correct codeword estimate. The paper first develops a new upper bound for guesswork over independent sequences by partitioning them into Hamming shells and applying H√∂lder‚Äôs inequality. This upper bound is then extended to ordered statistics, by constructing the conditionally independent sequences within the ordered statistics sequences. Next, we apply these bounds to characterize the statistical moments of the OSD guesswork complexity. We show that the achievable guesswork complexity of OSD at maximum decoding order can be accurately approximated by the modified Bessel function, which increases exponentially with code dimension. We also identify a guesswork complexity saturation threshold, where increasing the OSD decoding order beyond this threshold improves error performance without further raising the achievable guesswork complexity. Finally, the paper presents insights on applying these findings to enhance the design of OSD decoders.},

In the asymptotic regime, the capacity of such a channel is studied. For the non-asymptotic regime, fixed-length codes are presented, with the property that codewords can be freely cascaded without violating the temperature constraint.

This paper studies the CFMA scheme for a two-user Gaussian fast fading MAC with channel state information only available at the receiver (CSIR). We investigate appropriate lattice decoding schemes to decode linear combinations with any integer coefficients in the fading MAC and derive the achievable rate pairs. We give a sufficient and necessary condition under which the proposed scheme can achieve the ergodic sum capacity. Furthermore, we investigate the impact of channel statistics on the capacity achievability of the CFMA scheme. In general, the sum capacity is achievable if the channel variance is small compared to the mean value of the channel strengths.

A common feature between relay systems and IRS-aided systems is the two-hop multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channel. As a result, the mutual information (MI) of two-hop MIMO channels has been widely investigated with very engaging results. However, a rigorous investigation on the fundamental limits of two-hop MIMO channels, i.e., the first and second-order analysis, is not yet available in the literature, due to the difficulties caused by the two-hop (product) channel and the noise introduced by the relay (active IRS). In this paper, we employ large random matrix theory, specifically Gaussian tools, to derive the closed-form deterministic approximation for the mean and variance of the MI. Additionally, we determine the convergence rate for the mean, variance and the characteristic function of the MI, and prove the asymptotic Gaussianity. Furthermore, we also investigate the analytical properties of the fundamental equations that describe the closed-form approximation and prove the existence and uniqueness of the solution. An iterative algorithm is then proposed to obtain the solutions for the fundamental equations. Numerical results validate the accuracy of the theoretical analysis.},

  abstract     = {Fast correlation attack is one of the most powerful attack methods for LFSR-based stream ciphers, and the primary problem of the attack is to construct the linear approximations with great absolute correlations. For some stream ciphers with complex structures of linear approximations, the search for the maximum absolute correlation of linear approximations has always been a difficult problem because of the extremely high amount of masks that need to be searched. In this paper, an analysis method for searching maximum absolute correlation based on the linear mask structure is developed, including the filtering technology based on mask propagation trail, a structural characteristic of linear approximations of linear transformations with fewer active bytes, and linear approximation equivalence theorem of composite function composed of the parallel identical S-boxes and linear transformation. These methods efficiently reduce the exhaustive time complexity of the masks. As applications, this paper proves that the suprema of absolute correlations of all the linear approximations for the five XOR-versions of SNOW family stream ciphers (i.e., SNOW $2.0_{\oplus }$ , SNOW $\text{3G}_{\oplus }$ , SNOW- $\text{V}_{\oplus }$ , SNOW- $\text{Vi}_{\oplus }$ , SNOW $\text{5G}_{\oplus }$ ) are ${2^{ - 9}}/{2^{ - 15.893}}/{2^{ - 37.964}}/{2^{ - 37.964}}/{2^{ - 37.964}}$ . The exhaustive time complexity of the masks can be reduced from $O({2^{32}})/O({2^{96}})/O({2^{384}})/O({2^{384}})/O({2^{384}})$ to $O({2^{24}})/O({2^{31.98}})/O({2^{39.98}})/O({2^{39.98}})/~O({2^{39.98}})$ , respectively. Furthermore, we give the provable security evaluations of the five ciphers against fast correlation attacks under the success probability of 0.99 for the known fast correlation attack method. For SNOW- $\text{V}_{\oplus }$ /SNOW- $\text{Vi}_{\oplus }$ /SNOW $\text{5G}_{\oplus }$ , the time/data/memory complexity of the optimal fast correlation attacks are all $O(2^{227.54})/O(2^{227.72})/O(2^{227.72})$ . The results show that SNOW- $\text{V}_{\oplus }$ /SNOW- $\text{Vi}_{\oplus }$ /SNOW $\text{5G}_{\oplus }$ cannot guarantee the claimed 256-bit key security for the known fast correlation attack methods if we ignore the design constraint that the maximum length of keystream for a single pair of key and IV is $2^{64}$ . For SNOW $2.0_{\oplus }$ and SNOW $\text{3G}_{\oplus }$ , the time/data/memory complexity of the optimal fast correlation attacks are $O({2^{151.94}})/O({2^{151.35}})/O({2^{151.35}})$ and $O(2^{165.91})/O(2^{165.43})/O(2^{165.43})$ , respectively. The results show that both SNOW $2.0_{\oplus }$ and SNOW $\text{3G}_{\oplus }$ can guarantee the claimed 128-bit key security for the known fast correlation attack methods. In addition, this paper also discusses that the existing fast correlation attacks based on multiple linear approximations are invalid for these five ciphers.},

We establish theoretical recovery guarantees for reconstruction of signals using generative models in the presence of outliers, giving lower bounds on the number of correctable outliers. Our results are applicable to both linear and nonlinear generator neural networks with an arbitrary number of layers. We propose an iterative and linearized alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm for solving the outlier detection problem via $\ell _{1}$ norm minimization, and a gradient descent algorithm for solving the outlier detection problem via squared $\ell _{1}$ norm minimization. We conduct extensive experiments using variational auto-encoder and deep convolutional generative adversarial networks, and the experimental results show that the signals can be successfully reconstructed under outliers using our approach. Our approach outperforms the traditional Lasso and $\ell _{2}$ norm minimization approach.},

  abstract     = {Every Boolean bent function f can be written either as a concatenation $f=f_{1}|| f_{2}$ of two complementary semi-bent functions $f_{1},f_{2}$ ; or as a concatenation $f=f_{1}|| f_{2}|| f_{3}|| f_{4}$ of four Boolean functions $f_{1},f_{2},f_{3},f_{4}$ , all of which are simultaneously bent, semi-bent, or 5-valued spectra-functions. In this context, it is essential to specify conditions for these bent concatenations so that f does (not) belong to the completed Maiorana-McFarland class ${\mathcal {M}}^{\#}$ . In this article, we resolve this question completely by providing the algebraic characterization of $\mathcal {M}$ -subspaces for the concatenation of the form $f=f_{1}|| f_{2}$ and $f=f_{1}|| f_{2}|| f_{3}|| f_{4}$ , which allows us to estimate ${\rm {ind}}(f)$ , the linearity index of f, and consequently to establish the necessary and sufficient conditions so that f is outside ${\mathcal {M}}^{\#}$ . Based on these conditions, we propose several explicit and generic design methods of specifying bent functions outside ${\mathcal {M}}^{\#}$ in the special case when $f=g||h||g||(h+1)$ , where g and h are bent functions. Moreover, we show that it is possible to even decrease the linearity index of $f = g||h||g||(h+1)$ , compared to ${\rm {ind}}(g)$ and ${\rm {ind}}(h)$ , if the largest dimension of a common $\mathcal {M}$ -subspace of g and h is small enough (less than $\min \{{\rm {ind}}(g), {\rm {ind}}(h)\} - 1$ ). This also induces iterative methods of constructing bent functions outside ${\mathcal {M}}^{\#}$ with (controllable) low linearity index. Finally, we derive a lower bound on the 2-rank of f and show that this concatenation method can generate bent functions that are provably outside ${\mathcal {M}}^{\#} \cup {\mathcal {PS}}_{ap}^{\#}$ . In difference to the approach of Weng et al. (2007) that uses the direct sum and a bent function g outside ${\mathcal {M}}^{\#}$ , our method employs $g, h \in {\mathcal {M}}^{\#}$ for the same purpose.},

To accomplish this, the paper first derives tighter upper bounds for the gap size in both periodic and aperiodic scenarios under the assumption that all frequencies within the designated frequency slot set are fully utilized. Subsequently, this paper proposes a class of wide-gap frequency hopping sequences (WGFHSs) and a class of multi-timeslot wide-gap frequency hopping sequences (MTWGFHSs), both of which simultaneously exhibit optimal NHZ length and optimal gap.},

This is the first work to study SPIR with X-security in classical or quantum variations. We first develop a scheme for classical X-secure, E-eavesdropped and T-colluding SPIR (XSETSPIR) based on a modified version of cross subspace alignment (CSA), which achieves a rate of $R= 1 - \frac {X+\max (T,E)}{N}$ . The modified scheme achieves the same rate as the scheme used for X-secure PIR with the extra benefit of symmetric privacy, i.e., user-privacy as well as database-privacy. Next, we extend this scheme to its quantum counterpart based on the N-sum box abstraction. This is the first work to consider the presence of eavesdroppers in quantum private information retrieval (QPIR). In the quantum variation, the eavesdroppers have better access to information over the quantum channel compared to the classical channel due to the over-the-air decodability. To that end, we develop two different schemes for quantum X-secure, E-eavesdropped and T-colluding SPIR (QXSETSPIR) with secure over-the-air decoding. The first scheme achieves the highest possible super-dense coding gain, i.e., $R_{Q} = \min \left \{{{ 1, 2\left ({{1-\frac {X+\max (T,E)}{N}}}\right)}}\right \}$ , which requires additional uploads from the user. The second scheme on the other hand requires no extra uploads. However, it does not achieve the super-dense coding gain in some cases based on the relation between the number of eavesdropped links and the number of interference terms. The second scheme is based on the idea that there exist some special entanglement states that can be used to hide the contents of the user-required messages from the eavesdroppers using the interference symbols.},

Private Inference has been extensively explored in recent years, mainly from a cryptographic standpoint via techniques like homomorphic encryption and multiparty computation. These approaches often come with high computational overhead and may degrade the accuracy of the model. In our work, we take a different approach inspired by the Private Information Retrieval literature. We view private inference as the task of retrieving inner products of parameter vectors with the data, a fundamental operation in many machine learning models. We introduce schemes that enable such retrieval of inner products for models with quantized (i.e., restricted to a finite set) weights; such models are extensively used in practice due to a wide range of benefits. In addition, our schemes uncover a fundamental tradeoff between user and server privacy. Our information-theoretic approach is applicable to a wide range of problems and robust in privacy guarantees for both the user and the server.},

  abstract     = {Motivated by modern applications such as computerized adaptive testing, sequential rank aggregation, and heterogeneous data source selection, we study the problem of active sequential estimation. The goal is to design an adaptive experiment selection rule and an estimator for more accurate parameter estimation. Greedy information-based experiment selection rules, which optimize information gain one step ahead, have been employed in practice thanks to their computational convenience, flexibility to context or task changes, and broad applicability. However, the optimality of greedy methods under a sequential decision theory framework is only established in the one-dimensional case, partly due to the problem‚Äôs combinatorial nature and the seemingly limited capacity of greedy algorithms. In this study, we close the gap for multidimensional problems. We cast the problem under a sequential decision theory framework with generalized risk measures for a large class of design-and-estimation methods. We propose adopting the maximum likelihood estimator with a class of greedy experiment selection rules. This class encompasses both existing methods and introduces new methods with improved numerical efficiency. We prove that these methods achieve asymptotic optimality when the risk measure aligns with the selection rule. Additionally, we establish that the proposed estimators are consistent and asymptotically normal, and further extend the results to allow early stopping rules. We also perform extensive numerical studies on both simulated and real data to illustrate the efficacy of the proposed methods.},

  abstract     = {Due to the non-convex nature of training Deep Neural Network (DNN) models, their effectiveness relies on the use of non-convex optimization heuristics. Traditional methods for training DNNs often require costly empirical methods to produce successful models and do not have a clear theoretical foundation. In this study, we examine the use of convex optimization theory and sparse recovery models to refine the training process of neural networks and provide a better interpretation of their optimal weights. We focus on training two-layer neural networks with piecewise linear activations and demonstrate that they can be formulated as a finite-dimensional convex program. These programs include a regularization term that promotes sparsity, which constitutes a variant of group Lasso. We first utilize semi-infinite programming theory to prove strong duality for finite width neural networks and then we express these architectures equivalently as high dimensional convex sparse recovery models. Remarkably, the worst-case complexity to solve the convex program is polynomial in the number of samples and number of neurons when the rank of the data matrix is bounded, which is the case in convolutional networks. To extend our method to training data of arbitrary rank, we develop a novel polynomial-time approximation scheme based on zonotope subsampling that comes with a guaranteed approximation ratio. We also show that all the stationary points of the nonconvex training objective can be characterized as the global optimum of a subsampled convex program. Our convex models can be trained using standard convex solvers without resorting to heuristics or extensive hyper-parameter tuning unlike non-convex methods. Due to the convexity, optimizer hyperparameters such as initialization, batch sizes, and step size schedules have no effect on the final model. Through extensive numerical experiments, we show that convex models can outperform traditional non-convex methods and are not sensitive to optimizer hyperparameters.

Statistical regression models for distributional responses are a key technique for the emerging field of distributional data analysis, but so far have primarily been investigated for the case of one-dimensional response distributions. We investigate here the challenging case of conditional Fr√©chet means for multivariate response distributions under the Wasserstein metric, which has not been studied previously but is relevant for statistical data analysis in various fields, including climatology and health, as we demonstrate with real data applications. A second innovation is that we harness the notion of conditional barycenters and geodesics in the Wasserstein space to interpolate as well as extrapolate multivariate distributions under suitable regularity conditions, where even the simpler case of extrapolating one-dimensional distributions has not been studied before. We cover both global parametric-like and local smoothing-like models to implement conditional Wasserstein barycenters and establish asymptotic convergence properties for the corresponding estimates under suitable regularity assumptions. The utility of distributional inter- and extrapolation is explored in both simulations and examples. Conditional Wasserstein barycenters and distribution extrapolation are specifically illustrated with applications in epidemiology and climatology.},

  abstract     = {The randomized singular value decomposition (R-SVD) is a popular sketching-based algorithm for efficiently computing the partial SVD of a large matrix. When the matrix is low-rank, the R-SVD produces its partial SVD exactly; but when the rank is large, it only yields an approximation. Motivated by applications in data science and principal component analysis (PCA), we analyze the R-SVD under a low-rank signal plus noise measurement model; specifically, when its input is a spiked random matrix. The singular values produced by the R-SVD are shown to exhibit a BBP-like phase transition: when the SNR exceeds a certain detectability threshold, that depends on the dimension reduction factor, the largest singular value is an outlier; below the threshold, no outlier emerges from the bulk of singular values. We further compute asymptotic formulas for the overlap between the ground truth signal singular vectors and the approximations produced by the R-SVD. Dimensionality reduction has the adverse affect of amplifying the noise in a highly nonlinear manner. Our results demonstrate the statistical advantage of the R-SVD‚Äîin both signal detection and estimation‚Äîover more naive sketched PCA variants; the advantage is especially dramatic when the sketching dimension is small. Our analysis is asymptotically exact, and substantially more fine-grained than existing operator-norm error bounds for the R-SVD, which largely fail to give meaningful error estimates in the moderate SNR regime. It applies for a broad family of sketching matrices previously considered in the literature, including Gaussian i.i.d. sketches, random projections, and the sub-sampled Hadamard transform, among others. Lastly, we derive optimal singular value shrinkers for singular values and vectors obtained through the R-SVD, designed optimally for both matrix denoising and covariance estimation. For the second task, the performance gains offered by the new shrinker may be particularly significant, especially so when the sketching dimension is small.},

  abstract     = {Permutation synchronization is an important problem in computer science that constitutes the key step of many computer vision tasks. The goal is to recover n latent permutations from their noisy and incomplete pairwise measurements. In recent years, spectral methods have gained increasing popularity thanks to their simplicity and computational efficiency. Spectral methods utilize the leading eigenspace U of the data matrix and its block submatrices $U_{1},U_{2},\ldots , U_{n}$ to recover the permutations. In this paper, we propose a novel and statistically optimal spectral algorithm. Unlike the existing methods which use $\{U_{j}U_{1}^{\top } \}_{j\geq 2}$ , ours constructs an anchor matrix M by aggregating useful information from all of the block submatrices and estimates the latent permutations through $\{U_{j}M^{\top } \}_{j\geq 1}$ . This modification overcomes a crucial limitation of the existing methods caused by the repetitive use of $U_{1}$ and leads to an improved numerical performance. To establish the optimality of the proposed method, we carry out a fine-grained spectral analysis and obtain a sharp exponential error bound that matches the minimax rate.},

  abstract     = {In the implementation of quantum information systems, one type of Pauli error, such as phase-flip errors, may occur more frequently than others, like bit-flip errors. For this reason, quantum error-correcting codes that handle asymmetric errors are critical to mitigating the impact of such impairments. To this aim, several asymmetric quantum codes have been proposed. These include variants of surface codes like the XZZX and ZZZY surface codes, tailored to preserve quantum information in the presence of error asymmetries. In this work, we propose two classes of Calderbank, Shor and Steane (CSS) topological codes, referred to as cylindrical and M√∂bius codes, particular cases of the fiber bundle family. Cylindrical codes maintain a fully planar structure, while M√∂bius codes are quasi-planar, with minimal non-local qubit interactions. We construct these codes employing the algebraic chain complexes formalism, providing theoretical upper bounds for the logical error rate. Our results demonstrate that cylindrical and M√∂bius codes outperform standard surface codes when using the minimum weight perfect matching (MWPM) decoder.},

We test whether the quantum system is correlated to the classical system or is independent of it. Here, the null hypothesis is composed of states having the quantum system is correlated to the classical system in an arbitrarily varying form. The second problem is the problem of reliable communication over classical-quantum arbitrarily varying multiple access channels (CQ-AVMAC) and establishing its capacity region by giving multiple achievability techniques. We prove that each of these techniques is optimal by proving a converse. Further, for both these techniques, the decoder designed is a universal decoder and can achieve any rate pair in the capacity region without time sharing and also these decoders do not depend on the channel and therefore they are universal. Our result covers the case when the channel parameter is continuous, which has not been studied even in the classical case. Further, both these techniques can be easily generalized to the case when there are $T (T\gt 2)$ senders. The design of each of these decoders is based on the study of multiple independence testing. This approach allows us to study the problem of reliable communication over CQ-AVMAC from the point of view of hypothesis testing. Further, we also give a necessary and sufficient condition for the deterministic code capacity region of CQ-AVMAC to be non-empty.},

  abstract     = {Differential privacy provides a robust framework for protecting sensitive data, while maintaining its utility for computation. In essence, a differentially private algorithm takes as input the data of multiple parties, and returns an output disclosing minimal information about any individual party. Previous research has introduced several quantum extensions of differential privacy, with applications ranging from quantum machine learning on private classical data to quantum shadow tomography. However, the local model of quantum differential privacy ‚Äì where each party is responsible for privatizing their own data at a local level ‚Äì has received limited attention. This work delves into locally differentially private quantum measurements. Although any measurement can be made locally differentially private by adding noise to the outcome, we demonstrate that certain quantum measurements inherently satisfy some degree of local differential privacy for specific classes of input states. This finding has two significant implications: first, limiting the analysis to classical noise injection mechanisms may lead to suboptimal privacy-utility trade-offs for quantum data; second, the theory of differential privacy can be harnessed to further investigate the capabilities of quantum measurements. Motivated by these insights, we establish strong data processing inequalities for the quantum relative entropy under local differential privacy and apply these results to asymmetric hypothesis testing of quantum states with restricted measurements. Additionally, we prove an equivalence between quantum statistical queries and quantum differential privacy in the local model, thereby addressing an open question posed by Arunachalam et al. (2021). Finally, we consider the task of quantum multi-party computation under local differential privacy, demonstrating that parity functions can be efficiently learned in this model, whereas the corresponding classical task requires exponentially many samples.},

As application examples, the results are exercised in different scenarios using the $\alpha\text{-}\mu $ and $\kappa\text{-}\mu$ fading models, which encompass several other well-known models such as Semi-Gaussian, Rayleigh, Rice, Nakagami-m, and Weibull. We provide unprecedented closed-form formulations for the level crossing rate bounds of the product of these widely-known fading processes. Notably, there are no closed forms for the level crossing rate of these products. Therefore, our bounds supply a benchmark for this metric, with one of them serving as an excellent approximation of the exact metric.},

Analog transmitters hold sequences of analog values. Some functions of these distributed values (but not the values themselves) need to be conveyed to the receiver, subject to a fidelity criterion such as mean squared error (MSE) or a certain maximum error with given confidence. For the case in which the computed function for the analog transmitters is a sum of values in $[-1,1]$ , we derive inner and outer bounds for the tradeoff of digital and analog rates of communication under peak and average power constraints for digital transmitters and a peak power constraint for analog transmitters. We then extend the achievability result to a class of functions that includes all linear and some non-linear functions. This extended scheme works over fading channels as long as full channel state information is available at the transmitter. The practicality of our proposed communication scheme is shown in channel simulations that use a version of the scheme based on low density parity check (LDPC) coding. We evaluate the system performance for different block lengths and Gaussian as well as non-Gaussian noise distributions.},

  abstract     = {We consider unsourced random access (uRA) in a cell-free (CF) user-centric wireless network, where a large number of potential users compete for a random access slot, while only a finite subset is active. The random access users transmit codewords of length L symbols from a shared codebook, which are received by B geographically distributed radio units (RUs), each equipped with M antennas. Our goal is to devise and analyze a centralized decoder to detect the transmitted messages (without prior knowledge of the active users) and estimate the corresponding channel state information. A specific challenge lies in the fact that, due to the geographically distributed nature of the CF network, there is no fixed correspondence between codewords and large-scale fading coefficients (LSFCs). This makes current activity detection approaches which make use of this fixed LSFC-codeword association not directly applicable. To overcome this problem, we propose a scheme where the access codebook is partitioned in location-based subcodes, such that users in a particular location make use of the corresponding subcode. The joint message detection and channel estimation is obtained via a novel Approximated Message Passing (AMP) algorithm for a linear superposition of matrix-valued sources corrupted by noise. The statistical asymmetry in the fading profile and message activity leads to different statistics for the matrix sources, which distinguishes the AMP formulation from previous cases. In the regime where the codebook size scales linearly with L, while B and M are fixed, we present a rigorous high-dimensional (but finite-sample) analysis of the proposed AMP algorithm. Exploiting this, we then present a precise (and rigorous) large-system analysis of the message missed-detection and false-alarm rates, as well as the channel estimation mean-square error. The resulting system allows the seamless formation of user-centric clusters and very low latency beamformed uplink-downlink communication without explicit user-RU association, pilot allocation, and power control. This makes the proposed scheme highly appealing for low-latency random access communications in CF networks.},

Ye and Barg leveraged permutation matrices and Reed-Solomon type codes to devise 7 explicit constructions for constructing MDS array codes with optimal repair property (as known as MSR codes) or even optimal access property. Drawing inspiration from these explicit constructions, we provide two generic constructions for constructing MSR codes from high-rate MDS codes or MDS array codes. In this paper, we introduce the concepts of s-pairwise MDS codes sets and s-pairwise MDS array codes sets. Two generic constructions (Generic Constructions I and II) for constructing the MSR code using the s-pairwise MDS codes sets or the s-pairwise MDS array codes sets are given. Constructions 1 to 3 proposed by Ye and Barg can be regarded as some special cases of Generic Construction I, and Constructions 1 to 3 proposed by Li et al., can be regarded as some special cases of Generic Construction II. It is worth mentioning that Generic Construction II can be applied to any finite field, including the binary field. We also demonstrate how to obtain the s-pairwise MDS code sets and the s-pairwise MDS array code sets from a high-rate MDS code or MDS array code over $\mathbb {F}_{q}$ . We obtain a novel class of MSR codes by utilizing the MDS array codes provided by Lv et al., as component codes according to Generic Construction II. As a byproduct of Constructions 4 to 7, we obtain a new class of MSR codes with optimal access property. Using two types of sets $\Gamma _{1}$ and $\Gamma _{2}$ with the property that matrices commute, we present several new constructions for MSR codes with the optimal access property over any finite field. In this paper, compared with the constructions over binary field proposed by Li et al., the sub-packetization of our constructions applicable to the binary field is significantly reduced.},

While existing constructions for duplication-correcting codes can be straightforwardly adapted to this model, even resulting in optimal codes, their asymptotic rate is hard to find. In the regime of unbounded number of duplication errors, we either give the exact asymptotic rate of optimal codes, or bounds on it, depending on the values of k, $\ell $ and q.

  abstract     = {Analogies between codes and lattices have been extensively studied for the last decades. In this context, the MacWilliams identity is the finite analog of the Jacobi-Poisson summation formula of the theta function. Motivated by the random lattice theory, the statistical significance of MacWilliams theorem is considered. Indeed, the MacWilliams distribution provides a finite analog of the classical Gauss distribution. In particular, the MacWilliams distribution over quotient space of a code is statistically close to the uniform distribution. In the context of lattices, the analogy of MacWilliams identity associated with nu-function was conjectured by Sol√© in 1995. We give an answer to this problem.},

  abstract     = {Error-correcting codes resilient to synchronization errors such as insertions and deletions are known as insdel codes. In this paper, we present several new combinatorial upper and lower bounds on the maximum size of q-ary insdel codes. Our main upper bound is a sphere-packing bound obtained by solving a linear programming (LP) problem. It improves upon previous results for cases when the distance d or the alphabet size q is large. Our first lower bound is derived from a connection between insdel codes and matchings in special hypergraphs. This lower bound, together with our upper bound, shows that for fixed block length n and edit distance d, when q is sufficiently large, the maximum size of insdel codes is $ \frac {q^{n-\frac {d}{2}+1}}{\binom {n}{\frac {d}{2}-1}}(1 \pm o(1))$ . The second lower bound refines Alon et al.‚Äôs recent logarithmic improvement on Levenshtein‚Äôs GV-type bound and extends its applicability to large q and d.},

As applications, we further directly derive more non-GRS MDS codes, and get some results on the existence of their error-correcting pairs.

  abstract     = {Nowadays there are several classes of constrained codes intended for different applications. The following two large classes can be distinguished. The first class contains codes with local constraints; for example, the source data must be encoded by binary sequences containing no sub-words 00 and 111. The second class contains codes with global constraints; for example, the code-words must be binary sequences of certain even length where half of the symbols are zeros and half are ones. It is important to note that often the necessary codes must fulfill some requirements of both classes. In this paper we propose a general polynomial complexity method for constructing codes for both classes, as well as for combinations thereof. The proposed method uses the Cover enumerative code, but calculates all the parameters on the fly with polynomial complexity, unlike the known applications of that code which employ combinatorial formulae. The main idea of the paper is to use dynamic programming to perform calculations like: how many sequences with a given prefix and a given suffix length satisfying constraints exist. For the constraints under consideration, we do not need to know the entire prefix, but much less knowledge about the prefix is sufficient. That is, we only need a brief description of the prefix.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we present a class of codes, referred to as random staircase generator matrix codes (SGMCs), which have staircase-like generator matrices. In the infinite-length region, we prove that the random SGMC is capacity-achieving over binary-input output-symmetric (BIOS) channels. In the finite-length region, we propose the generalized representative ordered statistics decoding with local constraints (LC-ROSD) algorithm for the SGMCs. The most distinguished feature of the SGMCs with LC-ROSD is that the staircase-like matrices enable parallel implementation of the Gaussian elimination (GE), avoiding the serial GE of conventional OSD and supporting a potential low decoding latency, as implied from simulations. To analyze the performance of random SGMCs in the finite-length region, we derive the ensemble weight spectrum and invoke the conventional union bound. We also derive a partially random coding union (RCU) bound, which is tighter than the conventional one and is used as a criterion to design the SGMCs. Staircase-like generator matrices allow us to derive a series of (tighter and tighter) lower bounds based on the second-order Bonferroni inequality with the incremental number of codewords. The numerical results show that the decoding performance can match well with the proposed partially RCU bound for different code rates and different profiles. The numerical results also show that the tailored SGMCs with the LC-ROSD algorithm can approach the finite-length performance bound, outperforming the 5G low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes, 5G polar codes, and Reed-Muller (RM) codes.},

Hence it is a challenging task to construct non-Reed-Solomon type cyclic MDS codes. In this work, we obtain many new cyclic MDS codes for certain parameters by determining the solutions of the system of polynomial equations.

First, we derive the parallel Welch-Berlekamp (PWB) algorithm in a constructive manner based on the properties of solutions to the rational interpolation problem. The algorithm features the simultaneously performed discrepancy computation and polynomial update. Second, we explore the early-termination mechanism of the PWB algorithm for decoding of Reed-Solomon (RS) codes. By introducing the concept of incomplete error locator polynomial, we show that if $e \leq t$ (where e is the number of errors and t is the error correction capability), the PWB algorithm can be terminated at latest at the completion of the $(t+ e)$ -th iteration. This leads to the early-terminating PWB (EPWB) algorithm. Finally, we develop frequency-domain versions of the PWB and EPWB algorithms, namely, FPWB and FEPWB. The key point toward the two algorithms is to replace the update of polynomial coefficients with the update of polynomial evaluations. It is worth noting that the FEPWB algorithm applies only to shortened RS codes. Furthermore, an efficient systolic architecture for the FPWB algorithm is designed, which is easily adapted for the FEPWB algorithm.},

The primary goal of this work is to study the labeling capacity, which is defined as the maximal information rate that can be obtained using this labeling process. The labeling capacity is computed for almost any pattern of a single label and several results for multiple labels are provided as well. Moreover, we provide the optimal minimal number of labels of length one or two, over any alphabet of size q, that are needed in order to achieve the maximum labeling capacity of $\log _{2}(q)$ .

  abstract     = {In the setting of error-correcting codes with feedback, Alice wishes to communicate a k-bit message x to Bob by sending a sequence of bits over a channel while noiselessly receiving feedback from Bob. It has been long known (Berlekamp, 1964) that in this model, Bob can still correctly determine x even if $\approx \frac {1}{3}$ of Alice‚Äôs bits are flipped adversarially. This improves upon the classical setting without feedback, where recovery is not possible for error fractions exceeding $\frac {1}{4}$ . In the corresponding setting of erasures rather than bit flips, feedback improves the error resilience from $\frac {1}{2}-\epsilon $ to $1-\epsilon $ for any $\epsilon \gt 0$ . The original feedback setting assumes that after transmitting each bit, Alice knows (via feedback) what bit Bob received. In this work, our focus in on the limited feedback model, where Bob is only allowed to send a few bits at a small number of pre-designated points in the protocol. For any desired $\epsilon \gt 0$ , we construct a coding scheme that tolerates a $ 1/3-\epsilon $ fraction of bit flips (respectively a $1-\epsilon $ fraction of erasures) relying only on $O_{\epsilon } (\log k)$ bits of feedback from Bob sent in a fixed $O_{\epsilon } (1)$ number of rounds. We complement this with a matching lower bound showing that $\Omega (\log k)$ bits of feedback are necessary to recover from an error fraction exceeding $1/4$ (respectively $1/2$ for erasures), and for schemes resilient to a $1/3-\epsilon $ fraction of bit flips (respectively a $1-\epsilon $ fraction of erasures), the number of rounds must grow as $\epsilon \to 0$ .},

  abstract     = {For a multi-source multi-terminal noiseless network, the multicast key-dissemination problem, here called the key-cast problem, involves the task of multicasting a (secret) key K from the network sources to its terminals. Unlike traditional communication, where messages must be delivered from source to destination(s) unchanged, key-cast is more flexible since key-cast need not require source reconstruction at destination nodes. Instead, the distributed key can be a mixture of sources from which the sources themselves may be unrecoverable. Key-cast (also known as secret key agreement) in memoryless networks has seen significant studies over the past decades. This work initiates the study of key-cast in noiseless networks, i.e., network coding, and addresses the similarities and differences between traditional forms of communication that require source reconstruction and the less constrained form of communication in the key-cast task. The study varies according to three criteria. The setting can be secure, in which case the shared key is not revealed to an eavesdropper (whose capabilities we constrain), or non-secure, in which case the key need not be hidden. The setting can have one or multiple source nodes capable of generating independent randomness to be used in the key generation process. And the setting can have one or multiple terminal sets, where the latter case is referred to as multiple key-cast. In multiple key-cast, one requires that terminals in each terminal set decode a different shared key. In the given settings, this work derives combinatorial conditions for key-cast and multiple key-cast and designs corresponding communication schemes. In addition, the study compares the key-cast rate with and without the restriction of source reconstruction that is needed in traditional forms of communication. Key-cast achieves a strict advantage in rate when source reconstruction is relaxed.},

  abstract     = {Following initial work by JaJa, Ahlswede and Cai, and inspired by a recent renewed surge in interest in deterministic identification (DI) via noisy channels, we consider the problem in its generality for memoryless channels with finite output, but arbitrary input alphabets. Such a channel is essentially given by its output distributions as a subset in the probability simplex. Our main findings are that the maximum length of messages thus identifiable scales superlinearly as $R\,n\log n$ with the block length n, and that the optimal rate R is bounded in terms of the covering (aka Minkowski, or Kolmogorov, or entropy) dimension d of a certain algebraic transformation of the output set: $\frac {1}{4} d \leq R \leq \frac {1}{2} d$ . Remarkably, both the lower and upper Minkowski dimensions play a role in this result. Along the way, we present a Hypothesis Testing Lemma showing that it is sufficient to ensure pairwise reliable distinguishability of the output distributions to construct a DI code. Although we do not know the exact capacity formula, we can conclude that the DI capacity exhibits superactivation: there exist channels whose capacities individually are zero, but whose product has positive capacity. We also generalise these results to classical-quantum channels with finite-dimensional output quantum system, in particular to quantum channels on finite-dimensional quantum systems under the constraint that the identification code can only use tensor product inputs.},

  abstract     = {Marton‚Äôs optimal error exponent for the lossy source coding problem is defined as a non-convex optimization problem. This fact had prevented us to develop an efficient algorithm to compute it. This problem is caused by the fact that the rate-distortion function $R(\Delta |P)$ is potentially non-concave in the probability distribution P for a fixed distortion level $\Delta $ . The main contribution of this paper is the development of a parametric expression that is in perfect agreement with the inverse function of the Marton exponent. This representation has two layers. The inner layer is convex optimization and can be computed efficiently. The outer layer, on the other hand, is a non-convex optimization with respect to two parameters. We give a method for computing the Marton exponent based on this representation.},

To that end, at each time point we are allowed to update a finite-state machine with S states, using a possibly randomized but time-invariant rule, where each state of the machine is assigned an entropy estimate. Our goal is to characterize the minimax memory complexity $S^{*}$ of this problem, which is the minimal number of states for which the estimation task is feasible with probability at least $1-\delta $ asymptotically, uniformly in p. Specifically, we show that there exist universal constants $C_{1}$ and $C_{2}$ such that $ S^{*} \leq C_{1}\cdot \frac {n (\log n)^{4}}{\varepsilon ^{2}\delta }$ for $\varepsilon $ not too small, and $S^{*} \geq C_{2} \cdot \max \left \{{{n, \frac {\log n}{\varepsilon }}}\right \}$ for $\varepsilon $ not too large. The upper bound is proved using approximate counting to estimate the logarithm of p, and a finite memory bias estimation machine to estimate the expectation operation. The lower bound is proved via a reduction of entropy estimation to uniformity testing. We also apply these results to derive bounds on the memory complexity of mutual information estimation.},

In contrast to the Shannon capacity of a channel, the zero-error capacity has not even been shown to be computable: we have no convergent upper bounds. In this work, we present a new quantity, the zero-error unitary capacity, and show that it can be succinctly represented as the tensor product value of a quantum game. By studying the structure of finite automata, we show that the unitary capacity is within a controllable factor of the zero-error capacity. This allows new upper bounds through the sum-of-squares hierarchy, which converges to the commuting operator value of the game. Under the conjecture that the commuting operator and tensor product value of this game are equal, this would yield an algorithm for computing the zero-error capacity.},

  abstract     = {In outlier hypothesis testing, one aims to detect outlying sequences among a given set of sequences, where most sequences are generated i.i.d. from a nominal distribution while outlying sequences (outliers) are generated i.i.d. from a different anomalous distribution. Most existing studies focus on discrete-valued sequences, where each data sample takes values in a finite set. To account for practical scenarios where data sequences usually take real values and the number of outlying sequence is unknown, we study outlier hypothesis testing for continuous sequences when there might exist multiple outliers, and both the nominal and anomalous distributions are unknown. Specifically, we propose distribution free tests and prove that the probabilities of misclassification error, false reject and false alarm decay exponentially fast for three different test designs: fixed-length test, sequential test, and two-phase test. In a fixed-length test, one fixes the sample size of each observed sequence; in a sequential test, one takes a sample sequentially from each sequence per unit time until a reliable decision can be made; in a two-phase test, one adapts the sample size from two different fixed values. Remarkably, the two-phase test achieves a good balance between test design complexity and theoretical performance.},

  abstract     = {This paper investigates the capacity of finite-state channels (FSCs) with feedback. We derive an upper bound on the feedback capacity of FSCs by extending the duality upper bound method from mutual information to the case of directed information. The upper bound is expressed as a multi-letter expression that depends on a test distribution on the sequence of channel outputs. For any FSC, we show that if the test distribution is structured on a Q-graph, the upper bound can be formulated as a Markov decision process (MDP) whose state being a belief on the channel state. In the case of FSCs and states that are either unifilar or have a finite memory, the MDP state simplifies to take values in a finite set. Consequently, the MDP consists of a finite number of states, actions, and disturbances. This finite nature of the MDP is of significant importance, as it ensures that dynamic programming algorithms can solve the associated Bellman equation to establish analytical upper bounds, even for channels with large alphabets. We demonstrate the simplicity of computing bounds by establishing the capacity of a broad family of Noisy Output is the State (NOST) channels as a simple closed-form analytical expression. Furthermore, we introduce novel, nearly optimal analytical upper bounds on the capacity of the Noisy Ising channel.},

  abstract     = {This paper explores Bayesian lower bounds on the minimum mean squared error (MMSE) that belong to the well-known Ziv-Zakai family. The Ziv-Zakai technique relies on connecting the bound to an $\mathsf M$ -ary hypothesis testing problem. There are three versions of the Ziv-Zakai bound (ZZB): the first version relies on the so-called valley-filling function, the second one is a relaxation of the first bound which omits the valley-filling function, and the third one, namely the single-point ZZB (SZZB), replaces the integration present in the first two bounds with a single point maximization. The first part of this paper focuses on providing the most general version of the bounds. It is shown that these bounds hold without any assumption on the distribution of the estimand. This makes the bounds applicable to discrete and mixed distributions. Then, the SZZB is extended to an $\mathsf M$ -ary setting and a version of it that holds for the multivariate setting is provided. In the second part, general properties of these bounds are provided. First, unlike the Bayesian Cram√©r-Rao bound, it is shown that all the versions of the ZZB tensorize. Second, a characterization of the high-noise asymptotic is provided, which is used to argue about the tightness of the bounds. Third, a complete low-noise asymptotic is provided under the assumptions of mixed-input distributions and Gaussian additive noise channels. In the low-noise, it is shown that the ZZB is generally tight, but there are examples for which the SZZB is not tight. In the third part, the tightness of the bounds is evaluated. First, it is shown that in the low-noise regime the ZZB without the valley-filling function, and, therefore, also the ZZB with the valley-filling function, are tight for mixed-input distributions and Gaussian additive noise channels. Second, for discrete inputs it is shown that the ZZB with the valley-filling function is always sub-optimal, and equal to zero without the valley-filling function. Third, unlike for the ZZB, an example is shown for which the SZZB is tight to the MMSE for discrete inputs. Fourth, sufficient and necessary conditions for the tightness of the bounds are provided. Finally, some examples are provided in which the bounds in the Ziv-Zakai family outperform other well-known Bayesian lower bounds, namely the Cram√©r-Rao bound and the maximum entropy bound.},

  abstract     = {Aperiodic autocorrelation is an important indicator of performance of sequences used in communications, remote sensing, and scientific instrumentation. Knowing a sequence‚Äôs autocorrelation function, which reports the autocorrelation at every possible translation, is equivalent to knowing the magnitude of the sequence‚Äôs Fourier transform. The phase problem is the difficulty in resolving this lack of phase information. We say that two sequences are equicorrelational to mean that they have the same aperiodic autocorrelation function. Sequences used in technological applications often have restrictions on their terms: they are not arbitrary complex numbers, but come from a more restricted alphabet. For example, binary sequences involve terms equal to only +1 and ‚àí1. We investigate the necessary and sufficient conditions for two sequences to be equicorrelational, where we take their alphabet into consideration. There are trivial forms of equicorrelationality arising from modifications that predictably preserve the autocorrelation, for example, negating a binary sequence or reversing the order of its terms. By a search of binary sequences up to length 44, we find that nontrivial equicorrelationality among binary sequences does occur, but is rare. An integer n is said to be equivocal when there are binary sequences of length n that are nontrivially equicorrelational; otherwise n is unequivocal. For $n \leq 44$ , we found that the unequivocal lengths are 1‚Äì8, 10, 11, 13, 14, 19, 22, 23, 26, 29, 37, and 38. We pose open questions about the finitude of unequivocal numbers and the probability of nontrivial equicorrelationality occurring among binary sequences.},

  abstract     = {Various problems in engineering and natural science demand binary sequences that do not resemble translates of themselves, that is, the sequences must have small aperiodic autocorrelation at every nonzero shift. If f is a sequence, then the demerit factor of f is the sum of the squared magnitudes of the autocorrelations at all nonzero shifts for the sequence obtained by normalizing f to unit Euclidean norm. The demerit factor is the reciprocal of Golay‚Äôs merit factor, and low demerit factor indicates low self-similarity of a sequence under translation. We endow the $2^{\ell } $ binary sequences of length $\ell $ with uniform probability measure and consider the distribution of their demerit factors. Earlier works used combinatorial techniques to find exact formulas for the mean, variance, skewness, and kurtosis of the distribution as a function of $\ell $ . These revealed that for $\ell \geq 4$ , the pth central moment of this distribution is strictly positive for every $p \geq 2$ . This article shows that for every p, the pth central moment is $\ell ^{-2 p}$ times a quasi-polynomial function of $\ell $ with rational coefficients. It also shows that, in the limit as $\ell $ tends to infinity, the pth standardized moment is the same as that of the standard normal distribution.},

  abstract     = {Plagued by slow or failing workers (also known as stragglers), the speedup gain assumed by distributed learning often falls short. Although substantial efforts have been devoted to mitigating this straggling effect with coding-theoretic techniques, existing pioneering works often suffer from two issues: dense combination and inflexibility. In particular, a code that involves dense combination of sub-tasks may destroy sparsity and lead to heavy workload. In contrast, an inflexible code that conservatively designs its computation procedure according to the presumed maximum number of stragglers may entail unnecessary redundancy when the actual number of stragglers is small. To this end, a generic framework based on matrix splitting is proposed in this work to construct sparse and flexible codes. Specifically, by splitting an original sparse coding matrix into two sparser sub-matrices, a two-layer coded computation that maintains sparsity can be created accordingly. In the meantime, when the actual number of stragglers is small, the computation may be flexibly terminated at layer-one without executing layer-two, thereby avoiding unnecessary computation. Based on this framework, a novel flexible Bernoulli code is proposed. In addition, by deriving a lower bound in closed-form through the lens of a bipartite graph, its decoding probability is shown to be high and asymptotically one. Moreover, extensive simulations including an application in distributed learning of LeNet are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.},

  abstract     = {We study the Distributed Wireless Link Scheduling (DWLS) problem: there is a set of n autonomous stations, called senders, each with a message to be delivered to some other station, called receiver. The names and locations of all stations are arbitrarily selected and unknown to each other, to mirror an arbitrary scenario that may occur in mobile communication. Each pair ((sender,receiver),message) is called a request, and the event of successfully delivering the message is called the realization of the request. In the DWLS problem, the requests are realized through wireless communication links (which is a conceptual notion of two nodes being capable of direct wireless delivery of a message) between the stations. The decision to transmit a message is made locally by each station. We consider networks where communication links may interfere with each other, where the interference is an arbitrary input function of each pair of links, customarily called affectance; if the total affectance of other links whose senders are currently transmitting is above a given threshold, the considered transmission is not successful. In the above context, we study the impact of the number of truly random bits used by each link/sender, on the length of the transmission schedules. Specifically, for any set L of n requests with maximum average affectance $A(L)$ , we present a deterministic algorithm (i.e., 0 random bits) and a randomized algorithm using $O(\log A(L)\log n)$ random bits per link. (In this abstract we present formulas in simplified forms, for brevity.) The lengths of their transmission schedules are $O(A(L)^{2}\log ^{3} n)$ and $O(A(L)\log n)$ , respectively. We then combine both approaches to get a randomized solution using $O(\log W \log n)$ truly random bits per station with schedules of length $O\left ({{\frac {A(L)^{2}}{W}\log n}}\right)$ , for any $W\le A(L)$ . To the best of our knowledge, our study is a first step towards understanding the trade-offs between randomness and time complexity of Link Scheduling under arbitrary interference. It is particularly important as currently used (in practice) wireless protocols are either deterministic or use a very small random seed of (truly) random bits.},

Previous works propose the use of MDS codes to treat the responses from malicious workers as errors and correct them using the error-correction properties of the code. This comes at the expense of increasing the replication, i.e., the number of workers each partial gradient is computed by. In this work, we propose a way to reduce the replication to $ {s} +1$ instead of $2 {s} +1$ in the presence of s malicious workers. Our method detects erroneous inputs from the malicious workers, transforming them into erasures. This comes at the expense of s additional local computations at the main node and additional rounds of light communication between the main node and the workers. We define a general framework and give fundamental limits for fractional repetition data allocations. Our scheme is optimal in terms of replication and local computation and incurs a communication cost that is asymptotically, in the size of the dataset, a multiplicative factor away from the derived bound. We furthermore show how additional redundancy can be exploited to reduce the number of local computations and communication cost, or, alternatively, tolerate straggling workers.},

  abstract     = {This paper studies covert communication over channels with Action-Dependent State Information (ADSI) when the state is available either non-causally or causally at the transmitter. Covert communication refers to reliable communication between a transmitter and a receiver while ensuring a low probability of detection by an adversary, which we refer to as ‚Äúwarden‚Äù. It is well known that in a point-to-point Discrete Memoryless Channel (DMC), it is possible to communicate on the order of $\sqrt {N}$ bits reliably and covertly over N channel uses while the transmitter and the receiver are required to share a secret key on the order of $\sqrt {N}$ bits. This paper studies achieving reliable and covert communication of positive rate, i.e., reliable and covert communication on the order of N bits in N channel uses, over a channel with ADSI while the transmitter has non-causal or causal access to the ADSI, and the transmitter and the receiver share a secret key of negligible rate. We derive achievable rates for both the non-causal and causal scenarios by using block-Markov encoding and secret key generation from the ADSI, which subsumes the best achievable rates for channels with random states. We also derive upper bounds, for both non-causal and causal scenarios, that meet our achievable rates for some special cases. As an application of our problem setup, we study covert communication over channels with rewrite options, which are closely related to recording covert information on memory, and show that a positive covert rate can be achieved in such channels. As a special case of our problem, we study the Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) channels and provide lower and upper bounds on the covert capacity that meet when the transmitter and the receiver share a secret key of sufficient rate and when the warden‚Äôs channel is noisier than the legitimate receiver channel. As another application of our problem setup, we show that cooperation can lead to a positive covert rate in Gaussian channels. A few other examples are also worked out in detail.},

The channel is governed by discrete memoryless and i.i.d. channel states, and the channel state information (CSI) is revealed to the encoders in a causal manner. The main results of this paper are inner and outer bounds of the capacity region, for which we investigate coding schemes incorporating wiretap coding and secret key agreements between the sender and the legitimate receiver. Two kinds of block Markov coding schemes are proposed. The first is a new coding scheme that uses backward decoding and the Wyner-Ziv coding, and the secret key is constructed from a lossy description of the CSI. The other is an extended version of an existing coding scheme for point-to-point wiretap channels with causal CSI. A numerical example shows that the achievable region given by the first coding scheme can be strictly larger than the second one. However, these two schemes do not outperform each other in general, and there exist some numerical examples in which each coding scheme achieves some rate pairs that cannot be achieved by another scheme. Our established inner bound reduces to some best-known results in the literature as special cases. We further investigate some capacity-achieving cases for state-dependent multiple access wiretap channels (SD-MAWCs) with degraded message sets. It turns out that the two coding schemes are both optimal in these cases.},

  abstract     = {We consider the federated submodel learning (FSL) problem in a distributed storage system. In the FSL framework, the full learning model at the server side is divided into multiple submodels such that each selected client needs to download only the required submodel(s) and upload the corresponding update(s) in accordance with its local training data. The server comprises multiple independent databases and the full model is stored across these databases. A fundamental problem in FSL is to enable these multiple databases at the parameter server to collectively maintain a consistent view of the global parameters to facilitate parallel computing across distributed clients. In addition, a practically implementable FSL scheme should possess high throughput, efficient performance, fault tolerance, sufficient privacy, adequate security, certifiable stability, elastic scalability and easy usability features. To specifically resolve the fault tolerance and adequate security issues together, we propose a novel coding mechanism coined ramp secure regenerating coding (RSRC), which is a synthesis of ramp secret sharing and secure regenerating code. This coding technique matches FSL perfectly, as the system performance can be further improved when the full model is stored using RSRC in a distributed manner. By incorporating and extending available techniques cleverly, our new RSRC-based distributed FSL approach that is constructed on top of our earlier two-database FSL scheme which uses private set union (PSU), achieves all of the aforementioned important features. A complete one-round FSL process consists of: 1) an FSL-PSU phase where the union of the submodel indices to be updated by the selected clients in the current round is determined, 2) an FSL-write phase where the updated submodels are written back to the databases, and 3) additional auxiliary phases where sufficient amounts of necessary common randomness are generated at both server and client sides.},

However, many aspects including the role of small random initialization and how the various parameters of the model are coupled during gradient-based updates to facilitate good generalization remain largely mysterious. A series of recent papers have begun to study this role for non-convex formulations of symmetric Positive Semi-Definite (PSD) matrix sensing problems which involve reconstructing a low-rank PSD matrix from a few linear measurements. The underlying symmetry/PSDness is crucial to existing convergence and generalization guarantees for this problem. In this paper, we study a general overparameterized low-rank matrix sensing problem where one wishes to reconstruct an asymmetric rectangular low-rank matrix from a few linear measurements. We prove that an overparameterized model trained via factorized gradient descent converges to the low-rank matrix generating the measurements. We show that in this setting, factorized gradient descent enjoys two implicit properties: (1) coupling of the trajectory of gradient descent where the factors are coupled in various ways throughout the gradient update trajectory and (2) an algorithmic regularization property where the iterates show a propensity towards low-rank models despite the overparameterized nature of the factorized model. These two implicit properties in turn allow us to show that the gradient descent trajectory from small random initialization moves towards solutions that are both globally optimal and generalize well.},

  abstract     = {A more general formulation of the linear bandit problem is considered to allow for dependencies over time. Specifically, it is assumed that there exists an unknown $\mathbb {R}^{d}$ -valued stationary $\varphi $ -mixing sequence of parameters $(\theta _{t}, \; t \in \mathbb {N})$ which gives rise to payoffs. This instance of the problem can be viewed as a generalization of both the classical linear bandits with iid noise, and the finite-armed restless bandits. In light of the well-known computational hardness of optimal policies for restless bandits, an approximation is proposed whose error is shown to be controlled by the $\varphi $ -dependence between consecutive $\theta _{t}$ . An optimistic algorithm, called LinMix-UCB, is proposed for the case where $\theta _{t}$ has an exponential mixing rate. The proposed algorithm is shown to incur a sub-linear regret of $\mathcal {O}\left ({{\sqrt {d n\mathop {\mathrm {polylog}} (n) }}}\right)$ with respect to an oracle that always plays a multiple of $\mathbb {E}\;\theta _{t}$ . The main challenge in this setting is to ensure that the exploration-exploitation strategy is robust against long-range dependencies. The proposed method relies on Berbee‚Äôs coupling lemma to carefully select near-independent samples and construct confidence ellipsoids around empirical estimates of $\mathbb {E}\;\theta _{t}$ .},

  abstract     = {We propose SDORE, a semi-supervised deep Sobolev regressor, for the nonparametric estimation of the underlying regression function and its gradient. SDORE employs deep ReQU neural networks to minimize the empirical risk with gradient norm regularization, allowing the approximation of the regularization term by unlabeled data. Our study includes a thorough analysis of the convergence rates of SDORE in $L^{2}$ -norm, achieving the minimax optimality. Further, we establish a convergence rate for the associated plug-in gradient estimator, even in the presence of significant domain shift. These theoretical findings offer valuable insights for selecting regularization parameters and determining the size of the neural network, while showcasing the provable advantage of leveraging unlabeled data in semi-supervised learning. To the best of our knowledge, SDORE is the first provable neural network-based approach that simultaneously estimates the regression function and its gradient, with diverse applications such as nonparametric variable selection. The effectiveness of SDORE is validated through an extensive range of numerical simulations.},

While existing approximation theories leverage the smoothness of score functions, they suffer from the curse of dimensionality for intrinsically high-dimensional data. This limitation is pronounced in graphical models such as Markov random fields, where the approximation efficiency of score functions remains unestablished. To address this, we note score functions can often be well-approximated in graphical models through variational inference denoising algorithms. Furthermore, these algorithms can be efficiently represented by neural networks. We demonstrate this through examples, including Ising models, conditional Ising models, restricted Boltzmann machines, and sparse encoding models. Combined with off-the-shelf discretization error bounds for diffusion-based sampling, we provide an efficient sample complexity bound for diffusion-based generative modeling when the score function is learned by deep neural networks.},

  abstract     = {Non-malleable codes are fundamental objects at the intersection of cryptography and coding theory. These codes provide security guarantees even in settings where error correction and detection are impossible, and have found applications to several other cryptographic tasks. One of the strongest and most well-studied adversarial tampering models is 2-split-state tampering. Here, a codeword is split into two parts which are stored in physically distant servers, and the adversary can then independently tamper with each part using arbitrary functions. This model can be naturally extended to the secret sharing setting with several parties by having the adversary independently tamper with each share. Previous works on non-malleable coding and secret sharing in the split-state tampering model only considered the encoding of classical messages. Furthermore, until recent work by Aggarwal, Boddu, and Jain (IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory 2024 & arXiv 2022), adversaries with quantum capabilities and shared entanglement had not been considered, and it is a priori not clear whether previous schemes remain secure in this model. In this work, we introduce the notions of split-state non-malleable codes and secret sharing schemes for quantum messages secure against quantum adversaries with shared entanglement. Then, we present explicit constructions of such schemes that achieve low-error non-malleability. More precisely, for some constant $c\gt 0$ , we construct efficiently encodable and decodable split-state non-malleable codes and secret sharing schemes for quantum messages preserving entanglement with external systems and achieving security against quantum adversaries having shared entanglement with codeword length n, any message length at most $n^{c}$ , and error $\varepsilon =2^{-{n^{c}}}$ . In the easier setting of average-case non-malleability, we achieve efficient non-malleable coding with rate close to $1/11$ .},

This paper delves into the entanglement cost for discriminating two bipartite quantum states, employing positive operator-valued measures (POVMs) with positive partial transpose (PPT) to achieve optimal success probability through general entangled measurements. We first introduce two quantities called the spectral PPT-distance and relative spectral PPT-distance of a POVM to quantify the localness of a general measurement. We show these quantities are related to the entanglement cost of optimal discrimination by PPT POVMs. Following this, we establish bounds and develop SDP hierarchies to estimate the entanglement cost of optimal discrimination by PPT POVMs for any pair of states. Leveraging these results, we show that a pure state can be optimally discriminated against any other state with the assistance of a single Bell state. This study advances our understanding of the pivotal role played by entanglement in quantum state discrimination, serving as a crucial element in unlocking quantum data hiding against locally constrained measurements.},

Charlie uses local and pairwise shared randomness to compute a bivariate function of the measurement outcomes. The objective of three agents is to faithfully simulate the given distributed quantum measurement acting on the given quantum state while minimizing the communication and shared randomness rates. We demonstrate a new inner bound to the rate region using random structured POVMs based on asymptotically good algebraic codes, and characterize the performance limit using single-letter quantum mutual information quantities. This new bound subsumes the largest known inner bound and improves upon it strictly for identified examples. One of the challenges in analyzing these structured POVMs is that they exhibit only pairwise independence and induce only uniform single-letter distributions. We address these in the non-commutative quantum setting, and provide a two-party distributed faithful simulation and function computation protocol.},

  abstract     = {We propose a new proof method for direct coding theorems for wiretap channels where the eavesdropper has access to a quantum version of the transmitted signal on an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space and the legitimate parties communicate through a classical channel or a classical input, quantum output (cq) channel. The transmitter input can be subject to an additive cost constraint, which specializes to the case of an average energy constraint. This method yields errors that decay exponentially with increasing block lengths. Moreover, it provides a guarantee of a quantum version of semantic security, which is an established concept in classical cryptography and physical layer security. Therefore, it complements existing works which either do not prove the exponential error decay or use weaker notions of security. The main part of this proof method is a direct coding result on channel resolvability which states that there is only a doubly exponentially small probability that a standard random codebook does not solve the channel resolvability problem for the cq channel. Semantic security has strong operational implications meaning essentially that the eavesdropper cannot use its quantum observation to gather any meaningful information about the transmitted signal. We also discuss the connections between semantic security and various other established notions of secrecy.},

  abstract     = {Understanding the noise affecting a quantum device is of fundamental importance for scaling quantum technologies. A particularly important class of noise models is that of Pauli channels, as randomized compiling techniques can effectively bring any quantum channel to this form and are significantly more structured than general quantum channels. In this paper, we show fundamental lower bounds on the sample complexity for learning Pauli channels in diamond norm. We consider strategies that may not use auxiliary systems entangled with the input to the unknown channel and have to perform a measurement before reusing the channel. For non-adaptive algorithms, we show a lower bound of $\Omega (2^{3n}\varepsilon ^{-2})$ to learn an n-qubit Pauli channel. In particular, this shows that the recently introduced learning procedure by Flammia and Wallman (2020) is essentially optimal. In the adaptive setting, we show a lower bound of $\Omega (2^{2.5n}\varepsilon ^{-2})$ for $\varepsilon ={\mathcal {O}}(2^{-n})$ , and a lower bound of $\Omega (2^{2n}\varepsilon ^{-2})$ for any $\varepsilon \gt 0$ . This last lower bound holds even in a stronger model where in each step, before performing the measurement, the unknown channel may be used arbitrarily many times sequentially interspersed with unital operations.},

Specifically, leveraging Bayesian statistical tools, we analyze the asymptotic regime with a large number of receive antennas. In the coherent case, where the channel state information (CSI) is known at the receiver‚Äôs side, we characterize the asymptotic capacity and derive the exact scaling in the extreme regimes of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and the number of transmit antennas. In the non-coherent case, where the CSI is unknown but remains constant during T symbol periods, we first obtain the exact asymptotic capacity for $T\le 3$ . Then, we propose a scheme involving uniform signaling in the covariance space and derive a non-asymptotic lower bound on the capacity for an arbitrary block size T. Furthermore, we propose a genie-aided upper bound where the channel is revealed to the receiver. We show that the upper and lower bounds coincide when T is large. In the low SNR regime, we derive the asymptotic capacity up to a vanishing term, which, remarkably, matches our capacity lower bound.},

  abstract     = {In order to explore how blind interference alignment (BIA) schemes may take advantage of side-information in computation tasks, we study the degrees of freedom (DoF) of a K user wireless network setting that arises in full-duplex wireless MapReduce applications. In this setting the receivers are assumed to have reconfigurable antennas and channel knowledge, while the transmitters have neither, i.e., the transmitters lack channel knowledge and are only equipped with conventional antennas. The central ingredient of the problem formulation is the message structure arising out of the Shuffle phase of MapReduce, whereby each transmitter has a subset of messages that need to be delivered to various receivers, and each receiver has a subset of messages available to it in advance as side-information. We approach this problem by decomposing it into distinctive stages that help identify key ingredients of the overall solution. The novel elements that emerge from the first stage, called broadcast with groupcast messages, include an outer maximum distance separable (MDS) code structure at the transmitter, and an algorithm for iteratively determining groupcast-optimal reconfigurable antenna switching patterns at the receiver to achieve intra-message (among the symbols of the same message) alignment. The next stage, called unicast with side-information, reveals optimal inter-message (among symbols of different messages) alignment patterns to exploit side-information, and by a relabeling of messages, connects to the desired MapReduce setting.},

  abstract     = {The goal of the trace reconstruction problem is to recover a string $\mathbf {x}\in \{0,1\}^{n}$ given many independent traces of x, where a trace is a subsequence obtained from deleting bits of x independently with some given probability $p\in [0,1$ ). A recent result of Chase (STOC 2021) shows how x can be determined (in exponential time) from $\exp ({O}(n^{1/5})\log ^{5} n)$ traces. This is the state-of-the-art result on the sample complexity of trace reconstruction. In this paper we consider two kinds of algorithms for the trace reconstruction problem. We first observe that the bound of Chase, which is based on statistics of arbitrary length-k subsequences, can also be obtained by considering the ‚Äúk-mer statistics‚Äù, i.e., statistics regarding occurrences of contiguous k-bit strings (a.k.a, k-mers) in the initial string x, for $k = 2n^{1/5}$ . Mazooji and Shomorony (arXiv.2210.10917) show that such statistics (called k-mer density map) can be estimated within $\varepsilon $ accuracy from $ {\mathrm {poly}} (n, 2^{k}, 1/ {\varepsilon })$ traces. We call an algorithm to be k-mer-based if it reconstructs x given estimates of the k-mer density map. Such algorithms essentially capture all the analyses in the worst-case and smoothed-complexity models of the trace reconstruction problem we know of so far. Our first, and technically more involved, result shows that any k-mer-based algorithm for trace reconstruction must use $\exp (\Omega (n^{1/5} \sqrt {\log n}))$ traces, thus establishing the optimality of this number of traces. The analysis of this result also shows that the analysis technique used by Chase (STOC 2021) is essentially tight, and hence new techniques are needed in order to improve the worst-case upper bound. This result is shown by considering an appropriate class of real polynomials, that have been previously studied in the context of trace estimation (De, O‚ÄôDonnell, Servedio. Annals of Probability 2019; Nazarov, Peres. STOC 2017), and proving that two of these polynomials are very close to each other on an arc in the complex plane. Our proof of the proximity of such polynomials uses new technical ingredients that allow us to focus on just a few coefficients of these polynomials. Our second, simple, result considers the performance of the Maximum Likelihood Estimator (MLE), which specifically picks the source string that has the maximum likelihood to generate the samples (traces). We show that the MLE algorithm uses a nearly optimal number of traces, i.e., up to a factor of n in the number of samples needed for an optimal algorithm, and show that this factor of n loss may be necessary under general ‚Äúmodel estimation‚Äù settings.},

  abstract     = {Reed-Solomon (RS) codes are widely used to correct errors in storage systems. Finding the error locator polynomial is one of the key steps in the error correction procedure of RS codes. Modular Approach (MA) is an effective algorithm for solving the Welch-Berlekamp (WB) key-equation problem to find the error locator polynomial that needs $2t$ steps, where t is the error correction capability. In this paper, we first present a new MA algorithm that only requires $2e$ steps and then propose two fast decoding algorithms for RS codes based on our MA algorithm, where e is the number of errors and $e\leq t$ . We propose the Improved-Frequency Domain Modular Approach (I-FDMA) algorithm that needs $2e$ steps to solve the error locator polynomial and present our first decoding algorithm based on the I-FDMA algorithm. We show that, compared with the existing methods based on MA algorithms, our I-FDMA algorithm can effectively reduce the decoding complexity of RS codes when $e\lt t$ . Furthermore, we propose the $t_{0}$ -Shortened I-FDMA ( $t_{0}$ -SI-FDMA) algorithm ( $t_{0}$ is a predetermined even number less than $2t-1$ ) based on the new termination mechanism to solve the error number e quickly. We propose our second decoding algorithm based on the SI-FDMA algorithm for RS codes and show that the multiplication complexity of our second decoding algorithm is lower than our first decoding algorithm (the I-FDMA decoding algorithm) when $2e\lt t_{0}+1$ .},

When the matrix X is input, the channel outputs $Y=A(X+W)$ where A is a uniformly chosen $n\times n$ invertible matrix over $\mathbb {F}_{q}$ and where W is a uniformly chosen $n\times m$ matrix over $\mathbb {F}_{q}$ of rank t.

They also determined the leading term of the capacity when q is fixed, and t, n and m grow linearly. We generalise these results, showing that the condition $2n\geq m$ can be removed. (Our formula for the capacity falls into two cases, one of which generalises the $2n\geq m$ case.) We also improve the error term in the case when q is fixed.},

  abstract     = {Batched sparse (BATS) codes were proposed as a reliable communication solution for networks with packet loss. In the finite-length regime, the error probability of BATS codes under belief propagation (BP) decoding has been studied in the literature and can be analyzed by recursive formulae. However, all existing analyses have not considered precoding or have treated the BATS code and the precode as two separate entities. In this paper, we analyze the word-wise error probability of finite-length BATS codes with a precode under joint decoding, including BP decoding and maximum-likelihood (ML) decoding. The joint BP decoder performs peeling decoding on a joint Tanner graph constructed from both the BATS and the precode Tanner graphs, and the joint ML decoder solves a single linear system with all linear constraints implied by the BATS code and the precode. We derive closed-form upper bounds on the error probability for both decoders. Specifically, low-density parity-check (LDPC) precodes are used for BP decoding, and any generic precode can be used for ML decoding. Even for BATS codes without a precode, the derived upper bound for BP decoding is more accurate than the approximate recursive formula, and easier to compute than the exact recursive formula. The accuracy of the two upper bounds has been verified by many simulation results. Based on the two upper bounds, we formulate an optimization problem to optimize the degree distribution of LDPC-precoded BATS codes, which improves BP performance, ML performance, or both. In our experiments, to transmit 128 packets over a line network with packet loss, the optimized LDPC-precoded BATS codes reduce the transmission overhead to less than 50% of that of standard BATS codes under comparable decoding complexity constraints.},

  abstract     = {A simple, recently observed generalization of the classical Singleton bound to list-decoding asserts that rate R codes are not list-decodable using list-size L beyond an error fraction $\tfrac {L}{L+1} (1-R)$ (the Singleton bound being the case of $L=1$ , i.e., unique decoding). We prove that in order to approach this bound for any fixed $L \gt 1$ , one needs exponential alphabets. Specifically, for every $L\gt 1$ and $R\in (0,1)$ , if a rate R code can be list-of-L decoded up to error fraction $\tfrac {L}{L+1} (1-R -\varepsilon)$ , then its alphabet must have size at least $\exp (\Omega _{L,R}(1/\varepsilon))$ . This is in sharp contrast to the situation for unique decoding where certain families of rate R algebraic-geometry (AG) codes over an alphabet of size $O(1/\varepsilon ^{2})$ are unique-decodable up to error fraction $(1-R-\varepsilon)/2$ . Our bounds hold even for subconstant $\varepsilon \ge 1/n$ , implying that any code exactly achieving the L-th generalized Singleton bound requires alphabet size $2^{\Omega _{L,R}(n)}$ . Previously this was only known only for $L=2$ under the additional assumptions that the code is both linear and MDS. Our lower bound is tight up to constant factors in the exponent‚Äîwith high probability random codes (or, as shown recently, even random linear codes) over $\exp (O_{L}(1/\varepsilon))$ -sized alphabets, can be list-of-L decoded up to error fraction $\tfrac {L}{L+1} (1-R -\varepsilon)$ .},

  abstract     = {In conventional DNA synthesis machines, usually many strands are synthesized in parallel by iterating through a supersequence $\boldsymbol {s}$ and adding in each cycle the next nucleotide to a programmable subset of the strands. The length of $\boldsymbol {s}$ determines the number of the cycles, hence the time and the cost of the synthesis process. Recently, in order to reduce the number of synthesis cycles, researchers have suggested to append in each cycle a shortmer, i.e., a sequence of nucleotides, instead of a single one. The present work studies this synthesis technique from a theoretical point of view. In particular, it discusses which shortmers are the best to use (in order to reduce the number of cycles), and how to calculate the number of cycles required to synthesize in parallel a set of strands using a given set of shormers. Lastly, and following a previously described connection between the DNA synthesis problem and costly constrained graphs, this paper investigates calculating the capacity of non-deterministic costly constrained graphs.},

Twenty five years later, an infinite family of binary self-dual cyclic codes with lengths $n_{i}$ and minimum distances $d_{i} \geq \frac {1}{2} \sqrt {n_{i}+2}$ was presented in a paper of IEEE Trans.

However, no infinite family of Euclidean self-dual binary cyclic codes whose minimum distances have the square-root lower bound and no infinite family of Euclidean self-dual nonbinary cyclic codes whose minimum distances have a lower bound better than the square-root lower bound are known in the literature. In this paper, an infinite family of Euclidean self-dual cyclic codes over the fields ${\mathrm { F}}_{2^{s}}$ with a square-root-like lower bound is constructed. An infinite subfamily of this family consists of self-dual binary cyclic codes with the square-root lower bound. Another infinite subfamily of this family consists of self-dual cyclic codes over the fields ${\mathrm { F}}_{2^{s}}$ with a lower bound better than the square-root bound for $s \geq 2$ . Consequently, two breakthroughs in coding theory are made in this paper. An infinite family of self-dual binary cyclic codes with a square-root-like lower bound is also presented in this paper. An infinite family of Hermitian self-dual cyclic codes over the fields ${\mathrm { F}}_{2^{2s}}$ with a square-root-like lower bound and an infinite family of Euclidean self-dual linear codes over ${\mathrm { F}}_{q}$ with $q \equiv 1 \pmod {4}$ with a square-root-like lower bound are also constructed in this paper.},

Stated more constructively, we show that certain necessary requirements have to be met in order to produce a feasible solution to the dual linear program of Delsarte (1973), which improves on the first linear programming bound, following this line of argument.},

Our construction considers the gaps in a Weierstrass semigroup of a rational place in an algebraic function field to achieve a similar increase in the rate. This construction shows that there is potential in utilizing AG codes and their subcodes in SDMM since we demonstrate a better performance compared to state-of-the-art schemes in some parameter regimes.},

In this paper, we investigate minimal pseudocodewords of binary Hamming codes described by full-rank parity-check matrices. We first provide some general results on minimal pseudocodewords with support size 3 of a binary parity-check matrix. We also prove a lower bound on the minimum binary symmetric channel (BSC) pseudoweight of a binary parity-check matrix. Then we prove that a full-rank parity-check matrix of a binary Hamming code has minimal pseudocodewords of certain types whose support sizes are larger than 3. Interestingly enough, the BSC pseudoweight of all these minimal pseudocodewords is 2. Using this fact as well as the above-mentioned lower bound, we further prove that a full-rank parity-check matrix of a binary Hamming code has minimum BSC pseudoweight 2. Moreover, the additive white Gaussian noise channel (AWGNC) pseudoweight of all these minimal pseudocodewords is 3. Based on numerical observations, we conjecture that a full-rank parity-check matrix of a binary Hamming code has minimum AWGNC pseudoweight 3. Finally, we provide more properties of a subset of minimal pseudocodewords of a full-rank parity-check matrix of a binary Hamming code.},

  abstract     = {Fundamental limits on the error probabilities of a family of decentralized detection algorithms (e.g., the social learning rule proposed by Lalitha et al., 2018) over directed graphs are investigated. In decentralized detection, a network of nodes locally exchanging information about the samples they observe with their neighbors to collectively infer the underlying unknown hypothesis. Each node in the network weighs the messages received from its neighbors to form its private belief and only requires knowledge of the data generating distribution of its observation. In this work, it is first shown that while the original social learning rule of Lalitha et al., 2018 achieves asymptotically vanishing error probabilities as the number of samples tends to infinity, it suffers a gap in the achievable error exponent compared to the centralized case. The gap is due to the network imbalance caused by the local weights that each node chooses to weigh the messages received from its neighbors. To close this gap, a modified learning rule is proposed and shown to achieve error exponents as large as those in the centralized setup. This implies that there is essentially no first-order penalty caused by decentralization in the exponentially decaying rate of error probabilities. To elucidate the price of decentralization, further analysis on the higher-order asymptotics of the error probability is conducted. It turns out that the price is at most a constant multiplicative factor in the error probability, equivalent to an $o(1/t)$ additive gap in the error exponent, where t is the number of samples observed by each agent in the network and the number of rounds of information exchange. This constant depends on the network connectivity and captures the level of network imbalance. Results of simulation on the error probability supporting our learning rule are shown. Further discussions and extensions of results are also presented.},

  abstract     = {A conflict-avoiding code (CAC) is a deterministic transmission scheme for asynchronous multiple access without feedback. When the number of simultaneously active users is less than or equal to w, a CAC of length L with weight w can provide a hard guarantee that each active user has at least one successful transmission within every consecutive L slots. In this paper, we generalize some previously known constructions of constant-weight CACs, and then derive several classes of optimal CACs by the help of Kneser‚Äôs Theorem and some techniques in Additive Combinatorics. Another spotlight of this paper is to relax the identical-weight constraint in prior studies to study mixed-weight CACs for the first time, for the purpose of increasing the throughput and reducing the access delay of some potential users with higher priority. As applications of those obtained optimal CACs, we derive some classes of optimal mixed-weight CACs.},

  abstract     = {A power assignment over parallel Gaussian broadcast channels splits a power budget at the access point among all channel-user pairs subject to per-channel upper-bounds on the sum-power, and yields a rate allocation to all channel-user pairs. Its weighted energy efficiency (WEE) is the ratio of its weighted sum-rate over its sum-power plus a fixed positive overhead. The problem Max-WEE seeks a power assignment maximizing the WEE. Special variants of Max-WEE with unit weights or two users per channel have been extensively studied in the literature. But none of the existing algorithms for those special variants have known bounds on running time, mainly because they follow the general-purposed methods for fractional programming. In this paper, we first derive fundamental properties and closed-form expressions of maximum WEE. Then we devise a simple water-filling algorithm for Max-WEE. Assuming all users are presorted by weight, the water-filling algorithm has linear complexity in the number of channel-user pairs. Under a mild presorting condition, we further develop a linear-complexity algorithm for Max-WEE subject to rate demand.},

  abstract     = {This paper studies an internet of things (IoT) network where a fusion center relies on multi-view and correlated information generated by multiple sources to monitor various regions. Each region possesses hard age of correlated information (AoCI) constraints for information update, and accordingly we propose a scheduling policy to satisfy such needs and minimize the required wireless resources. We first approximate the problem to a dual bin-packing problem. Secondly, efficient scheduling policies are identified when the age constraints possess special mathematical properties, where the number of channels at most required is analyzed. Optimality conditions of the proposed policies are presented. For general constraints, a two-step grouping algorithm for multi-view (TGAM) is proposed to establish scheduling policies. Under TGAM, the constraints are mapped into a combination of the special constraints. To quickly identify an optimized mapping from a vast solution space, TGAM heuristically groups the regions according to their constraints and then searches for the optimal mapping for each group. Numerical results demonstrate that, compared to a derived lower bound, the proposed TGAM requires only 1.07% more channels. Additionally, the number of regions that can be served by TGAM is significantly larger than the state-of-the art algorithm, given the number of channels.},

However, the existing schemes require delicate data placement and output function assignment, which is not feasible when distributed nodes fetch data without the orchestration of a central server. In this paper, we consider the general systems where the data placement and output function assignment are arbitrary but pre-set. We propose two coded computing schemes, One-shot Coded Transmission (OSCT) and Few-shot Coded Transmission (FSCT), to reduce the communication load. Both schemes first group the nodes into clusters and divide the transmission of each cluster into multiple rounds, and then design coded transmission in each round to maximize the multicast gain. The key difference between OSCT and FSCT is that the former uses a one-shot transmission where each encoded message can be decoded independently by the intended nodes, while the latter allows each node to jointly decode multiple received symbols to achieve potentially larger multicast gains. Furthermore, based on the lower bound proposed by Yu et al., we derive sufficient conditions for the optimality of OSCT and FSCT, respectively. This not only recovers the existing optimality results but also includes some cases where our schemes are optimal while others are not.},

Specifically, we propose a construction for fractional repetition gradient coding; while ensuring that the generator matrix remains close to perfectly balanced for any set of coding parameters, as well as a low complexity decoding step. The proposed binary encoding avoids operations over the real and complex numbers which inherently introduce numerical and rounding errors, thereby enabling accurate distributed encodings of the partial gradients. We then make connections between gradient coding and coded matrix multiplication. Specifically, we show that any gradient coding scheme can be extended to coded matrix multiplication. Furthermore, we show how the proposed binary gradient coding scheme can be used to construct two different coded matrix multiplication schemes, each achieving different trade-offs.},

While this is a pessimistic result, we explore in this paper whether noisy client side information available at the client helps decrease the download cost in the context of SPIR with colluding and replicated servers. Specifically, we assume that the client possesses noisy side information about each stored file, which is obtained by passing each file through one of D possible discrete memoryless test channels. The statistics of the test channels are known by the client and by all the servers, but the mapping $\boldsymbol {\mathcal {M}}$ between the files and the test channels is unknown to the servers. We study this problem under two privacy metrics. Under the first metric, the client wants to preserve the privacy of its file selection and the mapping $\boldsymbol {\mathcal {M}}$ , and the servers want to preserve the privacy of all the non-selected files. Under the second metric, the client is willing to reveal the index of the test channel that is associated with its desired file. For both privacy metrics, we derive the optimal common randomness and download cost. Our setup generalizes SPIR with colluding servers and SPIR with private noiseless side information. Unlike noiseless side information, our results demonstrate that noisy side information can reduce the download cost, even when the client does not have noiseless knowledge of all but one file.},

We consider a K-armed bandit model where some subset of K arms is partitioned into M groups. Within each group, the random variable associated to each arm follows the same distribution on a finite alphabet. At each time step, the decision maker pulls an arm and observes its outcome from the random variable associated to that arm. Subsequent arm pulls depend on the history of arm pulls and their outcomes. The decision maker has no knowledge of the distributions of the arms or the underlying partitions. The task is to devise an online algorithm to learn the underlying partition of arms with the least number of arm pulls on average and with an error probability not exceeding a pre-determined value $\delta $ . Several existing problems fall under our general framework, including finding M pairs of arms, odd arm identification, and N-ary clustering of K arms belong to our general framework. We derive a non-asymptotic lower bound on the average number of arm pulls for any online algorithm with an error probability not exceeding $\delta $ . Furthermore, we develop a computationally-efficient online algorithm based on the Track-and-Stop method and Frank-Wolfe algorithm, and show that the average number of arm pulls of our algorithm asymptotically matches that of the lower bound. Our refined analysis also uncovers a novel bound on the speed at which the average number of arm pulls of our algorithm converges to the fundamental limit as $\delta $ vanishes.},

They subsume existing linear projection approaches developed under simplifying assumptions of Gaussian distributions, such as these distributions might share an equal mean or covariance matrix. As a by-product, we establish that the multi-class linear discriminant analysis, a celebrated method for classification and supervised dimension reduction, is provably optimal for maximizing pairwise Kullback-Leibler divergence when the Gaussian populations share an identical covariance matrix. For the case when the Gaussian distributions share an equal mean, we establish conditions under which the optimal subspace remains invariant regardless of how the Kullback-Leibler divergence is defined, despite the asymmetry of the divergence measure itself. Such conditions encompass the classical case of signal plus noise, where both signal and noise have zero mean and arbitrary covariance matrices. Experiments are conducted to validate the proposed solutions, demonstrate their superior performance over existing alternatives, and illustrate the procedure for selecting the appropriate linear projection solution.},

  abstract     = {The advent of large-scale inference has spurred reexamination of conventional statistical thinking. In a series of highly original articles, Efron persuasively illustrated the danger for downstream inference in assuming the veracity of a posited null distribution. In a Gaussian model for n many z-scores with at most $k \lt \frac {n}{2}$ nonnulls, Efron suggests estimating the parameters of an empirical null $N(\theta , \sigma ^{2})$ instead of assuming the theoretical null $N(0, 1)$ . Looking to the robust statistics literature by viewing the nonnulls as outliers is unsatisfactory as the question of optimal rates is still open; even consistency is not known in the regime $k \asymp n$ which is especially relevant to many large-scale inference applications. However, provably rate-optimal robust estimators have been developed in other models (e.g. Huber contamination) which appear quite close to Efron‚Äôs proposal. Notably, the impossibility of consistency when $k \asymp n$ in these other models may suggest the same major weakness afflicts Efron‚Äôs popularly adopted recommendation. A sound evaluation thus requires a complete understanding of information-theoretic limits. We characterize the regime of k for which consistent estimation is possible, notably without imposing any assumptions at all on the nonnull effects. Unlike in other robust models, it is shown consistent estimation of the location parameter is possible if and only if $\frac {n}{2} {-} k = \omega (\sqrt {n})$ , and of the scale parameter in the entire regime $k \lt \frac {n}{2}$ . Furthermore, we establish sharp minimax rates and show estimators based on the empirical characteristic function are optimal by exploiting the Gaussian character of the data.},

In this work, we formulate domain generalization from a novel probabilistic perspective, ensuring robustness while avoiding overly conservative solutions. Through comprehensive information-theoretic analysis, we provide key insights into the roles of gradient and representation matching in promoting generalization. Our results reveal the complementary relationship between these two components, indicating that existing works focusing solely on either gradient or representation alignment are insufficient to solve the domain generalization problem. In light of these theoretical findings, we introduce IDM to simultaneously align the inter-domain gradients and representations.

This work introduces a new data-driven estimator for the Bayesian CRB using score matching, i.e., a statistical estimation technique that models the gradient of a probability distribution from a given set of training data. The performance of the proposed estimator is analyzed in both the classical parametric modeling regime and the neural network modeling regime. In both settings, we develop novel non-asymptotic bounds on the score matching error and our Bayesian CRB estimator based on the results from empirical process theory, including classical bounds and recently introduced techniques for characterizing neural networks.

  abstract     = {To consider model uncertainty in global Fr√©chet regression and improve density response prediction, we propose a frequentist model averaging method. The weights are chosen by minimizing a cross-validation criterion based on Wasserstein distance. In the cases where all candidate models are misspecified, we prove that the corresponding model averaging estimator has asymptotic optimality, achieving the lowest possible Wasserstein distance. When there are correctly specified candidate models, we prove that our method asymptotically assigns all weights to the correctly specified models. Numerical results of extensive simulations and a real data analysis on intracerebral hemorrhage data strongly favour our method.},

Using a novel deepening scheme for deep ReLU nets, we rigorously prove that there exist perfect global minima achieving optimal generalization error rates for numerous types of data under mild conditions. Since over-parameterization of deep ReLU nets is crucial to guarantee that the global minima of ERM can be realized by the widely used stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithm, our results present a potential way to fill the gap between optimization and generalization of deep learning.},

  abstract     = {The practice of deep learning has shown that neural networks generalize remarkably well even with an extreme number of learned parameters. This appears to contradict traditional statistical wisdom, in which a trade-off between model complexity and fit to the data is essential. We aim to address this discrepancy by adopting a convex optimization and sparse recovery perspective. We consider the training and generalization properties of two-layer ReLU networks with standard weight decay regularization. Under certain regularity assumptions on the data, we show that ReLU networks with an arbitrary number of parameters learn only simple models that explain the data. This is analogous to the recovery of the sparsest linear model in compressed sensing. For ReLU networks and their variants with skip connections or normalization layers, we present isometry conditions that ensure the exact recovery of planted neurons. For randomly generated data, we show the existence of a phase transition in recovering planted neural network models, which is easy to describe: whenever the ratio between the number of samples and the dimension exceeds a numerical threshold, the recovery succeeds with high probability; otherwise, it fails with high probability. Surprisingly, ReLU networks learn simple and sparse models that generalize well even when the labels are noisy. The phase transition phenomenon is confirmed through numerical experiments.},

In this paper, we present some new insights into MAB and formulate the problem in the penalization framework, where a rigorous penalized regret can be well defined and a more sophisticated regret analysis is possible. Under such a framework, we propose a hard-threshold UCB-like algorithm, which enjoys many merits including the asymptotic fairness, nearly optimal regret, good tradeoff between reward and fairness. Both gap-dependent and gap-independent regret bounds have been established. Multiple insightful comments are given to illustrate the soundness of our theoretical analysis.

Any single-copy probabilistic transformation between a pair of states implies that an asymptotic transformation at rate 1 is possible with an exponentially decreasing success probability. However, it is possible that an asymptotic transformation is feasible with nonzero probability, but there is no transformation between any finite number of copies with the same rate, even probabilistically. In such cases it is not known if the optimal success probability decreases exponentially or faster. A fundamental tool for showing the feasibility of an asymptotic transformation is degeneration. Any degeneration gives rise to a sequence of stochastic LOCC transformations from copies of the initial state plus a sublinear number of GHZ states to the same number of copies of the target state. These protocols involve parameters that can be freely chosen, but the choice affects the success probability. In this paper, we characterize an asymptotically optimal choice of the parameters and derive a single-letter expression for the error exponent of the resulting protocol. In particular, this implies an exponential lower bound on the success probability when the stochastic transformation arises from a degeneration.},

  abstract     = {A quantum generalized divergence by definition satisfies the data-processing inequality; as such, the relative decrease in such a divergence under the action of a quantum channel is at most one. This relative decrease is formally known as the contraction coefficient of the channel and the divergence. Interestingly, there exist combinations of channels and divergences for which the contraction coefficient is strictly less than one. Furthermore, understanding the contraction coefficient is fundamental for the study of statistical tasks under privacy constraints. To this end, here we establish upper bounds on contraction coefficients for the hockey-stick divergence under privacy constraints, where privacy is quantified with respect to the quantum local differential privacy (QLDP) framework, and we fully characterize the contraction coefficient for the trace distance under privacy constraints. Using the machinery developed, we also determine an upper bound on the contraction of both the Bures distance and quantum relative entropy relative to the normalized trace distance, under QLDP constraints. Next, we apply our findings to establish bounds on the sample complexity of quantum hypothesis testing under privacy constraints. Furthermore, we study various scenarios in which the sample complexity bounds are tight while providing order-optimal quantum channels that achieve those bounds. Lastly, we show how private quantum channels provide fairness and Holevo information stability in quantum learning settings.},

While for two parties a large number of results in this direction is available, the multipartite setting still remains a major challenge. In this article, this problem is addressed by extending the resource theory of entanglement for multipartite systems beyond the standard framework of local operations and classical communication. Specifically, we consider transformations capable of introducing a small, controllable increase of entanglement of a state, with the requirement that the increase can be made arbitrarily small. We demonstrate that in this adjusted framework, the transformation rates between multipartite states are fundamentally dictated by the bipartite entanglement entropies of the respective quantum states. Remarkably, this approach allows the reduction of tripartite entanglement to its bipartite analog, indicating that every pure tripartite state can be reversibly synthesized from a suitable number of singlets distributed between pairs of parties.},

Typically, multiple rounds of syndrome extraction are employed to ensure reliable error information. In this paper, we consider phenomenological decoding problems, where data qubit errors may occur between extractions, and each measurement can be faulty. We introduce generalized quantum data-syndrome codes along with a generalized check matrix that integrates both quaternary and binary alphabets to represent diverse error sources. This results in a Tanner graph with mixed variable nodes, enabling the design of belief propagation (BP) decoding algorithms that effectively handle phenomenological errors. Importantly, our BP decoders are applicable to general sparse quantum codes. Through simulations, we achieve an error threshold of more than 3% for quantum memory protected by rotated toric codes, using solely BP without post-processing. Our results indicate that d rounds of syndrome extraction are sufficient for a toric code of distance d. We observe that at high error rates, fewer rounds of syndrome extraction tend to perform better, while more rounds improve performance at lower error rates. Additionally, we propose a method to construct effective redundant stabilizer checks for single-shot error correction. Our simulations show that BP decoding remains highly effective even with a high syndrome error rate.},

  abstract     = {Electromagnetic information theory (EIT) is an emerging interdisciplinary subject that integrates classical Maxwell electromagnetics and Shannon information theory. The goal of EIT is to uncover the information transmission mechanisms from an electromagnetic (EM) perspective in wireless systems. Existing works on EIT are mainly focused on the analysis of EM channel characteristics, degrees-of-freedom, and system capacity. However, these works do not clarify how to integrate EIT knowledge into the design and optimization of wireless systems. To fill in this gap, in this paper, we propose an EIT-based statistical channel model with simplified parameterization. Thanks to the simplified closed-form expression of the EMCF, it can be readily applied to various channel modeling and inference tasks. Specifically, by averaging the solutions of Maxwell‚Äôs equations over a tunable von Mises distribution, we obtain a spatio-temporal correlation function (STCF) model of the EM channel, which we name as the EMCF. Furthermore, by tuning the parameters of the EMCF, we propose an EIT-based covariance estimator (EIT-Cov) to accurately capture the channel covariance. Since classical MMSE estimators can exploit prior information contained in the channel covariance matrix, we further propose the EIT-MMSE channel estimator by substituting EMCF for the covariance matrix. Simulation results show that both the proposed EIT-Cov covariance estimator and the EIT-MMSE channel estimator outperform their baseline algorithms, thus proving that EIT is beneficial to wireless communication systems.},

Nevertheless, this assumption fails when messages arrive rapidly and reliability constraints require that the number of channel uses exceed the time between arrivals. In this paper, we consider a broadcast setting in which a transmitter wishes to send two different messages to two receivers over Gaussian channels. Messages have different arrival times and decoding deadlines such that their transmission windows overlap. For this setting, we propose a coding scheme that exploits Marton‚Äôs coding strategy. We derive rigorous bounds on the achievable rate regions. Those bounds can be easily employed in point-to-point settings with one or multiple parallel channels. In the point-to-point setting with one or multiple parallel channels, the proposed achievability scheme is consistent with the normal approximation. In the broadcast setting, our scheme agrees with Marton‚Äôs strategy for sufficiently large numbers of channel uses and shows significant performance improvements over standard approaches based on time sharing for transmission of short packets.},

Both the encoder and the decoder are aware of the input distribution, which is fixed. However, only the decoder is aware of the actual channel being used. The transform can be used to design a universal code for this scenario. The code is to have vanishing error probability when used over any channel in the set, and achieve the infimal information rate over the set. The setting considered is, in fact, more general: we consider a set of processes with memory. Universal polarization is established for the case where each process in the set: 1) has memory in the form of an underlying hidden Markov state sequence that is aperiodic and irreducible; and 2) satisfies a ‚Äòforgetfulness‚Äô property. Forgetfulness, which we believe to be of independent interest, occurs when two hidden Markov states become approximately independent of each other given a sufficiently long sequence of observations between them. We show that aperiodicity and irreducibility of the underlying Markov chain is not sufficient for forgetfulness, and develop a sufficient condition for a hidden Markov process to be forgetful.},

In this paper, we prove the conjecture. In fact, we prove a stronger result suggested by Ding et al.: the weight of the generating idempotent is equal to the Bose distance for both odd and even m. Our main tools are some new properties of the so-called fibbinary integers, in particular, the splitting field of related polynomials, and the relation of these polynomials to the idempotent of the BCH code.},

In the traditional framework of stuck-at codes, the task involves encoding a message into a one-dimensional binary vector. However, a certain number of the bits in this vector are ‚Äòfrozen‚Äô, meaning they are fixed at a predetermined value and cannot be altered by the encoder. The decoder, aware of the proportion of frozen bits but not their specific positions, is responsible for deciphering the intended message. We consider a more challenging version of this problem where the decoder does not know also the fraction of frozen bits. We construct explicit and efficient encoding and decoding algorithms that get arbitrarily close to capacity in this scenario. Furthermore, to the best of our knowledge, our construction is the first, fully explicit construction of stuck-at codes that approach capacity.},

  abstract     = {Bursts of errors are a class of errors that can be found in a variety of applications. A burst of t edits refers to a burst of t deletions, or a burst of t insertions, or a burst of t substitutions. This paper focuses on studying codes that can correct a burst of t edits. Our primary approach involves the use of the tool called weighted-summation VT sketch. The $(t,k)$ -weighted-summation VT sketch of a length-n sequence is defined as the weighted summation of the VT sketch of each row of its $t\times \lceil n/t \rceil $ array representation, with weights in the i-th row set as $k^{i-1}$ for $i=1,2,\ldots,t$ . By employing the weighted-summation VT sketch alongside multiple weight sketches, we introduce a construction for q-ary t-burst-substitution correcting codes with a redundancy of $\log n+O(1)$ , where the logarithm base is 2. Subsequently, we improve the redundancy to address specific types of burst-substitution errors, such as inversion errors, adjacent-block-transposition errors, and absorption errors. Moreover, by utilizing the method developed in the construction of burst-substitution correcting codes and imposing additional run-length-limited constraints, locally-bounded constraints, and strong-locally-balanced constraints, respectively, we introduce three constructions of t-burst-deletion correcting codes, each requiring a redundancy of $\log n+O(\log \log n)$ . Any t-burst-deletion-correcting code is also a t-burst-insertion correcting code, allowing us to intersect the t-burst-substitution-correcting codes and t-burst-deletion-correcting codes designed above to derive three constructions of q-ary t-burst-edit-correcting codes. The first two constructions have a redundancy of $\log n+(t\log q-1)\log \log n+O(1)$ , while the third construction has a redundancy of $\log n+\log \log n+O(1)$ . Most of the proposed codes demonstrate superior performance compared to previous results, with the exception of burst-deletion correcting codes. Furthermore, in cases of single-edit errors (t-burst-edit error with $t=1$ ), the redundancy of the first two constructions of quaternary single-edit correcting codes outperforms the results of Gabrys et al. (IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory 2023). We also provide efficient encoding and decoding algorithms for our codes to enhance their practical usability.},

In this problem, the failed node downloads the information stored at a subset of vertices of the graph for the purpose of recovering the lost data. Compared to the standard setting, regenerating codes on graphs address two additional features. The repair information is moved across the network, and the cost of node repair is determined by the graphical distance from the helper nodes to the failed node. Accordingly, the helpers far away from the failed node may be expected to contribute less data for repair than the nodes in the neighborhood of that node. We analyze regenerating codes with nonuniform download for repair on graphs. Moreover, in the process of repair, the information moved from the helpers to the failed node may be combined through intermediate processing, reducing the repair bandwidth. We derive lower bounds for communication complexity of node repair on graphs, including repair schemes with nonuniform download and intermediate processing, and construct codes that attain these bounds. Additionally, some of the nodes may act as adversaries, introducing errors into the data moved in the network. For repair on graphs in the presence of adversarial nodes, we construct codes that support node repair and error correction in systematic nodes.},

  abstract     = {Low-rank parity-check (LRPC) codes are the rank-metric analogue of low-density parity-check codes and they found important applications in code-based cryptography. In this paper we investigate a sub-family of LRPC codes, which have a parity-check matrix defined over a subspace ${\mathcal {V}}_{\alpha,d}=\langle 1,\alpha, \ldots, \alpha ^{d-1} \rangle _{\mathbb {F}_{q}}\subsetneq \mathbb {F}_{q^{m}} $ , where $\mathbb {F}_{q^{m}}$ is the finite field of $q^{m}$ elements, $\alpha \in \mathbb {F}_{q^{m}}$ is an element not in any proper subfield of $\mathbb {F}_{q^{m}}$ , and d is a positive integer significantly smaller than m. These codes are termed bounded-degree LRPC (BD-LRPC) codes. BD-LRPC codes are the same as the standard LRPC codes of density 2 when the degree $d=2$ , while for degree $d\gt 2$ they constitute a proper subset of LRPC codes of density d. Exploiting the structure of ${\mathcal {V}}_{\alpha,d}$ , the BD-LRPC codes of degree d can uniquely correct errors of rank weight r when $n-k \geq r + u$ for certain $u \geq 1$ , in contrast to the condition $n-k\geq dr$ required for the standard LRPC codes. This underscores the superior decoding capability of the BD-LRPC codes. Moreover, as the code length $n\rightarrow \infty $ , when $n/m\rightarrow 0$ , the BD-LRPC codes with a code rate of $R=k/n$ can be uniquely decodable with radius $\rho =r/n$ approaching the Singleton bound $1-R$ by letting $\epsilon =u/n\rightarrow 0$ ; and when $n/m$ is a constant, the BD-LRPC codes can have unique decoding radius $\rho = 1-R-\epsilon $ for a small $\epsilon $ , allowing for $\rho \gt (1-R)/2$ with properly chosen parameters. This superior decoding capability is theoretically proved for the case $d=2$ and confirmed by experimental results for $d\gt 2$ .},

Some examples are given to show that the Delsarte bound and the Norse bound for covering codes in the Hamming metric do not hold true for covering codes in the pair metric. We give the redundancy bound on covering radius of linear codes in the b-symbol metric and give some optimal codes attaining this bound. Then we prove that there is no perfect linear symbol-pair code with the minimum pair-distance 7 and there is no perfect b-symbol metric code if $b\geq \frac {n+4}{2}$ . Moreover a lot of cyclic and algebraic-geometric codes are proved non-perfect in the b-symbol metric. The covering radius of the Reed-Solomon code in the b-symbol metric is determined. As an application, the generalized Singleton bound on the sizes of list-decodable b-symbol metric codes is also presented. Then an upper bound on lengths of general MDS symbol-pair codes is proved.},

  abstract     = {Recently, codes for correcting a burst of errors have attracted significant attention. One of the most important reasons is that bursts of errors occur in certain emerging techniques, such as DNA storage. In this paper, we investigate a type of error, called a $(t,s)$ -burst, which deletes t consecutive symbols and inserts s arbitrary symbols at the same coordinate. Note that a $(t,s)$ -burst error can be seen as a generalization of a burst of insertions ( $t=0$ ), a burst of deletions ( $s=0$ ), and a burst of substitutions ( $t=s$ ). Our main contribution is to give explicit constructions of q-ary $(t,s)$ -burst correcting codes with $\log n + O(1)$ bits of redundancy for any given constant non-negative integers t, s, and $q \geq 2$ . These codes have optimal redundancy up to an additive constant. Furthermore, we apply our $(t,s)$ -burst correcting codes to combat other various types of errors and improve the corresponding results. In particular, one of our byproducts is a permutation code capable of correcting a burst of t stable deletions with $\log n + O(1)$ bits of redundancy, which is optimal up to an additive constant.},

  abstract     = {In the binary hypothesis testing problem, it is well known that sequentiality in taking samples eradicates the trade-off between two error exponents, yet implementing the optimal test requires the knowledge of the underlying distributions, say $P_{0}$ and $P_{1}$ . In the scenario where the knowledge of distributions is replaced by empirically observed statistics from the respective distributions, the gain of sequentiality is less understood when subject to universality constraints over all possible $P_{0},P_{1}$ . In this work, the gap is mended by a unified study on sequentiality in the universal binary classification problem, where the universality constraints are set on the expected stopping time as well as the type-I error exponent. The type-I error exponent is required to achieve a pre-set distribution-dependent constraint $\lambda (P_{0},P_{1})$ for all $P_{0},P_{1}$ . Under the proposed framework, different sequential setups are investigated so that fair comparisons can be made with the fixed-length counterpart. By viewing these sequential classification problems as special cases of a general sequential composite hypothesis testing problem, the optimal type-II error exponents are characterized. Specifically, in the general sequential composite hypothesis testing problem subject to universality constraints, upper and lower bounds on the type-II error exponent are proved, and a sufficient condition for which the bounds coincide is given. The results for sequential classification problems are then obtained accordingly. With the characterization of the optimal error exponents, the benefit of sequentiality is shown both analytically and numerically by comparing the sequential and the fixed-length cases in representative examples of type-I exponent constraint $\lambda $ .},

  abstract     = {The source coding problem with encoded side information is considered. A lower bound on the strong converse exponent has been derived by Oohama, but its tightness has not been clarified. In this paper, we derive a tight strong converse exponent. For the special case where the side-information does not exist, we demonstrate that our tight exponent of the Wyner-Ahlswede-K√∂rner (WAK) problem reduces to the known tight expression of that special case while Oohama‚Äôs lower bound is strictly loose. The converse part is proved by a judicious use of the change-of-measure argument, which was introduced by Gu and Effros and further developed by Tyagi and Watanabe. A key component of the methodology by Tyagi and Watanabe is the use of soft Markov constraint, which was originally introduced by Oohama, as a penalty term to prove the Markov constraint at the end. A technical innovation of this paper compared to Tyagi and Watanabe is recognizing that the soft Markov constraint is a part of the exponent, rather than a penalty term that should vanish at the end; this recognition enables us to derive the matching achievability bound. In fact, via numerical experiment, we provide evidence that the soft Markov constraint is strictly positive. Compared to Oohama‚Äôs derivation of the lower bound, which relies on the single-letterization of a certain moment-generating function, the derivation of our tight exponent only involves manipulations of the Kullback-Leibrer divergence and Shannon entropies. The achievability part is derived by a careful analysis of the type argument; however, unlike the conventional analysis for the achievable rate region, we need to derive the soft Markov constraint in the analysis of the correct probability. Furthermore, we present an application of our derivation of the strong converse exponent to the privacy amplification.},

  abstract     = {We consider channel coding for discrete memoryless channels (DMCs) with a novel cost constraint that constrains both the mean and the variance of the cost of the codewords. We show that the maximum (asymptotically) achievable rate under the new cost formulation is equal to the capacity-cost function; in particular, the strong converse holds. We further characterize the optimal second-order coding rate of these cost-constrained codes; in particular, the optimal second-order coding rate is finite. We then show that the second-order coding performance is strictly improved with feedback using a new variation of timid/bold coding, significantly broadening the applicability of timid/bold coding schemes from unconstrained compound-dispersion channels to all cost-constrained channels. Equivalent results on the minimum average probability of error are also given.},

  abstract     = {We study the successive refinement setting of Shannon cipher system (SCS) under the maximal leakage secrecy metric for discrete memoryless sources under bounded distortion measures. Specifically, we generalize the threat model for the point-to-point rate-distortion setting of Issa, Wagner and Kamath (T-IT 2020) to the multiterminal successive refinement setting. Under mild conditions that correspond to partial secrecy, we characterize the asymptotically optimal normalized maximal leakage region for both the joint excess-distortion probability (JEP) and the expected distortion reliability constraints. Under JEP, in the achievability part, we propose a type-based coding scheme, analyze the reliability guarantee for JEP and bound the leakage of the information source through compressed messages. In the converse part, by analyzing a guessing scheme of the eavesdropper, we prove the optimality of our achievability result. Under expected distortion, the achievability part is established similarly to the JEP counterpart. The converse proof proceeds by generalizing the corresponding results for the rate-distortion setting of SCS by Schieler and Cuff (T-IT 2014) to the successive refinement setting. Somewhat surprisingly, the normalized maximal leakage regions under both JEP and expected distortion constraints are identical under certain conditions, although JEP appears to be a stronger reliability constraint.},

The motivation behind these constructions is to enable theoretically well-founded time-frequency analysis over multiple temporal scales for real-time situations, or for physical or biological modelling situations, when the future cannot be accessed, and the non-causal access to the future in Gabor filtering is therefore not viable for a time-frequency analysis of the system. We develop a principled axiomatically determined theory for formulating these time-causal time-frequency representations, obtained by replacing the Gaussian kernel in the Gabor filtering with a time-causal kernel, referred to as the time-causal limit kernel, and which guarantees simplification properties from finer to coarser levels of scales in a time-causal situation, similar as the Gaussian kernel can be shown to guarantee over a non-causal temporal domain. We do also develop an axiomatically determined theory for implementing a discrete analogue of the proposed time-causal frequency analysis method on discrete data, based on first-order recursive filters coupled in cascade, with provable variation-diminishing properties that strongly suppress the influence from local perturbations and noise, and with specially chosen time constants to achieve self-similarity over scales and temporal scale covariance. In these ways, the proposed time-frequency representations guarantee well-founded treatment over multiple temporal scales, in situations when the characteristic scales in the signals, or physical or biological phenomena, to be analyzed may vary substantially, and additionally all steps in the time-frequency analysis have to be fully time-causal.},

  abstract     = {The problem of designing explicit bent and plateaued functions has been researched for several decades. However, finding new bent functions outside the well-known completed Maiorana-McFarland class $\mathcal {M}^{\#}$ is still a challenge. Plateaued functions have been characterized in many different ways, but there is no general and rigorous mathematical method to generate them directly, except for the ones in the spirit of the well-known Maiorana-McFarland constructions or those obtained through adaptations of the secondary constructions of bent functions. Jeong and Lee recently made significant advances regarding algorithms for constructing balanced plateaued functions with maximal algebraic degrees in [IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory, 70(2), 1408-1421, 2024]. Due to the gap between our significant interest in the notion of plateaued functions and the knowledge we have on it, our motivation is to bring further results on the constructions of plateaued functions that allow us to understand their structure better. This article creates a framework of new generic constructions of bent and plateaued functions by studying Boolean functions of the form $h(x)=f(x)+F(f_{1}(x),\ldots, f_{r}(x))$ , where $f_{i}(x)=f(x)+f(x+\mu _{i})$ for each $1\leq i\leq r$ . We firstly prove that h and f have the same extended Walsh-Hadamard spectrum if $D_{\mu _{i}}D_{\mu _{j}}f=0$ for any $1\leq i\lt j\leq r$ . This result extends a previous construction of bent functions to any Boolean functions. The strength of such a result is that it allows us to obtain several plateaued functions of high algebraic degrees from known ones with low algebraic degrees, which was a significant and challenging problem raised in the literature. Such a result is a real challenge and breaks a deadlock since no mathematical method allows the general constructions of plateaued functions. We next give an extended affine equivalent form of the function h, which provides us with another compelling perspective to design new bent functions (including those which are outside $\mathcal {M}^{\#}$ from certain known ones inside $\mathcal {M}^{\#}$ ) and plateaued functions. Finally, we present four generic constructions of bent functions outside $\mathcal {M}^{\#}$ from generalized Maiorana-McFarland functions.},

  abstract     = {We provide optimal lower bounds for two well-known parameter estimation (also known as statistical estimation) tasks in high dimensions with approximate differential privacy. First, we prove that for any $\alpha \le O(1)$ , estimating the covariance of a Gaussian up to spectral error $\alpha $ requires $\tilde {\Omega }\left ({{\frac {d^{3/2}}{\alpha \varepsilon } + \frac {d}{\alpha ^{2}}}}\right)$ samples, which is tight up to logarithmic factors. This result improves over previous work which established this for $\alpha \le O\left ({{\frac {1}{\sqrt {d}}}}\right)$ , and is also simpler than previous work. Next, we prove that estimating the mean of a heavy-tailed distribution with bounded kth moments requires $\tilde {\Omega }\left ({{\frac {d}{\alpha ^{k/(k-1)} \varepsilon } + \frac {d}{\alpha ^{2}}}}\right)$ samples. Previous work for this problem was only able to establish this lower bound against pure differential privacy, or in the special case of $k = 2$ . Our techniques follow the method of fingerprinting and are generally quite simple. Our lower bound for heavy-tailed estimation is based on a black-box reduction from privately estimating identity-covariance Gaussians. Our lower bound for covariance estimation utilizes a Bayesian approach to show that, under an Inverse Wishart prior distribution for the covariance matrix, no private estimator can be accurate even in expectation, without sufficiently many samples.},

This work considers the problem of mean estimation, where each user can impose their own distinct privacy level. The algorithm we propose for this problem is shown to be minimax optimal and has a near-linear run-time. Our results elicit an interesting saturation phenomenon that occurs. Namely, the privacy requirements of the most stringent users dictate the overall error rates. As a consequence, users with less but differing privacy requirements are all given more privacy than they require, in equal amounts. In other words, these privacy-indifferent users are given a nontrivial degree of privacy for free, without any sacrifice in the performance of the estimator.},

  abstract     = {Markov decision process (MDP) is an important model of sequential decision making problems. Existing theoretical analysis focus primarily on finite state spaces. For continuous state spaces, a recent interesting work (Shah and Xie, 2018) proposes a nearest neighbor Q learning approach. Under the streaming setting, in shich samples are received in a sequential manner, the sample complexity of this method is $\tilde {O}\left ({{\frac {|\mathcal {A}|}{\epsilon ^{d+3}(1-\gamma)^{d+7}}}}\right)$ for $\epsilon $ -accurate Q function estimation of infinite horizon discounted MDP with discount factor $\gamma $ , in which $|\mathcal {A}|$ is the size of the action space. However, the sample complexity is not optimal, and the method is suitable only for bounded state spaces. In this paper, we propose two new nearest neighbor Q learning methods, one for the offline setting and the other for the streaming setting. We show that the sample complexities of these two methods are $\tilde {O}\left ({{\frac {|\mathcal {A}|}{\epsilon ^{d+2}(1-\gamma)^{d+2}}}}\right)$ and $\tilde {O}\left ({{\frac {|\mathcal {A}|}{\epsilon ^{d+2}(1-\gamma)^{d+3}}}}\right)$ for offline and streaming settings respectively, which significantly improve over existing results and have minimax optimal dependence over $\epsilon $ . We achieve such improvement by utilizing samples more efficiently. In particular, the method by Shah and Xie, 2018, clears up all samples after each iteration, thus these samples are somewhat wasted. On the other hand, our offline method does not remove any samples, and our streaming method only removes samples with time earlier than $\beta t$ at time t, thus our methods significantly reduce the loss of information. Apart from the sample complexity, our methods also have additional advantages of better computational complexity, as well as suitability to unbounded state spaces. Finally, we extend our work to the case where both state and action spaces are continuous.},

  abstract     = {Sampling from probability distributions is a critical problem in statistics and machine learning, particularly in Bayesian inference, where direct integration over the posterior distribution is often infeasible, making sampling from the posterior essential for inference. This paper introduces the Schr√∂dinger-F√∂llmer sampler (SFS), a novel approach for sampling from potentially unnormalized distributions. The SFS leverages the Schr√∂dinger-F√∂llmer diffusion process on the unit interval, incorporating a time-dependent drift term that evolves the distribution from a degenerate form at time zero to the target distribution at time one. Unlike existing Markov chain Monte Carlo methods that rely on ergodicity, SFS operates independently of ergodicity. Computationally, SFS is straightforward to implement using the Euler-Maruyama discretization. In our theoretical analysis, we derive non-asymptotic error bounds for the SFS sampling distribution in the Wasserstein distance, subject to reasonable conditions.

In this model, a dense cycle of expected bandwidth $n \tau $ , representing the hidden one-dimensional geometry of vertices, is planted in an ambient random graph on n vertices. For both detection and recovery of the planted dense cycle, we characterize the information-theoretic thresholds in terms of n, $\tau $ , and an edge-wise signal-to-noise ratio $\lambda $ . In particular, the information-theoretic thresholds differ from the computational thresholds established in a recent work for low-degree polynomial algorithms, thereby justifying the existence of statistical-to-computational gaps for this problem.},

  abstract     = {The problem of identifying the channel with the highest capacity among several discrete memoryless channels (DMCs) is considered. The problem is cast as a pure-exploration multi-armed bandit problem, which follows the practical use of training sequences to sense the communication channel statistics. A gap-elimination algorithm termed BestChanID is proposed, which is oblivious to the capacity-achieving input distributions, and is guaranteed to output the DMC with the largest capacity, with a desired confidence. Furthermore, two additional algorithms NaiveChanSel and MedianChanEl, which output with certain confidence a DMC with capacity close to the maximal, are also presented. Each of these algorithms is shown to be beneficial in a different regime and can be used as a subroutine of BestChanID. To analyze the algorithms‚Äô guarantees, a capacity estimator is proposed and tight confidence bounds on the estimator error are derived. Based on this estimator, the sample complexity of all the proposed algorithms is analyzed as a function of the desired confidence parameter, the number of channels, and the channels‚Äô input and output alphabet sizes. The cost of best channel identification is shown to scale quadratically with the alphabet size, and a fundamental lower bound is derived on the number of channel senses required to identify the best channel with a certain confidence.},

A large body of prior works, however, focused on establishing $\ell _{2}$ eigenvector perturbation bounds, which are often highly inadequate in addressing tasks that rely on fine-grained behavior of an eigenvector. This paper makes progress on this by studying the perturbation of linear functions of an unknown eigenvector. Focusing on two fundamental problems ‚Äî matrix denoising and principal component analysis ‚Äî in the presence of Gaussian noise, we develop a suite of statistical theory that characterizes the perturbation of arbitrary linear functions of an unknown eigenvector. In order to mitigate a non-negligible bias issue inherent to the natural ‚Äúplug-in‚Äù estimator, we develop de-biased estimators that (1) achieve minimax lower bounds for a family of scenarios (modulo some logarithmic factor), and (2) can be computed in a data-driven manner without sample splitting. Noteworthily, the proposed estimators are nearly minimax optimal even when the associated eigen-gap is substantially smaller than what is required in prior statistical theory.},

While parameter learning in mixture models is well-studied, the sparsity constraint remains relatively unexplored. Sparsity of parameter vectors is a natural assumption in high dimensional settings, and support recovery is a major step towards parameter estimation. We provide efficient algorithms for support recovery that have a logarithmic sample complexity dependence on the dimensionality of the latent space, and also poly-logarithmic dependence on sparsity. Our algorithms, applicable to mixtures of many different canonical distributions including high dimensional Uniform, Poisson, Laplace, Gaussians, etc., are based on the method of moments. In most of these settings, our results are the first guarantees on the problem while in the rest, our results provide improvements on or are competitive with existing works.},

We point out some advantages of this new class of predictors and study its benefits from two complementary viewpoints: 1) we prove its optimality when the maximal R√©nyi divergence is considered as a regret measure, which can be interpreted operationally as a middle ground between the standard average and worst-case regret measures; 2) we discuss how it can be employed when NML is not a viable option, as an alternative to other predictors such as Luckiness NML. Finally, we apply the $\alpha $ -NML predictor to the class of discrete memoryless sources (DMS), where we derive simple formulas to compute the predictor and analyze its asymptotic performance in terms of worst-case regret.},

  abstract     = {The framework of distribution testing is currently ubiquitous in the field of property testing. In this model, the input is a probability distribution accessible via independently drawn samples from an oracle. The testing task is to distinguish a distribution that satisfies some property from a distribution that is far in some distance measure from satisfying it. The task of tolerant testing imposes a further restriction, that distributions close to satisfying the property are also accepted. This work focuses on the connection between the sample complexities of non-tolerant testing of distributions and their tolerant testing counterparts. When limiting our scope to label-invariant (symmetric) properties of distributions, we prove that the gap is at most quadratic, ignoring poly-logarithmic factors. Conversely, the property of being the uniform distribution is indeed known to have an almost-quadratic gap. When moving to general, not necessarily label-invariant properties, the situation is more complicated, and we show some partial results. We show that if a property requires the distributions to be non-concentrated, that is, the probability mass of the distribution is sufficiently spread out, then it cannot be non-tolerantly tested with $o(\sqrt {n})$ many samples, where n denotes the universe size. Clearly, this implies at most a quadratic gap, because a distribution can be learned (and hence tolerantly tested against any property) using $\mathcal {O}(n)$ many samples. Being non-concentrated is a strong requirement on properties, as we also prove a close to linear lower bound against their tolerant tests. Apart from the case where the distribution is non-concentrated, we also show if an input distribution is very concentrated, in the sense that it is mostly supported on a subset of size s of the universe, then it can be learned using only $\mathcal {O}(s)$ many samples. The learning procedure adapts to the input, and works without knowing s in advance.},

The problem becomes much more broadly accessible if suitable abstractions can be found for the underlying quantum functionality via classical black box models. This work formalizes such an abstraction in the form of an ‚ÄúN-sum box‚Äù, a black box generalization of a two-sum protocol of Song et al. with recent applications to N-server private information retrieval. The N-sum box has a communication cost of N qudits and classical output of a vector of $N~q$ -ary digits linearly dependent (via an $N \times 2N$ transfer matrix) on $2N$ classical inputs distributed among N transmitters. We characterize which transfer matrices are feasible by our construction, both with and without the possibility of additional locally invertible classical operations at the transmitters and receivers. Furthermore, we provide a sample application to Cross-Subspace Alignment (CSA) schemes to obtain efficient instances of Quantum Private Information Retrieval (QPIR) and Quantum Secure Distributed Batch Matrix Multiplication (QSDBMM). We first describe N-sum boxes based on maximal stabilizers and we then consider non-maximal-stabilizer-based constructions to obtain an instance of Quantum Symmetric Private Information Retrieval.},

Here, we establish inner and outer bounds on the capacity region for the general MAC with entangled transmitters, and show that the previous result can be obtained as a special case. It has long been known that the capacity region of the classical MAC under a message-average error criterion can be strictly larger than with a maximal error criterion (Dueck, 1978). We observe that given entanglement resources, the regions coincide. Furthermore, we address the combined setting of entanglement resources and conferencing, where the transmitters can also communicate with each other over rate-limited links. Using superdense coding, entanglement can double the conferencing rate.},

The optimal trade-off can be characterized by the rate-distortion function, which is the best rate given a certain distortion. In this paper, we derive the rate-distortion function of mixed-state compression. The rate-distortion functions in the entanglement-assisted and unassisted scenarios are in terms of a single-letter mutual information quantity and the regularized entanglement of purification, respectively. For the general setting where the consumption of both communication and entanglement are considered, we present the full qubit-entanglement rate region.

  abstract     = {This paper proposes coding schemes and information-theoretic converse results for the transmission of heterogeneous delay-constrained traffic over interference networks with random user activity and random data arrivals. The heterogeneous delay-constrained traffic is composed of delay-tolerant traffic and delay-sensitive traffic where only the former can benefit from transmitter and receiver cooperation since the latter is subject to stringent delay constraints. Even for the delay-tolerant traffic, the total number of cooperation rounds at transmitter and receiver sides is limited to D rounds. Each transmitter is assumed to be active with probability $\rho \in [{0,1}]$ , and we study two different models for traffic arrival, each model reflecting a different application type. In Model 1, each active transmitter sends a delay-tolerant message, and with probability $\rho _{f} \in [{0,1}]$ also transmits an additional delay-sensitive message; in Model 2, each active transmitter sends either a delay-sensitive message with probability $\rho _{f}$ or a delay-tolerant message with probability $1- \rho _{f}$ . For both models, we derive inner and outer bounds on the fundamental per-user multiplexing gain (MG) region of the symmetric Wyner network as well as inner bounds on the fundamental MG region of the hexagonal model. The per-user MG of an interference network describes the logarithmic growth of the largest average per-user rate that can be achieved over the network at high signal-to-noise ratios (SNR). Our inner and outer bounds on the per-user MG are generally close and coincide in special cases. They also show that when both transmitters and receivers can cooperate, then under Model 1, transmitting delay-sensitive messages hardly causes any penalty on the sum per-user MG, and under Model 2, operating at large delay-sensitive per-user MGs incurs no penalty on the delay-tolerant per-user MG and thus even increases the sum per-user MG. However, when only receivers can cooperate, the maximum delay-tolerant per-user MG that our bounds achieve at maximum delay-sensitive per-user MG is significantly decreased.},

  abstract     = {We introduce an algorithm for approximating the codebook probability that is compatible with all successive cancellation (SC)-based decoding algorithms, including SC list (SCL) decoding. This approximation is based on an auxiliary distribution that mimics the dynamics of decoding algorithms with an SC decoding schedule. Based on this codebook probability and SCL decoding, we introduce soft-output SCL (SO-SCL) to generate both blockwise and bitwise soft-output (SO). Using that blockwise SO, we first establish that, in terms of both block error rate (BLER) and undetected error rate (UER), SO-SCL decoding of dynamic Reed-Muller (RM) codes significantly outperforms the CRC-concatenated polar codes from 5G New Radio under SCL decoding. Moreover, using SO-SCL, the decoding misdetection rate (MDR) can be constrained to not exceed any predefined value, making it suitable for practical systems. Proposed bitwise SO can be readily generated from blockwise SO via a weighted sum of beliefs that includes a term where SO is weighted by the codebook probability, resulting in a soft-input soft-output (SISO) decoder. Simulation results for SO-SCL iterative decoding of product codes and generalized LDPC (GLDPC) codes, along with information-theoretical analysis, demonstrate significant superiority over existing list-max and list-sum approximations.},

  abstract     = {This paper is concerned with a guessing codeword decoding (GCD) of linear block codes, which is optimal and typically requires a fewer number of searches than the naive exhaustive search decoding (ESD). Compared with the guessing random additive noise decoding (GRAND), which is only efficient for high-rate codes, the GCD is efficient for not only high-rate codes but also low-rate codes. We prove that the GCD typically requires a fewer number of queries than the GRAND. Compared with the conventional ordered statistics decoding (OSD), the GCD does not require the online Gaussian elimination (GE). In addition to limiting the maximum number of searches, we suggest limiting the radius of searches in terms of soft weights or tolerated performance loss to further reduce the decoding complexity, resulting in the so-called truncated GCD. The performance gap between the truncated GCD and the optimal decoding can be upper bounded approximately by the saddlepoint approach or other numerical approaches. The derived upper bound captures the relationship between the performance and the decoding parameters, enabling us to balance the performance and the complexity by optimizing the decoding parameters of the truncated GCD. We also introduce a parallel implementation of the (truncated) GCD algorithm to reduce decoding latency without compromising performance. Another contribution of this paper is the application of the GCD to the polar codes. We propose a multiple-bit-wise decoding algorithm over a pruned tree for the polar codes, referred to as the successive-cancellation list (SCL) decoding algorithm by GCD. First, we present a strategy for pruning the conventional polar decoding tree based on the complexity analysis rather than the specific bit patterns. Then we apply the GCD algorithm in parallel aided by the early stopping criteria to the leaves of the pruned tree. Simulation results show that, without any performance loss as justified by analysis, the proposed decoding algorithm can significantly reduce the decoding latency of the polar codes.},

These codes have received much attention in recent years due to their ability to enable efficient and secure storage in distributed systems. In this paper, we study an array code version of the batch codes, which is called the batch array code (BAC). Under the setting of BAC, each node stores a bucket containing multiple code symbols and responds with a locally computed linear combination of the symbols in its bucket during the recovery of a requested symbol. We demonstrate that BACs can support the same type of requests as the original batch codes but with reduced redundancy. Specifically, we establish information theoretic lower bounds on the code lengths and provide several code constructions that confirm the tightness of the lower bounds for certain parameter regimes.},

  abstract     = {Rate-adaptive MacKay-Neal (MN) codes based on protographs are analyzed. The code construction employs an outer distribution matcher (DM) to adapt the rate of the scheme. The DM is coupled with an inner protograph-based low-density parity-check (LDPC) code. The performance achievable by the resulting code structure, that is nonlinear, is studied by means of an equivalent communication model that reduces the problem to the analysis of the inner (linear) LDPC code with transmission that takes place in parallel over the communication channel, and over a suitably defined binary symmetric channel. A density evolution analysis of protograph MN code ensembles is outlined, and it is complemented by an error floor analysis that relies on the derivation of the average input-output weight distribution of the inner LDPC code ensemble. Conditions on the shape of the normalized logarithmic asymptotic input-output weight distribution are defined, which allow discarding code ensembles with bad error floor properties during the code design phase. Examples of code designs are provided, showing how the use of a single LDPC code ensemble allows operating within 1 dB from the Shannon limit over a wide range of code rates, where the code rate is selected by tuning the DM parameters. By enabling rate flexibility with a constant blocklength, and with a fixed LDPC code as inner code, the construction provides an appealing solution for very high-throughput wireless (optical) links that employ binary-input modulations.},

  abstract     = {Linearized Reed-Solomon (LRS) codes are evaluation codes based on skew polynomials. They achieve the Singleton bound in the sum-rank metric and therefore are known as maximum sum-rank distance (MSRD) codes. In this work, we give necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of MSRD codes with a support-constrained generator matrix. The conditions on the support constraints are identical to those for MDS codes and MRD codes. The required field size for an $[n,k]_{q^{m}}$ LRS codes with support-constrained generator matrix is $q\geq \ell +1$ and $m\geq \max _{l\in [\ell]}\{k-1+\log _{q}k, n_{l}\}$ , where $\ell $ is the number of blocks and $n_{l}$ is the size of the l-th block. The special cases of the result coincide with the known results for Reed-Solomon codes and Gabidulin codes. For the support constraints that do not satisfy the necessary conditions, we derive the maximum sum-rank distance of a code whose generator matrix fulfills the constraints. Such a code can be constructed from a subcode of an LRS code with a sufficiently large field size. Moreover, as an application in network coding, the conditions can be used as constraints in an integer programming problem to design distributed LRS codes for a distributed multi-source network.},

We optimize the detector parameters to achieve the best trade-off between missed-detection and false-alarm error exponents. First, we optimize the detectors for a given signal, resulting in a non-linear relation between the signal and correlator weights to be optimized.

  abstract     = {For an integer $k \geq 0$ , k-bit delay decodable code-tuples are source codes that use a finite number of code tables and allow a decoding delay of at most k bits. It is known that the class of k-bit delay decodable code-tuples can achieve a better average codeword length than Huffman codes for $k \geq 2$ . However, it is generally challenging to find an optimal k-bit delay decodable code-tuple (i.e., a k-bit delay decodable code-tuple achieving the optimal average codeword length among all k-bit delay decodable code-tuples) because the class of k-bit delay decodable code-tuples is a comprehensive and flexible class containing a variety of source code consisting of any finite number of code tables. AIFV (almost instantaneous fixed-to-variable length) codes are 2-bit delay decodable code-tuples consisting of two code tables satisfying certain constraints. This paper proves that the class of AIFV codes always contains an optimal 2-bit delay decodable code-tuple for any given source distribution. Thus, we can find an optimal 2-bit delay decodable code-tuple in the class of 2-bit delay decodable code-tuples by considering only the class of AIFV codes, which is a very restricted subclass compared to the whole class of 2-bit delay decodable code-tuples.},

  abstract     = {Nonlinear feedback shift registers (NFSRs) are an important building blocks in the design of stream ciphers over the past years. An NFSR is vulnerable to cryptanalysis if there are output sequences with low linear complexities. In this paper, we present a method to find output sequences of an NFSR with low linear complexities from a new perspective. Let f be the characteristic function of an NFSR, and let $f_{L}$ be the linear part of f. First, we present some theoretical results in order to find sequences $\underline {a}\in G(f_{L})$ such that $\underline {a}\in G(f)$ . In particular, it is shown that if $f_{L}$ has divisors of the form $g(x^{d})$ , then $G(f)$ is more likely to have linear sequences. Then, we introduce two kinds of isomorphisms of NFSRs which could be used to find more potential linear sequences in $G(f)$ . Such isomorphisms induce a close relationship among the linear structures of NFSRs, whose realization relies on a type of decomposition of Boolean functions. As a generalization, we propose a framework to analyze the linear structure of a Galois NFSR. The idea is to focus on the Galois LFSR derived from the Galois NFSR by removing the nonlinear part, which can be transformed into an equivalent Fibonacci LFSR. Finally, we apply the results to some lightweight algorithms designed based on the cascade connections of NFSRs, and find several families of sequences generated by the main register of Lizard with linear complexities no more than 30.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we consider Switched-Delay-Lines (SDL) constructions of optical priority queues by using optical (bufferless) crossbar switches and optical fiber delay lines. In a priority queue, each packet is associated with a priority upon its arrival, the highest-priority packet is sent out from the queue whenever there is a departure request, and the lowest-priority packet is dropped from the queue whenever there is a buffer overflow. Given any system for SDL constructions of optical priority queues, the main research problem is twofold: (i) the design of the routing policy performed by the optical crossbar switches; (ii) the choice of the delays of the optical fiber delay lines. Sarwate and Anantharam are the first to propose a feedback system consisting of an optical $(M+2)\times (M+2)$ crossbar switch and M optical fiber delay lines (see Figure 1 in Section I) for SDL constructions of optical priority queues, and they have shown that the largest buffer size that can possibly be achieved by using such a feedback system is $2^{M}$ . However, whether this theoretical buffer size $2^{M}$ can be achieved or not remains an open research problem. Currently, the best result in the literature was obtained by Cheng et al. and the achieved buffer size is $2^{O(\sqrt {\alpha M})}$ , where $\alpha $ is a constant that depends on the parameters used in their constructions. In this paper, we consider a discrete-time setting and use a feedback system consisting of an optical crossbar switch and multiple groups of optical first-in first-out (FIFO) multiplexers with delay one (FM1‚Äôs) for SDL constructions of optical priority queues under a priority-based routing policy (see Figure 2 in Section I). Our contributions are as follows: (i) We extend and generalize an important class of constructions that contains the optimal constructions in the work of Cheng et al. As a result, we achieve larger buffer sizes and less construction complexities/costs than those by Cheng et al. (ii) We obtain a closed-form expression for the maximum buffer size that is achieved by the optimal construction for the scenario that each group of FM1‚Äôs has the same number of FM1‚Äôs. (iii) Our constructions possess a salient feature, namely, fault-tolerant capability, that can tolerate the malfunctioning of some FM1‚Äôs by using the generalized results obtained in this paper. (iv) We show that our constructions can be implemented by using an optical $(M+2)\times (M+2)$ crossbar switch and M optical fiber delay lines, and achieve a buffer size $2^{O(\sqrt {\alpha M})}$ , where $\alpha $ is a constant that depends on the parameters used in our constructions and is better, i.e., larger, than that in the work of Cheng et al. in a very broad regime.},

Examples are provided to prove that different instances of secure groupcast that have the same entropic structure, i.e., the same entropy for all subsets of the key variables, can have different maximum groupcast rates and different minimum broadcast bandwidth. Thus, extra-entropic structure matters for secure groupcast. Next, the maximum groupcast rate is explored when the key variables are generic linear combinations of a basis set of independent key symbols, i.e., the keys lie in generic subspaces. The maximum groupcast rate is characterized when the dimension of each key subspace is either small or large, i.e., the extreme regimes.

  abstract     = {In this work, we initiate the study of network-agnostic perfectly-secure multi-party computation (MPC) against general (non-threshold) adversaries, where the corruption capacity of the adversary is specified through an adversary structure, which is a set of potentially corrupt subsets of parties. Known MPC protocols are designed either assuming a synchronous network where every sent message is guaranteed to be delivered within some known time or assuming an asynchronous network where no timing assumptions are made and every sent message is eventually delivered. Perfectly-secure MPC protocols in the synchronous network can be designed as long as the underlying adversary structure satisfies the $ {{\mathcal {Q}}}^{(3)}$ condition, meaning that the union of no three subsets from the adversary structure covers the entire set of parties. On the other hand, perfectly-secure MPC protocols in the asynchronous network can be designed only against $ {{\mathcal {Q}}}^{(4)}$ adversary structures, meaning that the union of no four subsets from the adversary structure covers the entire set of parties. A natural question is whether a single MPC protocol exists, which remains secure even if the parties are unaware of the network conditions at execution time. That is, if the synchrony is satisfied throughout the protocol execution then the protocol should be secure against any $ {{\mathcal {Q}}}^{(3)}$ adversary structure. However, even if any synchrony assumption is violated during the execution, the protocol should still be secure against any $ {{\mathcal {Q}}}^{(4)}$ adversary structure. We answer the above question affirmatively. Fix any adversary structure ${\mathcal {Z}}_{s}$ and ${\mathcal {Z}}_{a}$ satisfying $ {{\mathcal {Q}}}^{(3)}$ and $ {{\mathcal {Q}}}^{(4)}$ conditions respectively, such that ${\mathcal {Z}}_{a} \subset {\mathcal {Z}} _{s}$ . We show the existence of a network-agnostic perfectly-secure MPC protocol tolerating ${\mathcal {Z}}_{s}$ and ${\mathcal {Z}}_{a}$ in synchronous and asynchronous networks respectively as long as the $ {{\mathcal {Q}}}^{(3, 1)}$ condition is satisfied, meaning that the union of no three subsets from ${\mathcal {Z}}_{s}$ and one subset from ${\mathcal {Z}}_{a}$ covers the entire set of parties.

  abstract     = {Multi-armed bandits is a sequential decision-making problem where an agent must choose between multiple actions to maximize its cumulative reward over time, while facing uncertainty about the rewards associated with each action. The challenge lies in balancing the exploration of potentially higher-rewarding actions with the exploitation of known high-reward actions. We consider a multi-armed bandit problem with probes, where before pulling an arm, the decision-maker is allowed to probe one of the K arms for a cost $c\geq 0$ to observe its reward. We introduce a new regret definition that is based on the expected reward of the optimal action. We develop UCBP, a novel algorithm that utilizes this strategy to achieve a gap-independent regret upper bound that scales with the number of rounds T as $ O(\sqrt {KT\log T})$ , and an order optimal gap-dependent upper bound of $ O(K\log T)$ . As a baseline, we introduce UCB-naive-probe, a naive UCB-based approach which has a gap-independent regret upper bound of $O(K\sqrt {T\log T})$ , and gap-dependent regret bound of $O(K^{2}\log T)$ ; and TSP, the Thompson sampling version of UCBP. In empirical simulations, UCBP outperforms UCB-naive-probe, and performs similarly to TSP, verifying the utility of UCBP and TSP algorithms in practical settings.},

  abstract     = {This paper investigates two hitherto unaddressed aspects of best arm identification (BAI) in stochastic multi-armed bandits in the fixed-confidence setting. The first aspect is related to the optimality and efficiency tradeoff. Specifically, the two key metrics for assessing bandit algorithms are their computational efficiency and performance optimality (e.g., in sample complexity). In the stochastic BAI literature, there have been advances in designing algorithms to achieve optimal performance at the expense of being computationally expensive (e.g., optimization-based methods). Similarly, there have been also advances in designing algorithms with high computational efficiency that have provable gaps to the optimal performance (e.g., the $\beta $ -optimal approaches in top-two methods). This paper introduces a framework for BAI that achieves optimal performance with a computationally efficient set of decision rules. The central process that facilitates this is a routine for sequentially estimating the optimal allocations up to sufficient fidelity. Specifically, these estimates are accurate enough for identifying the best arm (hence, achieving optimality) but not overly accurate to an unnecessary extent that creates excessive computational complexity (hence, maintaining efficiency). The second aspect pertains to the class of parametric stochastic bandits. The existing literature has only focused on the exponential family of distributions. This paper addresses any arbitrary family of distributions parameterized by their mean values (under mild regularity conditions). The optimality is established analytically, and numerical evaluations are provided to assess the analytical guarantees and compare the performance with those of the existing ones.},

  abstract     = {A fundamental quantity of interest in Shannon theory, classical or quantum, is the error exponent of a given channel W and rate R: the constant $E(W,R)$ which governs the exponential decay of decoding error when using ever larger optimal codes of fixed rate R to communicate over ever more (memoryless) instances of a given channel W. Nearly matching lower and upper bounds are well-known for classical channels. Here I show a lower bound on the error exponent of communication over arbitrary classical-quantum (CQ) channels which matches Dalai‚Äôs sphere-packing upper bound for rates above a critical value, exactly analogous to the case of classical channels. This proves a conjecture made by Holevo in his investigation of the problem. Unlike the classical case, however, the argument does not proceed via a refined analysis of a suitable decoder, but instead by leveraging a bound by Hayashi on the error exponent of the cryptographic task of privacy amplification. This bound is then related to the coding problem via tight entropic uncertainty relations and Gallager‚Äôs method of constructing capacity-achieving parity-check codes for arbitrary channels. Along the way, I find a lower bound on the error exponent of the task of compression of classical information relative to quantum side information that matches the sphere-packing upper bound of Cheng et al. In turn, the polynomial prefactors to the sphere-packing bound found by Cheng et al. may be translated to the privacy amplification problem, sharpening a recent result by Li, Yao, and Hayashi, at least for linear randomness extractors.},

  abstract     = {The Quantum Reverse Shannon Theorem has been a milestone in quantum information theory. It states that asymptotically reliable simulation of a quantum channel, assisted by unlimited shared entanglement, requires a rate of classical communication equal to the channel‚Äôs entanglement-assisted classical capacity. In this paper, we study the error exponent of quantum channel simulation, which characterizes the optimal speed of exponential convergence of the performance towards the perfect, as the blocklength increases. Based on channel purified distance, we derive lower and upper bounds for the error exponent. Then we show that the two bounds coincide when the classical communication rate is below a critical value, and hence, we have determined the exact formula of the error exponent in the low-rate case. This enables us to obtain an operational interpretation to the channel‚Äôs sandwiched R√©nyi information of order from 1 to 2, since our formula is expressed as a transform of this quantity. In the derivation, we have also obtained an achievability bound for quantum channel simulation in the finite-blocklength setting, which is of realistic significance.},

As our main contribution, we characterize these asymptotic distributions in terms of Fr√©chet derivatives of elementary operator-valued functions. We achieve this by leveraging an operator version of Taylor‚Äôs theorem and identifying the regularity conditions needed. As an application of our results, we consider an estimator of quantum relative entropy based on Pauli tomography of quantum states and show that the resulting asymptotic distribution is a centered normal, with its variance characterized in terms of the Pauli operators and states.

Secondly, we describe a novel ‚Äòsoundness amplification‚Äô procedure for qLTCs which can increase the soundness of any qLTC to a constant while preserving its distance and dimension, with an impact only felt on its locality. Finally, we apply the AEL distance amplification construction to the case of qLTCs for the first time which can turn a high-distance qLTC into one with linear distance, at the expense of other parameters. These constructions can be used on as-yet undiscovered qLTCs to obtain new parameters, but we also find a number of present applications to prove the existence of codes in previously unknown parameter regimes. In particular, applications of these operations to the hypersphere product code and the hemicubic code yield many previously unknown parameters.

We show that the matrix Laplace transform of Poisson shot noise admits an expression analogous to that implied by Campbell‚Äôs theorem. We demonstrate the utility of this generalization of Campbell‚Äôs theorem in two important applications: the characterization of a Poisson shot noise process and the derivation of the complementary CDF (CCDF) and meta-distribution of signal-to-interference-and-noise (SINR) models in Poisson networks. In the former application, we demonstrate how the higher order moments of Poisson shot noise may be obtained directly from the elements of its matrix Laplace transform. We further show how the CCDF of this object may be bounded using a summation of the first row of its matrix Laplace transform. For the latter application, we show how the CCDF of SINR models with phase-type distributed desired signal power may be obtained via an expectation of the matrix Laplace transform of the interference and noise, analogous to the canonical case of SINR models with Rayleigh fading. Additionally, when the power of the desired signal is exponentially distributed, we establish that the meta-distribution may be obtained in terms of the limit of a sequence expressed in terms of the matrix Laplace transform of a related Poisson shot noise process.},

For instance, an interesting approach for the univariate case using the size of the Cram√©r-Rao lower bound was introduced in a recent work by Ferreira Da Costa and Mitra.

However, due to the constraint on the maximum instantaneous power, guaranteeing bounded latency is challenging. In this paper, we investigate the reliability-latency-rate tradeoff in low-latency communication systems with finite-blocklength coding (FBC). Specifically, we are interested in the fundamental tradeoff between error probability, delay-violation probability (DVP), and service rate. Based on the effective capacity (EC), we present the gain-conservation equations to characterize the reliability-latency-rate tradeoffs in low-latency communication systems. In particular, we investigate the low-latency transmissions over an additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel and a Nakagami- $m$ fading channel. By defining the service rate gain, reliability gain, and real-time gain, we conduct an asymptotic analysis to reveal the fundamental reliability-latency-rate tradeoff of ultra-reliable and low-latency communications in the high signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) regime. To analytically evaluate and optimize the quality-of-service-constrained throughput of low-latency communication systems adopting FBC, an EC-approximation method is conceived to derive the closed-form expression of that throughput. Our results may offer some insights into the efficient scheduling of low-latency wireless communications, in which statistical latency and reliability metrics are crucial.},

They are used for various critical practical applications in communication and storage due to their efficient encoding and decoding algorithms. In the past sixty years, significant progress has been made in understanding BCH codes‚Äô dimensions and minimum distances. However, there has been limited research on the minimum distances of the dual codes of BCH codes, making it challenging to determine their actual minimum distances. Therefore, developing accurate lower bounds on the minimum distances of the dual codes of BCH codes is crucial and exciting. In this paper, we primarily use the multiplier technique proposed by Huffman and Pless to investigate the lower bounds on minimum distances of the dual codes $\mathcal {C}_{(q,q^{m}-1,\delta)}^{\perp } $ of the primitive narrow-sense BCH codes with designed distance $\delta $ . When $q = p^{e}$ with $e \ge 2$ , we improve the lower bounds on minimum distances of the dual codes $\mathcal {C}_{(q,q^{m}-1,\delta)}^{\perp } $ in the ranges $p^{ei}-p^{e-1}+2 \le \delta \le p^{ei+e-1}-p^{e-1}+1$ , where $m \ge 2$ and $1 \le i \le m-1$ . These new lower bounds are much tighter than the previously known bounds in the literature. This technique also applies to the study of binary dual codes $\mathcal {C}_{(2,2^{m}-1,\delta)}^{\perp } $ , for which we obtain tight lower bounds for $\delta = 2^{t}$ , where $m \ge 5$ is odd and $2 \le t \le m-3$ is even.},

Bounding this value can be done by finding solutions to the corresponding dual linear program. Delsarte‚Äôs theory is very general and goes way beyond binary codes. In this work, we provide universal bounds in the framework of association schemes that generalize the Elias-Bassalygo bound, which can be applied to any association scheme constructed from a distance function. These bounds are obtained by constructing new solutions to Delsarte‚Äôs dual linear program. We instantiate these results and we recover known bounds for q-ary codes and for constant-weight binary codes. Our other contribution is to recover, for essentially any Q-polynomial scheme, MRRW-type solutions to Delsarte‚Äôs dual linear program which are inspired by the Laplacian approach of Friedman and Tillich instead of using the Christoffel-Darboux formulas. We show in particular how the second linear programming bound can be interpreted in this framework.},

  abstract     = {Matrix product codes are generalizations of some well-known classes of codes, including generalized Reed-Muller codes and repeated-root constacyclic codes. Recently, a bound for the minimum symbol-pair distance of a matrix product code was given by (Luo et al., 2023), leading to the creation of new families of MDS symbol-pair codes. In this paper, we provide lower and upper bounds for the minimum b-symbol distance of matrix product codes, which naturally extends some of the results by (Luo et al., 2023). Examples meeting the bounds are included to illustrate our results. As an initial application of these new bounds, we establish that constacyclic codes (repeated-root or otherwise) meeting specific criteria can indeed be classified as matrix product codes, and present bounds on the minimum b-symbol distance of such constacyclic codes. Additionally, we determine all the minimum b-symbol distances of Reed-Muller codes as a secondary application of the new bounds.},

  abstract     = {Although the expenses associated with DNA sequencing have been rapidly decreasing, the current cost of sequencing information stands at roughly ${\$}120$ /GB, which is dramatically more expensive than reading from existing archival storage solutions today. In this work, we aim to reduce not only the cost but also the latency of DNA storage by initiating the study of the DNA coverage depth problem, which aims to reduce the required number of reads to retrieve information from the storage system. Under this framework, our main goal is to understand the effect of error-correcting codes and retrieval algorithms on the required sequencing coverage depth. We establish that the expected number of reads that are required for information retrieval is minimized when the channel follows a uniform distribution. We also derive upper and lower bounds on the probability distribution of this number of required reads and provide a comprehensive upper and lower bound on its expected value. We further prove that for a noiseless channel and uniform distribution, MDS codes are optimal in terms of minimizing the expected number of reads. Additionally, we study the DNA coverage depth problem under the random-access setup, in which the user aims to retrieve just a specific information unit from the entire DNA storage system. We prove that the expected retrieval time is at least k for $[n,k]$ MDS codes as well as for other families of codes. Furthermore, we present explicit code constructions that achieve expected retrieval times below k and evaluate their performance through analytical methods and simulations. Lastly, we provide lower bounds on the maximum expected retrieval time. Our findings offer valuable insights for reducing the cost and latency of DNA storage.},

  abstract     = {This article introduces a novel concatenated coding scheme called sparse regression LDPC (SR-LDPC) codes. An SR-LDPC code consists of an outer non-binary LDPC code and an inner sparse regression code (SPARC), whose respective field size and section sizes are equal. For such codes, an efficient decoding algorithm is proposed based on approximate message passing (AMP) that dynamically shares soft information between inner and outer decoders. This dynamic exchange of information is facilitated by a denoiser that runs belief propagation (BP) on the factor graph of the outer LDPC code within each AMP iteration. It is shown that this BP denoiser falls within the framework of non-separable denoising functions and subsequently, that state evolution holds for the proposed AMP-BP algorithm. Leveraging the rich structure of SR-LDPC codes, this article proposes an efficient low-dimensional approximate state evolution recursion that can be used for efficient hyperparameter tuning, thus paving the way for future work on optimal code design. Finally, numerical simulations demonstrate that SR-LDPC codes outperform contemporary codes over the AWGN channel for parameters of practical interest. SR-LDPC codes are shown to be viable means for obtaining shaping gains over the AWGN channel.},

Such codes are studied in the context of memoryless binary symmetric channels (BSCs) with maximum likelihood (ML) decoding. Previous research has characterized some optimal codes among the linear $(n,4)$ codes for any $n \geq 2$ . However, it was unknown whether these optimal codes among linear codes were better than all nonlinear codes. In this paper, we first demonstrate that for any $n \geq 2$ , there exists an optimal code among all $(n,4)$ codes that is either linear or belongs to a subset of nonlinear codes called Class-I codes. We identify all the optimal codes among the linear $(n,4)$ codes for each blocklength $n \geq 2$ and discover some that were not previously reported in the literature. For any n from 2 to 8, all the optimal $(n,4)$ codes are identified. Except for $n=3$ , all the optimal $(n,4)$ codes are equivalent to linear codes. There exist optimal $(3,4)$ codes that are not equivalent to linear codes. Furthermore, we introduce a subset of nonlinear codes called Class-II codes and show that for any $n \gt 3$ , the set composed of linear, Class-I, and Class-II codes and their equivalent codes contains all the optimal $(n,4)$ codes. Both Class-I and Class-II codes are close to linear codes in the sense that they involve only one type of column that is not included in linear codes. We derive a sufficient condition such that all the optimal $(n,4)$ codes are equivalent to linear codes, which can be evaluated by computer with a computation cost $O(n^{6})$ .},

Motivated by applications in polymer-based data storage for recovering strings from tandem mass-spectrometry sequencing, the proposed algorithm leverages the equivalent polynomial formulation of the problem which facilitates efficient parallel implementation. The computational complexity of the proposed reconstruction algorithm is upper bounded by $6.5n^{2}$ finite field operations, where the field size is upper bounded by $10n$ , implying that the computational complexity is upper bounded by $6.5n^{2}(3.22+\log {n})$ binary operations. Furthermore, it allows parallelization leading to $O(n \log n)$ reconstruction latency. We characterize sufficient conditions for a length n binary string that guarantee the string‚Äôs reconstruction time complexity to be bounded polynomially. Moreover, the sufficient conditions on binary strings that guarantee reconstruction in polynomial time are more general than the conditions for the algorithm by Acharya et al. This is used to construct new codebooks of reconstruction codes that have efficient encoding procedures, and are larger, by at least a linear factor in size, compared to the previously best known construction by Pattabiraman et al., (2023).},

The outer bound is proved by analyzing stochastic processes defined based on the entropy of the message, given the past channel‚Äôs outputs. Our method relies on tools from the theory of martingales, variable-length information measures, and a new technique called time pruning. We further propose a variable-length achievable scheme consisting of three phases: (i) data transmission, (ii) hybrid data-confirmation, and (iii) full confirmation. We show that two-phase-type schemes are strictly suboptimal in achieving the MAC‚Äôs reliability function. Moreover, we study the shape of the lower-bound and show that it increases linearly with respect to a specific Euclidean distance measure defined between the transmission rate pair and the capacity boundary. As side results, we derive an outer bound on the capacity of MAC with noiseless feedback and study a new problem involving a hybrid of hypothesis testing and data transmission.},

  abstract     = {We introduce the problem of determining the identity of a byzantine user (internal adversary) in a communication system. We consider a two-user discrete memoryless multiple access channel where either user may deviate from the prescribed behaviour. Since small deviations may be indistinguishable from the effects of channel noise, it might be overly restrictive to attempt to detect all deviations. In our formulation, we only require detecting deviations which impede the decoding of the non-deviating user‚Äôs message. When neither user deviates, correct decoding is required. When one user deviates, the decoder must either output a pair of messages of which the message of the non-deviating user is correct or identify the deviating user. The users and the receiver do not share any randomness. The results include a characterization of the set of channels where communication is feasible, and an inner and outer bound on the capacity region. We also show that whenever the rate region has non-empty interior, the capacity region is same as the capacity region under randomized encoding, where each user shares independent randomness with the receiver. We also give an outer bound for this randomized coding capacity region.},

  abstract     = {We study a class of gossip networks where a source delivers fresh status updates through networks consisting of a set of gossiping nodes. Contrary to previous works, the source delivers updates subject to an age-dependent point process where the rates are related to the age process at each node. Moreover, our work divides the age-dependent gossip networks into two types, i.e., type-A and type-B, where the former allows only one node sampling from source and the latter allows all. We first prove the necessary Markovity and ergodicity of both age-dependent gossip networks and proceed with deriving the general form of unique stationary distributions. With these premises established, closed-form expressions of the stationary age moments for type-A networks with arbitrary topologies are derived with the help of SHSs, with three specified results given for the line, ring and fully-connected networks. Meanwhile, we prove that no closed-form expressions of stationary age moments can be obtained in type-B networks. An approximated model for arbitrary-connected type-B networks is proposed, where we formulate the stationary moment equations for the approximated SHSs under the guarantee of Lagrange stability. Then, we provide a moment closure method to solve two symmetric cases, i.e., fully-connected and ring networks, approximately and verify the effectiveness of our algorithm by comparing to the simulations.},
