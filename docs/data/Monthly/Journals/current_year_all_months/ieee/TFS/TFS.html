By introducing a novel prescribed-performance transformation, the initial error of each subsystem can be confined in the constrained area for arbitrary system initialization. Then, the designed controller can guarantee global stability of the studied system for all initial system states, and can allow the system nonlinearities to be completely unknown. The odd-rational-power terms are divided into two parts appropriately by using mathematical tools, which facilitates the control design under sensor faults and odd-rational powers while the odd-rational powers are allowed to be unknown. It is proved that the proposed controller can guarantee the global stability of nonlinear systems with unknown system nonlinearities under odd-rational powers and sensor faults. Finally, the advantages and effectiveness of the proposed method are highlighted by both numerical and semi-physical simulations.},

  abstract     = {Microwave filters (MFs) are indispensable in communication systems for selecting specific frequency signals. The tuning of MFs is a demanding and time-consuming task, which can be addressed by the inverse decision-making model (IDMM). However, two main challenges arise in the sampling process for IDMM, namely, low efficiency due to the large number of samples and poor adaptability in the presence of uncertain initial positions. To overcome these challenges, a fuzzy nonuniform sampling (FNUS) method is proposed, leveraging the flexibility of the fuzzy logic system. Specifically, an adaptive sampling framework based on a fuzzy logic system is presented to handle the uncertainty of initial positions. Under this framework, a nonuniform sampling approach is devised to collect fewer samples far from the target and more samples close to the target. Given the similarity and single-sided distribution of samples in the raw dataset oriented to modeling, the tailored enhancement strategies are designed to improve dataset quality. Finally, the efficiency and adaptability of FNUS are demonstrated to be superior to the existing methods through simulations. Furthermore, the practicality of FNUS is validated by experiments on physical MFs.},

  abstract     = {With the rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI), group decision-making (GDM) has become a critical approach to ensuring the scientificity and fairness of decisions in complex systems. However, existing GDM methods often face limitations due to the presence of hypocritical trust and irrational confidence among decision-makers (DMs), which can significantly hinder the effective achievement of consensus. To address these challenges, this article proposes an innovative consensus reaching process that integrates fuzzy preference relations and advanced AI techniques to systematically identify and eliminate irrational factors in the decision-making process. The proposed method introduces a novel mechanism for quantifying the contribution degree of DMs based on game theory within the framework of fuzzy sociometric relations and effectively identifies and eliminates hypocritical trust relationships using geometric analysis. In addition, an innovative quartile classification method based on dynamic monitoring is designed to achieve real-time assessment and adjustment of the confidence level of DMs. By combining principles of calculus and geometry, an accurate calculation model of DM weights is constructed. The proposed method establishes a two-level consensus feedback mechanism integrating confidence level and trust degree, ultimately realizing the selection of the optimal alternative. Systematic case studies and comparative experimental analyses demonstrate the significant superiority of the proposed method in terms of consensus efficiency and decision-making quality. The key innovations of this research include the development of a new weight determination method based on calculus and geometry, the construction of a hypocritical trust identification mechanism using game theory and geometric analysis, and the establishment of an irrational confidence regulation system combining regret theory with dynamic monitoring. These contributions provide a robust theoretical framework and methodological support for addressing consensus challenges in complex GDM scenarios.},

Fuzzy support vector machines and their variants have demonstrated potential in handling noise and outliers but struggle to address the challenge of imbalanced datasets. To deal with this problem, in this article, we propose a novel relative density and nonmembership (RDNM)-based intuitionistic fuzzy twin support vector machine for class imbalance learning. The method utilizes a $k$-nearest neighbor-based probability density estimation to assess the significance of each training pattern. Furthermore, a novel RDNM-based membership function is employed to effectively distinguish noise and outliers from support vectors. To address the class imbalance problem, majority class training patterns are assigned a score function incorporating the imbalance ratio, while minority class patterns are given a higher membership degree of unity. To validate the superiority of the proposed method, comprehensive experiments and statistical analyses are conducted over 30 imbalanced benchmark datasets, employing linear and nonlinear kernels, and the outcomes are compared with the existing approaches. In addition, the proposed model is applied to the HAM10000 dataset, which consists of dermatoscopic images for skin lesion classification, showcasing its effectiveness in medical applications. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model surpasses the baseline models, underscoring its capability for addressing classification challenges in real-world applications with imbalanced class distributions.},

  abstract     = {The rapid advancement of medical imaging technologies has led to an exponential increase in medical image data, making efficient retrieval from large-scale datasets critical for improving diagnostic accuracy and speed. However, two key challenges hinder this process: first, the presence of uncertain and subtle lesions in medical images that are often difficult to discern, and second, class imbalance across different case types within medical image databases. These inherent challenges significantly degrade the performance of existing hashing algorithms. In recent years, methods based on the Takagi–Sugeno–Kang fuzzy system (TSK-FS) have shown promising performance in medical image modeling. Inspired by these advances, this article proposes a novel fuzzy hashing network (FHN) based on TSK-FS to enhance retrieval performance by effectively handling both uncertainty and data imbalance in medical imaging. The FHN first introduces a novel fuzzification mechanism that incorporates the concept of a self-attention mechanism to effectively capture the complex underlying features in medical images, thereby enhancing the data discriminability in fuzzy spaces. Meanwhile, a new consequent parameter learning mechanism is developed for defuzzification by introducing the Transformer network, which aims to improve the inference efficiency and generalization capability of the FHN. Based on these two mechanisms, FHN’s capability of analyzing and handling uncertain data is significantly enhanced. Furthermore, a novel hash center loss is designed to capture global relationships while emphasizing local structural information, thereby improving the handling of imbalanced data and significantly enhancing retrieval performance.},

Since the considered unreliable communication networks are jointly strongly connected switching networks and suffer from time delays, agents cannot receive their neighboring agents’ actions or can only obtain delayed actions. To estimate the neighboring agents’ actions, a distributed NE seeking observer is developed. Then, based on the proposed distributed NE seeking observer and backstepping control technology, a distributed fuzzy adaptive control scheme is constructed by utilizing fuzzy logic systems and adopting integrable functions and bounded parameter estimation algorithms. It is proven that the observation error of the distributed NE seeking observer asymptotically converges to zero, and the developed fuzzy adaptive control scheme can ensure that the agents’ outputs asymptotically converge to the NE of the noncooperative game. Moreover, the nondifferentiable problem of virtual controllers is avoided. Finally, we apply the distributed fuzzy adaptive control scheme to marine surface vehicles, and the simulation and comparison results confirm its effectiveness.},

Specifically, a novel bounded performance function is proposed, which preassigns the convergence time, transient convergence trend (dynamic, variable and gentle initial stage) and steady-state tracking accuracy. More possibilities for transient performance of fuzzy systems are developed. Then, fuzzy set theory is introduced to describe system uncertainties. A fuzzy mechanical system with prescribed performance is constructed in the homeomorphism mapping space. An adaptive control method with finite-time stability is proposed. Thus, the preassigned performance is met through a two-layer collaborative convergence characteristic, rather than relying solely on performance constraint. High-order adaptive laws reduce control costs and avoid overcompensation. Control design is always deterministic rather than based on fuzzy rules. A more effective way is reflected in fuzzy-based optimization. Based on fuzzy sets to measure uncertainty, a cooperative game optimization strategy is designed to obtain the optimal decision for multiple objectives and control parameters. The best combination of performance and cost is solved. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified via the steer-by-wire system.},

  abstract     = {In this article, we present a novel federated learning framework to multivariate regression problems, termed evolving Gaussian federated regression (eGauss+$_{\text{FR}}$). The need for a federated approach is due to the increasing problem of distributed acquisition of the data and protection for the rights of distributing these data. Regression problems are usually nonlinear and, therefore, strongly connected to the clustering to divide the data space into smaller subspaces where a linear approximation could be applied. Here, we are faced with the main drawback of traditional clustering methods, where a predefined number of clusters are needed. In federated learning problems, where the data are commonly nonidentically distributed between different sources or clients, this represents a significant challenge. This problem can be overcome by introducing an evolving approach, which adds and removes the clusters on-the-fly. The idea in our approach is to use the incremental c-regression or c-varieties clustering methods to define the clusters, which lie close to the lines and describe them with the centers and the covariance matrices. The clustering is done for each data source or client. Due to the restriction and protection of data sharing, only the centers and the covariance matrices of all clients are then transmitted to main server and merged together, which is here done in a way as proposed in eGauss+ method. From merged clusters the auxiliary points are generated, which than serve to approximate the function by using classical fuzzy models. Our proposed method was demonstrated on simple synthetic data, while synthetic and real-world datasets were used to test time complexity and scalability with the number of clients. The results demonstrate the benefits of evolving federated method, which results in high-quality approximation of the function and can be easily extended to high-dimensional problems.},

Aiming at characterizing nonlinearity with parameter uncertainty, the interval type-2 (IT2) Takagi–Sugeno fuzzy technique is implemented in system modeling. Meanwhile, it is supposed that both observer and controller modes can just be acquired via a hidden Markov mode detector in the first attempt. Then, following the concept of nonparallel distribution compensation, the observer-based IT2 fuzzy asynchronous controllers are constructed with observers and controllers sharing the same fuzzy membership function but different from that in systems, which improves the designed flexibility. In accordance with semi-Markov kernel approach and the Lyapunov function contingent upon both system modes and sojourn times, sufficient criteria are established for the functioning of expected mode-dependent IT2 fuzzy observers and controllers such that the $\sigma$-mean-square stability for the resulting nonlinear augmented semi-Markov jump singularly perturbed systems comprised of the controlled systems and observation error systems is guaranteed. Furthermore, from the perspective of fuzzy processing, parameters and relaxation matrices that comply with fuzzy rules are added to ensure system stability while further reducing the conservatism of conditions. Ultimately, a circuit model and comparison examples are shown to substantiate the necessity and superiority of the suggested technique.},

  abstract     = {Dempster–Shafer (DS) evidence theory provides a powerful framework for modeling uncertainty, reasoning, and combining information from multiple sources. However, it may yield counterintuitive results when handling conflicting evidence, thereby affecting decision reliability and limiting practical applications. To address this issue, this work proposes a novel evidential reasoning rule with divisive hierarchical clustering (ER-DHC), consisting of two main modules: evidence clustering and cluster fusion. At first, a new divisive hierarchical algorithm is introduced for evidence clustering, comprising coarse-grained and fine-grained division. In the coarse-grained stage, evidence with different decision preferences is grouped into separate clusters, thus preventing high intracluster conflicts and laying a solid foundation for evidence clustering. The fine-grained division adaptively refines cluster structures using an inflection point detection method, thereby enhancing clustering quality. On this basis, a new cluster fusion strategy is developed, involving intracluster fusion via classical Dempster’s rule and intercluster fusion using a fuzzy preference relation-based weighted approach. This fusion strategy can degenerate into classical DS fusion and weighted fusion, while also introducing a new clustering fusion perspective, offering better flexibility. Finally, the proposed ER-DHC method is applied to the multisource information fusion system, with experimental results demonstrating improved performance of target classification.},

  abstract     = {In this article, a novel prescribed-time composite learning-enhanced fuzzy (PrTCLF) cooperative control approach is proposed for the multiple-leadermultiple-follower (MLMF) teleoperation systems in the presence of system model uncertainties and external interferences. First, compared with traditional MLMF systems, a unifying virtual leader–follower teleoperation control framework, notably applicative for more general situations where the number of leaderand follower robots is not the same, is constructed by introducing scheduled control authority for different operators, especially in cooperative control mode. A significant feature of this article is that the first result of a novel time-dependent function integrated PrTCLF learning law rendering all the synchronization errors of the uncertain MLMF teleoperation system to zero is creatively derived, by which the effect of the traditional fuzzy learning error on the precision of system convergence is essentially solved. Meanwhile, in order to ensure the high efficiency and robustness of cooperative work, a new class of nonsingular prescribed-time terminal sliding mode surface is designed without any switching behavior. Besides, the sufficient conditions for maintaining the prescribed-time stability of the MLMF teleoperation system are provided through systematic Lyapunov stability analysis. Finally, the effectiveness of the control structure and algorithm is verified by a large number of simulation and experimental results.},

  abstract     = {As an innovative methodology in data processing and knowledge representation, granular-ball computing (GBC) adaptively generates distinct neighborhoods for individual objects, thereby improving both generality and flexibility. By replacing point inputs with granular-balls (GBs), GBC achieves substantial efficiency gains. However, traditional GB-based classifiers may produce unreliable classifications under uncertain conditions. To address this limitation, we propose a novel approach that integrates three-way decision (3WD) theory with GBC, enabling robust handling of uncertain classification problems. This study first introduces a sequential three-way decision with fuzzy granular-ball rough sets (S3WD-FGBRS). We systematically analyze the changing rules of the multilevel decision cost in S3WD-FGBRS and its three regions. Building upon the principle of justifiable granularity, we develop a cost-sensitive three-way granular-ball generation method (CS3W-GBG) based on S3WD-FGBRS that incorporates a granularity optimization mechanism. To validate our approach, we conduct comprehensive experiments using three state-of-the-art GB classifiers and two benchmark classifiers on 12 publicly available datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that CS3W-GBG exhibits strong resilience in processing uncertain data through its 3WD strategy. Furthermore, our method achieves competitive performance compared to existing approaches in terms of classification accuracy and robustness.},

This study proposes a novel actor-critic reinforcement learning control scheme, integrated with a fuzzy logic system (FLS), to address USV tracking and formation control problems in narrow waterways. Specifically, an FLS-based observer is designed to estimate unknown parameters, such as USV mass and speed, and environmental disturbances, and an actor–critic reinforcement learning controller is developed to allow for tracking and formation control of multiple USVs. The stability of the proposed control scheme is formally analyzed. The numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the controller, showcasing its ability to maintain the USV formation when tracking riverbanks rendered dynamic by environmental disturbances and obtains 24.48% reduction in trajectory length when compared with the existing controllers. This improves the autonomous tracking and formation capabilities of USVs in constrained and uncertain environments.},

  abstract     = {Fuzzy cognitive maps (FCMs) are widely used for modeling complex systems but are limited in handling uncertainty from imprecise or multi-interval data. To address this, extended models, such as fuzzy gray cognitive maps (FGCMs) and fuzzy general gray cognitive maps (FGGCMs) have been developed. In particular, FGGCMs can process general gray numbers, enabling more effective modeling of uncertainty. However, the convergence properties of FGGCMs remain underexplored, limiting their reliability in applications involving prediction, control, and decision-making. This article addresses this gap by establishing a rigorous theoretical framework for analyzing the convergence of FGGCMs using the tanh activation function. First, we define the metric and vector space structure of GGN and prove their completeness. Based on this, Banach’s fixed-point theorem is employed to derive sufficient conditions for the global convergence of FGGCMs to a unique fixed point. Moreover, convergence criteria are separately established for the kernel and grayness components. Finally, we show that existing convergence results for FCMs and FGCMs are special cases of the broader theorems proposed in this work. The main finding is the convergence theorems of tanh FGGCM and the results provide a solid mathematical foundation for future developments in learning algorithms and FCM-based modeling under uncertainty.},

The T2FSHLRNN, configured as a weighted combination of a type-2 fuzzy neural network and a single hidden layer network, demonstrates strong global learning ability. Leveraging its internal and external double-layer feedback mechanism, the network can incorporate both current and previous error information during the approximation process, effectively improving the approximation accuracy and reducing system chattering. Furthermore, an adaptive gain function is proposed and an adaptive terminal super-twisting controller based on T2FSHLRNN (ATSC-T2FSHLRNN) is developed. The system’s stability under unknown disturbance is ensured using Lyapunov synthesis. Based on this, the online parameter learning algorithm for T2FSHLRNN and the variable gains of ATSC are derived.

  abstract     = {To tackle the insufficient representation of uncertainty and weak structural adaptability in nonlinear system modeling, a dynamic interval type-2 fuzzy stochastic configuration network (DIT2FSCN) is proposed, synergistically integrating fuzzy rule initialization and dynamic sparse interpolation rule growth. First, a k-means clustering algorithm based on density peaks (BDPKA) is introduced to initialize the parameters of DIT2FSCN. The limitations of traditional clustering methods, such as sensitivity to initial centers and the requirement to predefine the number of rules, can be overcome by fusing density peak detection with k-means clustering, enabling data-driven fuzzy rule generation. Second, a two-stage modeling framework incorporating interval type-2 fuzzy inference and stochastic configuration-based dynamic optimization is designed. The uncertainty modeling capability of an interval type-2 fuzzy logic system (IT2FLS) and the incremental learning ability of stochastic configuration networks are jointly harnessed, allowing for dynamic characterization of complex system behaviors. Third, a dynamic sparse interpolation rule growth strategy based on the blankness score is proposed. The blankness scoring mechanism that accounts for both interrule spacing and local data distribution is designed to facilitate adaptive rule base expansion via sparse region identification and dynamic interpolation, capturing the coupling relationships in nonlinear systems. Finally, the effectiveness of DIT2FSCN is validated through simulation experiments, including sequence prediction, benchmark dataset modeling, and two real-world industrial process applications. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed DIT2FSCN has better performance than its peers in accuracy and generalization capability.},

In order to ensure the control quality and simultaneously save the communication resource, new resilient adaptive event-triggered scheme is proposed with a reinforcement learning-based intelligent optimal threshold regulation mechanism based on observed states. Then, an augmented observer-based fuzzy switching system is constructed using the time delay method. In addition, sufficient conditions are established to guarantee global exponential stability of the closed-loop nonlinear lane keeping system with prescribed H∞ performance using a piecewise Lyapunov functional analysis approach. Subsequently, the gains for controller, observer, and trigger are co-designed and computed by solving certain matrix inequalities.

This assumption limits the applicability of control strategies to scenarios with asymmetric information interactions among UAVs. To overcome this limitation, this article addresses the distributed formation control problem of nonlinear multi-UAV systems with unknown uncertainties under general directed communication networks. The approximation capabilities of fuzzy logic systems are leveraged to handle nonlinearities and uncertainties. To conserve limited resources, an event-driven approach is introduced for the design of a distributed formation control strategy. Specifically, the controller of each UAV is updated only when specific events are triggered by a distributed triggering condition, instead of being updated continuously over time. Under intermittent event-driven control updates, all UAVs can achieve a desired time-varying formation configuration, while excluding the Zeno behavior. Adaptive gains, rather than fixed gains, are introduced into the control strategy to enable more flexible control implementation without relying on global information. In addition to formation control, an event-driven attitude control strategy is proposed to ensure that the yaw angles of all UAVs converge to a prescribed value. Finally, simulations are conducted to validate the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed control schemes.},

First, a novel measurement method for attribute fluctuation is proposed, based on the variation range of attribute membership degrees. To mitigate redundancy in the concept space, a fuzzy granular concept space is constructed using the concept contribution degree. Second, the model leverages the semantic richness of concepts by integrating similar fuzzy granular concepts, thereby constructing a clustering space.

  abstract     = {In this study, we propose a novel data transformation-driven fuzzy clustering neural network (DTFCNN) to enhance the dimensionality reduction function and end-to-end refinment learning ability of the entire structure. Unlike conventional fuzzy clustering-based neural networks, which rely on fuzzy c-means clustering in the hidden layer and least squares error-based learning for connection weights, the DTFCNN utilizes backpropagation (BP) learning as a refinement algorithm. This refinement process enables iterative fine-tuning of the model’s parameters, allowing it to adapt more effectively to complex patterns. By using BP, DTFCNN enhances its ability to learn intricate feature interactions and extract relevant features from high-dimensional spaces, thereby significantly improving the model’s flexibility and performance. The proposed DTFCNN consists of four layers. First, a preprocessing layer employs principal component analysis for feature extraction and dimensionality reduction, where eigenvectors are used as connection weights for the preprocessing layer. Second, a hidden layer utilizes fuzzy c-means clustering for generating fuzzy membership degrees, and centers serve as connection weights for hidden layers. The entries of the partition matrix also are regarded as membership degrees. In the output layer, a linear-driven affine transform is used for fitting connection weights, and a SoftMax function is employed to express the outputs as probabilities. Finally, all parameters, such as eigenvectors, centers, and coefficients, from the preprocessing layer to the output layer are refined through BP-based learning. To validate the effectiveness of the DTFCNN, we conducted a collection of comparison experiments: 1) publicly benchmark datasets with statistical analysis, 2) facial recognition datasets for application-specific testing, and 3) three large-scale datasets. The results demonstrate that the DTFCNN outperforms classical classifiers, state-of-the-art fuzzy classifiers, and deep learning baselines in terms of accuracy and generalization capability. The DTFCNN model uses fewer parameters than deep learning baselines, resulting in faster training times without compromising performance. Overall, the DTFCNN achieves higher accuracy while maintaining model adaptability.},

  abstract     = {In the era of Big Data, the integration and fusion of heterogeneous information have become essential for addressing complex decision-making challenges in large-scale group decision-making (LSGDM), where expanding scale and diverse participant behaviors increasingly demand advanced techniques to enhance efficiency, fairness, and accuracy. To meet these demands, this article proposes a novel framework that leverages information-fusion principles to optimize group decision-making processes. First, an enhanced fuzzy C-means algorithm, termed Trust-based regularized fuzzy C-means, is introduced. By incorporating a regularization term derived from trust relationships, it improves clustering precision and enables finer segmentation of decision-makers (DMs), thus laying solid groundwork for consensus. Building on this, we develop an optimization model integrating three-way decision theory to resolve asynchronous differences among experts. The model uses dynamic trust updates to guide DMs from the negative region toward those in the positive region, with special emphasis on rapid consensus in emergencies. Furthermore, the study, for the first time, systematically investigates manipulative and herd behaviors within large datasets; adopting a cautious strategy to mitigate their impact on fairness and effectiveness, it embeds pseudotrust identification into the framework to further refine the decision environment. Extensive case studies and comparative experiments demonstrate that the proposed method significantly improves decision-making efficiency, fairness, and accuracy, offering new perspectives and practical tools for managing complex information and optimizing group behaviors in LSGDM.},

  abstract     = {The integrated wheel-end module (IWEM) incorporates both driving and steering functions at the wheel end, enabling independent control of each wheel and significantly enhancing the vehicle’s agility and stability. However, during steering maneuvers, road excitations and variations in wheel motion may lead to air-gap eccentricity (AGE) in the in-wheel motor, resulting in the unbalanced radial force and torque (URF/URT). These disturbances degrade the tracking accuracy of the wheel-end module and subsequently impair the vehicle’s steering performance. To address this issue, a control-oriented model of the IWEM is developed, incorporating the coupled characteristics of longitudinal slip and lateral slip angle of the tire. Furthermore, an interval type-II fuzzy logic (IT2FL) driven self-tuning tube model predictive control strategy is proposed. First, the generation mechanism of URF/URT under AGE is analyzed in depth. To mitigate the adverse effects of these uncertain disturbances on the wheel-end dynamics, an online observation method based on IT2FL systems is designed to enable real-time estimation of URF/URT and its perturbation bounds. On this basis, a self-tuning tube model predictive controller is developed to dynamically adjust the Tube boundaries according to the real-time observed disturbance range, effectively reducing control conservatism and improving tracking accuracy. Hardware-in-the-loop simulations and real-vehicle experiments validate that the proposed method can effectively suppress the adverse effects caused by AGE and significantly enhance the tracking control performance of the integrated wheel-end system.},

  abstract     = {Fuzzy rough set theory has made significant strides in the field of feature selection. However, it still faces challenges when dealing with noisy data. Most traditional models fail to incorporate sample weight information in the evaluation of sample similarity, leaving them prone to interference from noisy samples. To address this issue, this article introduces a novel Weighted Fuzzy Rough Set (WFRS) model, designed to more accurately capture the uncertainty inherent in data. This model combines class distribution with the concept of neighborhood weights for samples, and proposes a directed weighted fuzzy binary relation to evaluate both the similarity and differences between samples. By doing so, it avoids the overfitting issues typically caused by over-reliance on distribution information from local noisy samples. Drawing on sample weighting, traditional fuzzy approximation operators are reinterpreted and redefined, leading to the construction of the WFRS model. Key uncertainty metrics, such as decision approximation and the positive region, are analyzed in depth, providing a solid theoretical foundation for subsequent feature selection and decision analysis. Based on this model, a forward heuristic feature selection algorithm is developed and compared with various State-of-the-Art algorithms. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method performs exceptionally well across multiple evaluation metrics, fully validating the efficiency and robustness of the WFRS model.},

  abstract     = {Multilabel feature selection (MFS) plays a vital role in enhancing model performance by identifying the most relevant features. However, most existing methods assume complete feature information and overlook the potential issue of missing features in real-world applications. Furthermore, existing methods mainly focus on feature redundancy while paying insufficient attention to the potential positive interaction among features, which adversely affects the effectiveness of feature selection (FS). To overcome these limitations, this article proposes a novel incomplete MFS method based on dynamic dual-graph optimization and fuzzy feature interaction (D2GOFI). The method addresses two core challenges systematically: 1) feature-missing processing; and 2) feature interaction modeling. Specifically, D2GOFI introduces a fuzzy tolerance relation to mitigate information loss caused by missing features, and proposes fuzzy tolerance implication granularity information to reveal the data’s intrinsic structure and guide the FS process effectively. To address the potential issue of overinclusivity introduced by the fuzzy tolerance relation, a nonnegative adjustment matrix has been designed to improve the stability and reliability of FS. Meanwhile, D2GOFI explicitly models positive fuzzy interaction between features to enhance the expressiveness of feature relevance evaluation. Finally, a dynamic dual-graph optimization strategy is employed to preserve local manifold structures at the feature and label levels simultaneously, ensuring the FS process aligns with the data’s inherent patterns. Experimental results demonstrate that D2GOFI achieves superior accuracy and robustness across multiple datasets.},

To effectively represent knowledge in dynamic multiview data, this article proposes a dynamic multiview concept-cognitive learning (DMVCCL) model. First, a multiview knowledge representation framework is established, which uses fuzzy three-way concepts as basic carriers. The natural hierarchical relationship between concepts is utilized to precisely represent knowledge in multiview data. Then, for dynamic multiview data, a clue-based dynamic concept updating mechanism is designed. This mechanism leverages the varying sensitivities of concepts at different granularity levels to data changes, enabling learning concepts at the optimal granularity level. Moreover, the weights of each view are assigned based on the representation capability of the learned concepts, and a multiview classification method is designed using the similarity between concepts and data.

  abstract     = {Multitask Takagi–Sugeno–Kang fuzzy systems (MT-TSK-FS) commonly utilize interpretable fuzzy rules to facilitate information sharing among tasks and have shown promising performance. However, existing MT-TSK-FS modeling approaches still face several challenges. Specifically, they mainly focus on the global fitting of tasks while overlooking the local fitting accuracy of individual rules, thereby undermining rule interpretability. Moreover, the antecedent and consequent components of fuzzy rules are often learned independently, lacking collaborative coordination. In addition, task-specific rule diversity is insufficiently addressed, which may result in redundant or overlapping rules. To this end, we propose a progressive collaborative learning framework for MT-TSK-FS (MTTSKFS-PCL), which progressively optimizes the model from the local perspective of individual rules to that of global tasks. At the local level, a locally target-guided multitask fuzzy clustering method is introduced to enhance local rule accuracy and to jointly optimize rule antecedents and consequents. At the global level, a mini-batch gradient descent (MBGD) algorithm is employed to integrate fuzzy rules and enhance overall task fitting. Meanwhile, a confidence-supervised regularization strategy is introduced to preserve local rule accuracy throughout the MBGD process. Furthermore, a rule diversity enhancement mechanism is incorporated to improve task-specific rule diversity. Extensive experimental evaluations on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed MTTSKFS-PCL significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, validating its effectiveness and robustness in multitask fuzzy modeling.},

This functional also provides a graceful event-triggered $H_\infty$ analysis framework that avoids the use of the $S$-procedure. Then, the Lyapunov matrices in the functional are set to be aperiodic sampling-dependent, thereby further reducing the conservatism of the criteria. Furthermore, a basic-inequality-based method is provided to handle the imperfect premise matching between the fuzzy system and the fuzzy controller in interval type-2 fuzzy systems, avoiding the previous introduction of additional free matrices and extra constraints. Thereafter, the fuzzy controller design method is given, and the aperiodic sampling-based static/dynamic event-triggered control is effectively implemented. Ultimately, two case studies validate the effectiveness of the proposed approaches and demonstrate their ability to achieve superior event-triggered control effects compared with the existing literature.},

  abstract     = {Most fuzzy clustering algorithms are based on the well-known Bezdek’s fuzzy $C$-means (FCM). However, FCM fails when the data is imbalanced (class sizes are highly unequal). This issue arises because in FCM all data points have only attraction to each cluster prototype (i.e., centroid), causing centroids to be biased toward the large class with the most data points. This article proposes a novel equilibrium $K$-means (EKM) for imbalanced data, where data points exert both attraction and repulsion on centroids. The equilibrium between opposing forces reduces the learning bias toward large clusters, leading to more meaningful clusters on imbalanced data. Unlike FCM, EKM explicitly models the relationship between membership and centroid via equality constraints, avoiding the pitfalls of uniform effect. We derive closed-form centroid update equations proven to converge exponentially fast. Experiments are conducted on four artificial and 16 real-world datasets. The results demonstrate that EKM significantly outperforms 13 State-of-the-Art methods on imbalanced datasets while maintaining competitive performance on balanced data. EKM achieves an average improvement of 0.22 in normalized mutual information, 0.31 in adjusted rand index, and 0.21 in clustering accuracy over FCM on 10 real-world imbalanced datasets, with comparable computational efficiency in theory and practice.},

It is for the first time in the literature of fuzzy based linguistic MADM models that MARSHAL treats inputs as rich linguistic features from a pretrained deep learning based large language model. This is in addition to the input being uncertain and hesitant, while also presenting vector arithmetic based information elicitation from corresponding hesitant fuzzy linguistic term sets. The idea is to introduce semantically-aware probabilistic attribute weights based on high-dimensional linguistic features learned by an enhanced variant of BERT, utilized to solve MADM problems alongside risk and regret-aversive behaviors of experts. The proposed model is tested for applicability on a real case-study of employee flight risk detection.

  abstract     = {Anovel observer-based fuzzy adaptive fault-tolerant control approach is proposed for multimotor synchronously driving servo systems in the situation of a single-motor malfunction. Different from most existing fault-tolerant control strategies based on analytical redundancy, this article leverages inherent hardware advantages of multimotor systems and develops a structural redundancy-based fault-tolerant control by directly turning off the faulty motor, which enhances the reliability of the remaining healthy motors driving the asymmetric system. To further address the unknown nonlinearities and measurement inaccuracies introduced by the unbalanced faulty system, a fuzzy logic system is developed to identify the state-based unbalanced torque and additional friction dynamics, and a state observer is then designed to estimate the load speed. Moreover, the command-filtered backstepping technique is utilized in the control design process to reduce the computational complexity caused by the repeated signal derivations. After stability analysis, an experiment on the multimotor prototype is implemented to show the effectiveness of the designed fault-tolerant control approach.},

  abstract     = {This study focuses on achieving hierarchical optimal synchronization in a fractional-order nonlinear multiagent system (FONMAS) composed of a single leader and multiple followers, analyzed within the framework of the Stackelberg–Nash game theory. The leader makes decisions by anticipating the optimal responses of all followers, whereas each follower concurrently reacts optimally to the leader’s strategy by engaging in a Nash game. To obtain the optimal control policy of the FONMAS, a regularized fuzzy reinforcement learning approach is proposed. First, a fractional-order (FO) Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman (HJB) equation in coupled form is formulated, which serves as the basis for deriving the optimal control policies of both the leader and the followers. It is further proven that these strategies constitute a Stackelberg–Nash equilibrium. Next, due to the asymmetry among agents, solving the FO coupled HJB equations becomes challenging. To address this, a hierarchical learning framework grounded in FO value iteration is proposed, which depends solely on partial knowledge of the system dynamics. We demonstrate that, given mild coupling assumptions, this method converges asymptotically to equilibrium policies. Furthermore, a regularized actor–critic framework with fuzzy logic is employed to estimate the cost function and optimal control policy, and the FO weight update rules are developed by formulating a Lyapunov function for the optimal fuzzy weight deviation, ensuring convergence to optimal weight values. Ultimately, both theoretical analysis and simulation results support the efficiency of the proposed method.},

To address this problem, a performance index comprising local containment error, control energy, and fault effects, is first formulated under the zero-sum differential game, where controllers and faults are treated as opposing players with different signs. Subsequently, improved generalized fuzzy hyperbolic model-based approximation techniques are used to identify unknown dynamics and learn optimal FTCC policies incorporating reinforcement learning (RL). Specifically, to enhance the weight convergence performance and relax the traditional persistence of excitation condition, a practical fixed-time identifier is developed based on the generalized fuzzy hyperbolic model by integrating practical fixed-time system identification technique with experience replay technique. Then, using the generalized fuzzy hyperbolic model as the critic, a fuzzy-RL algorithm with experience replay is developed to learn optimal FTCC policies from the coupled Hamilton–Jacobi–Isaacs equations. The containment error and the critic approximation error are ensured to be ultimately uniformly bounded using the Lyapunov method.

However, the actuator failure and unavoidable external disturbances may cause deviations in the DO concentration, and even destabilize the system. In this article, a fault tolerant control approach utilizing adaptive dynamic programming (ADP) and experience replay (ER) is developed with the purpose of realizing robust control of the DO concentration under the influence of the actuator failure and external disturbances. First, a novel cost function considering actuator multiplicative failure and disturbances is constructed. Based on this cost function, the control law is designed, which can effectively suppress the adverse effects of the actuator failure and external disturbances on control performance. Second, the control input, failure input, and cost function are estimated via two action networks and one critic network. Specifically, the collaborative interaction of the three networks contributes to get the optimal robust control law. Third, an improved ER technique named disturbance-focused ER is designed for adjusting the critic network and action networks, where a metric rooted in disturbance magnitude and time-difference error is designed to dynamically adjust data and batch sizes, for effectively suppressing the external disturbances. Finally, the feasibility of the proposed fault tolerant control method based on ADP with ER is confirmed through simulation experiments.},

  abstract     = {Hierarchical fuzzy systems (HFSs), as a type of deep-structured fuzzy model, exhibit strong expressive power, excellent scalability, high flexibility, and desirable interpretability, making them highly promising for tackling a variety of complex problems. Despite their widespread applications in various fields such as control, classification, and modeling, very little research has been conducted to analyze how inputs influence the system’s behavior. Consequently, this article presents an in-depth analysis of a class of incremental HFSs (IHFSs) from two perspectives of input importance. First, an enhanced mutual information-based input importance ranking method is proposed, enabling a more effective and concise evaluation of the degree to which inputs influence or depend on the ground truth. Next, a comprehensive sensitivity analysis, both at the subsystem level and the entire system level, is performed to illustrate the impact of inputs on the system. Specifically, a novel sensitivity metric, termed average sensitivity (AS), is proposed to simplify sensitivity calculations, thereby significantly reducing computational costs. Several related theorems are provided to theoretically analyze the sensitivity of the system to inputs under specific conditions. Furthermore, an evaluation framework based on the AS, called ASEF, is proposed for assessing the rationality of the constructed IHFS structure, which facilitates the effective design of high-performance systems for modeling tasks. A series of experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed methods. Finally, several potential research directions are suggested to drive further progress.},

Such a framework operates in a parallel structure where the model-free predefined-time controller guarantees the transient performance while the proposed network controller provides appropriate torques to handle failures and uncertainties, which leads to a solution for both normal and faulty conditions. Significant features of this study are that the control design does not depend on any information about system dynamics, and theoretically, the predefined-time convergence is accomplished by means of the online parameter learning algorithm. Moreover, a hierarchical self-organizing algorithm is embedded in the proposed network controller to overcome the network structure complexity and the input partition problem.

Although many methods have been developed from diverse perspectives, to our knowledge, none can provide fine-grained hypergraph fuzzy community information, and the quality of identified crisp partitions is often limited. This study defines a set of novel concepts of multi-scale hypergraph fuzzy memberships that systematically quantify the partial belongingness (i.e., membership grades) among nodes, hyperedges, and hypergraph communities within the interval [0,1], thereby revealing the multi-scale partial topological affiliations. Furthermore, the multiscale hypergraph fuzzy memberships are employed to develop a general framework, named fuzzy membership-assisted hypergraph modularity optimization (FMHMO), aiming to approximate the modularity-optimal crisp hypergraph partition. The FMHMO framework comprises two key strategies: Hyperedge similarity-based hypergraph reduction (HS-HR) and fuzzy membership-based hypergraph partition recovery (FM-HPR). In particular, HS-HR reduces a hypergraph to a simple weighted graph, mapping hyperedges as nodes and their interactions as edges using novel hyperedge similarity as weights. Thereby, preserving intrahyperedge and interhyperedge topologies of the original hypergraph. FM-HPR recovers a hypergraph partition from the approximately modularity-optimal weighted graph partition by quantifying the fuzzy memberships of bridge nodes connecting multiple incident hyperedges, thereby enabling precise assignment of their crisp hypergraph community affiliations. Experimental results in both synthetic and real-world datasets indicate the superiority of FMHMO over state-of-the-art hypergraph community detection algorithms in accuracy and modularity quality.},

  abstract     = {Recently, many laws and regulations have granted users the right to be forgotten, i.e., the right to require data controllers to delete user data. Various methods for machine unlearning have been proposed to remove individual data points. However, they do not scale to the scenarios where larger groups of features are to be removed. To address this challenge, we propose MAFRO, an optimal-granularity fuzzy decision rule–based classifier that accelerates unlearning via influence functions. Building on granular computing (GrC), MAFRO first selects a minimal reduct of attributes, then constructs fuzzy granules with a Gaussian membership function to extract concise decision rules and realizes unlearning through the influence function. Specifically, instead of training with the full set of attributes, we use the reduct, a minimal subset of attributes that can classify the data with the same accuracy as the full set of attributes. Next, we extract fuzzy rules based on the reduct. Finally, fusing the generated rules establishes the linear model with strongly convex loss functions. In this way, MAFRO can quantify the divergence caused by attribute deleting and update the model without retraining it, thereby adapting the influence of data removal on the model and accelerating the unlearning process. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate MAFRO on 10 typical datasets in terms of performance and unlearning speed. We compare MAFRO with the state-of-the-art algorithms. Experimental results demonstrate that MAFRO enhances accuracy by an average of 6.96%, and achieves up to 236× speedup for attribute unlearning tasks.},

Existing ensemble clustering methods face two notable challenges: 1) developing a new ensemble framework that yields a final clustering result matching the ground-truth cluster count and 2) revealing consistency among all base clustering results. To address these challenges, we propose a novel one-step fuzzy ensemble clustering method (OS-FECM) that incorporates ground-truth cluster number graphs. Initially, OS-FECM establishes a one-step fuzzy ensemble framework that directly integrates all base fuzzy clustering results (i.e., membership matrices) with varying cluster counts, thereby eliminating reliance on the coassociation matrix typical of existing two-step ensemble frameworks. Furthermore, we construct a ground-truth cluster number graph, which maps the number of clusters in each base clustering result to the ground-truth cluster count in the final ensemble result. This graph reveals the consistency among all base fuzzy clustering results and illustrates the relationships between clusters in the base results and the ground-truth clusters. It is then embedded into the corresponding base fuzzy clustering results to enhance the final ensemble result. Finally, we employ an alternating optimization method alongside a weighting mechanism to derive the final ensemble clustering result and adaptively assign importance to each base clustering result. Experimental evaluations across various datasets demonstrate that OS-FECM achieves clustering performance that is at least comparable to, if not superior to, that of other comparative methods.},

  abstract     = {An adaptive fuzzy dynamic event-triggered control approach is proposed for a fleet of fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) operating under jointly connected switching topologies. The primary challenge lies in addressing asynchronous switching topologies caused by topology identification delays. To tackle this, asynchronous distributed observers are constructed, and topological switching rules are designed, ensuring that all follower UAVs can estimate the leader UAV’s state by leveraging asynchronous distributed state errors. In addition, a novel dynamic event-triggering mechanism is introduced. Compared to state-of-the-art methods, the proposed triggering function directly couples the external state variable with the last triggered value, dynamically regulates the triggered interval based on the control performance, and minimizes the number of occurrences while maintaining the system performance. An adaptive fuzzy translational and rotational controller is further developed to enable the follower UAVs to accurately track the state of the leader UAV while ensuring that all closed-loop states remain globally uniformly ultimately bounded. The proposed strategies are validated for effectiveness and superiority through a semiphysical simulation platform.},

  abstract     = {Nonlinear switched positive systems (SPSs) subject to time-varying delays are ubiquitous in actual applications, whose control and synthesis are complicated due to the influence of positivity constraints, switching laws, and time delays. This article addresses the issues of dissipative sliding mode control and dissipativity-based sliding mode tracking control for fuzzy SPSs in the presence of time-varying delays under a state-dependent switching paradigm. First, a bumpless transfer technique and a hysteresis switching mechanism for fuzzy switched systems are employed to mitigate input chattering and avoid high-frequency switching, respectively. Then, a novel fuzzy integral switching sliding surface is formulated to accommodate the characteristics of nonlinear switched systems. Based on the multiple linear copositive Lyapunov function, sufficient conditions are derived to guarantee that the closed-loop positive system is asymptotically stable with strict $(q,r)$-$\alpha$ dissipativity and bumpless transfer performance under the proposed controller. Furthermore, the dissipative tracking control design is investigated via the designed fuzzy integral sliding mode surface, with guaranteed reachability under positivity and stability conditions. Ultimately, the feasibility of the mentioned fuzzy sliding mode control strategy is verified through two examples with a Lotka–Volterra population model.},

  abstract     = {The federated fuzzy C-means (federated FCM) extends the traditional Fuzzy C-means (FCM) to the federated learning (FL) scenario, aiming to address the data privacy preservation issue of soft clustering in distributed environments. However, a significant challenge persists with existing federated FCM algorithms, i.e., they struggle to converge effectively in complex heterogeneous scenarios, leading to unstable clustering outcomes. Here the complex heterogeneous scenarios stem from the combination of nonindependently and identically distributed (non-IID) data across different clients (statistical heterogeneity), coupled with the involvement of only some clients in each iteration (systematic heterogeneity). While prior research has attempted to address the impact of statistical heterogeneity in FL scenarios, it has overlooked the issue of system heterogeneity. In response, this article proposes a novel federated FCM algorithm (SC-FFCM) that remains robust even in such complex heterogeneous scenarios. First, the client-side clustering module of SC-FFCM adopts a gradient-based FCM algorithm, facilitating corrections to the direction of local optimization. Second, the algorithm introduces a control variates technique to rectify update bias during the iteration process, thereby mitigating the adverse effects of random client sampling and non-IID data distribution on the algorithm convergence. Finally, the proposed algorithm approximates the ideal federated FCM algorithm. Experimental studies verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

Existing approaches typically rely on global-level feature learning or noise disambiguation; however, they often struggle to effectively capture the multigranularity relationships inherent in feature and label spaces, and tend to overlook critical intrafeature information essential for accurate label discrimination. To address these limitations, we propose a novel partial multilabel learning framework based on a dynamic coarse-to-fine granularity feature aggregation strategy, which hierarchically extracts feature representations across multiple levels of granularity and dynamically emphasizes label-relevant feature components. Specifically, the dynamic fine-granularity graph captures label-specific local information by modeling the fuzzy aggregations among fine-granularity feature components, while the dynamic coarse-granularity graph learns adaptive label representations by identifying feature-aware correlations of labels and suppressing noise. By jointly leveraging these two complementary granularity levels, the model effectively integrates multilevel semantic relationships and enhances the overall discriminative capacity of the learned features. Extensive experiments conducted on benchmark datasets under varying noise conditions demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in partial multilabel classification.},

In industrial production, operators often lack a comprehensive and objective assessment of the operating conditions of an SAG process and usually make different control decisions based on experience to meet production demands. This article explains a two-level fuzzy comprehensive evaluation method for the load and efficiency of an SAG process. First, the operation mechanism of an SAG process is analyzed, and the evaluation indicators of load and efficiency are determined. Then, the levels and weights of each indicator are determined by combining expert experience and actual production data. Finally, the operating load level is first evaluated by combining the information entropy weight and fuzzy computation. When the load level is within an acceptable range, a fuzzy comprehensive evaluation of the efficiency level is then performed. The modeling method of efficiency indicator, circulating load ratio (CLR), is integrated with random forest and Bayesian optimization to carry out the efficiency evaluation. Experiments using actual production data demonstrate CLR modeling performance with a mean absolute error of 1.084% and a mean absolute percentage error of 9.415%. The accuracy of the operating efficiency evaluation is 81.69%. This method provides an objective and uniform criterion for operators to evaluate the operating load and efficiency of an SAG process, thus guiding the regulation of actual production.},

  abstract     = {Pixel-level histopathology image segmentation plays a vital role in computational pathology, and weakly supervised segmentation methods, which rely solely on image-level labels, have shown great potential. However, most existing weakly supervised segmentation methods are limited by the fixed receptive field of convolutional neural networks, and overlook the uncertainty of the distribution of different tissue types and the fuzziness of class boundaries, resulting in limited segmentation effects. To address these problems, we propose a fuzzy-enhanced class-aware attention based Transformer (FCAformer) for weakly supervised histopathology image segmentation. FCAformer employs the Transformer architecture for model global contextual information, which effectively alleviates the limitation of fixed receptive field on the size of attention map in traditional methods. Subsequently, FCAformer integrates fuzzy system to model the uncertainty in histopathology images. Specifically, it assigns membership function to the output feature map of the last layer of Transformer encoder, generates fuzzy membership matrix, extracts fuzzy features by combining three fuzzy rules, and finally fuses these features to generate fuzzy attention map. This attention map guides the network to learn the characteristics of different tissue types and improve the fuzziness of class boundaries, thereby improving the modeling ability of the model on uncertain tissue distribution and fuzzy areas. In addition, based on the idea of contrastive learning, we design contrastive class token (CCT) loss to further enhance the distinguishability between different class labels. Extensive experiments on LUAD-HistoSeg and BCSS-WSSS datasets demonstrate that FCAformer achieves state-of-the-art segmentation performance in weakly supervised segmentation tasks.},

Additionally, it addresses the shortcomings of traditional objective functions, such as mean squared error (MSE), which fail to capture the complexities inherent in high-dimensional and uncertain datasets. The BPFNN framework integrates Bayesian probabilistic modeling with advanced fuzzy clustering techniques, utilizing a non-Gaussian probability density function to better represent data uncertainties. A hybrid Markov chain Monte Carlo strategy, combining Metropolis-Hastings for membership updates and Gibbs sampling for cluster parameter estimation, is employed to effectively model uncertainty. For the learning of connection weights, the generalized cross-entropy loss function is applied, and the iteratively reweighted least squares algorithm is used to update the weights, allowing for a more precise quantification of the divergence between predicted and ground truth labels. Experimental evaluations on several benchmark datasets, as well as a high-dimensional laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) spectral dataset, demonstrate that the proposed BPFNN significantly outperforms both traditional methods and State-of-the-Art techniques in terms of classification accuracy and robustness. Notably, BPFNN achieves an average accuracy improvement of 3.2% over conventional models on benchmark datasets, with a 5.3% improvement on the LIBS dataset, highlighting its substantial advancement in the field.},

With the numerous efforts contributed by related researchers, impressive success has been achieved in employing the external knowledge to enhance the sentiment representation. However, in previous works, the utilization of external knowledge is quite straightforward, which does not match the sentiment characteristics of human beings. Thus, this work proposes a novel humanized ABSA method, namely, fuzzy humanized sentiment-assisted graph attention networks (FHSGAT). Preliminary, to acquire the essential semantic features, the sentence is reconstructed by the manually designed prompt template, which would assist the pretrained language model in generating the target-guided semantic representation. In addition, based on the normal dependence graph, triple-dimensional external knowledge is injected into the corresponding nodes. Specifically, this article leverages the Gaussian membership function to fuzzify the sentiment knowledge-enhanced nodes, enabling the networks to obtain the humanized sentiment relationship between graph nodes, namely, fuzzy humanized syntactic features. Besides, due to its exquisite performance in information fusion, graph attention networks are utilized to accomplish the integration of target-guided semantic representation and fuzzy humanized syntactic features synchronously. Eventually, to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method FHSGAT, extensive experiments are conducted on five publicly and widely used benchmarks, and the corresponding results show the performance of the proposed approach outperforms the state of the art obviously.},

  abstract     = {Constraints from the external environment and personal experiences may hinder decision makers from offering complete fuzzy preference relations in situations of group decision making. Conflicts in individual different preferences impede any effort of reaching consensus. Addressing such challenges, traditional methods typically isolate fuzzy preference relation completion and consensus reaching as two separate parts, while improving consistency level through iterative processes. However, such an approach affects the efficiency of consensus achievement. Furthermore, existing studies utilize limited known objective information for filling missing values, while neglecting the excavation of indirect preferences that requires lower cognitive capacity from decision makers. Consequently, the credibility of decision results is greatly reduced. Through integrating indirect preferences, this article introduces a consensus framework that concurrently accomplishes fuzzy preference relation completion and consensus reaching. In the framework, an ordinal regression consensus discriminant model is constructed to first assess the compatibility of information sets. Subsequently, to accurately identify and manage conflicting information, we design a conflict feedback mechanism by considering the minimum cost elimination consensus model and the minimum cost adjustment consensus model. Our proposed method not only deeply explores decision makers’ implicit preferences, but also achieves the integration of three goals: missing value prediction, consensus reaching, and additive consistency realization. It avoids multiple consistency iterations and distortions, while enhancing the reliability of estimated values and the efficiency of consensus reaching. Finally, the validity of the proposed method is demonstrated through case analysis, sensitivity analysis, and comparative analysis.},

In order to enhance the classification accuracy, we assign adaptive weights to each sample and adjust these weights to mitigate the impact of outliers on classification accuracy. Unlike traditional fuzzy clustering algorithms, we employ the particle swarm optimization algorithm with time-varying acceleration coefficients to determine the global optimal parameters, thus reducing the computational resources and enhancing the algorithm’s efficiency. The experimental results based on 16 publicly available datasets validate that the proposed algorithm achieves higher classification accuracy with minimal number of iterations.},

  abstract     = {To partition samples into distinct clusters, Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) calculates the membership degrees of samples to cluster centers and provides soft labels, gaining significant attention in recent years. However, existing FCM methods encounter the following challenges. First, traditional FCM focuses on learning membership degrees, neglecting the data similarity structures. Second, graph-based FCM typically separates graph construction from clustering, overlooking the knowledge interaction between graphs and clustering, obtaining suboptimal performance. Third, exploring the similarity structures among all samples is computationally expensive for large-scale tasks. To solve these dilemmas, we propose a scalable fuzzy clustering with collaborative structure learning and preservation (CSLP), which simultaneously leverages both cluster information and similarity structures to learn an optimal membership degree representation. Specifically, a self-weighted manner is devised to measure the sample importance, thereby reducing the adverse impacts of outliers. Moreover, the graph is updated according to the data similarities in the membership degree representation, such that CSLP collaboratively learns the graph and membership degrees in a mutually reinforcing manner. Thus, the similarity structures are fully explored during clustering processes and preserved in the learned membership degrees, enhancing the discrimination of clustering labels. To further improve efficiency, an acceleration solution is developed to reduce the computational cost of CSLP by propagating membership degrees from potential centers to samples, making CSLP scalable for large-scale tasks. An iterative strategy is designed to solve the formulated objective function. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CSLP outperforms other fuzzy clustering methods in terms of both effectiveness and scalability.},

  abstract     = {In this article, a novel neuro-fuzzy-based evolution-guided Q-learning (EGQL) algorithm is established for solving the optimal control problem of unknown nonlinear systems. To enhance the accuracy for approximating the Q-function, the adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) is leveraged, which offers superior precision compared to traditional polynomial approximations commonly used in adaptive dynamic programming. Despite its advantages, the ANFIS-based approximation faces challenges in obtaining the derivative of the Q-function with respect to the control input. To address this limitation, evolutionary algorithms are integrated into EGQL, eliminating the need for gradient information by directly minimizing the Q-function values to derive optimal control strategies. This integration enables precise and robust exploration of the solution space, resulting in accurate and reliable control policies. Furthermore, convergence and monotonic improvement are ensured by the EGQL algorithm, making it suitable for uncertain and nonlinear environments. The effectiveness and superiority of the ANFIS-based EGQL algorithm are validated through simulation results. The developed algorithm achieves a 3.1% reduction in total cost compared to the traditional approach, demonstrating superior control performance.},

  abstract     = {Graph clustering typically involves a two-step process: Relaxation followed by postprocessing. However, it often leads to significant information loss during relaxation and solution deviation in postprocessing. In addition, traditional graph clustering faces computational challenges due to regular graph construction and spectral decomposition, and binary indicators hinder interpretability in uncertain scenarios. We propose a novel method termed Fast Fuzzy Graph Cut (FFGC) to overcome key issues in graph clustering by: Preventing information loss by tackling the original graph cut problem; eliminating solution deviation by directly solving for the target variable; alleviating computational burdens by employing anchor graphs in place of regular graphs; and enhancing flexibility by incorporating a regularization term to soften the cluster indicator. The use of a fuzzy cluster indicator within the graph cut framework expands FFGC’s applicability to a wider range of real-world data, increasing both its adaptability and interpretability. In addition, we develop two efficient optimization algorithms to solve the resulting objective problem. Extensive experimental evaluations validate the superior efficiency and effectiveness of FFGC in clustering tasks.},

First, the Takagi–Sugeno–Kang fuzzy inference system is integrated into the modeling process of KSCNs, where multiple submodels are constructed according to the associated fuzzy rules. Then, the parameters of F-KSCNs are determined by the kernel stochastic configuration algorithm to guarantee model’s universal approximation property. Finally, the output of F-KSCNs is obtained by comprehensively evaluating the significance of each submodel. Compared to the original KSCNs, the proposed F-KSCNs have stronger fuzzy inference ability and can deal with rule-based information. Moreover, computational efficiency is greatly improved under this fuzzy inference framework. Two industrial case studies are carried out for performance evaluation. The experimental results with comparisons with existing solutions clearly show the superiorities of our proposed method, including generalization performance and modeling efficiency.},

  abstract     = {Clustering is an important unsupervised learning technique widely applied in data analysis and pattern recognition. Graph-based clustering methods have gained attention for their ability to effectively model complex data structures. However, traditional methods mainly rely on first-order proximity information, which struggles to capture high-order structural relationships between data points. Such limitation can significantly degrade clustering performance. To address this issue, we propose a novel fuzzy clustering approach leveraging orthogonal tensor decomposition on high-order anchor graphs (OTDHAG). Unlike conventional high-order graph-based methods that rely on self-multiplication of proximity matrices, which are computationally expensive, our method introduces the high-order anchor graph with low computational complexity, and exploits high-order proximity information via orthogonal tensor factorization on high-order anchor graphs. Meanwhile, tensor nuclear norm regularization is adopted to enhance clustering consistency, thereby improving clustering quality. Experiments on 10 benchmark datasets (e.g., MNIST, Wine, PIE) demonstrate that OTDHAG outperforms 14 state-of-the-art methods, achieving 92.3% accuracy on Wine (vs. 86.5% for DenoHOG) and 88.7% NMI on MNIST (vs. 82.1% for AOPL-Root). In conclusion, OTDHAG not only significantly improves clustering accuracy and computational efficiency but also provides a scalable solution for clustering tasks.},

  abstract     = {The secondary membership functions (MFs) of type-2 (T2) fuzzy sets (FSs) are generally assumed to be convex, normal, and upper semicontinuous. Although not explicitly stated, this fact can be detected by taking a look at the $\alpha$-cuts of their join and meet in vertical-slice format. These two operations induce $[0,1]_{\mathcal {F}}$, i.e., the complete lattice of the convex normal upper semicontinuous FSs on $[0, 1]$ together with the so-called convolution order. In this article, we deduce the $\alpha$-cut representations of suprema and infima over finite and infinite sets that occur in the inference mechanisms of general type-2 (GT2) fuzzy inference systems (FISs). We continue by developing a complete, albeit not distributive, lattice structure for the class of all convex upper semicontinuous FSs on $[0, 1]$, denoted ${\mathcal {F}}_{CU}$, which permits designing T2 FISs involving T2 FSs whose secondary MFs are not necessarily normal. Using our formulae of the $\alpha$-cuts of suprema and infima in $[0,1]_{\mathcal {F}}$ and ${\mathcal {F}}_{CU}$, whose elements we describe using so-called anti-dilations, we prove that $[0,1]_{\mathcal {F}}$ is a closed sublattice of ${\mathcal {F}}_{CU}$. We also expand on the lattice-theoretical relations between $[0,1]_{\mathcal {F}}$ and the complete lattices of the convex (strictly) normal FSs. In addition, we show that $[0,1]_{\mathcal {F}}$ and ${\mathcal {F}}_{CU}$ contain complete sublattices of (extended) interval type-2 (IT2) FSs. With these results at hand, it becomes easy to perform the transitions FISs under the minimum t-norm $\to$ (closed) IT2 FISs $\to$ GT2 FISs currently used in practice $\to$ GT2 FISs having not necessarily normal secondary MFs.},

By seamlessly integrating the principles of backstepping with fuzzy logic systems, an innovative practical fixed-time tracking controller is suggested to address the identified issue.

To address these challenges, we propose a meta-fuzzy multimodal fusion network (MF$^{2}$-Net) for depression recognition. This innovative approach integrates physiological signals and behavioral data, employs multiple multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) to learn the fuzzy measures of single base learners and complementary increments, then constructs all fuzzy measures, and finally achieves an interpretable decision-level fusion process through fuzzy integrals. Furthermore, we incorporate model-agnostic meta-learning for conducting few-shot domain-adaptive training, mitigating the issues related to high individual variability levels and the scarcity of multimodal depression data. Our method demonstrates exceptional classification performance in subject-independent experiments implemented on public datasets; offers a reliable solution for objectively, effectively, and conveniently recognizing depression; and has the potential to promote the clinical applications of rapid intelligent depression diagnosis.},

  abstract     = {Facial movement-based depression recognition has garnered considerable attention in automatic depression detection field in recent years. Current methods typically seek to establish a uniform depression discrimination criterion and often overlook interindividual differences in facial movements, which lead to a decrease in the accuracy of models. A closer examination of the clinical diagnostic criteria for depression reveals that individuals with depression exhibit a wide variety of symptoms. This suggests that even individuals with similar levels of depression may exhibit significantly different facial movements. To address this challenge, this study introduces a novel framework for depression assessment—multiscale video adaptive graph network (MVAGN). By leveraging the information transmission capabilities of graph neural network to balance the relationship between individual differences and commonalities to achieve more accurate depression identification. MVAGN consists of three modules: the multiscale video feature extractor (MVFE), the hybrid feature interaction graph module (HFIGM), and the adaptive hybrid graph network (AHGN). MVFE extracts multiscale features from the video, HFIGM transforms these features into graph representations, and AHGN facilitates information transfer between nodes to reduce individual feature differences, ultimately providing a more precise estimation of depression severity. Experiments conducted on the AVEC2013 and AVEC2014 datasets demonstrate that MVAGN achieves state-of-the-art performance. This article proposes that building a fuzzy system with a compact kernel and a loose periphery provides a viable path for recognizing depression.},

  abstract     = {Image aesthetic quality assessment (IAQA) aims to simulate user perceptions to judge the aesthetic quality of images. Due to the high subjectivity of users and the complexity of image aesthetics, modeling IAQA solely at the image level is a compromise. Consequently, existing methods mainly focus on multimodal-based models and achieve effective performance. These methods explore aesthetic comments on images to characterize users and serve as auxiliary text information for multimodal modeling. Unfortunately, this may suffer from two limitations. One limitation is that aesthetic comments are often unavailable for an unknown image in the test phase, and another limitation is that the semantic information of these comments may be uncertain and fuzzy. Therefore, this article proposes a progressively generated text-assisted IAQA method, aiming to address the lack of aesthetic comments and the fuzziness of aesthetic judgments in these comments. Specifically, we first adopt a multimodal large language model to generate aesthetic comments on images by simulating user perceptions and utilize the generated comments to characterize their aesthetic perception to assist in the pretraining of our multimodal-based IAQA model. Then, we design an attribute prediction module to determine the attribute levels of aesthetic judgments and utilize text template construction to further generate explicit descriptions of image aesthetics. Finally, we leverage the generated attribute descriptions to further assist in training our IAQA model. By progressively generating textual auxiliary descriptions of aesthetics for images, the proposed model can gradually determine the aesthetic quality of the images. Massive experimental results indicate that the proposed method outperforms existing mainstream methods on multiple IAQA datasets.},

While conventional wisdom suggests that high salaries in the IT industry safeguard well-being, this study challenges the notion that “money cannot buy happiness” by demonstrating that technostress, social isolation, and “Zoom fatigue” persist regardless of income level. Drawing on a longitudinal dataset collected at three one-year intervals, the research employs fuzzy semantics to translate qualitative survey data into quantitative descriptors, basket analysis to identify consistent behavioral patterns, and a Minimal Spanning Tree-based isolation forest enhanced by Takagi–Sugeno fuzzy rules to detect anomalies. The findings indicate a nuanced interplay of negative and positive emotions, with fear, anxiety, and fatigue frequently coexisting alongside pride, energy, and satisfaction. Some anomalies in responses reveal issues, such as random guessing or minimal IT usage, underscoring the importance of filtering out low-quality data. Crucially, the emotional outcomes are influenced not only by pandemic-related disruption but also by psychosocial and organizational factors—such as role complexity, skill requirements, and managerial support—providing a holistic view of how and why IT-based work can foster both strain and fulfillment. These insights hold practical implications for employers, suggesting that comprehensive well-being strategies, rather than monetary incentives alone, are pivotal in promoting a healthier, more resilient IT workforce.},

  abstract     = {Hypergraph representation learning (HGRL) has attracted widespread attention for its ability to capture high-order relationships (simultaneous interactions among multiple entities) in hypergraphs. However, most existing HGRL methods struggle with uncertainties throughout HGRL processes, including input signals, message passing, and inference. These uncertainties, such as redundant or noisy attributes, distorted structures, noisy node/hyperedge representations, and parameter estimation biases, undermine model robustness and reliability. To address this issue, we introduce fuzzy logic into HGRL for the first time, and propose a new HGRL framework called fuzzy hypergraph representation learning and inference (FHRLI). It effectively manages uncertainties from both data and model perspectives, resulting in more expressive representations. In addition, it allows for more precise and robust inference based on uncertain evidence. Contemplating the influence of label scarcity and uncertainties (annotation errors), we further develop an unsupervised HGRL algorithm, named fuzzy hypergraph contrastive representation learning (FHCRL), by combining the proposed FHRLI framework with hypergraph contrastive learning. Extensive experiments across various tasks verify the effectiveness and competitiveness of the proposed FHRLI framework and FHCRL compared to the state-of-the-art baselines. Furthermore, we experimentally demonstrate that the proposed FHRLI framework can achieve superior robustness and wide universality, along with providing a certain explanatory analysis.},

  abstract     = {In this study, the synchronization problem of discrete-time fuzzy complex networks (FCNs) is investigated based on a state-dependent intermittent memory-event-triggered (MET) scheme. To alleviate the burden of network communication, a state-dependent-region-partitioning-based intermittent mechanism is proposed to set the working/rest interval of the controller. Compared with the existing results, it realizes on-demand control, reduces resource consumption, and expands applicability. A MET mechanism that depends on historical triggering states is developed during the working interval, which adds “smarter” to the triggering decision. Besides, a working-state-dependent threshold function is designed in the triggering condition, which realizes the correlation between intermittent and event-triggered mechanisms. Compared with the existing results, the mechanism provides intelligent regulation of the triggering instant, thereby optimizing the controller update instant and control effect, achieving the goal of improving the control effect while reducing the triggering frequency. Sufficient criteria for achieving synchronization of discrete-time FCNs are derived using Lyapunov stability theory under the state-dependent intermittent MET scheme. Simulation results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.},

First of all, under the semi-intermittent framework, by adopting a more relaxed average control rate under the new definition, a novel fixed-time stability lemma with a unified exponential condition is established, which can reduce the input of parameters irrelevant to the system. Considering the important practical application significance of the practical fixed-time stability, two new practical fixed-time stability lemmas are further obtained based on two different algorithms, which can greatly improve the existing ones. By using the transformation of the same dimension, some new results on the practical fixed-time synchronization control of the considered networks are given by designing the intermittent event-triggered controllers with exponential gains, which have smaller trigger frequency and higher trigger efficiency than the traditional event-triggered controllers. In parallel, both static and dynamic event-triggered controls have been designed, and the dynamic function has been stringently proven to be positive via simple conditions. This accomplishment addresses a long-standing issue in the extant literature, where the presence of high-order terms in the dynamic function had hitherto precluded or failed to establish its nonnegativity. Finally, the viability of the acquired results is demonstrated through numerical simulations.},

  abstract     = {The first-order Takagi–Sugeno–Kang (TSK) fuzzy classifier with a fully combined fuzzy rule base (FuCo-FRB) is a potent and interpretable classifier for multiple input and multiple output (MIMO) tasks. However, FuCo-FRB poses an exponential increase in the number of fuzzy rules, which creates challenges for efficient identification of the parameter matrix for MIMO tasks. To address these challenges, we propose a lightweight TSK fuzzy classifier (LW-TSK-FC) to achieve the balance of training efficiency and predictive performance, particularly for MIMO tasks. The proposed LW-TSK-FC has three key advantages: 1) an adaptive weighting method based on directly connected FRB enables the efficient generation of fuzzy rules while retaining the distribution characteristics of FuCo-FRB; 2) the consequent network of the first-order TSK is optimized to a novel series structure by using matrix factorization. This new structure increases the depth of the consequent network, enabling the implementation of kernel functions and least learning machine (LLM), which enhance both calculation efficiency and predictive performance; and 3) the consequent network of LW-TSK-FC contains only weight parameters, which can be quantitatively identified using LLM. This results in significant improvements in training efficiency. Comparison experiments demonstrate that LW-TSK-FC achieved superior predictive performance and training efficiency, particularly for tasks involving higher-order statistical features. Furthermore, experiments on a real-world clinical application show that LW-TSK-FC efficiently handled 1000-dimensional data and achieved the best testing AUC. This lightweight structure holds tremendous potential for application in deep or stacked fuzzy neural networks.},

The offline phase employs a multitarget sparse regularization strategy to enhance the learning mechanism of the fuzzy-SCN (F-SCN), improving the model’s capacity to handle multitarget parameters. The online phase proposes two strategies, namely, a fuzzy rule growth and pruning strategy and an online optimization strategy for the enhancement layer of F-SCN, aimed at achieving real-time dynamic optimization of the model structure and parameters. This enhances the model’s continual learning ability in nonstationary online data streams.

Consequently, we proposed a hierarchical fuzzy stochastic configuration network based on canonical correlation analysis (HFSCN-CCA) method to enhance the performance of TSK fuzzy systems on multiview datasets. Specially, we replaced the deep canonical correlation analysis framework with data-independent incremental HSCN-CCA method to increase the computational efficiency and ensure universal approximation property while maximizing the correlation. In addition, we optimized the traditional TSK fuzzy system with a novel joint membership function to capture sample-specific multiview information for higher representation capability.

Moreover, BFI can assign each imprecise object to a meta-cluster, defined as the union of specific clusters, to characterize (partial) imprecision.

To tackle the challenge mentioned above, a novel mixture-of-experts-based fuzzy broad learning system (MFBLS) is proposed. In MFBLS, a fuzzy system is integrated to deal with the fuzziness of input data. Concurrently, based on the advantages of the mixture-of-experts framework, the feature weight of each expert system is dynamically adjusted via a gating network to enhance the importance of key features, thereby enhancing the overall capability of the model. Besides, several classical over-sampling techniques are employed to address sample imbalance in datasets to achieve a more balanced class distribution. Subsequently, the extreme gradient boosting algorithm is utilized on the oversampled dataset for feature selection, aiming to enhance the efficiency and the predictive precision of subsequent model training in MFBLS. Finally, through a comparative analysis of state-of-the-art machine learning methods, the superiority of MFBLS in handling imbalanced datasets is validated through a series of experimental evaluations on various imbalanced datasets.},

  abstract     = {This article focuses on the problem of robust adaptive fuzzy fixed-time distributed time-varying optimization (FxT-DTVO) for nonlinear second-order multiagent systems (SOMASs) with input saturation and unmatched disturbances over unbalanced networks. A fixed-time robust adaptive fuzzy tracking strategy is applied to solve the FxT-DTVO problem. First, a gradient-sum-estimation-based fixed-time distributed optimization reference signal is designed to realize the FxT-DTVO in an unbalanced signal network. Subsequently, a fixed-time disturbance estimation algorithm is designed to estimate the unmatched disturbance. Based on the designed disturbance estimation and reference signal, two hierarchical coordinated tracking errors are defined to transform the SOMASs into error dynamic systems. To realize fixed-time stabilization of the error dynamic systems, a fixed-time robust adaptive fuzzy tracking algorithm based on sliding mode control is established, where the robust adaptive term with composite learning robust adaptive law is estimated online to compensate for the effect of input saturation and the unknown interference term. The unknown and continuous nonlinear part is approximated by a fuzzy logic system. The fixed-time stabilization of the error dynamic system means that the nonlinear SOMASs track the time-varying optimization reference signal within a fixed time, and the studied FxT-DTVO problem is thus solvable. Finally, two examples are employed to verify the correctness and good performance of the designed algorithm.},

To enhance the effectiveness and accuracy of peer review in the scientific and technological evaluation system, an integrating fuzzy C-Means (FCM) clustering algorithm and similarity analysis method is proposed. In this methodology, the FCM clustering algorithm is first applied to conduct cluster analysis on expert feature attribute. Second, the recursive feature elimination (RFE) feature selection is used to select the important features for enhancing the model generalization capability. The Gower distance of key features between experts is calculated to determine the similarity between experts, and the association features among experts are mined. Finally, an expert credibility prediction model is constructed based on a feedforward neural network. A real-world expert credibility dataset was used to validate the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed method. The experimental results indicated that integrating the FCM clustering algorithm and similarity association is an effective way to improve the model prediction performance. This can be considered a promising solution for the scientific and technological evaluation.},

To improve the bounds of sampled data period, an SML algorithm is proposed to optimize the allocation of network resources and ensure the effective utilization of bandwidth. Besides, two improved integral inequalities are introduced to estimate the integral quadratic terms that account for signal transmission delays and sampling information. Meanwhile, an appropriate asymmetric looped Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional (ALLKF) is constructed incorporating information on the fuzzy membership function, aperiodic sampling pattern, and transmission delays to facilitate model conservativeness. Next, based on the constructed fuzzy ALLKF along with the proposed inequalities, a set of necessary conditions for achieving asymptotic stability with $H_{\infty }$ performance is derived through linear matrix inequalities, and then control parameters can be obtained to guarantee the less conservative stabilization results of considered closed-loop systems. Finally, to verify the superiority and feasibility of the proposed theoretical observations, the hacked permanent magnet synchronous generator-based wind energy system is numerically validated. In addition, comparative examples are presented to demonstrate the improved conservativeness of the proposed technique.},

  abstract     = {Large language models (LLMs) play a crucial role in intelligent code generation tasks. Most existing work focuses on pretraining or fine-tuning specialized code LLMs, e.g., CodeLlama. However, pretraining or fine-tuning a code LLM requires a vast corpus of data, significant computational resources, and considerable human effort. Compared to pretraining or fine-tuning LLMs, a simple and flexible method of contrastive decoding has garnered widespread attention to improve the text generation quality of LLMs. While contrastive decoding can indeed improve the text generation quality of LLMs, our research has found that directly using contrastive decoding: 1) introduces erroneous information into the logit distribution generated from normal prompts (i.e., user’s input), particularly in the code generation of LLMs; 2) significantly impedes the inference and decoding time of LLMs. In this work, the limitations of using contrastive decoding directly are systematically highlighted, and a novel real-time fuzzy-assisted contrastive decoding (FCD) mechanism is proposed to improve the code generation quality of LLMs. The proposed FCD mechanism initially categorizes prompts into high-quality and low-quality groups based on the results of the evaluator (i.e., unit test) before integrating the LLM. Next, feature values (e.g., standard deviation, peak value, etc.) related to the logit distribution of predicted tokens during the LLM’s inference process for both high-quality and low-quality prompts are extracted. Finally, the extracted feature values are used to train the fuzzy neural network (i.e, fuzzy min–max neural network) offline, allowing for the prejudgement of the reliability of the logit distribution for normal prompt outputs. This prevents the direct use of erroneous information from contrastive decoding and improves the code generation quality of LLMs. Through extensive experiments, it has been demonstrated that the proposed FCD mechanism can significantly improve the code generation quality of LLMs through FCD. Moreover, the FCD mechanism can also reduce the time required for inference and contrastive decoding.},

Nevertheless, there is no a standard subset of EEG features widely accepted in this research field, giving rise to the challenge of curse dimensionality. To cope with the challenge, many EEG feature selection (FS) methods have been put forward based on information theory. Generally, these methods suffer from the issue of delivering a suboptimal result with heuristic search, and they are also inefficient in balancing the influence of different terms like feature relevance and feature redundancy. Based on this, we present a new fuzzy information-theoretic based optimization approach to attain the goal. To be specific, fuzzy mutual information is unitized to evaluate EEG features from the relevance and redundancy perspective, and data structure information is captured to exploit feature manifold simultaneously. Then, a unified optimization framework is designed to take all of them into consideration, thereby inducing a globally optimal result of EEG FS. Extensive empirical studies on three EEG emotional datasets reveal that our method is able to found out a discriminative and nonredundant feature subset from different domains, and therefore achieves the performance improvement of emotion recognition.},

Although deep neural network-based approaches offer a novel, versatile, and highly precise solution for classification tasks, the intrinsic ambiguity and uncertainty present in the data continue to pose a significant challenge, impeding the potential for further advancements in classification accuracy. To address this issue, we propose a fuzzy neural support vector machine (FASTEN), which mitigates the fuzziness and uncertainty inherent in the data and enhances the classification performance. FASTEN mainly consists of two parts: the fuzzy feature extraction unit and the multipath classifier aggregation unit. The fuzzy feature extraction unit is designed to precisely capture the fuzzy features of the uncertainty data by embedding membership functions and fuzzy rules within the neural network. In this process, fuzzy parameters are dynamically updated on a task-driven basis, ensuring that the model can adaptively handle data with different degrees of fuzziness. The multipath classifier aggregation unit is designed to integrate the outputs of multiple neural network classifiers through dynamic linear combination. Meanwhile, we introduce the maximum margin theory of support vector machines to optimize the feature representation and improve classification accuracy. Our experimental results show that FASTEN can improve the classification performance on image and signal datasets. Through ablation experiments, the contributions of each unit to performance enhancement have been further validated, thereby establishing a foundation for subsequent model optimization.},

This approach is grounded in fuzzy optimal membership degrees, and employs fuzzy measures and $\lambda$-mean classification to construct the coupled multiobjective optimum matrix, utilizing the strategy space as the foundation. The Pareto-Nash equilibrium point is sought through the MDFOPI method, with the multiobjective optimal membership degree matrix used to organize the sampled data and integrate the results of multiobjective evaluations.

  abstract     = {Wearable electrocardiographic (ECG) devices have transcended the limitations of long-term Holter monitoring. They provide a solution for early screening of abnormal cardiac conditions. However, in most wearable devices, less than 50% of the collected ECG signals are complete and usable as 12-lead ECG segments, potentially leading to missed detections of paroxysmal cardiac conditions. To address these issues, this study developed an ECG adaptive synthesis neural network (EASNN) designed to enhance the proportion of usable signals in dynamic 12-lead ECG recordings. Building on the proposed composite 18-lead ECG system, the EASNN incorporates lead masking and temporal-lead embedding. It uses additional leads to provide supplementary cardiac status information, which enhances the robustness of the dynamic 12-lead ECG synthesis. The designed multigranular fuzzy cross-attention module achieves multigranular cross-channel embedding for ECG synthesis, helping to effectively capture the structural correlations between the ECG leads. Inspired by relational memory, we incorporated lead attention deep memory within the encoder to capture critical information on the interlead relations, thus deepening the model’s understanding of the relationships between the leads. Experimental results demonstrated that the EASNN outperformed state-of-the-art time-series forecasting algorithms. It achieved up to 97.87% consistency in expert-annotated experiments, indicating that the EASNN-reconstructed ECG closely matched the recorded ECG signals, thus providing valuable support for ECG diagnosis. Notably, EASNN is the first deep neural network specifically designed for the reconstruction of low-quality ECG signals, offering significant application value in dynamic cardiac monitoring.},

Although deep convolutional neural networks and attention-based models have achieved remarkable advancements in this field, they each exhibit inherent limitations and struggle to effectively handle uncertainty. To address these challenges, this article proposes a multiple attentions-based multilevel hybrid-guided deep fuzzy convolutional neural network (MAMH-DFCNN), aimed at enhancing recognition accuracy and uncertainty processing ability while simultaneously expanding the application scope of deep fuzzy systems. Specifically, by introducing a novel squeeze-and-excitation (SE) attention mechanism-based interval type-2 generalized fuzzy hyperbolic tangent autoencoder, a multilevel convolutional fuzzy feature extraction framework is developed to capture features across different spatial and granularity levels, enriching feature representations and improving the model’s robustness against uncertainty. A spatial pyramid-type fuzzy feature attention fusion module (FFAFM) is then employed to fully integrate the multilevel fuzzy features, acquiring more abstract semantic information while reducing information redundancy. Subsequently, a hybrid-driven cross-attention classifier is designed to facilitate the deep interaction of features with different granularities, ultimately producing the final recognition outcome. Extensive comparative experiments and analytical evaluations are conducted. The results demonstrate that MAMH-DFCNN achieves desirable performance across both binary and multiclass classification tasks, exhibiting certain competitiveness against baseline models and state-of-the-art models. These findings highlight the feasibility and effectiveness of MAMH-DFCNN in improving recognition accuracy and robustness against uncertainty in IR.},

In specific, we first establish a mathematical model of fuzzy structural entropy propagation. This model represents multiomics associations by fuzzy hypergraphs, characterizing the progression of AD as the topological evolution of fuzzy hypergraphs. Next, we design a fuzzy hypergraph generative adversarial network (FHG-GAN). Particularly, large foundation models are used to generate high-quality feature representations, alleviating data noise and inconsistencies. FHG-GAN captures the evolutionary patterns of diseases using fuzzy hypergraph convolutional layers designed based on the mathematical model, thereby achieving accurate disease risk prediction and pathogeny extraction. Finally, we experimentally demonstrate the superiority of FHG-GAN compared with advanced methods, indicating FHG-GAN’s ability to support the early diagnosis and treatment of AD-like diseases.},

  abstract     = {Multilabel feature selection (MFS) has received much attention because it can effectively mitigate the impact of “dimensionality curse.” Ambiguity and unavoidable label noise in real life pose significant challenges to MFS. So far, there are relatively few studies on MFS considering label noise. Existing few studies do not consider that label sets of different samples are affected by noise to different degrees, and ignoring differences between samples may reduce the robustness of MFS. Moreover, they explore the fuzzy relationship between samples and labels from a local perspective, which is not comprehensive. In addition, they lack a monotonic metric for measuring attribute importance, leading to the unreasonable selected feature subset. To solve these issues, we propose a noise-tolerant MFS method by monotonic noise-tolerant fuzzy confidence conditional entropy with sample reliability degree and fuzzy association confidence called SRDAC. First, sample reliability degree is defined from the perspective of consistency to distinguish samples affected by different levels of label noise. Second, the idea of global similarity and the fuzzy association confidence between samples and labels are proposed, and corresponding noise-tolerant label enhancement for different types of samples is carried out to better explore the relationship between samples and labels. Third, based on noise-tolerant label space, the noise-tolerant fuzzy confidence conditional entropy is proposed to more reasonably measure the relationship between attributes. Finally, a robust MFS method based on monotonic noise-tolerant fuzzy confidence conditional entropy is proposed. Extensive experiments show that the effectiveness and robustness of SRDAC is better than other representative methods.},

  abstract     = {Online streaming feature selection (OSFS) is a critical technique for addressing high-dimensional streaming data in various real applications. The challenge of OSFS arises from missing entries due to various reasons such as equipment failure or human mistakes. Online sparse streaming feature selection (OS$^{2}$FS) is a feasible approach to this challenge by pre-estimating the missing data before feature selection based on latent factor analysis (LFA). However, such an approach separates the processes of the LFA-based estimates and the down-streaming feature selection, which cannot represent the uncertain relationships between the sparse features and the labels, thereby leading to accuracy losses. To address this critical issue, this article proposes a recursion-and-fuzziness reinforced online sparse streaming feature selection (RF-OS$^{2}$FS) model, which consists of two-fold ideas: first, connecting the LFA-based feature estimation process and the consequent feature selection process via a recursively completion sampling strategy, therefore enabling the information feedback loop from the feature selection validation results to the missing feature estimation, and second, adopting the three-way decisions strategy to establish the fuzzy feature selection for representing the uncertain relationships between the sparse features and the labels. Experimental results on ten real-world benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed RF-OS$^{2}$FS model significantly out-performs existing state-of-the-arts, both OSFS and OS$^{2}$FS models in terms of accuracy when performing sparse streaming feature selection for down-streaming classification tasks.},

  abstract     = {Fuzzy systems are widely used for their strong ability to handle uncertainty; however, they often struggle with high-dimensional problems. Here, a novel scalable model, the multihead Takagi–Sugeno–Kang fuzzy system (MHTSK), is proposed to efficiently handle high-dimensional data while maintaining strong interpretability. Unlike traditional fuzzy systems that construct a single antecedent using all features, MHTSK builds multiple subantecedents by randomly sampling subsets of features to address high-dimensional challenges. The rules generated by these subantecedents are jointly optimized, resulting in a naturally sparse consequent structure that enhances interpretability. Since the size and number of feature subsets directly influence the length and complexity of fuzzy rules, we propose an optimal parameter configuration scheme that balances: first, preventing “numeric underflow” in high-dimensional data, and second, ensuring sufficient coverage of the original feature space. Furthermore, considering the randomness introduced by sampling, a rule extraction scheme is proposed to eliminate redundant rules. The refined rule base obtained after the extraction process is used to retrain the model, resulting in a new variant model called MHTSK_RE. The effectiveness of MHTSK and MHTSK_RE is demonstrated on eleven high-dimensional datasets. The results confirm their superior performance and outstanding interpretability in handling high-dimensional data.},

First, an improved looped function containing quadratic information about the sampling sawtooth characteristic is employed to include as much system state information as possible in a simple form. In response to the nonlinear terms encountered in the functional derivatives, a fuzzy-related matrix injection method is proposed on the basis of linearization transformation.

First, the ideal controller of HST is modified to an equivalent linear data model by utilizing the dynamic linearization (DL) method. Then, a novel partial form DL controller-based model-free adaptive control framework is designed. To alleviate the impact of actuator faults, the unknown fault-related uncertainties are approximated by employing a fuzzy logic system, and the fuzzy weight is estimated by introducing a parameter estimation criterion function. Furthermore, a fixed threshold sensor attack detection mechanism is introduced to detect and isolate compromised sensors by predicting the speed of the train in the next time interval. Based on the prediction algorithm, an improved data fusion strategy is developed to compensate for the impacts of sensor attacks, which can remove the requirement of the number of attacked sensors while allowing the system to maintain robust performance under various attack conditions. It is shown that the proposed algorithm is effective in the sense of the generic norm, thus ensuring reliable and safe operation for the multiple-unit HST.

To characterize the stability of a given flow scheme, we define the amplitude of the corresponding solution, in this work. If a solution has a bigger amplitude, then it is able to bear a larger perturbation among its components. Accordingly, the corresponding flow scheme is considered to be more stable. For obtaining the amplitude of a given solution, we propose some effective algorithms to compute the upper and lower amplitudes.

  abstract     = {Class incremental learning (CIL) aims to mitigate catastrophic forgetting of previously learned classes when integrating new knowledge. A primary challenge contributing to forgetting is the absence of data from earlier classes. Researchers have designed a variety of methods to solve the problem, among which topology-preserving methods show tremendous potential. However, two problems remain: first, a large hyperparameter search space for constructing and utilizing a complex topology hinders efficient performance optimization, and second, constraining the network to preserve the topology in the objective makes it difficult to optimize. This article proposes SPARK, a simple and parameter-free method by embedding fuzzy cognitive maps, to address the problems. First, we construct a fuzzy cognitive map with nodes representing class prototypes and edges representing interclass similarities. Then, we exploit the fuzzy cognitive map to obtain class-level embedding by aggregating features of other classes for each class. Finally, the class- and sample-level embeddings are fused and fed to the classifier. The proposed method can be easily optimized without introducing additional loss terms and hyperparameters. We theoretically prove that such a simple fuzzy cognitive map embedding can efficiently preserve the structural information of the fuzzy cognitive map. Experimental results indicate that SPARK achieves up to 5.85% higher average accuracy and 8.69% reduction in forgetting compared to baseline methods.},

However, determining the optimal number of convolutional and pooling layers in a convolutional neural network (CNN) remains a challenging problem. In addition, the randomness in the query, key, and value vectors of the self-attention mechanism in Transformers can affect their predictive performance. Furthermore, inaccuracies in the calculation of the membership matrix in fuzzy $C$-means clustering (FCM) can impact clustering effectiveness. To address these issues, this article introduces an adaptive CNN-Transformer multivariate prediction model based on discriminative fuzzy $C$-means clustering (DFCM), referred to as DFCM-A-CNN-Transformer. First, by considering the membership degree of similar samples belonging to the same cluster, DFCM is designed to resolve inaccuracies in the computation of the membership degree matrix. Next, a system is developed to simultaneously determine the value of $k$ and the number of clusters in the $k$-nearest neighbor algorithm, thereby completing feature selection. Subsequently, the number of convolutional and pooling layers is adaptively determined based on data characteristics and dynamic stopping conditions. The query, key, and value vectors of the self-attention mechanism in the Transformer are then determined based on the output of the CNN. Finally, the superiority and effectiveness of the proposed model are validated through comparative experiments with six other models on eight datasets.},

  abstract     = {Test-time adaptation (TTA) leverages real-time updates with test samples to effectively address distribution shifts. Previous TTA methods have achieved stable results in scenarios with continual distribution change through techniques such as teacher-student model distillation and image augmentation. However, these test-time adaptation methods are primarily designed for scenarios with balanced class distributions. Yet, in practical applications, having imbalanced classes is more common, which can present a significant challenge. In test data streams characterized by distribution shifts and class imbalances, continual updates can cause the model to become biased towards extreme samples, reducing overall performance. There have only been a few attempts to reduce this influence—generally by sampling from imbalanced test streams to create a more balanced distribution. However, even with these strategies, the models still suffer from biases toward certain categories when the class imbalance is extreme. To overcome the influence of class imbalance in dynamic settings, we propose a Fuzzy Rule-based Test-Time Adaptation method (FTTA). The method incorporates fuzzy rules that allow weights to be assigned to each sample based on its degree of membership in different categories, which helps alleviate the problem of neglecting minor categories in traditional hard categorization methods. By using fuzzy rules, FTTA guides the model to select particular updates. Thus, it prevents the model from excessively favoring specific samples during iterative updates and maintains balance throughout the update process, improving overall accuracy and robustness. Experiments with five datasets in four-class imbalanced continual dynamic scenarios validate the proposed method with FTTA consistently achieving state-of-the-art performance.},

The proposed approach fully utilizes two fundamental modeling pursuits based on fuzzy rule-based models and neural networks. We take advantages of the unique capabilities of fuzzy rule-based models to characterize the nonlinear relationship between the acquired bioimpedance signals and their temporal coordinates. The fuzzy modeling approach is used to approximate the process that generates the bioimpedance signals through a collection of rules (if–then statements). In the sequel, the parameters of the models are used as the inputs of neural network models to determine the position of characteristic points. We further augment the numeric neural network to its granular counterpart to accommodate the uncertainty in the available experimental evidence by allocating a certain level of information granularity across the parameter space. The resulting granular outputs (intervals) become reflective of the quality and level of confidence associated with the prediction results. The quality of the prediction results is quantified in terms of the coverage and specificity criteria. The performance index is also enhanced to deal with the situation when the positions provided by experts are also information granules (intervals). The performance of the proposed approach is justified through a collection of experiments carried out on the collected real-world bioimpedance signals. Experimental results show that the proposed approach achieved higher accuracy in determining the position of characteristic points in comparison with other existing methods.},

However, practical applications are often limited by low adaptability in grasping, complex control, and feedback difficulties. To address these challenges, this work designs a prosthetic hand with a rigid-flexible coupling structure, demonstrating promising adaptability in grasping. It can successfully grasp objects with common shapes, materials, and stiffness. To realize intuitive feedback, the prosthetic hand utilizes a skin-stretching actuator array to simulate the tactile feedback experienced when a normal human hand grasps a heavy object with the palm oriented downward. The fuzzy control encodes the actuator array to provide the user with information such as grasping location, stability, and force level, thus allowing the user to control the motion of the prosthetic hand more intuitively. The array of actuators enables the user to perceive the grasping state of all fingers and lowers the user's threshold of understanding based on fuzzy control, facilitating quicker and easier understanding of the grasping situation. Additionally, for bidirectional control, this prosthetic hand enables neural control using electromyographic (EMG) signals obtained from the proximal surface of the forearm. The EMG sensor's acquisition sites are optimized, and real-time bidirectional demonstration is achieved. This study paves the way for high-performance bionic prosthetics and proposes a novel tactile feedback system with easier understood cascaded spatiotemporal type-2 fuzzy tactile control mapping.},

The sEMG signals provide information about the electrical activity of muscle contractions, while the FMG signals monitor morphological changes in the muscles, all in a noninvasive manner. We developed a portable, wearable hybrid sEMG-FMG acquisition system, consisting of a signal acquisition module and an armband to gather both types of signals from the same skin area. Using this system, we examined the sensitivity of sEMG and FMG signals to muscle fatigue and assessed whether combining these two signals could mitigate the effects of muscle fatigue on gesture recognition accuracy. The sEMG and FMG signals were recorded during various hand gestures under both fatigued and nonfatigued conditions. Additionally, a cascade fuzzy forest (CFF) algorithm was developed to enhance hand motion recognition accuracy using the combined sEMG-FMG signals. Experimental results show that FMG signals are resilient to muscle fatigue, and the integration of sEMG with FMG signals significantly reduces the adverse effects of muscle fatigue. The CFF algorithm further improves recognition accuracy, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

  abstract     = {The widespread use of electronic devices has contributed to an increase in poor posture, particularly when it comes to the cervical spine, leading to various cervical vertebral pain disorders. In this article, we focus on accurately monitoring the motion status of the cervical spine using the accelerometers and gyroscope sensors embedded in earphones. Our aim is to gain a better understanding of cervical spine health. To address the individual differences among subjects, we introduce fuzzy rules to the Re-ISDA method, proposing a novel approach known as FuzRe-ISDA. Unlike traditional domain adaptation methods, the FuzRe-ISDA method offers flexibility in adjusting the contribution from different source domains. It takes into account the collective impact of multiple models on predicting new user behavior. Moreover, this method can quickly adapt to new users without requiring extensive datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that our FuzRe-ISDA approach outperforms popular domain adaptation methods in terms of accuracy when predicting cervical motion. This highlights the effectiveness of our approach in addressing individual differences and improving the reliability of cervical spine motion prediction.},

A deep spiking high-dimensional fuzzy network (DSHTFN) algorithm is specifically designed to analyze the “3S” grasping states of soft manipulators—shaking, stable, and slipping—with greater depth and precision. A novel membership function, the Bernoulli-Arctangent (B-Atan) function, has been designed to accommodate the unique characteristics of spiking input signals and support backpropagation capabilities. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method achieves accuracies of 95.66% and 96.05% in opposing-finger and three-fingered soft manipulator operations, respectively. Through comparative analysis with other algorithms, the superior performance of the B-Atan membership function and the DSHTFN approach in analyzing the grasping states of soft manipulators has been validated.},

The hand, as a primary interaction tool, conveys information through gestures and tactile signals. With advancements in flexible electronics and fuzzy systems, it is now possible to achieve interpretable and accurate interactions using hand gestures and tactile information. This article introduces a fuzzy-encoded, dual-modal soft glove applied to gesture and grasping object classification. The glove, featuring 10 soft pressure sensors and 6 soft bending sensors, is compactly designed and exhibits excellent sensitivity, with average sensitivities of 133 N$^{-1}$ for soft pressure sensors and 13°$^{-1}$ for soft bending sensors. The fuzzy Mamba encoding classification algorithm, inspired by the interpretability and uncertainty resilience of fuzzy systems and the fitting ability of state-space models, was developed. To the best of authors’ knowledge, this work is the first to combine the Mamba structure with fuzzy intelligent systems. Applied to gesture and grasping object classifications, the glove achieved average accuracies of 96.3% and 94.9%, respectively. The fuzzy encoding leverages membership vectors provided by experts to enhance interpretability. These results demonstrate the glove’s effectiveness in signal recording and processing and highlight the powerful synergy between flexible electronic technologies and fuzzy systems.},

In this article, a novel drift decoupling-based variational adaptation network (DD-VAN) is proposed for FDA, allowing for the learning of intradomain evolutionary patterns and interdomain uncertainties. The DD-VAN algorithm is implemented in three main steps: 1) An intradomain evolutionary trend modeling module is first employed to capture unknown temporal variations through an autoencoder architecture with variational inference; 2) a prototype-assisted fuzzy clustering module is used to estimate the membership degree of the target data, characterizing the inherent uncertainty and imprecision present in real-world distributions; and 3) a membership-aware domain fuzzy matching module is utilized to learn the gradual transitions between category-related data pairs in the source and target domains by introducing uncertainties. Furthermore, it is theoretically demonstrated that the inferred posterior distributions of latent codes can be optimized to align with the corresponding prior distributions by minimizing the Kullback–Leibler divergence. Extensive experiments are conducted on cross-domain tasks involving both synthetic and real-world datasets, and the experimental results suggest that the DD-VAN algorithm outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.},

This approach elevates values of membership function above a threshold $\alpha$ to 1, reduces those below $\beta$ to 0, and assigns the remaining ones to an intermediate value m. A key challenge lies in determining the thresholds $\alpha$ and $\beta$ and selecting the value of m, as existing models often lack analytical solutions and fail to fully explore the relationship between m and membership structures. This study introduces an asymmetric three-way approximation model for fuzzy sets, removing the constraint $\alpha + \beta = 1$. Analytical formulas are derived for the thresholds $ \alpha $ and $ \beta $ by minimizing information loss, and the relationship between m and membership structures is thoroughly examined. An adaptive optimizer is proposed to learn the approximate optimal value of m by minimizing the information loss. The experimental results show that information loss decreases initially before increasing as m grows. Besides, our model achieves the best classification across most datasets.},

To address these challenges, a framework of fuzzy hierarchical SCNs (FHSCNs) is proposed, which consists of a slow feature extraction block, a fuzzy inference block and an enhanced output block. The slow feature extraction block is designed, which utilizes a autoencoder based on two SCNs with shared-parameters and the incremental learning paradigm of SCNs to efficiently and adaptively extract the slow-varying latent features.

The fuzzy inference block can allow the model to have the fuzzy reasoning capabilities and improve the model interpretability.

It then employs the proposed misclassification-error-inspired learning to accomplish its ensemble learning by training the consequents of all fuzzy rules of each TSK fuzzy subclassifier in a multiview learning way with the simplest averaging aggregation. As a result, the misclassification error caused by such an ensemble learning of fuzzy subclassifiers is theoretically upper bounded. MEI-TSK also features the use of both Bernoulli random feature selection and random feature permutation. The permuted features can be conveniently useful for determining all the antecedents of fuzzy rules with diversity guarantee among all the subclassifiers, and accordingly, be discarded after ensemble learning, resulting in shorter fuzzy rules and improved generalization capability.

This article develops a fuzzy inverse reinforcement learning optimal control scheme with inverse reinforcement learning algorithm for Takagi–Sugeno (T–S) fuzzy systems with disturbances. Since the controlled fuzzy systems (learner systems) desire to learn or imitate expert system's behavior trajectories, a learner–expert structure is established, where the learner only know the expert system's optimal control policy. To reconstruct expert system's cost function, we develop a model-free inverse Q-learning algorithm that consists of two learning stages: an inner Q-learning iteration loop and an outer inverse optimal iteration loop. The inner loop aims to find fuzzy optimal control policy and the worst-case disturbance input via learner system's cost function by employing zero-sum differential game theory. The outer one is to update learner system's state-penalty weight via only observing expert systems' optimal control policy. The model-free algorithm does not require that the controlled system dynamics are known. It is proved that the designed algorithm is convergent and also the developed inverse reinforcement learning optimal control policy can ensure T–S fuzzy learner system to obtain Nash equilibrium solution. Finally, we apply the presented fuzzy inverse Q-learning optimal control method to nonlinear unmanned surface vehicle system and the computer simulation results verified the effectiveness of the developed scheme.},

In addition, the application of communication theory to the CRP has rarely been considered. This article is devoted to building a fuzzy opinion dynamics-driven consensus model through the detection of hybrid mesoscale structures. First, this article proposes a novel mesoscale structure detection method that can detect both overlapping community structures and core–periphery structures in the STN. Then, to capture the opinion dynamics process under hybrid mesoscale structures, this article improves the opinion dynamics model by delineating five categories of nodes. Considering the dynamic changes of the CRP, a consensus feedback mechanism driven by opinion dynamics is proposed. In addition, the opinion adjustment is based on the “Spiral of Silence Theory.” Finally, the practicality of the proposed model is illustrated through an example. The superiority of the new detection algorithm and the efficiency of the novel consensus model are demonstrated through comparative analysis.},

  abstract     = {Traditional partition-based fuzzy clustering algorithms are widely used for revealing possible hidden structures in data. However, high computational cost limits their applications in large-scale and high-dimensional data. Moreover, most fuzzy clustering algorithms are sensitive to noise. To tackle these issues, a robust jointly sparse fast fuzzy clustering algorithm via anchor graph (RSFCAG) is proposed and analyzed in this article. Specifically, we first propose a fast k-means method integrated shadowed set and balanced ternary tree, which serves as a fast hierarchical clustering approach by partitioning every cluster into three subclusters at each layer (3KHK). 3KHK can quickly obtain the anchor set and its optimization is solved fast by the simplex method, which also captures the ambiguity and uncertainty between clusters in large-scale clustering tasks. Second, a similarity matrix learning approach based on possibilistic neighbors is further proposed to get a robust similarity graph, which strengthens the ability of fuzzy clustering to handle large-scale data. Furthermore, the orthogonal projection matrix is integrated into the RSFCAG framework to transform the original high-dimensional space into low-dimensional space. Finally, the $L_{2,1}$-norm loss and regularization are integrated into the joint algorithm RSFCAG, which is solved optimally by block coordinate technique, to enhance the robustness and interpretability of the fuzzy clustering process. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed method in most of benchmark datasets.},

  abstract     = {To address the problem of robust stability analysis for interval type-2 fuzzy systems (IT2FSs), this article proposes an innovative analysis approach based on model transformation. First, a classical piecewise linear approximation method is utilized to process the upper boundary membership functions and lower boundary membership functions of the footprint of uncertainty in IT2FSs, resulting in linear boundary membership functions (MFs) that are more convenient for analysis, along with the corresponding approximation error functions. Subsequently, a novel error model transformation method is introduced to handle these error terms. By constructing new fuzzy rules and MFs, the boundary error terms are converted into a new fuzzy model, thereby incorporating more information about the error functions into the stability analysis. Based on this model, a robust stability condition in the form of linear matrix inequalities are derived, achieving improved robustness. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is validated through simulations on real-world systems, and its superiority is demonstrated by comparison with existing methods.},

The issue is how to construct a tracking controller to ensure that the tracking error converges to an adjustable region around the origin in a fixed time. This article develops an adaptive fixed-time control strategy by employing fuzzy logic system to approximate the unknown function terms and the nonlinear growth assumption often used in unknown systems is eliminated.

  abstract     = {With the rapid advancement of data acquisition technologies, multiview data have been widely applied in fields such as social networks, computer vision, and natural language processing. Multiview data typically contain information arising from different views or sensors, offering more perspectives for observation. The multiview nature also brings challenges, such as high dimensionality, noise, heterogeneity, and redundancy. Particularly, in scenarios with limited labeled data, traditional single-view learning methods often struggle to handle these complex issues. To address this, this article proposes an unsupervised multiview learning framework that integrates Takagi–Sugeno–Kang fuzzy systems and graph-based adaptive regularization (MvTSK-GAR) to handle the heterogeneity and redundancy in multiview data effectively. Specifically, this article first captures the uncertainty in multiview data through fuzzy rules and models the structural relationships between the data using graph-based adaptive regularization. The framework does not rely on a large amount of labeled data. Instead, it integrates complementary information coming from different views to automatically mine latent patterns, thus generating more accurate and stable data representations. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework performs well in various real-world applications, particularly excelling in high-dimensional data processing and noise reduction. Good performance in multiple publicly available datasets validates the effectiveness of our approach.},

To address these issues, we propose an online streaming feature selection method based on label enhancement and fuzzy synergistic discrimination information. First, we define a novel label enhancement method based on label correlation, which does not require any prior knowledge of feature space. Second, we propose a new measure to evaluate the discriminative ability of multiple feature subsets for labels in fuzzy environment, called fuzzy synergistic discrimination information. It is bounded and has many interesting properties. The fuzzy synergistic discrimination information is computed directly based on fuzzy similarity relations, so the calculation is relatively simple. Third, based on label enhancement and proposed fuzzy synergistic discrimination information, we construct a three-stage online multilabel streaming feature selection method, including online significance analysis, online relevance analysis, and online redundancy analysis. Finally, comparative experiments on 12 datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method. The influences of different feature sequences and these components on the algorithm's performance are further analyzed.},

  abstract     = {Manipulability optimization plays a crucial role in the motion control of omni-directional mobile redundant manipulator (OMRM), since it can reduce the risk of the OMRM to enter into singular postures. However, manipulability is a nonlinear nonconvex function with respect to the joint variables, and thus its efficient optimization is a challenge. In addition, existing manipulability optimization methods rarely consider obstacle avoidance. To solve these limitations, a time-varying quadratic programming problem-based manipulability-optimized obstacle avoidance scheme is proposed, which no longer approximates obstacles as a single point and avoids singularity in the motion control process. To address the problem that the traditional neural network with fixed convergence parameters is not accurate enough for system disturbance or external noise, this article proposes an antinoise disturbance fuzzy neural dynamics (AND-FND) model. The model adapts the fuzzy parameters and convergence rate based on error fluctuations, enhancing both robustness and adaptability. Notably, the AND-FND model utilizes membership functions and rules to describe controller parameter variations due to external disturbances and operational complexity. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that the AND-FND model possesses global convergence and strong robustness. Numerical results and physical experiments demonstrate the practicability and advantages of the proposed method compared to the existing techniques.},

To address this issue, we first evaluate the similarity of the probabilistic component of PHFSs and incorporate this value as a coefficient in the similarity measure formula for the hesitant fuzzy component. This approach yields a comprehensive similarity measure that effectively captures both probabilistic and hesitant fuzzy aspects of PHFSs. Building on this framework, we refine traditional set-based similarity measures—Jaccard, Dice, and Cosine—for PHFSs and introduce layered set-based similarity measures (LSSMs), which externally integrate distinct semantic components. The effectiveness of LSSM is demonstrated by extending the CRITIC technique for decision-making, allowing for the determination of criteria weights even when information is incomplete or uncertain. We further validate the proposed measures using Spearman's correlation coefficient to analyze ranking stability and context sensitivity, facilitating their selection for specific decision scenarios. Finally, we apply the developed measures to optimize electric vehicle charging infrastructure in a large-scale problem, showcasing their practical applicability.},

However, their performance often deteriorates when the input data is affected by noise. To overcome this limitation, this study leverages the robustness of granular-ball computing (GBC) against noise to develop more effective classification models by integrating GBC with TWSVM and FTSVM. First, we introduce the granular-ball TWSVM (GBTWSVM) classifier, which incorporates GBC with the TWSVM framework. By replacing traditional point-wise inputs with granular-ball representations, we derive a pair of nonparallel hyperplanes for the GBTWSVM classifier by solving a quadratic programming problem. Afterwards, we develop the granular-ball FTSVM (GBFTSVM) classifier, where the membership and nonmembership functions of granular-balls are defined using Pythagorean fuzzy sets, enabling a more nuanced differentiation of the contributions of granular-balls from distinct regions within the input space. By incorporating these functions into the FTSVM framework, we derive a pair of nonparallel hyperplanes for the GBFTSVM classifier through the solution of a quadratic programming problem. Finally, we present algorithms for the GBTWSVM and GBFTSVM classifiers and evaluate their performance on 21 benchmark datasets. Experimental results demonstrate the superior scalability, computational efficiency, and robustness of the proposed classifiers in pattern recognition, highlighting their potential as advanced tools for noise-tolerant classification.},

  abstract     = {This article investigates the secure leader–following consensus of multiagent systems with unknown follower dynamics under two types of denial-of-service attacks: connectivity-maintained and connectivity-broken attacks. A predefined-time resilient distributed observer to achieve predefined-time observation of the leader's state is constructed by incorporating a time-varying piecewise function with an online update at the initial instant. During the connectivity-maintained intervals, all agents can achieve predefined-time observation of the leader. During the connectivity-broken intervals, agents that have direct or indirect access to the leader's state can still accomplish the predefined-time observation. Since the leader state observation cannot be ensured for all agents during the connectivity-broken intervals, a new persistent dwell-time switching model is introduced to describe the switching between the two types of attacks, and novel sufficient conditions are derived to ensure that all agents can observe the leader's state based on multiple Lyapunov function approach. Furthermore, a predefined-time sliding mode controller combining the resilient distributed observer and fuzzy reinforcement learning strategy is proposed to ensure leader–following consensus. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is validated through simulations and comparisons using a distributed multiple robot arm system.},

  abstract     = {This article focuses on the prescribed-time fully distributed Nash equilibrium seeking (PT-FDNES) against denial-of-service attacks of multiagent systems (MASs), where the action of each agent is described by high-order uncertain nonlinear dynamics. Specifically, the fuzzy logic system technique is utilized to approximate the unknown nonlinear functions existing in the agents' dynamics, where a single parameter updating law is proposed by estimating the norm of fuzzy optimal weight vectors to further reduce the computational cost. To deal with the difficulty where the attack-induced topologies may destabilize the NE seeking performance, a novel PT function together with a resetting mechanism is delicately designed. Then, a PT-FDNES with adaptive gains is developed by incorporating the resetting mechanism to search for the NE independent of any global information. Subsequently, a novel PT fuzzy adaptive tracking control law is designed in the celebrated backstepping structure. Based on the Lyapunov stability theory, we prove that actions of the MAS converge to the NE within the PT and all the closed-loop system signals remain bounded. At last, an example is given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.},

To derive the optimal policies, a single-critic network architecture under the framework of reinforcement learning is constructed. Meanwhile, a fuzzy logic-based control policy is designed to handle the dynamical uncertainty issue aroused from the unmodeled dynamics.

  abstract     = {High-dimensional data regression presents significant challenges due to factors such as strong nonlinearity among features, an excessive number of intermediate variables, and rule explosion, all of which hinder the model's ability to capture complex features and achieve low regression accuracy. This article proposes a method for high-dimensional data regression using a hierarchical fuzzy topological system (HFTS). The HFTS adopts a modular design, where each layer consists of an independent fuzzy logic system, enabling flexible operation based on feature distribution and output requirements. It utilizes a graph neural network based hierarchical feature classification approach to group high-dimensional data, mapping features into nodes and establishing edges based on similarity. This process creates a topological structure that facilitates high-density feature representation through neighborhood aggregation. HFTS introduces a cross-layer rule-sharing mechanism and an interpolation expansion algorithm to smooth fuzzy rules, thereby reducing interaction complexity. Additionally, an adaptive weight adjustment strategy dynamically optimizes feature importance, enhancing both robustness and predictive accuracy. When applied to eleven KEEL regression datasets, HFTS demonstrates superior accuracy, effectively addressing high-dimensional interactions while maintaining a balance between interpretability and performance.},

Subsequently, with the help of the prescribed-time scaling function and the barrier function, the problem of deferred output constraint is reformulated as a boundedness problem of the new variable. By introducing several useful lemmas, the designed controller can ensure that the closed-loop signals are bounded in the presence of actuator fault in the system.

This model adeptly characterizes the distribution patterns of data points. First, we employ entropy function and their complementary function as measurement tools to accurately quantify the inherent uncertainty in data with different distributions, and considers the sum of the two as a comprehensive representation of the overall uncertainty of the information source. Subsequently, an outlier score model is constructed based on MGIS, which can deeply characterize the degree of outlierness of samples, thereby effectively identifying abnormal points in the dataset. During validation, ODMGIS was rigorously tested on practical datasets from medicine and bioinformatics, and its performance was benchmarked against both traditional and the state-of-the-art algorithms, showcasing substantial benefits. This research not only contributes a fresh perspective to outlier detection, but also sparks innovative avenues for exploring and advancing the granular computing theory.},

Deep learning methods have demonstrated state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in the field of time series prediction. However, time series data from complex industrial scenarios often contain substantial uncertainty. This makes it difficult for deterministic deep learning models to achieve accurate predictions. Moreover, existing static methods often fail to meet the real-time requirements of industrial environments. To address the challenges, this study introduces fuzzy learning into deep learning models to overcome the drawbacks of fixed model representations. Therefore, we propose a fuzzy dynamic transformer (FDformer) that can adaptively adjust network depth according to the complexity of individual samples. Subsequently, we design a fuzzy feature extraction mechanism to capture feature information within the fuzzy membership degree, enabling the feature-level fusion of the fuzzy representation with the dynamic depth representation. Finally, we propose a training method for dynamically allocating loss weights, emphasizing the contribution of various samples to different exits, thereby improving the performance of time-series dynamic networks.

Precise delineation of the Gross Tumor Volume (GTV) plays a pivotal role in ensuring effective radiotherapy for pancreatic cancer. Although recent methods have achieved promising results in GTV segmentation, it remains challenging to generalize from one domain to another, especially when the target domain is a different modality with severe domain shifts. To address this challenge, we propose a novel active domain adaptation framework to enhance domain adaptation for GTV segmentation. Specifically, we refer to the latent feature space of the synthesized target domain to select domain-specific representative samples from a specific target domain for annotation and model fine-tuning. To suppress noise and enhance the edge information, we decouple the network into an additional edge regression task that is used to further mine the contextual information of the edge pixels. Experiments on our self-collected pancreas tumor dataset and a public dataset show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a significant margin, achieving an average Dice score improvement of 2.16% and 1.86% in the two target domains on the pancreas tumor dataset, respectively.},

  abstract     = {Biselection (feature and sample selection) enhances the efficiency and accuracy of machine learning models when handling large-scale data. Fuzzy rough sets, an uncertainty mathematical model known for its excellent interpretability, are widely used in machine learning, particularly for feature selection. While the consistent matrix has significantly improved the computational efficiency and scalability of feature selection, like most fuzzy rough set-based methods, it focuses only on feature selection and seldom incorporates sample selection. This feature-centric approach can limit classification performance, particularly in noisy and large-scale datasets where both features and samples require judicious selection. To overcome these limitations, this article explores the integration of sample selection with feature selection. First, we introduce a $\beta$-consistent granulation method to generate more accurate and concise fuzzy information granules. In addition, a novel membership function is employed to distinguish noise samples and irrelevant features simultaneously. As a result, a biselection algorithm with lower computational complexity is proposed to select high-quality features and samples. Numerical experiments demonstrate that, compared to eleven representative algorithms, our proposed method achieves an average accuracy improvement of 9.66% and a 933-fold increase in efficiency.},

The research involving co-clustering and kernel function is still in the initial stage. In this article, we proposed the first kernel-based algorithms that can learn the width hyperparameter of the Gaussian kernel automatically for hard and fuzzy co-clustering. The main advantages of the proposed methods are that there is no need for a previous additional step to tune the width hyperparameter, and we consider width hyperparameters that are the same for all clusters, varying only with respect to objects or variables (global methods), or they can also vary across clusters (local methods). As a consequence, our methods can rescale the objects and variables separately, according to their distribution, and in the local case, also according to the distribution in each variable cluster and object cluster, respectively. Experiments conducted over 14 real datasets, and compared with traditional clustering methods and previous state-of-the-art co-clustering algorithms, showed the efficiency of the proposed algorithms.},

  abstract     = {This article investigates the event-triggered $\mathcal {H}_{\infty }$ filtering problem for interval type-2 fuzzy networked control systems with data loss. The goal of this article is to design an event-triggered fuzzy filter with adjustable gains to further improve the $\mathcal {H}_{\infty }$ performance of the filtering error system (FES) while saving communication resources. First, an adaptive event-triggered mechanism (ETM) that utilizes the average filtering error to adaptively adjust the triggered threshold is proposed to mitigate network congestion. In contrast to the existing filtering achievements, the proposed adaptive ETM considers the impact of filtering error on data transmission which can achieve the effect of saving more communication resources. Then, an interval stability theory is applied to adjust the filter gains for achieving the purposes of changing the convergence speed of the FES and improving the $\mathcal {H}_{\infty }$ performance. Moreover, under the conditions of imperfect communication links, sufficient criteria for designing the $\mathcal {H}_{\infty }$ filter with adjustable gains are obtained based on the interval stability theory and linear matrix inequalities technique. Finally, the simulation results are utilized for demonstrating the feasibility of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {Broad learning system (BLS) is renowned for its excellent generalization and high efficiency in data classification. However, when confronted with class imbalance problems, BLS treats all samples as equally important, resulting in performance degradation. In addition, the presence of noise and outliers in imbalanced data further complicates BLS's ability to handle real-world classification problems. To address these challenges, this article proposes a graph-embedding intuitionistic fuzzy adaptive broad learning system (GEIB). The graph embedding strategy proposed by GEIB leverages the geometric topology of the data and class-specific information, effectively capturing variability among imbalanced samples and improving class separability. Furthermore, we introduce intuitionistic fuzzy theory. The BLS integrated with it considers both the homogeneity and heterogeneity of sample neighborhoods, enabling it to address uncertainty and imprecision in the data. It further differentiates clean samples from noisy ones in imbalanced datasets, thereby enhancing model robustness. To further investigate the prior distribution information of imbalanced data, we design an adaptive class-specific penalty mechanism based on global distribution and local density information. This mechanism accounts for both intraclass and interclass density information and class global distribution. We verify the superiority of our method by conducting a comparison with current approaches using real-world datasets that include both Gaussian noise and noise-free versions.},

  abstract     = {This article introduces a novel extension of the multivariate variational mode decomposition (MVMD) method, termed fuzzy MVMD (FMVMD), designed to enhance alignment information extraction. In contrast to MVMD, FMVMD focuses on capturing finer alignment details by leveraging fuzzy clustering techniques. The proposed FMVMD algorithm proceeds through the following steps: First, FMVMD employs a modified clustering algorithm, termed fuzzy C-means (FCM), to categorize submodes within each channel into fuzzy clusters based on their contribution to common center frequencies. Second, a variational optimization model is formulated, extending the principles of MVMD to accommodate the fuzzy clustering approach used in FMVMD. Finally, an optimization technique called the alternating direction method of multipliers is employed to derive the optimal solution for the FMVMD model. Experimental results show that FMVMD achieves a 41% and 28% improvement in center frequency alignment performance compared to MVMD when using two and three fuzzy clusters, respectively, and a 13% improvement compared to GMVMD with the same number of clusters. Under a 25 dB SNR condition, FMVMD demonstrates a noise resistance improvement of 44% and 24% compared to MVMD with two and three fuzzy clusters, respectively, and a 37% improvement compared to GMVMD. Validation using EEG data in the forms of bipolar leads and common average reference confirms the effectiveness of FMVMD, achieving consistently favorable results.},

The nonlinear plant with parameter uncertainty is represented by an interval type-2 fuzzy model, where the membership functions of the fuzzy rules are related to the system mode. Since sojourn information is challenging to obtain in practice, the sojourn time probability density function is considered to be incompletely available. The considered system is more general, not only relaxing the traditional assumption that all the sojourn time probability density functions are completely available, but also covering completely available sojourn time probability density functions as a special case. The main innovation is that an observer-based SMC scheme is designed, which makes the discrete nonlinear models have better dynamic performance, and realizes the reachability of discrete quasi-sliding mode. By the interval type-2 fuzzy and classical Lyapunov function, the mean-square stability criterion of the semi-Markov jump models is constructed employing additional matrix variables. Then, an observer-based SMC mechanism is constructed to achieve the reachability of the quasi-sliding mode.

However, reliably utilizing the minimal point-wise annotations for unlabeled data in complex and large-scale scenes is still challenging, such as only 20 points labeled in 2 million points. To tackle this challenge, we propose a new Uncertainty-aware Superpoint Graph Transformer (UaSGT) framework that utilizes minimal annotations for unlabeled data learning through reliable long-range supervision propagation from labeled superpoints to unlabeled superpoints. First, we propose a superpoint graph transformer to achieve long-range supervision propagation along the attention-based fuzzy subsets defined on superpoints. The attention-based fuzzy subset measures the membership of unlabeled superpoints to clusters centered on labeled superpoints. Second, we employ an uncertainty-aware membership rectification technique on the fuzzy subset to ensure reliable propagation among superpoints within the same category. This technique integrates an uncertainty prediction module to mask the influence of unreliable membership and a spatial prior refinement module to reduce uncertainty in intraclass membership degrees. Finally, experimental results on two large-scale benchmarks S3DIS and ScanNet-V2 demonstrate the superiority of our approach compared to the state-of-the-art with at least 90% annotation reduction, and our method also achieves comparable performance to fully supervised methods with less than 0.1% labeled points.},

Second, to alleviate communication overhead and reduce control frequency, an event-triggered impulse strategy is implemented. This strategy activates impulse control only under specific conditions, effectively minimizing control actions while maintaining system consensus. Using Lyapunov stability theory, sufficient conditions for achieving system consensus are established, demonstrating the global consensus and robustness of the MASs under certain criteria.

However, MPSTTs are prone to fuzziness owing to coordinate coupled and Gaussian truncation errors. To address these challenges, we propose a high-precision robust tracker that uses divide-and-conquer multiple-importance Kalman filtering (DCMIKF) via a fuzzy measure. Specifically, we designed coupling maneuver models and attached their model-truth probabilities as a fuzzy set. The measurements-to-target data association was then formulated as a fuzzy maxima searching problem with soft spatiotemporal causal constraints. The proposed approach enables the integration of all available information to derive the fuzzy measure, dividing the hybrid state estimation into variable-structure model estimation and model-conditioned filtering. Simultaneously, DCMIKF combines importance prediction with constrained convex measurement updating using KF and fuses the outputs via fuzzy model probability. Besides, it offers a purely mathematical approach for quantifying the average fuzziness yielded from the fuzzy set, thereby smoothing the mismatches between multilikelihoods, proposal distribution, and target posterior. Simulated and measured results conformed well; compared with the regression Gaussian process motion tracker, DCMIKF overcame the prior hypotheses in machine learning, reducing the problematic cubic complexity in the number of time steps to the linear time complexity; compared to the interacting multiple model minimax particle filter, DCMIKF significantly improves filtering accuracy and tracking robustness.},

To address this issue, source-free domain adaptation has been proposed and subsequently developed.

Alongside this, another underexplored problem is feature heterogeneity across multiple source domains. In this article, we propose a fuzzy domain adaptation method, fuzzy heterogeneous domain adaptation (FuzHDA), that learns fuzzy rules from heterogeneous teacher models, even when these models are black boxes. The proposed method first trains heterogeneous source models privately on individual devices without sharing any information, including neither data nor model parameters. Then, using a memory bank that stores all target predictions from the pretrained source models, we apply a self-knowledge distillation approach to train a target model, which simulates the predictions from these heterogeneous source teachers. After completing the target model, a cross-modality hybrid model leveraging prompt learning and uncovering causal factors is fine-tuned via self-supervision at the last step to facilitate transfer performance. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed FuzHDA.},

Moreover, multiscale data have received widespread attention due to its rich knowledge representation. However, current research on multiscale data primarily focuses on supervised learning environments, while semisupervised feature selection for multiscale data with limited labels remains inadequately explored. Meanwhile, existing studies on multiscale data often emphasize selecting optimal scales and further conducting feature selection, but this strategy may result in losing potentially valuable information from other scales. To overcome these limitations, by adopting a multiscale fuzzy information fusion mechanism, this article proposes two new semisupervised feature selection approaches for multiscale data with limited labels from both global and local perspectives. Initially, by fusing fuzzy information at various scales, a label learning method is proposed to convert the decision of missing labels into a fuzzy decision of label distribution. Subsequently, label-distributed multiscale fuzzy global and local rough sets are constructed from global and local perspectives, respectively. Based on the two models, two semisupervised feature selection algorithms are developed based on global and local multiscale fuzzy information fusion. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to other advanced feature selection algorithms, the two proposed algorithms can effectively handle multiscale data with limited labels and exhibit superior classification performance, computational efficiency, and robustness.},

  abstract     = {The air suspension is an advanced suspension system for vibration suppression of vehicles. However, the real-time controllability of the air suspension is weak due to the time-delay characteristics of the air spring. This study designs a novel magnetorheological semiactive air suspension (MSAS) system and examines the fault characteristics of the MSAS system to improve the performance of vibration suppression. First, the generalized fuzzy hysteresis model is novelly proposed to approximate the hysteresis nonlinearity of the magnetorheological fluid damper. Then, the MSAS model with various fault modes is constructed to study the dynamic performance of the MSAS system under different fault modes. Furthermore, the intermediate estimator is adopted to detect the generation of the sensor and actuator faults. Based on the fault estimation, a reinforcement learning-based fault-tolerant (RLF) controller is proposed to improve the dynamic performance of the MSAS system. Moreover, a double wishbone suspension is built to examine the effectiveness of the proposed RLF controller. Experimental results show that the dynamic performance of the MSAS system with the proposed RLF controller is improved in comparison with the MSAS system with the model-based controllers and the passive suspension.},

Addressing this issue requires a method that effectively balances the competing demands of the speed and precision in the optimization process. Therefore, a tradeoff genetic algorithm (TOGA) is proposed to refine the FGCM optimization process in this article. First, a modified fitness function with a penalty term is designed to improve the convergence rate, which can drive the FGCM population to obtain the optimal solution during the evolutionary process. Second, an adaptive genetic mechanism based on horizontal comparison and longitudinal assessment, is designed to strike a balance between accelerating convergence and avoiding the dilemma of falling into local optima. Finally, in the simulation section, the effectiveness of the proposed method is validated by optimizing FGCM using synthetic datasets and applying it toa spacecraft debris threat avoidance scenario.},

  abstract     = {Granular-ball computing (GBC) proposed by Xia adaptively generates a different neighborhood for each object, resulting in greater generality and flexibility. Moreover, GBC greatly improves the efficiency by replacing point input with granular-ball. However, the current GB-based classifiers rigidly assign a specific class label to each data instance and lacks of the necessary strategies to address uncertain instances. These far-fetched certain classification approachs toward uncertain instances may suffer considerable risks. In this article, we introduce three-way decision (3WD) into GBC to construct a novel three-way decision with fuzzy granular-ball rough sets (3WD-FGBRS) from the perspective of uncertainty. This helps to construct reasonable multigranularity spaces for handling complex decision problems with uncertainty. First, 3WD-FGBRS is constructed in a data-driven method based on fuzziness, which avoids the subjective definition of certain risk parameters when calculating the threshold pairs. Based on 3WD-FGBRS, we further propose a sequential three-way decision with fuzzy granular-ball rough sets (S3WD-FGBRS) and analyze the fuzziness loss of multilevel decision result in S3WD-FGBRS. Then, the optimal granular-ball space selection mechanism of S3WD-FGBRS is introduced by combining fuzziness and granular-ball space distance. Finally, extensive comparative experiments are conducted with 3 state-of-the-art GB-based classifiers and 3 classical machine learning classifiers on 12 public benchmark datasets. The results show that our models almost outperform other comparison methods in terms of effectiveness, efficiency and robustness.},

  abstract     = {Fuzzy systems have been employed in many fields and achieved remarkable results. However, due to the inherent characteristics, there is still a challenge for them to deal with high-dimensional data which includes a large number of features and becomes very common in the current era of Big Data. Most of the literature employ the product, minimum, softmin and its adaptive versions to compute the firing strengths in fuzzy system modeling, where only the first two are standard T-norms conforming to the theoretical basis of fuzzy logic reasoning. But easy to cause numeric underflow and nondifferentiability are their disadvantages, respectively. To comply with fuzzy theory basis and alleviate the aforementioned predicament of dimensionality, this article investigates how to design high-dimensional Takagi–Sugeno–Kang (TSK) fuzzy system based on Dombi T-norm, which has not been explored for fuzzy system modeling to the best of our knowledge. We first build Dombi T-norm based TSK (DombiTSK) model, then an adaptive strategy is designed for the index parameter of Dombi T-norm to enhance the performance of DombiTSK, which results in so-called adaptive DombiTSK (ADMTSK) fuzzy system. To further improve the design and performance of ADMTSK, we give a novel membership function with positive lower bound to match the use of adaptive Dombi T-norm, which is constructed based on Gaussian membership function (GMF) and named as composite GMF (CGMF). The experiments are conducted on high-dimensional classification datasets with feature dimensions varying from 1024 to 120 432 to evaluate the proposed methodologies. Experimental results verify the advantages of adaptive Dombi T-norm and CGMF. The comparison results and statistical tests among ADMTSK and other state-of-the-art fuzzy algorithms demonstrate that our proposed model outperforms its rivals.},

OSL-FRSCNs integrate the self-organizing learning strategies into FRSCNs, maintaining the model's strong fuzzy inference capabilities while enhancing their continuous learning abilities for nonstationary data streams. The network parameters are updated online using the projection algorithm based on the newly arriving data streams. Moreover, the network structure can be dynamically adjusted in the light of the fuzzy recurrent stochastic configuration (FRSC) algorithm and an improved sensitivity analysis. Comprehensive comparisons over two nonlinear system identification tasks and two industrial applications are carried out. Numerical results clearly demonstrate that the proposed OSL-FRSCNs outperform other neurofuzzy and nonfuzzy models with sound generalization, verifying their effectiveness in modeling nonlinear systems with nonstationary dynamics.},

The effects of both unknown-but-bounded disturbances and faults are taken into account in the state bounding observer design via zonotopic representation of sets, which aims to reduce set operations to simple matrix calculations. Based on the $P\text{-}$radius criterion, the size of the state bounding observers can be minimized via $\mathscr {L}_\infty$ performance to mitigate the effect of unknown-but-bounded disturbances. Moreover, for fault detection purposes, $\mathscr {H}_-$ performance is taken into account to increase the fault sensibility. The proposed multiobjective $\mathscr {H}_-/\mathscr {L}_\infty$ state bounding observer design is reformulated as an optimization problem under linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). As a result, the tradeoff between robustness with respect to uncertainties and fault sensibility can be effectively achieved using standard solvers for LMI constraints. Numerical experiments and suitable comparative studies are performed with a nonlinear autonomous vehicle system to demonstrate the effectiveness and the practical interests of the proposed state bounding TS fuzzy observer design method.},

  abstract     = {Three-way decision (3WD) is a trisecting-and-acting model that is in line with the decision-making logic of human beings. Bayesian risk decision (BRD) theory is a statistical method that optimizes decisions by quantifying and minimizing uncertainty-induced losses. As a typical BRD method, cost-sensitive 3WD aims to reduce decision risks and enhance decision credibility by incorporating an uncertainty decision item, known as boundary decision. However, in most existing 3WD-based multiclassification (MC) models, there is redundancy in both the decision item set and cost matrix, which may lead to decision conflict, ambiguity, and redundancy. Moreover, determining the cost matrix under the intuitionistic fuzzy (IF) environment remains a challenging task. To address these problems, we propose a reliable three-way multiclassification (R3WMC) model under the IF environment. Specifically, an IF cost transformation mechanism is proposed, and a novel boundary decision associated with the corresponding compact cost matrix is established to achieve a conflict-free decision set. Motivated by confidence-based classifiers, we propose an effective decision rule which is time-efficient and able to solve decision conflicts. We also demonstrate that our model is an enhanced BRD model, contributing to a solid theoretical basis for the proposed R3WMC method. Finally, a comparative analysis of multiple models across various datasets validates the reliability and superior performance of our model.},

However, the randomness of BLS brings instability to the training performance of the model, so the hyperparameters of the model are crucial for its performance. Currently, many FBLS use grid search to determine hyperparameters. However, grid search brings longer search time and the parameters obtained have randomness, which may not necessarily be the optimal hyperparameters. In response to these challenges, this paper proposes a fuzzy broad learning system with automatic determination of hyperparameters (ADHFBLS). We construct a novel FBLS based on the interval type-2 fuzzy set and design an incremental learning algorithm for rules and enhancement nodes to support rapid model expansion. Meanwhile, a heuristic hyperparameter automatic optimization algorithm is designed to overcome the randomness and long optimization time of grid search. Experiments have shown that ADHFBLS has higher accuracy and shorter model tuning time compared to some state-of-the-art models based on FBLS.},

Unlike existing containment control protocols that rely on multiple leaders sharing the same system matrices, our approach is applicable to more general systems, where multiple leaders and followers are allowed to be equipped with nonidentical system matrices and even state dimensions. The switching signal of communication graphs is regulated by the random Markov process, and the connectivity assumption is relaxed by merely requiring the union graph of possible subgraphs to be connected. First, new adaptive observers are constructed that can observe leaders' states without access to global topology information, even under randomly switching topologies and DoS attacks. Second, based on fuzzy logic systems and output regulation methods, fuzzy system state estimators are introduced to address challenges associated with unknown nonlinear functions and unmeasurable states of followers. Further, a new fuzzy controller is developed to guarantee the achievement of flexible secure output containment, where containment coefficients no longer depend on the Laplacian matrix and can be flexibly preset to accommodate various tasks. Finally, the theoretical algorithm is validated through simulation results.},

By leveraging fuzzy logic, the fuzzy attention layer learns and identifies interpretable patterns of neural activity. This addresses a significant challenge in using transformers: the lack of transparency in determining which specific brain activities most contribute to particular predictions. Our experimental results, obtained from fNIRS data engaged in social interactions involving handholding, reveal that the fuzzy attention layer not only learns interpretable patterns of neural activity but also enhances model performance. In addition, these patterns provide deeper insights into the neural correlates of interpersonal touch and emotional exchange.

  abstract     = {Sequential three-way decision (S3WD) is an efficient granular computing paradigm for dealing with uncertain problems. However, it is primarily oriented to all decision classes, which contradicts the fact that decisions are typically for the specific decision classes. Meanwhile, most S3WD models hide the topological structure of the granules, leading to difficulties in semantic interpretation. To address the issues, integrating model construction, attribute reduction and knowledge extraction, a general framework of granular sequential three-way decision for the specific decision classes is proposed to improve semantic interpretation and computational efficiency. First, a two-stage trisecting strategy and a GrS3WD model are proposed to integrate model construction with attribute reduction. Its main advantage is that it retains the topological structure of granules, which not only enhances semantic interpretation, but also avoids unnecessary double counting. Second, three acceleration strategies and a novel granular sequential three-way reduction (GrS3WR) algorithm are proposed to fast obtain a classification-based reduct or a class-specific reduct. Finally, the decision rules with multigranularity can be directly extracted from the concept tree generated by GrS3WR. Experimental results demonstrate that a class-specific reduct usually has fewer attributes and better classification performance than a classification-based reduct. Moreover, GrS3WR can significantly improve the computational efficiency of attribute reduction.},

By establishing a nonquadratic cost function, the constrained $H_{\infty }$ control problem is converted into zero-sum game and Hamilton–Jacobi–Isaacs equation (HJIE) is derived. To solve the HJIE, the ADP algorithm is developed by constructing a single-network adaptive critic framework. Assisted by GFHM, the updating process obviates the necessity for the dynamics of unknown nonlinear terms.

To leverage the positivity properties of state, input, and output variables, a novel concept of dissipativity is developed, focusing on linear supply rates and linear copositive storage functionals. When state information is available, the state dependent switching mechanism satisfying a dwell time constraint is introduced dependent on the constructed time-varying multiple linear copositive storage functionals. This mechanism allows for solving the dissipativity issue for the entire system without imposing any solvability requirements on subsystems and reduces the switching frequency. In cases, where state information is unavailable, dissipativity is ensured by a dwell-time dependent switching mechanism. Further, all conditions guaranteeing the solvability of the problem are presented in the form of linear vector inequalities. Two simulation examples are finally offered, demonstrating that the proposed techniques are effective and superior.},

  abstract     = {Online streaming feature selection has garnered widespread attention due to its efficiency and adaptability in dynamic data environments. However, existing methods primarily focus on the correlation and redundancy among features, often overlooking the complementarity between candidate and selected features. In this article, we address this gap by introducing three key innovations. First, we construct a novel metric, fuzzy Gini entropy (FGE), to measure feature uncertainty within datasets. Unlike traditional information entropy, fuzzy Gini entropy inherits the advantages of the Gini index, effectively measuring the impurity of datasets, while also being capable of handling common fuzzy environments. Accordingly, related metrics such as fuzzy joint Gini entropy, fuzzy conditional Gini entropy, and fuzzy mutual Gini information are developed. Second, we innovatively propose the concept of the bidirectional complementarity ratio, which captures the relationship between candidate features and previously selected features in online streaming feature selection. This mitigates the unfairness associated with the late arrival of features, ensuring that candidate features with a bidirectional complementary effect that outweighs their redundancy effect with the selected features are chosen. Third, we design an online streaming feature selection method named FGE-OSFS. The method evaluates streaming features through three steps: Online relevance analysis, online bidirectional complementarity analysis, and online redundancy analysis. Finally, we compare the proposed method with five state-of-the-art online streaming feature selection methods, demonstrating the effectiveness of our new approach.},

Most existing SSL models select the labeled data randomly and equally allocate the labeling quota among the classes, leading to considerable unstableness and degeneration of performance. This study unsupervisedly constructs a leading forest that forms another metric space, based on which it is convenient to define the fuzzy membership function to characterize central and divergent samples and select both types with fuzzy Xor logic. The labeling quota can, thus, be allocated adaptively among different classes. The proposed determinate labeling strategy can generally improve the performance for most SSLs. Especially, when combined with the kernelized large margin component analysis, it produces a novel semisupervised classification model. In addition, the multimodal issue in SSL is effectively addressed by the multigranular structure of leading forest that readily facilitates multiple local metrics learning. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieved competitive efficiency and encouraging accuracy when compared with the state-of-the-art methods.},

Combining adaptive backstepping control and vehicle-to-vehicle communication topology, a prescribed-time fuzzy adaptive cooperative asymptotic tracking control scheme is proposed, which demonstrates all signals of the platoon systems are bounded within a prescribed time, and the velocities of all following vehicles can asymptotically track the leader vehicle with desired safety spacing. Moreover, the formation tracking errors can asymptotically tend to origin within a prescribed time.

The communication quality is reflected by the presence of two channel modes (i.e., “bad” mode and “good” mode), which switch randomly according to a Markov process. In the “bad” mode, packet dropouts are governed by a stochastic variable sequence. Considering the inaccessibility of channel modes, a mode detector is utilized to estimate the communication situation. The relationship between the actual channel mode and the estimated mode is depicted in terms of certain conditional probabilities. Moreover, a comprehensive model is constructed to represent the probability uncertainties arising from statistical errors in channel mode switching, packet dropouts, and mode detection processes. Subsequently, a robust asynchronous PID controller, based on the detected channel mode, is proposed. Sufficient conditions are then derived to ensure the mean-square stability of the closed-loop system while maintaining the desired $H_{\infty }$ performance.

The proliferation of privatization devices has driven the emergence of new challenge in MVFC research works. Federated learning, a technique that can jointly train without directly using raw data, has gain significant attention in decentralized MVFC. However, their applicability depends on the assumptions of data integrity and independence between different views. In fact, while within distributed environments, data typically exhibits two challenging problems: 1) multiple views within a single client; 2) incomplete data. Existing methods exhibit limitations in effectively addressing these challenges. Hence, in this study, we aim at achieving the effective clustering for incomplete data by a novel vertical federated MVFC framework. Specifically, a unified clustering framework is designed to capture both local client learning and global server training. For the local client learning, the data reconstruction strategy and prototype alignment strategy are introduced to ensure the preservation of data structure and refinement of clustering relationships, which mitigates the impact of incomplete data. Meanwhile, the global training process implements aggregation based on client-specific information. The whole process is realized based on the unified fuzzy clustering framework, promoting collaborative learning between client-specific and server information. Theoretical analyses and extensive experiments are carefully conducted to validate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method from multiple perspectives.},

  abstract     = {In this article, the cooperative fuzzy tracking control problem for a type of high-order nonlinear multi-agent systems under the Round-Robin (RR) communication protocol is solved. To effectively reduce the communication among agents, an RR communication protocol is first proposed, where each agent can communicate with only one neighbor at any given time. Based on the developed communication protocol, a hierarchical control approach is introduced, consisting of a distributed observer layer that utilizes information from both local and neighboring agents, and a decentralized control layer that operates solely based on local agent information. Specifically, a distributed observer is designed in the distributed observer layer to achieve the distributed observation objective by introducing a time-varying gain in the observer input. Furthermore, an improved distributed observer with the upper triangular form is constructed to produce a signal with high-order derivatives. In the decentralized control layer, fuzzy adaptive controllers are designed for all agents by using the backstepping technique. By using the Lyapunov stability theory, rigorous stability analysis shows that the cooperative fuzzy tracking control problem is solved under the developed hierarchical control approach. In the end, a simulation example is presented to demonstrate the validity of our proposed method.},

To reduce system performance loss and redundant data transmission under such attacks, a novel adaptive memory event-triggered mechanism (ETM) is proposed, offering two key advantages. First, unlike traditional ETMs that rely solely on current system information, the adaptive memory ETM utilizes historical release data to adjust communication frequency and enhance control effectiveness. Second, an attack-related triggering condition and adaptive law are introduced to reduce the abnormaldata transmission induced by denial of service (DoS) attacks and extend the lifespan of the sensor node. Sufficient conditions are derived to ensure the mean-square $\mathcal {H}_{\infty }$ asymptotic stability of the resulting T–S fuzzy WTS, while also guaranteeing uniformly ultimate boundedness in the presence of DoS attacks. Finally, an illustrative example is used to show the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

Decision-makers' weights are determined using grey relational analysis and incorporated as the initial layer in the Bayesian network. The conditional probabilities within the QLBN are derived by integrating attribute weights and regret utility functions, and the alternatives are ranked based on their final quantum probabilities.

  abstract     = {Automatic acne severity grading is crucial for the accurate diagnosis and effective treatment of skin diseases. However, the acne severity grading process is often ambiguous due to the similar appearance of acne with close severity, making it challenging to achieve reliable acne severity grading. Following the idea of fuzzy logic for handling uncertainty in decision-making, we transforms the acne severity grading task into a fuzzy label learning (FLL) problem, and propose a novel adjacency-aware fuzzy label learning (AFLL) framework to handle uncertainties in this task. The AFLL framework makes four significant contributions, each demonstrated to be highly effective in extensive experiments. First, we introduce a novel adjacency-aware decision sequence generation method that enhances sequence tree construction by reducing bias and improving discriminative power. Second, we present a consistency-guided decision sequence prediction method that mitigates error propagation in hierarchical decision-making through a novel selective masking decision strategy. Third, our proposed sequential conjoint distribution loss innovatively captures the differences for both high and low fuzzy memberships across the entire fuzzy label set while modeling the internal temporal order among different acne severity labels with a cumulative distribution, leading to substantial improvements in FLL. Fourth, to the best of our knowledge, AFLL is the first approach to explicitly address the challenge of distinguishing adjacent categories in acne severity grading tasks. Experimental results on the public ACNE04 dataset demonstrate that AFLL significantly outperforms existing methods, establishing a new state-of-the-art in acne severity grading.},

  abstract     = {Complex systems are frequently influenced by uncertain factors, making it difficult for traditional fixed-model control schemes to achieve high-precision control. Data-driven control methods offer a solution, but they face challenges in constructing accurate models due to insufficient excitation in operational data. Moreover, mismatches between historical models and new conditions coupled with limited data accumulation under new conditions reduces the operational performance throughout the entire process. To address these issues, this paper proposes a generalized integrated fuzzy model predictive control (GIF-MPC) framework. It combines the generalization capability of fuzzy control with the precision of model predictive control to ensure highprecision control under all conditions. Specifically, a strategy switching mechanism, triggered by a mismatch characteristic parameter is first proposed, which transitions the original strategy to a fuzzy-driven excitation control method, thereby mitigating the control performance degradation caused by the mismatch between control strategies and complex systems. Then, a fuzzy control feature extraction method is proposed to balance fuzzy set activation and improve adaptability to unknown conditions. Additionally, an optimal input excitation design method is proposed to tackle insufficient data excitation, enabling effective control. Once sufficient data is accumulated, the model switches to model predictive control. The dual decision mechanism guided by the data information and triggered by the mismatch characteristic parameter effectively ensures high precision control under uncertainties. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the GIF-MPC method ensures high-precision control throughout disturbances and condition changes. The solution is also successfully deployed in an industrial setting, validating its excellent control performance under full operation conditions.},

Given that agents require confidential state messages, an output mask scheme is delicately synthesized to ensure that other agents cannot identify the true state message, potentially adding to the sophistication of the containment control process of MAS. Then, an adaptive prescribed-time fuzzy optimal containment control strategy is developed that counts on the masked state of neighboring agents. In addition, an auxiliary error via the shifting function is incorporated into the nonlinear mapping function to manage error constraints, not only avoiding the feasibility criteria but also realizing the unified control. Notably, an emerging intermediate variable is executed to tackle the issue of unknown control gains acting on the RL-based recursive design procedure. Moreover, the drawback of semiglobal boundedness of the error surface induced by dynamic surface control can be avoided with the aid of the novel Lyapunov-like energy candidate. With the assistance of the practical prescribed-time stability, it can be guaranteed that the original state value of each agent remains undisclosed, and the output of the followers can be centered on a convex hull made up of leaders within a prescribed time. Herein, the efficacy of the suggested tactic is exemplified through two illustrative examples.},

Specifically, GDOF first employs label-informed fuzzy granulation to effectively represent various data types and develops granule density for precise density estimation. Subsequently, granule densities from individual attributes are integrated for outlier scoring by assessing attribute relevance with a limited number of labeled outliers. Experimental results on various real-world datasets show that GDOF stands out in detecting outliers in heterogeneous data with a minimal number of labeled outliers.

In the inference engine of such a system, the current inputs are used to forecast the likely outputs. The unpredictability of one (or more) inputs in the forecasting horizon, gives rise to one source of uncertainty in the reasoning process, named evidence uncertainty, which is the main focus of this article. To deal with this sort of uncertainty numerical scenarios are generated from historical data to substitute the uncertain input parameter using two approaches: Uniform sampling, and a classical nonuniform sampling acceptance–rejection method. Each input scenario has particular output, and at the end these outputs are aggregated with the discrete Choquet integral to account for outputs' dependencies. Fuzzy measures, also called capacities or nonadditive measures, assign the importance weight not to just each scenario but also to groups of scenarios. A fuzzy measure for the Choquet integral is learned from the historical data. The proposed reasoning approach is evaluated in a long-term relative electricity load forecasting, and treats the uncertainty which arises from unpredictability of the daily temperature in the long run. The results show the superiority of the proposed Choquet integral-based approach with respect to the $k$-interactive, $k$-additive, and $k$-tolerant fuzzy measures compared to traditional aggregators: the weighted arithmetic mean, and the ordered weighted averaging.},

  abstract     = {Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are widely used across fields, with inductive learning replacing transductive learning as the mainstream training paradigm due to its superior memory efficiency, computation speed, and generalization. Neighbor node sampling, a key step in inductive learning, is critical to model performance. However, existing samplers focus only on adjacency matrix-based sampling, neglecting the varying impacts of different neighbors on target nodes over time. They usually aggregate the neighbor information in a simple way such as averaging or summing, which limits the information representation, robustness, and generalization. To address these limitations, we propose a Dynamic Fuzzy Sampler (DFS) based on a Gaussian fuzzy system. DFS accounts for node diversity and models the uncertainties and fuzziness in neighbor-target mutual information dynamically. Specifically, DFS first innovatively constructs a learnable Gaussian fuzzy set system for determining the membership degree of different neighbors to the target node at different moments. Subsequently, DFS aggregates the target node embeddings and membership-weighted neighbor embeddings to update the target node's features, which makes the target node utilize the sampling information more effectively. The aggregated target node effectively captures the graph structure information and neighbor node information, which can facilitate the subsequent graph neural network-based graph representation model with stronger representation and generalization capabilities. Experimental results on supervised and self-supervised graph datasets demonstrate that DFS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art sampling schemes. DFS achieves up to 1.90% and 9.52% F1-score improvement compared to the state-of-the-art schemes on small- and large-scale graphs, respectively.},

  abstract     = {This article aims to address the problem of distributed model-free adaptive iterative learning control for nonlinear discrete-time multiagent systems under switching topologies. To save valuable bandwidth in the wireless channel without sacrificing system performance, an event-triggered iterative learning control strategy is established and employed, where information is only transmitted at triggered instants. First, by virtue of the dynamic linearization technology, the controlled system can be converted into a linear model to construct the controller structure. Second, a model-free adaptive iterative learning consensus control scheme is proposed merely employing the input and output data, in which better tracking performance can be attained by learning the previous experience. Third, a dynamic event-triggered mechanism along the iteration domain is set up to deal with the limited bandwidth issue, effectively saving communication resources. Unlike most model-free adaptive control results, the constructed distributed controller is designed based on controller-dynamic-linearization approach to deal with the controller structure design issue without designing the cost function, making it more convenient in solving tracking control issues for multiagent systems under iteration-switching communication topologies, which is more suitable for the actual environment. Using graph theory and the contraction mapping principle, the convergence of tracking control errors is theoretically analyzed. Ultimately, the effectiveness of the established control schemes is illustrated through two simulation examples.},

  abstract     = {In multilabel learning, the precise mining and appropriate application of label correlation can improve the effectiveness and generalization of prediction models. In order to characterize label correlation more carefully, the concept of operator-valued kernel is introduced. The value of operator-valued kernel is an operator on Hilbert space, and when applied to a practical problem, the function-valued operator degenerates into a positive-definite matrix, which aims to describe the label correlation. However, existing works focus on the basic theory of operator-valued kernel, and lack way to learn specific kernel from specific datasets, thus the application of operator-valued kernel in practical problem is greatly hindered. In this article, we focus on learning operator-valued kernels with fuzzy rough sets from multilabel datasets and designing learning algorithm for multilabel classification. First, the importance distribution of feature set to different labels at each sample is measured by using kernelized fuzzy rough sets. For a single sample, label correlation matrix is constructed based on the consistency of the importance distribution of features to labels, so as to characterize the correlation information between different labels. By considering the interaction information between two label correlation matrices, the label incidence matrix between two samples is obtained. Therefore, a new operator-valued kernel is defined by using label incidence matrices as elements. This operator-valued kernel is further proved to be an entangled and transformable kernel. On the basis, the proposed operator-valued kernel is applied to develop an efficient learning algorithm for multilabel classification. The generalization error bound of the prediction function is measured by Rademacher complexity. In order to illustrate the effectiveness of our algorithm, the classification experiments and statistical analysis results on twelve multilabel datasets are provided, which are compared with seven high performance algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Fuzzy recurrent stochastic configuration networks (F-RSCNs) have shown great potential in modeling nonlinear dynamic systems due to their high learning efficiency, less human intervention, and universal approximation capability. However, their remarkable performance is accompanied by a lack of theoretical guidance regarding parameter selection in fuzzy inference systems, making it challenging to obtain the optimal fuzzy rules. In this article, we propose an improved version of F-RSCNs termed IF-RSCNs for better model performance. Unlike traditional neuro-fuzzy models, IF-RSCNs do not rely on a fixed number of fuzzy rules. Instead, each fuzzy rule is associated with a subreservoir, which is incrementally constructed in the light of a sub-reservoir mechanism to ensure the adaptability and universal approximation property of the built model. Through this hybrid framework, the interpretability of the network is enhanced by performing fuzzy reasoning, and the parameters of both fuzzy systems and neural networks are determined using the recurrent stochastic configuration (RSC) algorithm, which inherits the fast learning speed and strong approximation ability of RSCNs. In addition, an online update of readout weights using the projection algorithm is implemented to handle complex dynamics, and the convergence analysis of the learning parameters is provided. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed IF-RSCNs outperform other classical neuro-fuzzy and nonfuzzy models in terms of learning and generalization performance, highlighting their effectiveness in modeling nonlinear systems.},

In real applications, noise data and irrelevant or redundant features affect the generality of learning models. Therefore, keeping meaningful features and avoiding the effect of noise is essential for feature selection in a multi-scale information system. In bireduct, multi-scale granulation can be used to characterize the importance and correlation of features at different scales. However, little work has taken the distribution of multi-scale data into account when granulating it. In addition, these approaches focus on solving the task of multi-scale data reduction only from the dimension perspective. To this end, a fuzzy-rough bireduct with supervised multi-scale granulation (FrBSmg) is proposed. First, the supervised multi-scale fuzzy granulation based on data distribution is constructed. Then, scaled uncertainty measures are defined to describe the fuzzy relevance of each feature. Furthermore, the global and local distributions of a sample are characterized simultaneously based on the positive region, which can reflect the degree of a sample belonging to some class, and the supervised fuzzy similarity relation can describe the degree of a sample belonging to its class. A strategy of Feature-Correlated Selection and Sample-Noisy Removal is devised for bireduct. Finally, the experimental results on twenty-one public datasets show the effectiveness of FrBSmg.},

  abstract     = {The issue of sliding flexible prescribed performance control (SFPPC) of input saturated nonlinear systems (ISNSs) is first studied in this article. Compared to the traditional PPC and the finite-time PPC algorithms for ISNSs, under which the performance constraint boundaries (PCBs) present the symmetrical or asymmetric “horn” shape, which leads to a large jitter in the tracking error before the system reaches steady state; and once the parameters are selected, the PCBs are fixed, when the initial state (or reference signal) changes, it is necessary to reverify whether the initial error still satisfies the initial constraint condition. By designing a new pair of sliding flexible PCBs (SFPCBs) associated with the initial error, a novel SFPPC algorithm is presented in this article, which presents two main advantages: 1) the SFPCBs can slide adaptively with the initial tracking error without increasing the measure of the initial PCBs, implying that the proposed SFPPC algorithm can be applied to ISNSs with arbitrary initial errors without sacrificing the initial control performance; 2) the proposed SFPPC algorithm achieves a tradeoff between performance constraint and input saturation, i.e., the SFPCBs can adaptively increase when the control input exceeds the maximum allowable threshold, effectively avoiding singularity, and when the control input is within the saturation threshold range, the SFPCBs can adaptively revert back to the original PCBs. The results demonstrate that the proposed SFPPC approach can guarantee that the system output tracks the desired signal, and the tracking error always kept within the SFPCBs that depend on initial error, input, and output constraints. The developed algorithm is exemplified by means of simulation instances.},

The design realizes a decoupling of control and estimation loops, effectively ensuring transient approximation performance and avoiding chattering induced by nonzero initial tracking errors. Then, based on the estimated components, a robust steady-state control scheme embedded with a prescribed performance mechanism is tailored to guarantee that the output state can converge to a predefined range within a preassigned time. This endows the designed controller with a specified time tracking capability independence on control parameters. To make a tradeoff between tracking precision and energy cost, a finite-time learning-based optimal control policy is exploited by utilizing adaptive dynamic programming technique to serve as an adaptive supplementary controller, where single critic neural network is trained for acquiring the solution of the Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman equation.

In addition, due to the large uncertainty and fuzziness of the data distribution in real scenarios compared to the training data, the model's generalization ability is often limited. To address the above issues, we propose a novel adaptive fuzzy degradation perception approach based on fuzzy theory that includes two tactics: 1) Fuzzy Degradation Perceiver (FDP); and 2) Test-time Self-supervised Prompt Fine-tuning (TSPF). On the one hand, we introduce the FDP, which leverages the rich visual language prior knowledge in CLIP to learn the prompt representations of different degradations. These prompts are regarded as semantic representations of various degradation fuzzy sets, achieving adaptive degradation perception by computing the degrees of membership between input images and the fuzzy sets. On the other hand, we propose the TSPF strategy, which is capable of self-supervised optimization of degraded fuzzy sets according to real-world scenarios during testing. This strategy improves the model's ability to perceive and represent the degraded information in data with real-world distributions. Thanks to the above key strategies, our method significantly improves degradation perception capability and image restoration quality while exhibiting excellent generalization in complex real-world scenarios. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets confirm that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in all-in-one image restoration.},

It introduces an adaptive consensus pseudoinverse control scheme based on fuzzy logic systems and barrier Lyapunov functions (BLFs), ensuring that all states of the closed-loop system are strictly confined within predefined constraints. The main features of this study are as follows. First, in order to cope with the hysteresis nonlinearity present in the actuators of multiagent systems, a pseudoinverse control algorithm has been proposed. This approach avoids the direct construction of a hysteresis inverse model. It achieves control by searching for actual control signals in temporary control laws, and it does not rely on the precise model of the system. Therefore, it can adapt more flexibly to the uncertainties in the system. Second, within the framework of this control strategy, the seamless integration of fuzzy control, BLFs, and the hysteresis pseudoinverse algorithm effectively addresses the full-state constraint control issue in the Preisach hysteresis model. The control signals are elegantly represented in the form of a double-integral function, offering a potent solution to the constraints inherent in the Preisach hysteresis model. Third, a multiagent collaborative control experimental platform was established, incorporating quadcopter autonomous aerial vehicles and ground mobile robots. Experimental validation of the proposed control scheme against traditional control approaches demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy in practical applications.},

Moreover, a new switching event-triggered mechanism that focuses on triggering strategies and conditions to minimize resource wastage from continuous controller sampling is constructed. This approach effectively reduces the frequency of sampling and energy loss within the controller. In addition, the boundedness of the Lyapunov function is analyzed using invariant set theory. It demonstrates that the tracking error converges to zero within a user-defined time, which simultaneously ensures all signals of the closed-loop system be bounded and Zeno-free phenomenon. Finally, the efficacy of the proposed control algorithm is validated through numerical simulation results.},

  abstract     = {This article presents a novel neuro-fuzzy model, termed fuzzy recurrent stochastic configuration networks (F-RSCNs), for industrial data analytics. Unlike the original recurrent stochastic configuration network (RSCN), the proposed F-RSCN is constructed by multiple subreservoirs, and each subreservoir is associated with a Takagi–Sugeno–Kang (TSK) fuzzy rule. Through this hybrid framework, first, the interpretability of the model is enhanced by incorporating fuzzy reasoning to embed the prior knowledge into the network. Then, the parameters of the neuro-fuzzy model are determined by the recurrent stochastic configuration (RSC) algorithm. This scheme not only ensures the universal approximation property and fast learning speed of the built model but also overcomes uncertain problems, such as unknown dynamic orders, arbitrary structure determination, and the sensitivity of learning parameters in modeling nonlinear dynamics. Finally, an online update of the output weights is performed using the projection algorithm, and the convergence analysis of the learning parameters is given. By integrating TSK fuzzy inference systems into RSCNs, F-RSCNs have strong fuzzy inference capability and can achieve sound performance for both learning and generalization. Comprehensive experiments show that the proposed F-RSCNs outperform other classical neuro-fuzzy and nonfuzzy models, demonstrating great potential for modeling complex industrial systems.},

An improved adaptive event-triggered protocol is created by integrating fuzzy rules and detection probability information. Moving beyond traditional time-domain sampled-data control strategies, a space–time sampled-data control approach is proposed to significantly reduce communication load. Benefiting from Lyapunov theory, criteria are attained for ensuring the mean-square exponential stability of the systems under consideration.

To make full use of the learning characteristic, a 2-D model of the fuzzy repetitive-control system is established to independently regulate the control and learning behaviors. The EEID approach decouples the design of the observer and the estimator by adding a flexible controller to the estimator. This makes it possible to simultaneously reduce the estimated and filtered errors, which is a contradictory problem in the conventional EID method. The two errors cannot be eliminated due to the lack of an internal model of the external disturbance. To actively cancel the negative influence of the two errors, a new observation-error compensator is added to the observer input to improve the disturbance-suppression performance. Two low-conservative linear-matrix-inequality stability conditions are derived using the Lyapunov–Krasovskii functionals and zero equations with free-weighting matrices. The nondominated sorting genetic algorithm II and the particle swarm optimization algorithm are used to optimize the parameters of the controllers for the tracking and disturbance-suppression systems based on the stability conditions and performance indexes. The effectiveness and superiority of the design are verified by numerical simulation and comparison results.},

  abstract     = {This article innovatively combines the empirical distribution characteristics of random fuzzy variables to propose a new Wasserstein distributionally robust equilibrium optimization method and effectively applies to an electric vehicle routing problem with contactless delivery (EVRPCD). The proposed method characterizes customer demand and travel time in EVRPCD as random fuzzy variables with ambiguous probability distributions. Moreover, this studied EVRPCD integrates the location decision of the contactless delivery station and the routing decision of the electric vehicle, thus forming a bi-level optimization. Meanwhile, a tolerant load coefficient and an idle loss cost are introduced into the established bi-level optimization model to describe the safety and economic effects of vehicle overloading and underloading, respectively. Importantly, the proposed method generates Wasserstein ambiguity sets to effectively achieve the theoretical characterization of the ambiguous probability distribution of random fuzzy variables in EVRPCD. As the proposed method faces significant computational challenges, this article theoretically deduces its computable reformulation via utilizing the dual theory and the credibility measure method. The computable reformulation realizes the solvability of the model via transforming it into a mixed integer programming with a piecewise penalty function and multiple conditional constraints. An interactive iteration-based algorithm is then given to solve the reconstructed model numerically. The sensitivity analysis and comparative experimental results reveal the effectiveness of the proposed method. Experimental results show that the proportion of vehicle overweight may be reduced by appropriately increasing the penalty and the proposed method pays a small price of distributional robustness to resist the ambiguous probability distributions of random fuzzy variables.},

The interval output constraint algorithm utilizes the distance information to implement output constraints and formation changes, which are more practical but more challenging than the output constraint problem based on user-assigned settling time, especially in narrow areas. One of the distinctive advantages of the proposed output-constrained model predictive controller is that it can activate formation changes and output constraints for AAVs when passing through narrow space, and it can automatically restore the formation of AAVs and deactivate the output constraints when the AAVs are far away from the narrow space. Unlike most nonlinear model predictive control strategy, where predictive control relies on the accurate underlying dynamical system, the article introduces adaptive fuzzy updating law to receding horizon optimization algorithm to estimate and compensate unknown dynamics and external disturbances. Two potential field functions are designed to safely track in 3-D environments with obstacles. Finally, several examples are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed controller.},

The model uncertainties are measured based on the fuzzy set theory by a number of sub-optimal parameter vectors that reproduce certain measured outputs and approach the optimal value of a modeling objective function. These sub-optimal parameter vectors can describe the uncertainties in the presence of model structure deviations and unknown noise distributions, without making restrictive assumptions that the noise follows a Gaussian distribution as in existing methods. The proposed method is validated by practical examples in a radiator-heated residential building. The examples illustrate that the proposed method can provide more accurate measurements of the model uncertainties than the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method.},

The majority of the existing literature on NCSs tends to emphasize certain aspects while neglecting others. In this article, we propose a general framework for addressing the stabilization problem of networked nonlinear systems that incorporates multiple stochastic transmission intervals (MSTIs), successive packet losses (SPLs), and FDI attacks. We assume that the nonlinear system can be precisely modeled using a Takagi–Sugeno (T–S) fuzzy system. MSTIs can be described using the categorical distribution, while both the sensor-to-controller channel and the controller-to-actuator channel are affected by SPLs and FDI attacks. In order to facilitate the stabilization problem, we first establish the equivalent stochastic transmission interval between adjacent nonpacket-loss instants, where the occurrence probability of the length of the equivalent transmission interval can be accurately calculated by using the probabilistic information of SPLs and MSTIs. Furthermore, considering two-channel FDI attacks, a discrete-time T–S fuzzy system model is obtained. The controller design conditions, represented by linear matrix inequalities (LMIs), are derived based on this model. Specifically, using a novel matrix reconstruction approach, the dimension of the obtained controller design condition does not change with the number of maximum packet losses and the number of MSTIs, which is more general than existing results and avoids the high computational complexity associated with solving LMIs in some cases. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through a numerical example.},

The complex knowledge comes from a proposed hybrid NFN-LSTM model (teacher) composed of a long shor-term memory (LSTM) coupled to a neo-fuzzy neuron (NFN) structure. The proposed student model, the NFN-MOD, is an explainable Takagi–Sugeno fuzzy model that resembles modular characteristics to mimic the temporal memory of the LSTM part in the teacher model. The NFN-MOD is adaptable across many scenarios, including solo learning (without a teacher), with the estimation of a previously trained teacher, or training in parallel with the teacher. The complexity reduction of the student model is achieved through the pruning of its consequent parameters with the lowest L1-norm. Application of NFN-MOD in industrial case studies (sulfur recovery unit and cement manufacturing process) demonstrates the efficiency of NFN-MOD in distilling complex knowledge from the teacher model NFN-LSTM, with emphasis on parallel training and parameter pruning. In addition, a novel explainability analysis is introduced, which evaluates the influence of antecedent parameters of the student model in relation to the expected real system output.},

Considering that the medium access constraints allow only the measurement information from a single node to be transmitted and the authenticity of the measured values is corrupted by attacks, a fuzzy-model-based asynchronous FD filter with only partially available measurements is designed. Then, based on the residual signals generated by the filter, a generalized detection scheme for sensor faults and actuator faults is proposed. By applying the information about membership functions and relaxation matrices, the existence conditions of the filter are obtained that guarantee the stochastic stability and strict dissipativity of the filtering error system. Finally, a simulation example is provided to validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, which shows that it can more accurately identify the actual fault signal than the existing methods without generating false alarms.},

  abstract     = {Although the construction of multilinear trend fuzzy information granules (FIG) achieves a win–win situation in terms of interpretability and trend extraction, in its second stage of segmentation, the equal-length segmentation will result in the loss of local trend. The granulation effect will further affect the forecasting performance of the time series. To this end, this article establishes a convolutional neural network (CNN) prediction method based on improved multilinear trend FIGs. First, considering the natural cycle characteristics of the time series, this article establishes a time series segmentation algorithm based on the valley points, which replaces the equal-length segmentation in the second stage of the construction of the multilinear trend FIGs, thus enhancing the interpretability of the granulation process. Later, an evaluation index of Gaussian fuzzy information granules (GLFIGs) is proposed for improving the trend extraction effect of each multilinear trend FIG. Since the multilinear trend FIGs are constructed in the natural period segment, in order to fully exploit the correlation of the corresponding positions of each granule to enhance the prediction accuracy, a GLFIG correspondence algorithm based on the segmentation and merging is introduced in this article. Finally, CNN is selected as the prediction model based on the data characteristics. We conduct experiments on six datasets and two artificial cycle datasets, and compare the constructed model with commonly used prediction models and the latest granularity model. At last, the experiments reveal that our model performs better.},

Different from current approaches, our method ensures enhanced prescribed performance by guaranteeing finite-time convergence and avoiding high frequency chattering.

However, most state-of-the-art methods suffer from limitations due to not only using the single-scale information granulation but also the lack of trend information. As a result, the prediction models are difficult to capture the multiscale temporal dependencies and dynamic behavior of time series. To address these problems, this article proposes a multiscale information granule-based time series forecasting model. First, the trend-based information granulation strategy is proposed to generate trend information granules that can capture dynamic behavior and trend information in an incremental manner. Then, the multiscale fusion mechanism is proposed to form multiscale information granules with diversified information, which fuses local and global information at different scales. Finally, the two-stage prediction mechanism is proposed to capture multiscale temporal dependencies and perform long-term prediction. A series of experiments were conducted on publicly available time series. Comparative analysis shows that the proposed method outperforms existing numeric models and granular models in long-term prediction on regular and large data time series.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, multilabel feature selection (MFS) has gained considerable attention as a key technique in the field of data mining. Embedded methods have been widely adopted due to their simplicity and efficiency. However, most embedded MFS methods assume that all labels share the same feature space. Although previous works have noted this issue and proposed solutions, they still suffer from the inability to accurately identify a specific subset of features for each label. Furthermore, most embedded MFS methods often only consider feature similarity through manifold learning concepts, neglecting the impact of feature redundancy, leading to suboptimal performance. In addition, their weight matrix is usually derived from a single perspective of the loss function. To address these limitations, we propose a novel embedded label-specific MFS method based on fuzzy implication granularity information called LSFSFI. This method uses the partial fuzzy mutual implication granularity information to capture the relationships between labels and features, and introduces an auxiliary matrix to achieve label-specific feature selection, which provides a new perspective for the calculation of the weight matrix. In addition, the normalized fuzzy mutual implication granularity information is used to describe the redundancy between features, and a new redundancy constraint regularization term is proposed to ensure a more reasonable assignment of feature weights. Experimental results on several multilabel datasets show that LSFSFI outperforms existing methods in terms of both performance and practicality.},

Then, different from the previous control strategies in which they only focused on the balanced directed topology, the classification optimization algorithm is presented to accomplish the bipartite consensus tracking control according to the structurally unbalanced directed topology. Besides, by combining the adaptive backstepping technique with the adding power integration methodology, the nonsingular fixed-time control strategy is proposed.

Linear fuzzy information granulation is a well-recognized and powerful tool for long-term forecasting. However, existing studies on this topic have been restricted to univariate time series, falling short of meeting the real-world demands of complex forecasting issues. In this regard, this article proposes a multivariate long-term time-series forecasting model using fuzzy information granules and demonstrates its application to a transportation forecasting task. Our model begins by designing a multilinear trend fuzzy information granulation scheme within a justifiable granularity framework. This scheme effectively granulates and delineates time-series information for each feature. To ensure the normalization of the granular time series within each time window, we propose a scale equalization strategy that leverages the dynamic time warping algorithm. Building upon this foundation, our model introduces a long-term forecasting mechanism for multivariate time series. Notably, this mechanism fosters interconnections, bridging the temporal gap between past and future granular time series while concurrently linking the granular series of influential features and the target feature. Empirical validation on six real-world traffic flow forecasting datasets demonstrates the effectiveness and competitiveness of our proposed model.},

However, current models that use DLPRs often overlook two crucial factors: the ordinal consistency of preference relations and the fairness of adjustment allocation within the DLPRs-based consensus reaching process. In this article, we propose a cooperative game-based minimum adjustment consensus reaching mechanism that accounts for both ordinal consistency and the hesitant degree in DLPRs. This approach leverages the properties of indices in cooperative game theory to ensures a fair allocation of consistency and consensus adjustments, while maintaining ordinal consistency and controlling the hesitant degree of DLPRs through the construction of appropriate constraints to preserve their quality. In addition, a new algorithm is developed to manage completeness, ordinal and acceptable cardinal consistency, consensus-reaching, and hesitation in scenarios involving incomplete DLPRs. Finally, a case study is provided to demonstrate the practical application of the proposed method. Sensitivity and comparative analyzes with existing models are performed to assess the performance of the approach in terms of quality, fairness, and efficiency.},

  abstract     = {Graph convolutional neural networks (GCNs) have demonstrated effectiveness in processing graph structure. Due to the diversity and complexity of real-world graph data, heterogeneous GCN have attracted significant attention. However, existing research predominantly relies on explicit connections to explore graph heterogeneity. In the case of edgeless graphs, such as information systems, the absence of direct edges poses a significant challenge for employing GCNs to analyze the latent heterogeneity within these graphs. Traditional approaches overlook the topological features of information systems, resulting in information loss. This article introduces a heterogeneous graph convolutional neural network based on shadowed deviation relationship (SDHGCN) to investigate the heterogeneity of information systems, thereby improving the generalizability of heterogeneous GCNs. First, shadow deviation relationship and attribute deviation relationship are constructed derived from shadow sets and information gain, respectively. Then, dexterously integrated with the feature matrix of the information system (the relationship between objects and attributes), a highly expressive heterogeneous graph is constructed. Second, by performing graph convolution operations on the heterogeneous graph, effective node representations can be obtained to complete node classification tasks. Finally, the effectiveness and nonrandomness of SDHGCN are validated by extensive comparison and ablation experiments.},

  abstract     = {This article principally presents the adaptive fuzzy dynamic event-triggered output-feedback consensus tracking control problem for constrained nonlinear multiagent systems encountering false data injection attacks, using monotone tube boundary functions (MTBFs). First, the composite observer is designed to concurrently estimate the unpredictable system states and disturbances. Then, a novel parameter integration approach is constructed via the fuzzy approximation technique to reduce the computational burden, where the uncertainty terms (state errors, composite errors, fuzzy weights, and injection attacks) can be converted into a linear parameterized form with merely one unknown scalar. In addition, a set of MTBFs is designed to prevent the excessive overshoot or jitter of system errors in the transient-state performance. Furthermore, an adaptive dynamic event-triggered control strategy is constructed on the basis of the auxiliary dynamic variable. All the closed-loop signals are shown to be bounded, and the followers can achieve the synchronous tracking of the leader's output. In the end, the simulation results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed control strategy.},

Specifically, the fluctuations of the state estimator gain parameters are taken into account in the design of the filter. Further, cyber attacks are supposed to take place in the communication channel and can modify the sensor signals by injecting false data if an attack is successful. Meanwhile, the transition probability of the Markov process is a switching phenomenon along with the minimum and maximum bounds of the multichannel communication scheme. By employing appropriate Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional along with reciprocally convex approach, a set of sufficient conditions guaranteeing the finite-time mixed $H_\infty$ and passivity performance for NCSs are derived in terms of linear matrix inequalities.

Hierarchical rule-base reduction was used in defining the controller. This entailed selecting inputs/outputs, determining the most globally influential inputs, generating a hierarchy relating inputs, selecting only the rules corresponding to the hierarchy, and, in effect, designing a symmetric rule-base. This dramatically reduced the rule-base size, by 97.7%, while maintaining global operating environment coverage. The stability analysis proved the asymptotic stability of the closed-loop controller-vehicle system. In addition, test courses were used to examine the effects of steering disturbance, phase lag, and overshoot as expressed in root mean square error (RMSE) and max error (ME). Outdoor experimental results for the controller's performance were contrasted with a benchmark waypoint navigation controller, pure pursuit, and a simpler implementation that only output linear speed. The controller was found to outperform the pure pursuit and simpler implementation experimentally by 72% and 50% in RMSE, 71% and 40% in ME, validating the controllers viability.},

By using the command filter, the problem of “explosion of complexity” is successfully averted, meanwhile the influence of filtered error is eliminated by way of the fractional power error compensation mechanism. The issue of singularity is effectively tackled by the hyperbolic tangent function's property and L'Hospital's rule. A predefined-time performance function is inserted into the control scheme to ensure that the tracking errors are restricted to the preassigned performance bounds. It is strictly proven that the closed-loop system is practically predefined-time stable, and the position and attitude tracking errors are driven into a small region around zero in a predefined time.

By using fuzzy logic systems to approximate the unknown functions, the controlled uncertain NMASs are transformed into the strict-feedback parameterized NMASs. Then, based on the designed communication-delay-related distributed formation observer and the backstepping control design theory, a fuzzy adaptive formation control algorithm is proposed. By constructing the Lyapunov functions, it is proved that the designed communication-delay-related distributed formation observer errors converge to zero exponentially and the proposed distributed fuzzy formation control algorithm can ensure that the closed-loop systems are semi-globally uniformly ultimately bounded, with the formation tracking errors converging to an adjustable neighborhood around zero.

  abstract     = {The clustering algorithm has always been a hot spot in machine learning, which has made great progress and been widely used in different scenarios. Due to the characteristics and requirements of some application scenarios, the branch of the balanced clustering algorithm has been developed. The ideal of these algorithms is to obtain clusters containing approximately the same number of samples. However, when there are data points distributed at the boundary of different clusters, resulting in different probabilities of their belonging, hard-partitioned balanced clustering may not be able to handle these boundary data well, thus limiting their performance. Motivated by this, we propose a Fuzzy Min-Cut with Soft Balancing Effects (FCBE) method in this article. Specifically, the FCBE model utilizes fuzzy constraints to simultaneously enhance the ability of the balanced algorithm to capture boundary data members and the advantage of directly obtaining the partitioning results of graph-cut problem without postprocessing. In addition, a sparse regularization is introduced to avoid trivial solutions and maintain the separability of the relationship matrix. Furthermore, the proposed FCBE method can be viewed as a flexibly adjustable generalization pattern that not only has clear interpretability but also can become special cases with clear physical meanings under different parameter values. The feasibility of FCBE has been verified on real datasets.},

  abstract     = {Multiview anchor graph clustering has been a prominent research area in recent years, leading to the development of several effective and efficient methods. However, three challenges are faced by current multiview anchor graph clustering methods. First, real-world data often exhibit uncertainty and poor discriminability, leading to suboptimal anchor graphs when directly extracted from the original data. Second, most existing methods assume the presence of common information between views and primarily explore it for clustering, thus neglecting view-specific information. Third, further exploration and exploitation of the learned anchor graph to enhance clustering performance remains an open research question. To address these issues, a novel dual anchor graph fuzzy clustering method is proposed in this article. First, a novel matrix factorization-based dual anchor graph learning method is proposed to address the first two issues by extracting highly discriminative hidden representations for each view and subsequently deriving both common and specific anchor graphs from these hidden representations. Then, to address the third issue, a novel anchor graph fuzzy clustering method is developed with cooperative learning to exploit and utilize the common and specific anchor graphs fully. Meanwhile, a fuzzy membership structure preservation mechanism with dual anchor graphs is constructed to enhance clustering performance. Finally, negative Shannon entropy is further introduced to adaptively adjust the view weighing. Extensive experiments on several datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

However, these generalizations have a limited application to signals defined on domains with arbitrary geometry.

We introduce a universal concept of a fuzzy partition that includes a kernel representation, a fuzzy partition, and the corresponding F-transform. In addition, we discuss the main properties of this generalized F-transform and characterize the nonlocal Laplace operator in terms of the F-transform.

Third, by employing a new piecewise Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional that incorporates membership functions (MFs), a fuzzy controller with imperfect MFs is designed, where both the MFs and their derivatives are considered. Eventually, sufficient conditions are developed to ensure that the networked IT-2 system is mean square exponentially stable with $ H_\infty$ performance. Finally, the merits and applicability of the proposed approaches are exemplified by a practical example.},

  abstract     = {In this article, we propose a dynamic event-triggered adaptive prescribed-time output feedback tracking control strategy for nonlinear systems with unknown external disturbances under denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. The presence of malicious intermittent DoS attacks makes the output signal and states of the system unavailable, which in turn leads to more difficulty in the design of the controller. To overcome the above difficulty, we construct a novel composite observer based on the attack compensator, whereby the system states can be reconstructed. Moreover, with the help of the time-varying constraint function, the prescribed-time tracking control problem for nonlinear systems is transformed into the constraint problem of tracking error. At the same time, a new dynamic event-triggered adaptive prescribed-time safety fuzzy controller is built and remains applicable in the systems that operate continuously after the predefined time. The adaptive fuzzy safety control method proposed in this article ensures that the tracking error converges to the user-specified region in the predefined time, all signals of the closed-loop system remain bounded under intermittent DoS attacks, and the repeated transmission of samples from the controller to the actuator can be further reduced, generating fewer events and saving communication resources. Finally, the simulation results of the single-link robotic arm demonstrate the rationality and effectiveness of the developed control algorithm.},

  abstract     = {In group decision-making (GDM), traditional consensus models have primarily focused on cardinal consensus. In reality, irrespective of whether the objective of GDM is to select the optimal alternative or to rank alternatives, it is imperative to establish a ranking that garners the utmost assent from all decision-makers (DMs). When preferences are articulated through fuzzy preference relations (FPRs), cardinal information emerges in numerical form, quantifying the degree of preference for alternatives, while ordinal relations are implicitly embedded within pairwise comparisons. To delve into both cardinal and ordinal consensus among DMs, this study introduces two consensus optimization models that strive to minimize adjustments to FPRs while fostering consensus in terms of preference intensity and ranking. To this end, we first propose two ordinal consensus measurement methods: one precisely discerns whether DMs have achieved consensus on the selection of the best alternative, while the other assesses the consistency of different preference rankings, taking into account the importance of positions. Based on these methods, two systems of inequalities are designed to explicitly govern both types of ordinal consensus. Subsequently, two consensus control rules are formulated, tailored to distinct objectives. These rules necessitate not only cardinal consensus among all DMs, but also their alignment in terms of either the selection of the best alternative or the preference ranking. Ultimately, these rules are integrated as constraints into two mixed-integer programming models aimed at minimizing preference adjustments. The proposed models have been applied in a case study, confirming their practicality, with thorough comparative analyses demonstrating their effectiveness.},

  abstract     = {Selecting a compact and relevant feature subset for hybrid decision systems is a key task in decision-making. Fuzzy rough set (FRS) is an effective method for this purpose, but its space complexity can be a hindrance when dealing with large data sets. A scalable FRS-based feature subset selection framework, FDM-FMFRS, was proposed earlier. This framework integrates FRS with fuzzy min–max neural network (FMNN) as a preprocessing step to handle large datasets. FMNN model transforms object space into hyperbox space. However, its implementation requires all input variables to be numeric. One way to handle categorical data is to replace them with numerical values, but this method may define an unsuitable metric for the categories. This article presents an extended version of FDM-FMFRS, called Hybrid-FDM-FMFRS, which is applicable to both numeric and categorical variables by incorporating set-valued data for categorical attributes. A weighted set is presented to represent the frequency distribution of distinct categories within the hyperbox, helping to create set-valued data for categorical attributes and providing the proposed approach greater flexibility and broader applications on definite space. A comprehensive comparative analysis is conducted on hybrid benchmark datasets, and it is established that the proposed algorithm obtained relevant reduct while preserving satisfactory classification accuracy in much less computational time. In addition, the proposed approach retains the scalability benefits of FDM-FMRS, allowing it to handle large datasets where the compared algorithms fail to compute reducts.},

There are no ideal models so the obtained numeric output could create a false illusion of achieved accuracy. A desirable approach is to augment the results with some measure of confidence (credibility) by admitting a granular rather than numeric format of the produced output values of the model. Our focus of this study is on fuzzy Takagi–Sugeno rule-based models whose conclusions are constant. The ultimate objective is to extend such models to the generalized granular structure with the conclusions formed as information granules. We study information granules described by intervals and fuzzy sets as well as probabilistic Gaussian information granules. The original design of the granular model is realized by involving the principle of justifiable granularity. Using this principle, we also show how to determine the equivalence between information granules. The construction of probabilistic information granules of the model is completed with the aid of optimized Gaussian process models. The granular models built in this way constitute a substantial and application-oriented departure from the numeric fuzzy models by offering a comprehensive insight into the quality of the produced results. The experimental studies based on synthetic and publicly available data demonstrate the design process and discuss the quality of the obtained results.},

  abstract     = {Motion planning, considered a fuzzy sequential decision-making problem, encounters significant challenges due to inherent environmental uncertainty. Traditional planning methods that rely on single strategies often struggle in complex scenarios. While fuzzy systems excel at handling uncertainty, high-dimensional continuous spaces require a large number of fuzzy rules, which significantly increases computational complexity. In contrast, humans leverage limited and fuzzy information to address various decision-making scenarios flexibly and efficiently. The concurrent reasoning mechanism in the prefrontal cortex plays a crucial role during this process. Consequently, the brain-inspired model and the concept of multiple fuzzy rules offer a novel perspective for the above issues. Motivated by these insights, this article proposes a brain-inspired motion planning method called harmonized learning with concurrent arbitration (HLCA). Specifically, inspired by the concurrent inference model, a concurrent arbitration module is employed in the planning process to effectively manage the boundary between exploration and exploitation. Furthermore, inspired by the multistrategy processing mechanism, HLCA introduces multistrategy harmonized learning by referring to the mechanism for operating multiple fuzzy rules, allowing the dynamic selection of strategies through a reliability function to enable self-improving learning. Experimental results demonstrate that HLCA outperforms state-of-the-art benchmarks, highlighting its potential to enhance the planning performance of robots by learning from the human brain.},

  abstract     = {As a low-cost cargo delivery manner, cable-suspended aerial transportation system is highly regarded by researchers. However, existing works seldom consider the relative distance adjustment between the payload and the multirotor, which greatly limits the application scope, such as tunnel traversing or payload releasing. In addition, treating the hook and the payload as a single point mass while ignoring the hook effect results in an inaccurate description of the dynamic model. To address the aforementioned problems, the dynamic model of the variable-length cable-suspended aerial transportation system is established accurately through Lagrange's equation with consideration of the motion of the multirotor, the payload, and the hook. Subsequently, an adaptive control method is presented through energy-based analysis, and swing angle related fuzzy rules are established to dynamically adjust the control parameters, which can simultaneously achieve multirotor positioning, payload hoisting/lowering, and hook/payload swing suppression. Moreover, the cable length is constrained within a feasible range by an elaborately designed auxiliary control signal. Lyapunov techniques and LaSalle's invariance theorem are utilized to prove the asymptotic convergence of the closed-loop system. Finally, a series of simulations are conducted to verify the control performance of the designed method.},

  abstract     = {Fuzzy rule interpolation (FRI) has been successfully applied to address real-world problems where domain knowledge is incomplete, particularly in situations where observations do not directly match existing rules. However, most of the existing research focuses on fuzzy systems based on Mamdani models. Recently, a pioneering approach has been proposed for rule interpolation within Takagi–Sugeno–Kang (TSK) fuzzy models, employing two distinct techniques that cluster neighboring rules to facilitate interpolated outcomes. Although promising, these techniques have been developed through empirical methods, lacking formal representation and theoretical justification. This article formalizes such emerging empirical studies with the aim of strengthening the theoretical foundation of FRI. It introduces the location view of rules and rule bases regarding TSK models, analyzing the influence of individual rules within FRI techniques for such models. Through geometrizing sparse rule bases, comparative investigations of the empirical and theoretical results are carried out. Moreover, geometric projection of the rules is combined with a rule weight adjustment mechanism to reinforce the capability of the formalized FRI techniques. By embedding directional parameters into the rules, the resulting method increases the weighting of critical rules, strengthening the FRI algorithms' performance when many rules may be selected for interpolation. Experimental results confirm the effectiveness of the theoretical model and the consistency with the existing empirical findings. This highlights the potential and significance of formal studies in guiding algorithmic improvements on FRI with TSK models.},

  abstract     = {Artificial intelligence (AI) has made remarkable achievements in extensive fields, whereas its closed boxnature limited applications in many critical areas. Against this drawback, explainable AI (XAI), has emerged as a focal point of current research. Recently, fuzzy logic systems (FLSs) attract increasing attention in XAI because of their linguistic representation, which can be naturally understood by humans. However, the focus of these works is limited by simply relying on inherent rule-based structures for explanation. Motivated by further exploring, the potential of FLS to overcome the challenges of XAI in terms of comprehensibility, scalability, and transferability, in this work, we propose fuzzy model-agnostic explanation (FMAE) as a post-hoc paradigm to explain the behavior of closed boxmodels. The innovations and contributions of this work provide a unified framework offering four levels of explanation, develop the associated algorithms to present the hidden knowledge behind the closed boxmodel in human-understandable form at different levels of granularity, and create the interface to deliver explanations to users. First, we introduce the hierarchical FMAE framework to formulate explanations into four levels including sample, local, domain, and universe. Second, the learning and explaining algorithms are developed to systematically construct FLS to model the behavior of closed boxmodels in the four levels where downscaling is performed by simplification to facilitate explanations with concise rules and upscaling is performed by the aggregation to integrate explanations at a higher level. Third, the proposed explanation interface unifies two typical forms of expression in XAI by fuzzy rules: the semantic inference explanation revealing the decision mechanism of the closed boxmodel and the feature salience explanation reflecting the attribution and interaction of input features. Simulated user experiments are designed on the comprehensive explanatory metrics. Compared with mainstream methods, the result shows outstanding explanation performance on real-world datasets for both regression and classification tasks.},

In this article, a fuzzy logical system (FLS) based state constrained adaptive integral sliding-mode control strategy is proposed to deal with those problems. A nonlinear sliding manifold is utilized to optimize the time-varying tracking errors, which averts integral windup while ensuring the convergence. Moreover, an auxiliary dynamic signal is incorporated into FLS to approach dynamic uncertainties generated by unmodeled dynamics. For the purpose of compensating the adverse influences induced by stochastic noises, several adaptive laws based on the virtual signals about norms of noise intensities are designed. Then, the stability of spacecraft proximity system is proved by Lyapunov function of stochastic system. Numerical simulation results show the boundness of all signals, which demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed controller.},

Existing studies rarely considered the psychological factors of DMs and the imprecise information of criteria importance when aggregating group opinions. This article proposes a robust MCGDM method that aggregates group opinions incorporating psychological factors of DMs and criteria weights determined by an interval information-based Bayesian hierarchy best worst method. First, a programming model, with an objective of minimizing the difference between the original and adjusted opinions of DMs, is developed to objectively determine the weights of DMs, taking into account the tolerance levels of DMs for opinion adjustments. Additionally, considering the interval preference information of criteria importance, a Bayesian hierarchy best worst method is proposed to infer the probability distribution of criteria weights, in which the criteria weights are regarded as stochastic variables. A numerical example shows that ignoring psychological factors of DMs can lead to biased decisions, while the proposed method providing a probabilistic distribution of alternative rankings forms robust decision results.},

Besides, a novel resilient quantitative prescribed performance control (RQPPC) is developed, which incorporates finite-time performance boundaries with input-relevant dynamic boundaries generated by an auxiliary system, being expected to flexibly adapt to input saturation without violating performance constraints. Building upon the RQPPC, the transient and steady-state behaviors of consensus errors can be quantitatively predesigned free from repeated parameter tuning processes.

  abstract     = {With the advancement of Big Data technology, deep learning automatic modulation recognition (DLAMR) has undergone new improvements. Existing DLAMR methods focus mostly on the primary matching of the model itself or ubiquitous big communications data, which lack interpretability and ignore deep representations for the modulation mechanism of the communication signals; thus, difficulties in further improving the recognition accuracy and multiquadrant amplitude modulation (MQAM) discriminability in complex communication environments are encountered. In response to these challenges, this article proposes an innovative communication signal graph mapping method to address the uncertainty in the modulation mechanisms. Specifically, it models sampling points as nodes; connects inter- and intrasymbol points with edges to represent modulation mechanisms and propagation uncertainty; and maps amplitude, phase, in-phase, and quadrature values as node features. A deep graphical and temporal neuro-fuzzy methodology (GT-DNFS) that integrates graph attention networks and bidirectional long short-term memory networks is subsequently proposed for DLAMR. The numerical results show that GT-DNFS achieves a significantly higher recognition accuracy of 93.01%, and an MQAM (M=16, 64) discrimination of 94.5%. This research offers valuable insights for neuro-fuzzy networks and efficient DLAMR algorithm design.},

However, most deep learning models are deterministic models that ignore the uncertainty of data. Fuzzy neural networks are proposed to tackle this type of problem. In this article, we proposed a novel quantum assisted hierarchical fuzzy neural network (QA-HFNN). Different from classical fuzzy neural networks, QA-HFNN uses quantum neural networks (QNNs) to learn fuzzy membership functions. The model is a multifeature fusion learning algorithm with a parallel structural design that integrates quantum and classical neural networks. The classical network is used to capture high-dimensional neural features, the QNNs are designed to capture fuzzy logic features of the data, then, the two features are fused to form the final features to be classified. The experiment is performed on a classical computer, and the quantum circuit is built through a simulated quantum environment. The results indicate that the accuracy of QA-HFNN can equal to or even surpass classical methods in image classification tasks. The quantum circuit utilizes only a single qubit which is easy to implement. In addition, the fidelity of quantum circuit in a quantum noise environment is assessed, demonstrating that QA-HFNN has strong robustness.

  abstract     = {The ensemble deep random vector functional link (edRVFL) neural network has demonstrated the ability to address the limitations of conventional artificial neural networks. However, since edRVFL generates features for its hidden layers through random projection, it can potentially lose intricate features or fail to capture certain nonlinear features in its base models (hidden layers). To enhance the feature learning capabilities of edRVFL, we propose a novel edRVFL based on fuzzy inference system (edRVFL-FIS). The proposed edRVFL-FIS leverages the capabilities of two emerging domains, namely deep learning and ensemble approaches, with the intrinsic IF–THEN properties of FIS and produces rich feature representation to train the ensemble model. Each base model of the proposed edRVFL-FIS encompasses the following two key feature augmentation components: 1) unsupervised fuzzy layer features and 2) supervised defuzzified features. The edRVFL-FIS model incorporates diverse clustering methods (R-means, K-means, fuzzy C-means) to establish fuzzy layer rules, resulting in the following three model variations: 1) edRVFL-FIS-R, 2) edRVFL-FIS-K, and 3) edRVFL-FIS-C with distinct fuzzified features and defuzzified features. Within the framework of edRVFL-FIS, each base model utilizes the original, hidden layer, and defuzzified features to make predictions. Experimental results, statistical tests, discussions, and analyses conducted across UCI and NDC datasets consistently demonstrate the superior performance of all variations of the proposed edRVFL-FIS model over baseline models such as fuzzy broad learning system.},

The enhancements increase the flexibility of KM in the defuzzification stage while the NT in the fuzzification stage.

  abstract     = {Utilizing artificial intelligence techniques for automated diagnosis of cancerous areas within gastric tissue pathology images can significantly augment physicians' diagnostic capabilities and subsequent treatment procedures. However, conventional segmentation models based on UNet architecture typically have images of the lesion area as outputs, failing to reconstruct the original gastric tissue pathology images from learned image features. This approach often results in incomplete learning of the complex details within gastric tissue pathology images, rendering the learned features susceptible to noise interference. Furthermore, previous segmentation models have used pooling operations, such as max, random, or average pooling, neglecting the holistic and global features present in gastric tissue pathology images, consequently failing to represent pathological features of gastric cancer tissue effectively. Therefore, we propose a reconstructed UNet model with hybrid fuzzy pooling (RUHFP) to detect lesion areas within gastric tissue pathology images. The RUHFP model is primarily based on the UNet architecture. The UNet version used in this work is U2-Net. Its novelty lies in integrating reconstruction operations from autoencoders into the UNet architecture. We jointly optimize the loss functions of both decoders to enhance the robustness of learned image features against noise interference. In addition, we incorporate fuzzy pooling operations for feature extraction, which are fused with features learned by the UNet architecture to improve the effectiveness and interpretability of image features. Several experimental tests conducted on real gastric tissue pathology image datasets validate the outstanding performance of the RUHFP model.},

Traditional methods and existing research often fall short in effectively analyzing this data, limited by their inability to fully capture the complex and nonlinear patterns inherent in ECG signals. Addressing these limitations, in this article, we introduce a novel deep neuro-fuzzy model augmented with multimodal feature fusion. Our method ingeniously combines the power of neuro-fuzzy systems with the robust feature extraction capabilities of deep learning, specifically leveraging a Transformer-based architecture, to analyze both ECG signals and their corresponding spectral images. This multimodal fusion not only enriches the model's input data, providing a comprehensive understanding of cardiac signals, but also enhances the adaptability and accuracy of cardiac arrhythmia detection. We rigorously validate our approach on the MIT-BIH arrhythmia database, conducting a series of experiments, including performance evaluations and ablation studies, to highlight the significant contributions of the multimodal feature fusion and neuro-fuzzy module. The results achieve significant improvements in classification metrics: an accuracy of 98.46% and an F1 score of 99.1%. Moreover, we benchmark the Transformer's feature extraction performance against other architectures, such as ResNet.

Compared with appearance-based methods, skeleton-based methods exhibit well robustness to cluttered backgrounds, carried items, and clothing variations. However, skeleton extraction faces the wrong human tracking and keypoints missing problems, especially under multiperson scenarios. To address above issues, this article proposes a novel gait recognition method using deep neural network specifically designed for multiperson scenarios. The method consists of individual gait separate module (IGSM) and fuzzy skeleton completion network (FU-SCN). To achieve effective human tracking, IGSM employs root–skeleton keypoints predictions and object keypoint similarity (OKS)-based skeleton calculation to separate individual gait sets when multiple persons exist. In addition, keypoints missing renders human poses estimation fuzzy. We propose FU-SCN, a deep neuro-fuzzy network, to enhances the interpretability of the fuzzy pose estimation via generating fine-grained gait representation. FU-SCN utilizes fuzzy bottleneck structure to extract features on low-dimension keypoints, and multiscale fusion to extract dissimilar relations of human body during walking on each scale. Extensive experiments are conducted on the CASIA-B dataset and our multigait dataset. The results show that our method is one of the SOTA methods and shows outperformance under complex scenarios. Compared with PTSN, PoseMapGait, JointsGait, GaitGraph2, and CycleGait, our method achieves an average accuracy improvement of 53.77%, 42.07%, 25.3%, 13.47%, and 9.5%, respectively, and it keeps low time cost with average 180 ms using edge devices.},

  abstract     = {In the field of fine-grained visual recognition (FGVR), the ability to resolve minute and often subtle differences between highly similar object categories is paramount. The advent of vision transformers (ViTs) has marked a significant advancement in this domain, primarily due to their capacity to model the intricate interdependencies among object parts represented as image patches. However, their inherent single-scale processing limitation hampers their effectiveness in FGVR tasks. Furthermore, the challenge of uncertainty inherent in FGVR tasks remains unresolved, necessitating the development of methods that bolster the robustness of these models, particularly across varying scales of visual features. We introduce a new plug-in module that can be seamlessly integrated into ViT, called dual guidance enabled fuzzy inference (DGEFI), which combines fuzzy inference with dual guidance mechanisms. Dual guidance includes scale-aware guidance and probability guidance. The former strengthens the model's focus on salient scales, and the latter refines the distinction between similar categories by optimizing intraclass compactness and interclass separability. Fuzzy inference enables the model to adaptively tweak the influence of distinct scales in the final decision-making phase, thereby enhancing the overall accuracy of recognition tasks. We demonstrate the versatility and efficacy of our DGEFI module by integrating it into several leading ViT backbones, including ViT, Swin, Mvitv2, and EVA-02. Empirical results exhibit exceptional performance gains, with the integration of DGEFI into EVA-02 remarkable accuracy improvements, reaching 93.6% on the CUB-200-2011 dataset and 94.5% on the NA-Birds dataset, respectively, improving over the state-of-the-art method 0.5% and 1.5%.},

  abstract     = {Logistics distribution plays a crucial role in smart logistics systems, with delivery time prediction being a key issue. Accurately predicting the delivery time of parcels positively impacts logistics companies, couriers, and customers. However, traditional delivery time prediction models struggle to handle potential noise and redundant information in existing features effectively. Moreover, the interaction between various features is often overlooked, and the combination of features is ignored in predicting results. In addition, previous prediction models based on fully connected networks, while capable of learning nonlinear mappings between features, fail to capture local information among features, leading to suboptimal performance on specific datasets. In addition, the intelligent system collects data from multiple sources, introducing ambiguity, which cannot be addressed by fully connected networks in reasoning about the ambiguity among various data. This work proposes a hybrid model using a fuzzy system and convolutional factorization machine (FSCFM) to address the abovementioned challenges. The FSCFM model integrates the local information capture capability of 1-D convolutional neural networks, the automatic feature combination ability of factorization machines, and the reasoning capability of fuzzy systems. This integration allows for a more accurate prediction of delivery times. Multiple experiments were conducted on a real logistics delivery dataset, confirming the practicality of the FSCFM model.},

In order to address the problem of facial expression recognition, this article proposes a fuzzy neural network enabled deep subspace domain adaptive fusion (FNN-DSDAF) by integrating the fuzzy logic module into the convolutional network structure. The fuzzy logic module integrates the powerful learning ability of deep networks can learn a set of robust Gaussian membership functions through a series of learnable Gaussian membership functions and logical operations. When training the classical normalized exponential loss function to force different categories of samples to maintain a certain distance in the learned feature space, FNN-DSDAF further uses the local hold loss function to make the local clusters within each category of samples more compact. The experimental results demonstrated that the fuzzy neural network had good feature decoupling ability and was suitable for facial expression understanding in real-world scenarios, and improve the accuracy, reliability, and robustness.},

  abstract     = {A mixed traffic environment of manual driving and automatic driving will become the norm in future intelligent transportation systems. The deep reinforcement learning (DRL) method has shown significant promise in cooperative control for traffic lights and connected autonomous vehicles (CAV) in a mixed-traffic environment. However, the uncertainty and noise in integrating agents' observations can lead to inadequate exploration of environmental data by DRL algorithms. Consequently, these algorithms are prone to overfitting and becoming trapped in local optimal, which limits the performance of control strategies. To more effectively harness the gathered environmental data and thereby facilitate improved decision-making by agents, a DRL-based cooperative control method with fuzzy feature fusion (F3DRL) was proposed in this article. First, the adaptive fuzzy inference module is implemented to adaptively mitigate information uncertainty as the data from CAV is aggregated. Then, a deep information extraction module was introduced and integrated with the output of the adaptive fuzzy inference module to establish a parallel feature fusion module. The adaptive fuzzy inference module mitigates uncertainty in the extracted traffic environmental states, while the deep information extraction module facilitates the extraction of a more comprehensive environmental representation. The fusion of features derived from these two distinct modules aids DRL agents in making better action selections, which significantly enhances the effectiveness and stability of the F3DRL method. In simulations, F3DRL significantly reduced travel and delay times, fuel consumption, and CO$_{2}$ emissions, outperforming both traditional and state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract     = {Due to its superiority in addressing label ambiguity, label distribution learning (LDL) has received wide attention from the community, such as image classification, emotion recognition, and big data processing. To efficiently process the data with label distribution, researchers have proposed to learn label-specific features (LSFs) that are the discriminative features for each class label. Although the LDL literature has seen many algorithms to learn LSFs, most of them ignore the characteristics of label distribution. Label distribution lies in real-value vector space with specific characteristics. In this article, we propose to learn label-distribution-specific features (LDSFs) for processing label distribution data by considering the structures of label distribution. We design a novel LDL method called LDL-LDSF to exploit LDSFs by considering the fuzzy cluster structures of label distribution data. First, LDL-LDSF learns LDSFs for the whole label distribution by jointly learning the label distribution and fuzzy C-means clustering. Second, it learns LDSFs for each label in a similar way. Third, it concatenates the learned LDSFs with the original features to deduce an LDL model. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments to justify that LDL-LDSF statistically outperforms several state-of-the-art LDL methods and validate the advantages of LDSFs for processing label distribution data.},

Owing to noise interference as well as differences in lesions between patients, the precise segmentation of SRF lesions is extremely difficult. To this end, a segmentation method (FRCNN) of SRF lesions, which combines fuzzy-rough-set-based feature discretization and convolutional neural network is proposed. First, each segmented region category is regarded as a fuzzy cluster, the fuzzy clustering is employed to derive the membership functions of all segmented region categories according to the number of fuzzy clusters, and the fuzzy relationship is determined by calculating the distance between pixels, thus accurately describing the sample blurriness in SD-OCT images. Second, pixel values are discretized by building a fuzzy-rough-set-based fitness function in a rough approximation space for the redundant information and noise in the image. This function is composed of the number of breakpoints and the average approximation precision of fuzzy rough sets of all segmented region categories, which can reduce the data size while ensuring high accuracy. Finally, the images after feature discretization are taken as input data, and the deep attention modules with hybrid kernel convolutions are used to capture multiscale information in the fully convolutional neural network architecture. Compared with advanced SD-OCT fundus image segmentation algorithms, FRCNN can achieve better segmentation results and effectively segment the SRF lesions, providing strong support for theoretical research and clinical applications.},

The grazing behavior recognition of herded sheep is a paramount issue in animal husbandry. Triaxial accelerometers of agricultural cyber-physical systems provide fine-grained observations of herded sheep but also generate temporal-spatial correlated acceleration data with inherently large-scale dimensions and massive volumes. These inherent characteristics of the data constrain the direct application of existing recognition algorithms. Motivated by the unique features of triaxial accelerometers of agricultural cyber-physical systems, we design a hybrid temporal-spatial fuzzy deep neural network (TSFDNN) approach for predicting the grazing behaviors of herded sheep. We first extract temporal-spatial features and reduce data dimensionality using bidirectional long short-term memory network and convolutional neural network in parallel, then control feature dimensions through principal component analysis, and finally use fuzzy neural network to achieve feature enhancement and category mapping. The superiority of the designed TSFDNN is demonstrated through its empirical comparison with other state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms by using two datasets from sheep pastures. Furthermore, we analyze the rationale of each component in the designed TSFDNN by performing several ablation studies. We also conduct robustness experiments with heterogeneous dimension reduction and optimization algorithms to explore the generalization capabilities of TSFDNN. The managerial implications of precisely identifying herded sheep behaviors for production decision-making, agricultural management, animal welfare, and ecological protection are discussed.},

However, the lack of interpretability limits the application of multimodal models, especially for those that require the security of systems, data, and users. A key challenge in enhancing the interpretability of the models is the tradeoff between transparency and model performance in terms of accuracy and computing efficiency. We propose a vision-language multimodal pretrained model called multiway-fuzzy-experts bidirectional retention network (VL-MFER), which is designed to effectively interpret model decision processes while enhancing the consistent mapping between text and image features. We first propose a bidirectional retention network to handle and integrate the cross-modal high-dimensional data, which can effectively enhance both the performance and inference efficiency. Then, to improve the interpretability of vision-language pretrained models such as the unified vision-language pretraining with mixture-of-modality-experts, we propose a multiway fuzzy experts pool based on multiple different layered deep neuro-fuzzy systems for diverse downstream tasks. After training on diverse datasets consisting of images, text, and paired image-text data, we fine-tuned models for multiple vision and vision-language tasks. Experimental results show that VL-MFER performs well in all performance metrics of downstream tasks, and VL-MFER leads to enhancements in transparency compared to other methods, while improving computational efficiency and reducing inference time by up to 13%.},

At the heart of our contribution is the introduction of Z-GT2-FLS, formed through the integration of Z-GT2-FS with the $\alpha$-plane representation. We show that the design flexibility of GT2-FLS is increased as it takes away the dependency of the secondary membership function definition from the primary membership function. For learning, we provide a solution to the curse of dimensionality problem alongside a method to seamlessly integrate deep learning (DL) optimizers. This article further presents a dual-focused Z-GT2-FLS within a DL framework, intending to learn Z-GT2-FLSs that are capable of achieving high-quality prediction intervals alongside high precision. In this context, we assign distinct roles for $\alpha _{k}$-plane-associated interval type-2 FLSs through a composite loss function. In addition, we extend the application of Z-GT2-FLS to predictive distribution estimation, proposing a DL framework to learn the inverse cumulative distribution function by predicting entire quantile levels. We first reformulate the output of Z-GT2-FLS to represent a quantile level function, thereby offering flexibility in generating desired quantiles through $\alpha$-planes. For learning, we propose a simultaneous quantile learning method alongside an adaptation mechanism to enhance learning performance. Through comparative analyses, we show that the Z-GT2-FLS excels in UQ compared to its fuzzy and DL counterparts. The contributions of this study underscore the versatility and superior performance of Z-GT2-FLS, positioning it as a valuable tool for UQ.},

To fill this research gap, we introduce an innovative time-aware model, fuzzy convolutional neural network long short-term memory (CNN-LSTM), designed specifically for NDVI prediction within the Chinese context. This model leverages the adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) to encapsulate the spatial nuances presented by the latitude, longitude, and elevation of the observation points. It also harnesses the power of 1-D convolution and LSTM to delineate temporal patterns. We incorporate a gate control mechanism to effectively blend the spatial intelligence rendered by ANFIS with the temporal insights captured by CNN-LSTM. We also combine deep neural fuzzy systems with traditional temporal neural networks. A comparative analysis spanning several temporal intervals highlights the superior performance of our proposed model in spatio-temporal forecasting in relation to conventional methods.

Such information processing also brings many challenges with existing privacy protection algorithms. On the one hand, the algorithms based on data encryption compromise the integrity of the original data or incur high computational and communication costs to some extent. On the other hand, algorithms based on distributed learning require frequent sharing of parameters between different computing nodes, which poses risks of leaking local model information and reducing global learning efficiency. To mitigate the impact of these issues, a quantum fuzzy federated learning (QFFL) algorithm is proposed. In the QFFL algorithm, a quantum fuzzy neural network is designed at the local computing nodes, which enhances data generalization while preserving data integrity. In global model, QFFL makes predictions through the quantum federated inference (QFI). QFI leads to a general framework for quantum federated learning on non-independent and identically distributed (IID) data with one-shot communication complexity, achieving privacy protection of local data and accelerating the global learning efficiency of the algorithm. The experiments are conducted on the COVID-19 and MNIST datasets, and the results indicate that QFFL demonstrates superior performance compared to the baselines, manifesting in faster training efficiency, higher accuracy, and enhanced security. In addition, based on the fidelity experiments and related analysis under four common quantum noise channels, the results demonstrated that it has good robustness against quantum noises, proving its applicability and practicality.},

  abstract     = {Utilizing electrocardiogram (ECG) to assess patients' cardiac health is currently the popular diagnostic method. This approach demonstrates high accuracy and helps alleviate the workload of medical professionals. However, the ECG signals consist of physiological signals with low-frequency and low-amplitude features, including various interference noises. Traditional feature extraction methods of classification models have proven ineffective in handling this data type. Moreover, previous classification models fail to capture the spatial and local structures within ECG data, resulting in learned features that do not include the key features of ECG signals. In addition, traditional models often adopt neural network as prediction modules, which are likewise inefficient in handling noise within the data. To end these issues, we propose a fuzzy-operated convolutional autoencoder (FOCAE) for the classification of ECG collected from wearable devices. The FOCAE model integrates convolutional autoencoder and fuzzy neural network, enabling it to learn high-quality features from noisy data to ensure the model's inferential capability. Furthermore, the FOCAE model inputs the learned features into the fuzzy neural network and fully connected network to obtain the classification results of ECG. Using fuzzy rules in the fuzzy neural network to describe the mapping between features and classification results enhances the robustness of the predictive outcomes. Some experimental results on a real ECG dataset validate the superior performance of the FOCAE model. The performance of the FOCAE model is superior to other three baseline models. Specifically, the Precision, Accuracy, and F1-Score of the FOCAE model are 0.971, 0.968, and 0.965, respectively.},

  abstract     = {Deep neuro-fuzzy systems (DNFS) have emerged as a hybrid machine learning approach that has found applications in a wide range of fields, including healthcare, transportation, and finance. However, we empirically demonstrate that DNFS is vulnerable to adversarial examples generated by various attack algorithms, raising numerous concerns about its reliability in security-critical scenarios. Existing defense mechanisms designed for deep neural networks (DNNs) often rely on specific knowledge of attacks and their parameters. Consequently, considering the diversity and uncertainty of potential attacking methods, designing defense strategies to enhance the robustness of DNN-based and DNFS-based models against multiple attacks still remains a challenging task. In this work, we propose a comprehensive defense mechanism, named perturbation destruction and information recovery (PDIR), for image classification tasks, that achieves practical robustness against multiple attacks. PDIR employs a combination of perturbation destruction through randomization and multiplication and information recovery using a pixel-to-pixel network. Experimental results demonstrate that PDIR outperforms state-of-the-art defenses, such as joint photographic experts group (JPEG), total variation minimization (TVM), adaptive diversity promoting (ADP), gradient alignment loss (GAL), diversifying vulnerabilities for enhanced robust generation of ensembles (DVERGE), and transferability reduced smooth, against both white-box and black-box attacks.},

  abstract     = {Deep learning has made remarkable achievements in many fields. However, although fuzzy neural networks with natural interpretability are widely used in prediction and control scenarios, there are very few studies on the deepening of fuzzy systems. By integrating rough set theory, fuzzy rough neural network has unique advantages benefiting from the complementarity of the fuzzy set theory and the rough set theory as well as the powerful learning ability of neural networks. Similarly, research on deep fuzzy rough neural networks is even rarer. In this article, in order to improve the performance of the fuzzy rough neural network and expand its application range, the deep fuzzy rough neural network model is constructed and optimized by stacking blocks of fuzzy rough neural network to imitate the deepening deep neural network based on multiobjective evolution. Each fuzzy rough neural network block is interpretable, and its stacked architecture also has high interpretability. To automatically generate deep fuzzy rough neural network models with high efficiency, a distributed parallel multiobjective neuroevolution framework is developed, thus blocks can be stacked flexibly and deep architecture can be optimized considering multiple optimization objectives of accuracy, interpretability, and generalization simultaneously. In addition, multiobjective evolution is combined with Wang–Mendel method, pseudoinverse, and backpropagation to effectively learn specific parameters. Finally, based on the time series prediction problems, the superiority of the multiobjective deep fuzzy rough neural network evolutionary framework is verified.},

  abstract     = {The surge in visual general Big Data has notably advanced data-driven deep learning-based computer vision technologies. Transformer-based methods shine in this era of Big Data because of their attention mechanism architecture and demand for massive data. However, the difficulty of obtaining medical images has caused the field to continue facing the limited-data challenge. In this article, we propose a novel deep neuro-fuzzy system named Fuzzy-ViT, which synergistically integrates fuzzy logic with the vision transformer (ViT) for cross-domain transfer learning from large-scale general data to medical image domain. Specifically, Fuzzy-ViT utilizes a ViT backbone pretrained on extensive general datasets, such as ImageNet-21 K, LAION-400 M, and LAION-2B, to extract rich general features. Then, a fuzzy attention cross-domain module (FACM) is presented to transfer general features to medical features, thereby enhancing the medical image analysis. Thanks to the fuzzy system transitioner (FST) in FACM, fuzzy and uninterpretable general domain features can be effectively converted into those needed in the medical domain. In addition, the attention mechanism smoother in FACM smoothes the conversion outcomes, ensuring a harmonious integration of the fuzzy system with the neural network architecture. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed Fuzzy-ViT achieves state of the art and satisfactory performance on popular medical image benchmarks (BreakHis and HCRF) with 93.37% and 97.22% F1 scores. Detailed ablation analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of our method for bridging large general visual and medical images.},

To address the limitations of previous models in practical transport operations, this study formulates a two-echelon vehicle routing problem with simultaneous pickup and delivery for multicommodity. Furthermore, the model uniquely emphasizes certain considerations, such as prioritizing product distribution based on production batches and allowing vehicles to engage in flexible product redistribution. Considering the computational challenges arising from the substantial data involved in real-world problem instances, a hybrid heuristic algorithm is proposed. Initially, a hybrid fuzzy C-Means is employed to decompose the problem by clustering chain stores, effectively reducing the solution space. Subsequently, an enhanced multipopulation genetic algorithm, integrated with variable neighborhood search, is introduced to solve the decomposed subproblems. Experimental validation conducted with a food enterprise located in Zhengzhou, China, provides empirical support for the efficacy of the proposed model. Multiple test scenarios further illustrate the superior performance of the proposed algorithm. This study holds significant practical and theoretical implications, offering insights to aid decision-makers in reducing transportation costs and advancing the development and application of vehicle routing problem models.},

With higher interpretability, convolutional fuzzy neural network (CFNN) becomes an alternative choice for the model of IoT applications. IoT applications are often latency-sensitive. By jointly utilizing computing power of IoT devices and edge servers, end-edge collaborative CFNN inference improves the insufficiency of local computing resources and reduces the latency of computing-intensive CFNN inference. However, the calculation amount of fuzzy layers is hard to get directly, bringing difficulty to CFNN partition. In addition, the profit of service providers is often ignored in existing work on distributed inference. In this article, an end-edge collaborative inference framework of CFNNs for big data-driven IoT, named DisCFNN, is proposed. Specifically, a novel CFNN structure and a method of fuzzy layer calculation amount assessment are designed at first. Next, computing resource allocation and CFNN partition decisions are generated on each edge server based on deep reinforcement learning. Then, each IoT device sends the request of CFNN inference service to a certain edge server or infer the whole CFNN locally according to the task offloading strategy obtained through many-to-one matching game.

  abstract     = {Gearboxes have become an essential part of connecting various components in the machine and transmitting power. A fault in the gearbox will cause the entire mechanical equipment to stop working, causing economic losses and safety hazards. Previous fault diagnosis models for gearbox used the vibration signals as input features. They designed a variety of feature extraction modules to learn the information contained in the vibration signals. However, the latent features learned by previous models have poor interpretability and robustness, so the results are often less robust. Moreover, previous models used for gearbox are usually end-to-end black box models, which cannot provide interpretive information, so it is difficult to handle the uncertain information in the vibration signals. Therefore, we propose a multi-scale fuzzy variational autoencoder (MFVAE) using a fuzzy neural network for big data-based fault diagnosis in gearbox. The big data technology can automatically collect vibration signals from sensors and provide high-quality training samples for fault diagnosis models. The MFVAE model first uses two variational autoencoders of different sizes to extract the latent features of the gearbox vibration signal. Subsequently, the MFVAE model fuses low-level latent features and high-level latent features in proportion to form the final head features, which are used to diagnose gearbox faults. Finally, the MFVAE model inputs the head features into a prediction layer to diagnose the fault. The prediction layer comprises a fully connected network and a fuzzy neural network. Experimental results on a real gearbox dataset verify the outstanding performance of the MFVAE model.},

  abstract     = {Conducting and interacting with an orchestra is a multimodal process that integrates channels, such as music, visual cues, posture, and gestures, to convey artistic intent accurately. For robots, discerning human emotions from these channels can enhance human–machine interactions. Currently, gesture recognition systems in orchestras focus more on rhythm, speed, and dynamics, whereas studying emotional factors in orchestra conducting music requires more profound research. We introduced the Facial Expression and Orchestra Gesture Emotion (FEGE) dataset, consisting of eight different emotions for recognition. This article introduces a fuzzy multimodal fusion network (FMFN) based on fuzzy logic, which operates in multifeature spaces and is designed for emotion recognition in bimodal tasks involving facial expressions and orchestra-conducting gestures. The network maps facial expressions and gestures into a multifeature space through bimodal processing, learns unique and shared representations, and decodes them using classifiers optimized by FMFN parameters. Finally, it processes data uncertainty and fuzziness using a fuzzy logic system, improving the classification decision process to enhance the robustness and adaptability of emotion recognition tasks in bimodal visual modalities. Experimental results on the FEGE dataset confirmed the effectiveness of our network. The proposed bimodal fusion network achieved an accuracy of 89.16% in bimodal emotion recognition, which is approximately a 21% improvement over single-modal recognition results. This approach can also be better applied to human–machine interaction systems, particularly in orchestra conducting training, aiming to enhance the most critical emotional factors conveyed during the conducting process, thus elevating the depth of artistic intent.},

  abstract     = {Fuzzy integral fusion has been shown as an effective tool for enhancing classification accuracy while also achieving explainability. With the deep learning boom in the past decade, many researchers have investigated the advantages of fusing various deep neural networks (DNNs) with fuzzy integral techniques in computer vision. However, recent studies focus on only the explainable fusion process. Thus, features learned by each DNN are difficult to understand. Moreover, DNNs are usually trained on the ImageNet dataset, whereas the effectiveness of applying the fuzzy integral methods to this dataset is yet to be investigated. This is the gap that motivates our research study. To address this issue, we explore fuzzy integral fusion classification models that make both the fusion process and extracted features explainable. Specifically, we use two well-known fuzzy integral fusion methods [i.e., Sugeno integral (SI) and Choquet integral (ChI)] to combine three explainable deep learning features (i.e., shape, texture, and color) in a manner that mimics the human visual recognition process. The originality of our work includes the emphasis on complete explainability in the classification process, the investigation of applying fuzzy integral methods to the ImageNet dataset, and extensive experimental validation of the effectiveness of fuzzy integral. Computational experiments show that fuzzy integral fusion can improve classification accuracy by 14.6% compared with an individual DNN on subsets derived from the ImageNet dataset. Furthermore, fuzzy integral fusion helps understand contributions, relationships, and interactions among the three features (shape, texture, and color) for each class, providing convincing evidence for the final classification result. Consequently, the proposed models not only achieve impressive performance, but also provide a thorough understanding of how these models work.},

In response, this study explores a control strategy for addressing the time-varying nature of the suspension system. The time-varying characteristics of the suspension system are initially revealed through finite element analysis and mathematical model representation. Subsequently, a double closed-loop control system for suspension force is designed, including a time-invariant suspension force model (TISFM) and a data-driven fuzzy sliding mode observer (DDFSMO). The TISFM is used to conduct a time-invariant direct suspension force control system, whereas the DDFSMO is designed on the basis of the TISFM to compensate for the error between the TISFM and complete suspension force model. The time-varying suspension control system is successfully converted into a time-invariant one by the combined action of the TISFM and DDFSMO. Finally, the validity of the proposed control strategy for time-varying suspension system is validated.},

We apply fuzzy systems to deep learning. Compared with traditional fuzzy inference systems, this deep fuzzy network has the ability to generate feature representations. Echo state network (ESN) is a special type of recurrent neural network, which consists of an input layer, a randomly generated large fixed hidden layer (called a reservoir), and an adaptive output layer. The advantages of our method over ESNs are that it is capable of mining and capturing hidden features layer-by-layer within reservoirs and has better approximation performance. In order to remove redundancy, the output layer weights are trained by structured sparse learning, which enhances the generalizability and robustness of the method. Evaluation of our method by testing it on tissue-specific datasets shows that it outperforms existing tools.},

  abstract     = {Brain networks are commonly used to identify cognitive neurobehavioral and brain conscious disorders. Most of the studies on state networks focus on the characterization and expression of resting-state brain networks, but there are few studies on dynamic brain networks. In fact, the analysis of dynamic brain networks can find more valuable information, because it can dynamically depict the dynamic characteristics of brain networks from the time dimension. However, too much consideration of the expression of dynamic networks will naturally hide many of its static characteristics. Therefore, this article proposes a tense-based multiview fusion fuzzy learning model (TM-FL) to identify dynamic brain networks. TM-FL relearns the features of adjacent networks in high-dimensional space, mining the dynamic features between adjacent brain networks. Best of all, TM-FL can also capture resting information in the brain network at different times in the source space. The fuzzy TSK-based TM-FL also possesses the strong interpretability inherent in fuzzy systems. In this article, a fusion mechanism is designed to effectively integrate decision support under dynamic and static features, and enhance the classification and generalization performance of the proposed fuzzy classification model. For the proposed fusion fuzzy mechanism, Simon entropy is cleverly set as the regular term of the objective function, which not only constrains the decision weight, but also avoids the embarrassment of making mistakes in a leading decision. Experimental results show that TM-FL has good classification, generalization and interpretable capabilities in recognition of multichannel epileptic electroencephalographic signals.},

  abstract     = {Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals, as a reliable biological indicator, have been widely used in fatigue driving detection due to their capacity to reflect a driver's cognitive and neural response state. However, EEG signals have problems such as imbalanced data distribution, significant differences between subjects, and complex scenes, which affect the detection effect. Small commonalities between input objects can be interpreted as important information about an entire sample. Therefore, to retain as much information as possible, we design a new approach for integrating fuzzy features, comprehensive adaptive interpretable Takagi– Sugeno– Kang fuzzy classifier (CAI-TSK-FC). It not only captures the features of multiple subclassifiers more efficiently and alleviates the dataset imbalance problem, but it can also reduce the accumulation of error information by randomly retaining fuzzy rules as well as normalization. Finally, we linearly combine the results of multiple subclassifiers to comprehensively consider the learning effect of multiple subclassifiers to adapt to different subjects and datasets. Experiments conducted on both self-made and public datasets show that CAI-TSK-FC has good performance and interpretability on different EEG fatigue driving datasets. In comparison to existing methods, it achieves an accuracy improvement of 3.15% and 1.52%, respectively, as well as a specificity improvement of 4.72% and 0.91%, respectively.},

  abstract     = {Epistasis detection (ED) was widely used for identifying potential risk disease variants in the human genome. A statistically meaningful ED typically requires a more extensive dataset to detect complex disease-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms, but a single institution generally possesses limited genome data. Thus, it is necessary to collect multi-institutional genome data to carry out research together. However, concerns regarding privacy and trustworthiness impede the sharing of massive genome data. Therefore, this article proposes a novel federated ED framework with the sequence perturbation privacy-preserving method to address the limitation of distributed data sharing (FedED-SegNAS). First, to address the lack of interpretability in deep learning models, integrate fuzzy logic into convolutional neural networks (CNNs), promoting the capabilities of CNN to represent the ambiguities of genomic data with high interpretability and reasonable accuracy. Second, consider using the neural architecture search method to optimize the federated neural architecture. Specifically, selecting the particle swarm optimization algorithm to automatically search the optimal neural architecture at different stages in federated learning (FL) based on adaptive multiobjectives decreases the communication cost and improves communication efficiency. Furthermore, to ensure the security of the parameter transfer process, design the sequence perturbation privacy-preserving method, grouping the upload and download parameters of FL and randomly perturbing the group number so that the attacker cannot obtain the corresponding result between the group number and parameters. Its rationality and security have been proven. The experiments conducted on a range of datasets demonstrate the superiority of the framework over state-of-the-art ED methods. FedED-SegNAS can reduce network complexity while protecting genome data security.},

  abstract     = {Sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome (SAHS) seriously affects human sleep, so it is necessary to find the disease as early as possible. However, most of traditional models use convolutional neural networks, which are ineffective in capturing image details. In addition, due to the fuzzy and uncertain information in the SaO2 signal image, the detection accuracy of traditional models is low. Therefore, we propose a vision transformer enabled deep fuzzy neural network (ViTDFNN) to detect SAHS in an Internet of Medical Things platform. The ViTDFNN model can analyze the patients vital signs and sleep status on time and identify potential SAHS conditions. It first uses a vision transformer to learn the features of the image so that global information and long-range dependencies can be learned. Subsequently, it uses VGG to extract the features of the image to learn the local information, which is convenient for distinguishing the texture, edge, and other details. Finally, it linearly fuses the two image features and inputs them into a deep fuzzy neural network (DFNN) and fully connected network to detect the patients symptoms. The DFNN can convert each deterministic pixel into an uncertain pixel, thereby solving the fuzzy and uncertain information. In addition, the ViTDFNN model also uses a masked strategy to implement the image reconstruction for reducing the dependence on the labeled image. We validated the superiority of the ViTDFNN on a real sleep dataset. The scores of the ViTDFNN model under the F1-Score, Recall and Accuracy metrics are 0.994, 0.992 and 0.994, respectively.},

This framework utilizes fuzzy Bayesian data imputation to minimize filling errors and provide a reliable data foundation for decision systems. The framework includes a fuzzy Bayesian module for imputing missing data, resulting in complete datasets and enhancing interpretability. Additionally, a multifactor prediction model is established within an encode-decode framework, incorporating dimension-temporal cross-attention layers to capture and extract correlations among multiple factors. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed model outperforms single-factor prediction, achieving a 13.6% increase in correlation. These results validate the effectiveness of the imputation module in enhancing forecasting precision and reliability, thereby assisting agricultural DSS in meeting evolving demands.},

  abstract     = {Predicting the future trajectories of dynamic traffic actors is the Gordian knot for autonomous vehicles to achieve collision-free driving. Most existing works suffer from a gap in characterizing the evolving interactions of scenario components and ensuring the physical feasibility of predictions, particularly in highly heterogeneous scenarios. Therefore, we propose an enhanced multistream interaction network (EMSIN), which is devoted to providing accurate trajectory predictions. The EMSIN highlights several threads of high-level time-varying interactions, including agent-traffic semantic, self-trend, and agent–agent dependencies. A novelly designed trend-aware mechanism is developed to capture the self-trend interactions from different representation subspaces sufficiently. To model the spatial information of traffic agents and extract their evolutions, we present a dynamic adaptive graph convolutional network that extends previously predefined graph paradigms. The adaptive and dynamic graphs in the EMSIN are created using learnable node embeddings, allowing the model to discern interaction strengths without additional attention modules. Finally, all high-level feature spaces elaborating multistream interactions are fused to generate possible agent actions with corresponding confidence values. Comprehensive experiments conducted on both L5kit and nuScenes datasets demonstrate that the EMSIN surpasses its counterparts, boasting smaller prediction errors and faster inference times. This study also introduces a fuzzy-based metric to probe the physical feasibility of predicted trajectories, providing valuable insights into appraising the performance of various prediction models from the perspective of fuzziness.},

Social media platforms are the epitome of sharing individual thoughts and feelings through textual posts and linguistic cues. Therefore, the textual modality from social media posts can be leveraged for detecting early signs of stress, depression or other mental health conditions, accordingly. Existing methods mainly focus on the feature engineering, shallow learning, and employing of deep learning architectures to improve the mental state recognition performance. Seldom the study uses an established knowledge-base that is available to model mentalization and emotional aspect to improving the depression and stress recognition. In this regard, we propose emotion aware contrastive networks (EAC-net) that leverages the existing knowledge-base and propose some new ones to model the emotional and mentalization aspect in order to improve the recognition of stress and depression state from textual posts. Furthermore, we propose a feature-level fusion and weighting mechanism using gated recurrent units (GRUs) and self-attention layers to weight and select the important features. Last, the EAC-Net uses a supervised contrastive learning strategy to train the network. The proposed method is evaluated on four publicly available datasets. Experimental results reveal that the EAC-Net achieves state-of-the-art results by outperforming baselines and existing methods by atleast 1.86%, 0.72%, 3.43%, and 3.64% on four publicly available datasets using F1-measure as the evaluation metric.},

First, we combine multimodal data, namely text, audio, and images, to extract intrinsic feature representations. Second, our model incorporates the fuzzy-deep neural network learning module, infused with fuzzy logic principles to enhance adaptability to the inherent vagueness in sentiment expressions. Furthermore, we integrate the dual attention mechanism that dynamically focuses on pivotal aspects within multimodal data, refining feature extraction for heightened context-awareness. Rigorous validation across three datasets, including the Multimodal Corpus of Sentiment Intensity dataset, the Multimodal Opinion Sentiment and Emotion Intensity dataset, and the Chinese Single and Multimodal Sentiment dataset, demonstrates the model's superior performance in capturing the intricacies of human emotions.},

  abstract     = {Multimodal sentiment analysis (MSA) aims at teaching computers or robotics to understand human sentiment with diverse multimodal signals, including audio, vision, and text. Current MSA approaches primarily concentrate on devising fusion strategies for multimodal signals and trying to learn better multimodal joint representations. However, employing multimodal signals directly is not appropriate since the human psychological states are fuzzy and cannot be categorized easily, which undermines the effectiveness of existing methods. In this article, we regard the natural fuzziness of human sentiments can be observed as two types as follows: 1) objective fuzziness introduced by human expression and 2) subjective fuzziness caused by the complexity of human affection. Based on the assumption, we proposed a novel method termed Joint Objective and Subjective Fuzziness Denoising (JOSFD), which introduced fuzzy logic into the multimodal fusion process and sentiment decision process to overcome the objective and subjective fuzziness. Specifically, our JOSFD method contains two key modules as follows: 1) modality-specific fuzzification module leveraging uncertainty estimation and fuzzy logic to overcome the influence of objective fuzziness in different modalities in multimodal fusion. 2) Attitude-intensity representation disentangling that learns joint representations for human attitude and sentiment strength separately and further employs fuzzy logic to decide the sentiment analysis results. We evaluate our proposed JOSFD method on the following three widely used MSA benchmark datasets: 1) CMU-MOSI, 2) CMU-MOSEI, and 3) CH-SIMS. Extensive experiments demonstrate our proposed JOSFD method outperforms recent state-of-the-art methods.},

Moreover, the gaps between sentiments with different degrees are small in one modality, but the gaps between sentiments with same degree are large across different modalities. The imbalance leads to incorrect recognition for different sentiment degrees. Since the fuzzy network shows excellent performance in integrating data from multiple modalities, this study constructs a fuzzy cognition-based dynamic fusion network (Fcdnet) for MSA. The Fcdnet dynamically integrates sentiment scores across different modalities using a fuzzy cognition fusion mechanism, significantly enhancing the accuracy of identifying divergent sentiments across modalities. Additionally, a disparity balancing module is proposed to normalize the representations between different modality features by penalizing the similarity of sentiments with different degrees and rewarding the separability of sentiments with same degree.
