  abstract     = {Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Schizophrenia (SCZ) are prominent neurodegenerative conditions and leading causes of dementia, resulting in progressive cognitive decline and memory loss. Several studies reveal that early detection and intervention can slow the progression of AD and SCZ. Numerous machine learning algorithms including twin support vector machine (TSVM) have been proposed for the early diagnosis of AD and SCZ. However, TSVM grapples with significant challenges: 1) TSVM relies on the hinge loss function, resulting in susceptibility to noise and instability; 2) TSVM encounters challenges in effectively handling large datasets, attributed to its computational complexity and dependence on matrix inversions. Keeping in view the aforementioned challenges, in this article, we propose a novel granular ball twin support vector machine with pinball loss function (Pin-GBTSVM). Pin-GBTSVM employs granular balls, as opposed to individual data points, as inputs for constructing a classifier, while also leveraging the pinball loss function to attain a heightened level of noise insensitivity. The proposed Pin-GBTSVM persists in facing challenges associated with the absence of integration of the structural risk minimization (SRM) principle and the requirement for matrix inversions. We further propose a novel large-scale Pin-GBTSVM (Pin-LGBTSVM). Pin-LGBTSVM achieves two crucial objectives: 1) it eliminates the necessity for matrix inversions, streamlining the computational efficiency of Pin-GBTSVM; and 2) it integrates the SRM principle by incorporating regularization terms, effectively addressing the concern of overfitting. Experiments are conducted on University of California Irvine (UCI), knowledge extraction based on evolutionary learning (KEEL), and normally distributed clustered (NDC) benchmark datasets, where both the proposed Pin-GBTSVM and Pin-LGBTSVM models consistently outperform the baseline models in terms of generalization performance. Furthermore, we implemented the proposed Pin-GBTSVM and Pin-LGBTSVM models on SCZ and Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) datasets, showcasing the model's efficacy in real-world applications.},

  abstract     = {Online platforms are nurturing social interactions, yet regrettably, they have also led to the proliferation of antisocial behaviors such as cyberbullying, trolling, and hate speech on a global scale. The identification of hate speech and aggression has become indispensable in the fight against cyberbullying and online harassment. Cyberbullying encompasses the use of aggressive and offensive language, including rude, insulting, hateful, and teasing comments, to inflict harm on individuals through social media platforms. Human moderation is both sluggish and costly, rendering it impractical in light of the exponential growth of data. Consequently, automated detection systems are imperative to effectively combat trolling. This study addresses the challenge of automatically discerning cyberbullying in tweets sourced from a publicly available cyberbullying dataset. The proposed methodology leverages the robustly optimized bidirectional encoder representations from transformers approach (RoBERTa), integrating principle component analysis (PCA) extracted global vectors for word representation (GLOVE) word embedding features. Furthermore, our proposed approach is benchmarked against state-of-the-art machine learning, deep learning, and transformer-based methods, utilizing the GLOVE word embedding technique. Statistical analyses reveal that our proposed model outperforms its counterparts, achieving a 0.98 accuracy and recall rate with 0.97 of precision and F1 score in detecting cyberbullying tweets. Results from $k$-fold cross validation further corroborate the superior performance of our proposed model.},

  abstract     = {As a bridge between the deaf people and the outside, sign language primarily involves hand movements, complemented by intricate facial and body expressions. To enhance the engagement of sign language users in today's prevalent online social activities, it is necessary to incorporate video sign language recognition (SLR) technology into social multimedia. However, current multimodal video SLR methods predominantly rely on limited data, leading to poor robustness and susceptibility to overfitting. Additionally, most works employed simple concatenation, failing to explore effective interaction among different modalities. To address these issues, we propose a cross-attention modal fusion network (CAMFuse) based on red-green-blue (RGB) and skeleton to achieve more robust video SLR. First, CAMFuse introduces a comprehensive bimodal framework that considers coarse-grained features from body and fine-grained features from hands and face. Second, departing from previous skeleton-based video SLR methods represented through graphs, CAMFuse adopts heatmap volumes to reduce storage and promote subsequent interaction. Last, a space-time cross-attention fusion (ST-CAF) module is applied to the deeper feature extraction stages of RGB and skeleton, aiming to mine complementary relationships between them and learn the excellent information from each other, reducing the independence among modalities. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed CAMFuse, outperforming the state-of-the-art methods on the popular isolated video sign language datasets WLASL-2000 (53.12%) and AUTSL (96.18%) dataset.},

  abstract     = {With the widespread adoption of multimedia web APIs (API) in web and mobile applications, a substantial proliferation of these APIs is observed. These APIs have streamlined development processes, reducing both time and costs. Nevertheless, identifying the required APIs from the vast array of options has emerged as a significant challenge. Collaborative filtering (CF)-based recommendation technologies have demonstrated their efficiency in presenting developers with potentially useful APIs. However, these methods often suffer from popularity bias, i.e., popular APIs tend to dominate the recommendation lists. This imbalance in recommendation opportunities among APIs hinders the growth of the multimedia API ecosystem. To mitigate the popularity bias produced by CF-based API recommendation methods, this article introduces a novel debiasing strategy that combines a log postprocessing adjustment (LPA) with determinant point process (DPP). Specifically, the LPA is employed during the prediction phase to yield a more balanced set of candidate APIs. Then, DPP is utilized to generate recommendation lists that are not just relevant but also diverse in terms of API popularity. Experimental results reveal that our proposed method surpasses existing state-of-the-art approaches in multimedia API recommendation, excelling in both accuracy and the capability to mitigate popularity bias effectively.},

  abstract     = {Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) aims to identify specific sentiment elements in social multimedia content. To address aspect extraction and sentiment prediction together, recent studies have utilized a sequence tagging approach, mainly leveraging pretrained language models (PLMs) with specific architecture and auxiliary subtasks. However, these approaches often overlook task-related knowledge and struggle to scale across different domains. With advances in large language models (LLMs), there is a rising trend in constructing generative ABSA models. Nevertheless, these techniques tend to emphasize specific frameworks and overlook comprehensive knowledge representation. To address these challenges while leveraging the advantages of LLM and PLM-based methods, we propose a hybrid knowledge integration framework (HFABGKI). It employs a parameter-efficient fine-tuning technique, allowing for plug-and-play integration with existing LLMs. To bridge the LLM and PLM-based models, HF-ABGKI incorporates a global label semantic representation for potential aspect tokens, in which a simplified gating mechanism is proposed to filter useful information. Experimental results from six public social multimedia datasets demonstrate that our approach can accurately extract aspect terms and predict their sentiment polarity, achieving state-of-the-art performance compared to existing ABSA methods.},

  abstract     = {Analyzing multimedia data, which often comprises diverse views such as text, images, and videos, presents unique challenges for data processing. Deep matrix factorization (DMF) provides an elegant way to obtain reduced-dimensional representation of the multiview data produced by multimedia. Compared with single-layer matrix factorization, DMF can better discover the hierarchical information in a layerwise technique. However, the existing multiview DMF methods still have several problems: 1) the standard DMF using Frobenius norm fails to process data containing noises and outliers; 2) most DMF methods neglect to exploit the feature diversity to learn a more discriminative representation; and 3) in graph learning methods for DMF, the $k$NN method is utilized to construct data graphs, which results in many incorrect neighbor assignments. To address these issues, a robust multiview deep nonnegative matrix factorization with feature diversity and optimal graph learning (RMvDNMF-FG) is proposed for clustering in this article. Specifically, a noise-insensitive logarithmic loss function is designed to measure the factorization error, inner products of basis vectors are minimized to achieve feature diversity for obtaining discriminative representation, and an optimal graph construction strategy is proposed to maintain the geometric structure of the data. To solve the proposed model, we explore an iterative updating algorithm that makes the objective function decrease consistently as the number of iterations increases. Additionally, the convergence proof of the iterative updating algorithm is provided with detailed mathematical analysis. Furthermore, through numerous comparative experiments with eleven state-of-the-art algorithms on five multiview datasets, the effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated.},

Despite these promising findings, many of these studies are limited by small sample sizes and traditional observational methods, leaving a gap in our understanding of music’s broader impact on mental health. In response to these limitations, this study introduces a novel approach that combines generalized linear mixed models (GLMM) with propensity score matching (PSM) to explore the relationship between music listening and stress levels among social media users diagnosed with anxiety, depression, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Our research not only identifies associative patterns between music listening and stress but also provides a more rigorous examination of potential causal effects, taking into account demographic factors such as education level, gender, and age. Our findings reveal that across all mental health conditions, music listening is significantly associated with reduced stress levels, with an observed 21.3% reduction for anxiety, 15.4% for depression, and 19.3% for PTSD. Additionally, users who listened to music were more likely to report a zero stress score, indicating a stronger relaxation effect. Further, our analysis of demographic variations shows that age and education level influence the impact of music on stress reduction, highlighting the potential for personalized interventions. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of music’s therapeutic potential, particularly in crafting interventions tailored to the diverse needs of different populations.},

At the same time, ensuring high-quality, low-latency streaming is difficult due to the demands of real-time interaction, immersive rendering, and bandwidth optimization. To address these issues, we propose adaptive social metaverse streaming (ASMS), a novel streaming system based on federated multiagent proximal policy optimization (F-MAPPO). ASMS leverages F-MAPPO, which integrates federated learning (FL) and deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to dynamically adjust streaming bit rates while preserving user privacy. Experimental results show that ASMS improves user experience by at least 14% compared to existing streaming methods across various network conditions. Therefore, ASMS enhances the social metaverse experience by providing seamless and immersive streaming, even in dynamic and resource-constrained networks, while ensuring that sensitive user data remain on local devices.},

  abstract     = {The massive expansion of social media and the rapid growth in multimedia content on it has resulted in a growing interest in visual content analysis and classification. There are now a good number of studies that focus on identifying hateful and offensive content in social media posts. The social media content is often analyzed through automated algorithmic approaches, with respect to being unsuitable or harmful for different groups such as women and children. There is, however, a noticeable gap in the exploration of positive content, particularly in the case of multimodal content such as GIFs. Therefore, the present work attempted to address this gap by introducing a high-quality annotated dataset of animated GIFs. The dataset provides for two subtasks: 1) subtask 1 involves binary classification, determining whether a GIF provides emotional support; and 2) subtask 2 involves multiclass classification, wherein the GIFs are categorized into three different emotional support categories. The data annotation quality is assessed using Fleiss' kappa. Various unimodal models, utilizing text-only and image-only approaches, are implemented. Additionally, an effective multimodal approach is proposed that combines visual and textual information for detecting emotional support in animated GIFs. Both sequence and frame-level visual features are extracted from animated GIFs and utilized for classification tasks. The proposed multimodal long-term spatiotemporal model employs a weighted late fusion technique. The results obtained show that the proposed multimodal model outperformed the implemented unimodal models for both subtasks. The proposed LTST model achieved a weighted F1-score of 0.8304 and 0.7180 for subtask 1 and subtask 2, respectively. The experimental work and analysis confirm the suitability of the dataset and proposed algorithmic model for the task.},

  abstract     = {Sensor-based human activity recognition (HAR) usually suffers from the problem of insufficient annotated data, due to the difficulty in labeling the intuitive signals of wearable sensors. To this end, recent advances have adopted handcrafted operations or generative models for data augmentation. The handcrafted operations are driven by some physical priors of human activities, e.g., action distortion and strength fluctuations. However, these approaches may face challenges in maintaining semantic data properties. Although the generative models have better data adaptability, it is difficult for them to incorporate important action priors into data generation. This article proposes a differentiable prior-driven data augmentation framework for HAR. First, we embed the handcrafted augmentation operations into a differentiable module, which adaptively selects and optimizes the operations to be combined together. Then, we construct a generative module to add controllable perturbations to the data derived by the handcrafted operations and further improve the diversity of data augmentation. By integrating the handcrafted operation module and the generative module into one learnable framework, the generalization performance of the recognition models is enhanced effectively. Extensive experimental results with three different classifiers on five public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.

However, this surge also heightens the risks of unauthorized access, privacy breaches, and cyberattacks. Consequently, ensuring the secure and efficient transmission and storage of multimedia content is of paramount importance. This article presents a robust encryption scheme for secure image transmission, utilizing a novel one-dimensional chaotic map characterized by random and complex dynamics, validated through NIST test and meticulous evaluation. Key matrices are derived from the chaotic map, with the SHA-256 hash of random, nonoverlapping blocks of the input image influencing the initial conditions, thereby ensuring resistance to differential cryptanalysis. The encryption process encompasses a dual shuffling mechanism: an adaptive shuffling guided by the chaotic key, followed by orbital shuffling, which rearranges pixel positions by segmenting the image into distinct orbital patterns. This is complemented by a feedback diffusion technique that ensures each pixel’s encryption is influenced by neighboring values and the keys employed. Extensive evaluation with multimodal images demonstrates the scheme’s versatility, with significant resilience against various cryptographic attacks, as evidenced by thorough assessments. Comparative analysis further highlights the superiority of the proposed scheme over state-of-the-art approaches. These attributes position the proposed scheme as a highly effective solution for contemporary digital security challenges.},

  abstract     = {Generative adversarial networks (GANs) have demonstrated potential in enhancing keyframe selection and video reconstruction via adversarial training among unsupervised approaches. Nevertheless, GANs struggle to encapsulate the intricate spatiotemporal dynamics in videos, which is essential for producing coherent and informative summaries. To address these challenges, we introduce an unsupervised video summarization framework that synergistically integrates temporal–spatial semantic graphs (TSSGraphs) with a bilinear additive attention (BAA) mechanism. TSSGraphs are designed to effectively model temporal and spatial relationships among video frames by combining temporal convolution and dynamic edge convolution, thereby extracting salient features while mitigating model complexity. The BAA mechanism enhances the framework’s ability to capture critical motion information by addressing feature sparsity and eliminating redundant parameters, ensuring robust attention to significant motion dynamics. Experimental assessments on the SumMe and TVSum benchmark datasets reveal that our method attains improvements of up to 4.0% and 3.3% in F-score, respectively, compared to current methodologies. Moreover, our system demonstrates diminished parameter overhead throughout training and inference stages, particularly excelling in contexts with significant motion content.},

  abstract     = {Few-shot learning (FSL) aims to train a model using a minimal number of samples and subsequently apply this model to recognize unseen classes. Recently, metric-based methods mainly focus on exploring the relationship between the support set and the query set through attention mechanism in solving FSL problems. However, these methods typically employ unidirectional computation when calculating the attention relationship between support and query. This unidirectional approach not only limits the depth and breadth of knowledge acquisition but may also lead to mismatched patches between support and query, thereby affecting the overall performance of the model. In this article, we propose a bidirectional patch-aware attention network for few-shot learning (BPAN) to address this issue. First, we extract subimages via grid cropping and feed them into the learned feature extractor to obtain patch features. Moreover, self-attention is used to assign different weights to patch features and reconstruct them. Then, PFCAM is proposed to mutually explore the patch feature relationship between the support set and the support set, further reconstruct the patch features, and aggregate multiple patch features of each image into one feature through a learnable parameter matrix for the purpose of prediction. Finally, the template for each class is constructed to extend the results of PFCAM to the few-shot classification scenario. Experiments on three benchmark datasets show that BPAN achieves superior performance.},

  abstract     = {Addressing the bias problem in multimodal zero-shot learning tasks is challenging due to the domain shift between seen and unseen classes, as well as the semantic gap across different modalities. To tackle these challenges, we propose a multimodal disentangled fusion network (MDFN) that unifies the class embedding space for multimodal zero-shot learning. MDFN exploits feature disentangled variational autoencoder (FD-VAE) in two branches to distangle unimodal features into modality-specific representations that are semantically consistent and unrelated, where semantics are shared within classes. In particular, semantically consistent representations and unimodal features are integrated to retain the semantics of the original features in the form of residuals. Furthermore, multimodal conditional VAE (MC-VAE) in two branches is adopted to learn cross-modal interactions with modality-specific conditions. Finally, the complementary multimodal representations achieved by MC-VAE are encoded into a fusion network (FN) with a self-adaptive margin center loss (SAMC-loss) to predict target class labels in embedding forms. By learning the distance among domain samples, SAMC-loss promotes intraclass compactness and interclass separability. Experiments on zero-shot and news event datasets demonstrate the superior performance of MDFN, with the harmonic mean improved by 27.2% on the MMED dataset and 5.1% on the SUN dataset.},

Nevertheless, LLMs face inherent challenges in tasks involving both natural language and molecular modalities. Although there has been some research progress on these tasks, two challenges remain unresolved: modeling the differences in representation format between natural language and molecular modalities, and capturing subtle differences under an instruction-tuned paradigm. To address these two challenges, this article proposes a two-stage training framework to build molecular knowledge-enhanced LLM, named Mol-LLM. The first stage utilizes the multitask instruction tuning method to tackle the modality differences between natural language and molecular sequence. The second stage is the direct preference optimization training strategy with three random preference actions to capture subtle differences under the instruction-tuned paradigm. Extensive experiments have demonstrated the state-of-the-art performances of the model Mol-LLM proposed in this study, including mol2mol, text2text, mol2text, and text2mol task. The effectiveness of the module has been further verified through ablation studies, and the generalizability has been confirmed by additional supportive experiments.},

Traditionally, rating the expressive language level and use (EXLA) item in JERI relies on retrospective video analysis conducted by qualified professionals, thus incurring substantial labor costs. This study introduces a multimodal behavioral signal-processing framework designed to analyze both child and caregiver behaviors automatically, thereby rating EXLA. Initially, raw audio and video signals are segmented into concise intervals via voice activity detection, speaker diarization and speaker age classification, serving the dual purpose of eliminating nonspeech content and tagging each segment with its respective speaker. Subsequently, we extract an array of audio-visual features, encompassing our proposed interpretable, hand-crafted textual features, end-to-end audio embeddings and end-to-end video embeddings. Finally, these features are fused at the feature level to train a linear regression model aimed at predicting the EXLA scores. Our framework has been evaluated on the largest in-the-wild database currently available under the CST program. Experimental results indicate that the proposed system achieves a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.768 against the expert ratings, evidencing promising performance comparable to that of human experts.},

To address this issue, we propose multimodal mortality prediction-multilevel semantic hypergraph (MMP-MSH), a medical multimodal model based on a multilevel semantic hypergraph. Specifically, we approach clinical text in two ways. First, we employ a CNN to extract textual features directly. Second, the text processed into hypergraph is subjected to multilevel GCN to obtain global hypergraph information, which is then introduced into the model training process and combined with the features of each batch of clinical texts.

However, the scarcity of labeled data has hindered the application of deep graph learning in brain network analysis, accelerating the usage of extra label-free self-supervised contrastive graph learning. However, existing augmentation strategies commonly used in contrastive learning (CL), such as edge and node drop, do not fully benefit brain network learning due to the distribution differences between different modalities of brain neural imaging. To this end, we introduce a novel approach namely spatial–temporal hierarchical augmentation-based contrastive learning (ST-HACL) to enhance the representation learning of functional brain networks. ST-HACL leverages augmentation methods tailored specifically to brain networks. Our method employs an augmentation strategy from both spatial and temporal level during the brain network construction process to generate contrastive samples, enabling label-free self-supervised learning. We evaluate the performance of our approach on the orthostatic hypotension dataset (OH) and the Alzheimer's disease neuroimaging initiative dataset (ADNI). Results demonstrate that our model surpasses existing graph neural network (GNN) models and graph-CL methods, achieving F1 scores of 80.61% in OH and 73.01% in ADNI.

Specifically, we apply this method to two datasets: 1) one related to physical and cognitive frailty in the elderly; and 2) another focusing on identifying IKIGAI (happiness, self-efficacy, and sense of contribution) in volunteer staff of a civic health promotion activity. Both datasets consist of multiple sub-datasets measured using different modalities, such as facial expressions, sound, activity, and heart rates. By defining feature extraction methods for each subdataset, we compare and integrate the overlapping data. The results demonstrated that our method could effectively preserve common characteristics across different data types, offering a more interpretable solution than traditional dimensionality reduction methods based on linear and nonlinear transformation. This approach has significant implications for data integration in multidisciplinary fields and opens the door for future applications to a wide range of datasets.},

However, existing privacy-preserving techniques for vertical federated feature selection are limited to selecting task-related features and cannot reduce redundant features among clients, resulting in performance loss. This article introduces a mutual information-based federated feature selection (MUSE) framework to address these issues. In the MUSE framework, the correlation of cross-device feature–feature and feature–class is estimated by our defined privacy-preserving mutual information, called federated mutual information (FMI). To compute FMI, we propose the anonymous bin matching (ABM) algorithm, which only uses the intersection size of bins rather than bin elements to avoid sample-IDs leakage. With FMI, MUSE can support the minimized dependency feature selection criteria for removing redundant features. Additionally, we propose the local feature preselection to reduce the computation cost of FMI. It is theoretically and experimentally proved as a close approximation of the global optimum under certain constraints. We evaluate the effectiveness of our MUSE framework on various datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that our methods consistently outperform the state-of-the-art federated feature selection methods across most datasets. Moreover, our method shows potential in multimodal data as well.},

  abstract     = {Multimodal emotion recognition in conversation (MERC) aims to identify emotions in target utterances from multimodal records, drawing significant attention for its value in conversational artificial intelligence. While early research focuses on exploring conversational context, recent efforts emphasize integrating multimodal cues. Existing methods focus on modeling the impact of conversational context on emotion recognition while neglecting the role of the speaker’s personality factors. Furthermore, these approaches often suffer from inefficiencies in information transfer due to full-utterance connectivity and fail to leverage multiple fusion modes for complementary benefits. To address these issues, we propose a personality-guided iterative feedback graph network (PGIF) for MERC. PGIF incorporates personality information as a specialized modality to enhance the feature space for emotional inference. We utilize a graph network to model information flow, integrating interlocutor-aware contextual information by considering interlocutor dependencies between utterances. Additionally, we employ a dialogue discourse parser to directly model semantic relationships between utterances. Our iterative feedback fusion mechanism explicitly simulates emotional interactions between feature-level and decision-level modalities, improving inference without ground truth labels through iterative refinement. PGIF demonstrates improvements of 1.94% and 1.42% over state-of-the-art methods on the IEMOCAP and MELD datasets, respectively. Ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of PGIF’s mechanisms, while its manipulation of input features and global fusion strategies ensures compatibility with existing approaches.},

  abstract     = {Multimodal emotion recognition (MER) has recently gained much attention since it can leverage information over multiple modalities. However, in real life, we often encounter the problem of missing modalities, as well as modeling the heterogeneity and correlation among multimodal data are challenges. To this end, we propose a unified model called cross-modal adaptive masked autoencoder (CMA-MAE) for incomplete multimodal learning. Our CMA-MAE model comprises a cross-modal adaptive fusion encoder (CMAFE) and a multiview adaptive encoder (MVAE) to capture and fuse the heterogeneity and correlation among multimodal features. Additionally, we design a convolutional decoder that progressive upsampling and fusion with the modality-invariant features to generate robust emotional features from partially observable data. To effectively utilize both data with complete and incomplete modalities for feature learning, we adopt an end-to-end approach that simultaneously optimizes classification and reconstruction tasks. Extensive testing on the DEAP and SEED-IV datasets is conducted to assess our model, with the findings demonstrating that our CMA-MAE model outperforms current leading approaches in both incomplete and complete multimodal learning scenarios.},

Consequently, many studies have begun using audio-visual data for automatic depression detection (ADD). Despite significant progress, numerous challenges remain. During feature extraction, many studies fail to capture crucial spatiotemporal information for depression diagnosis, leading to decreased feature quality. In the modality fusion stage, many methods assume that the semantic information of different modalities is temporally aligned, which is not the case. To address the first challenge, this study proposes a linear spatiotemporal detector (LSTD) to model spatiotemporal information through detection and ensemble, enhancing feature quality. To tackle the second challenge, a cross-modal temporal aligner (CMTA) is proposed, using cross-modal attention for alignment before modality fusion to promote thorough fusion. LSTD and CMTA form the proposed spatiotemporal information modeling and modal alignment (SIMMA) framework. Extensive experiments on five depression datasets (AVEC2013, AVEC2014, AVEC2017, AVEC2019, and CMDep) demonstrate that our method outperforms previous studies in effectiveness.},

To address the problem of optimizing 3-D missile interception guidance laws, this article introduces the deep Q-network (DQN) algorithm on the foundation of proportional navigation guidance (PNG) and proposes an adaptive proportional guidance algorithm based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL). The proposed algorithm uses air combat situational information as the state space and incorporates parameters such as the missile-target relative distance and line-of-sight (LOS) angle into the reward function design. The optimal proportional navigation coefficient $K^{*}$ for low-overload maneuvering targets is determined through network search, and the longitudinal and lateral control commands of the missile are decoupled by designing the proportional coefficient increment $\Delta K$, constructing a discretized action space. Simulation results show that, compared to the PNG with a constant $K^{*}$, the proposed method significantly improves the hit probability of high-overload maneuvering targets while maintaining the hit rate for low-overload maneuvering targets. As an exploration of future intelligent combat scenarios, this guidance law design method holds both theoretical significance and practical application value.},

In this article, we propose phishing detection on Ethereum via graph neural architecture search of transaction subgraph (PETS-GNAS). The phishing detection problem on Ethereum is transformed into a graph classification task, where accounts and transactions are represented as nodes and edges, respectively. Specifically, we acquire account labels and their corresponding transaction information from credible sources and then extract transaction subgraphs centered on labeled accounts as datasets. Subsequently, we introduce a mapping mechanism to extend these transaction subgraphs into corresponding temporal transaction subgraph (TTSG), encoding transaction attributes during the TTSG construction process. Then, graph neural architecture search (GNAS) strategy that incorporates early stopping and L2 regularization is proposed to enhance the feasibility and accuracy of Ethereum phishing detection by avoiding redundant parameters and complex architectures. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that PETS-GNAS achieves strong performance in phishing detection tasks, enabling early and accurate identification of phishing accounts.},

  abstract     = {Information diffusion prediction plays a pivotal role in the analysis of information propagation across social networks. Many existing methods rely on learning social homophily solely from users’ social connections as a single diffusion dependency to drive information diffusion. Moreover, these approaches often capture temporal influence from cascades within discrete time intervals, which might be inadequate in describing complex diffusion processes and can limit prediction performance. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel approach with augmented diffusion dependency and multigranularity temporal influence (ADDMT) for information diffusion prediction. Our method strategically leverages the interactive regularity implicit in historical diffusion cascades. This information is integrated with social homophily through a cross-graph convolution network (GCN) to augment the diffusion dependency among users. Furthermore, we introduce multiple overlapping sliding windows to partition diffusion cascades. Adjacent cascade slices exhibit 50% overlap, enhancing semantic and structural coherence. In addition, we employ the combination of hypergraph convolution networks (HGCNs) and temporal convolution networks (TCNs) to capture multigranularity temporal influence within cascades. This design enables our model to further discern evolutionary trends and ephemeral fluctuations in users’ preferences across time intervals. The experimental results, obtained from comprehensive evaluations on four realistic datasets, demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed model. In particular, our model surpasses previous state-of-the-art diffusion prediction models, as evidenced by improved metrics such as Hits@K and MAP@K. These results underscore the effectiveness and robustness of ADDMT in predicting information diffusion in social networks.},

Such conventional methods struggle with the advanced features associated with LLM-driven bots, which possess contextual understanding and mimic human interaction patterns. The significance of detecting LLM-driven bots lies in their increased difficulty of detection and their potential to inflict more covert harm compared with traditional bots. To address these challenges, we propose LLM-BotGuard, a novel detection model that is capable of capturing the unique features of LLM-driven bots alongside other bot characteristics through three key modules, i.e., pattern-informed feature extraction module, mixture of experts module, and graph module with graph sample and aggregation networks.

The results demonstrate that LLM-BotGuard significantly outperforms baseline methods in detecting LLM-driven bots.

  abstract     = {Multimodal recommendation has become a key technology for social media platforms. It is widely used in content recommendation, user preference analysis, advertisement placement, etc. Existing recommendation methods mainly focus on learning multimodal embeddings from direct interactions between users and items, ignoring indirect interactions among users-to-users and items-to-items. This limits the further exploration of potential interests between users and items. Moreover, during the model training, classical recommendation methods usually randomly select uninteracted items of a user as their negative samples. This may introduce significant learning bias, as uninteracted items could be false negatives and still potentially interest the user. To this end, we propose a novel indirect interactions discovery and true negative sampling multimodal recommendation (ITMRec) method to further explore potential user interests and mitigate the issue of false negative samples during learning. Specifically, we propose an indirect interactions discovering (IID) model to explore the latent interests among users-to-users and items-to-items. Then, we propose a true negative sampling (TNS) model to refine negative sampling that can alleviate the false negative sample problem. Finally, we enhance existing collaborative filtering methods by integrating representations derived from multimodal content, indirect interactions discovery, and refined negative sampling strategies, allowing for more precise alignment with users’ latent interests. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that our ITMRec significantly outperforms state-of-the-art recommendation baselines, achieving a 3.64% improvement over peer methods.

  abstract     = {Multimodal fake news detection (MFND) has received widespread attention. As a typical multimodal task, MFND is troubled by modality imbalance, where the dominant modality suppresses other modalities during the optimization process. Meanwhile, the social credibility maintains the amount of fake news less than that of real news, which causes class imbalance. We call MFND with intertwined influence of modality imbalance and class imbalance as dual imbalanced MFND, i.e., DI-MFND, which has not been well studied. In this article, we propose an approach called prototype-based fully balanced learning (PFBL) for DI-MFND. Specifically, our model contains three main parts. 1) The prototype-based modality-balanced learning (PMB) part, which constructs modality prototypes for each modality. It designs the prototype-based unimodal loss to enhance the intraclass compactness of the poorly performing modality and a constrained gradient optimization strategy to suppress the dominant modality for optimization. 2) The prototype-based class-balanced learning (PCB) part constructs class prototypes. A prototype-oriented discriminative enhancement loss is designed to effectively align samples with corresponding prototypes and increase the inter-class distance, thus enhancing the separability of different categories. 3) The multimodal fusion and classification (MFC) part employs a cross-transformer block to perform interaction between modalities and further integrates features of different modalities by attention mechanism. We propose a joint updating strategy for modality prototypes and class prototypes. Extensive experiments on three widely-used news datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art approaches.},

  abstract     = {Activity recognition (AR) using surveillance cameras remains challenging because of the variation between the data required for deep learning and the capabilities of CCTV-based frameworks for data recording. Most research on skeleton-based activity focuses on improving recognition using complete data, often overlooking performance on incomplete skeleton data due to occlusion or noise. However, in practical situations, it is inevitable to obtain a noisy or occluded human skeleton. When some informative keyjoints are unavailable or disturbed, it can compromise the efficiency and effectiveness of existing methods. This article proposes a skeleton-based model for activity recognition to deal with the occlusion problem. The main approach of the proposed model is to address occlusion by treating it as a missing value imputation problem within the feature matrix. First, it extracts features such as normalized joints, relative joint coordinates, angles, and velocity using a CNN-based technique and encodes the skeleton data into a feature matrix. The innovative use of generative adversarial imputation networks (GAIN) with bidirectional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM), enhanced by spatial and temporal attention mechanisms, effectively handled missing data due to occlusions, ensuring a complete feature matrix for subsequent classification. Additionally, this article introduces autoencoder-based Bi-LSTM with attention modules that improve activity classification by capturing and leveraging spatial and temporal dependencies. A comprehensive experiment was conducted on both occluded and unoccluded datasets to validate the effectiveness and improvements of the proposed model. Comparative results show that the proposed model outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods, achieving superior recognition accuracy in an occluded environment.},

Existing methods often overlook the high-order interactions and heterogeneous relationships among users and tweets, limiting their effectiveness in addressing sophisticated bot behaviors. This article introduces HHG-Bot, a novel hyper-heterogeneous graph-based framework for Twitter bot detection. The proposed approach integrates heterogeneous graph convolutional networks with a trainable hypergraph aggregation model to capture complex, high-order interactions. To overcome the challenge of labeled data scarcity, HHG-Bot employs a meta-learning paradigm that enhances the model’s generalization capability across different bot types. Experiments conducted on the Twibot-20 benchmark dataset demonstrate that HHG-Bot achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing existing methods in terms of accuracy (86.17%), F1-score (87.51%), and Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) (71.75%).

  abstract     = {Although social media generally provides a safe and enjoyable experience, it can also serve as a quick and easy means for spreading false news, misinformation, and other harmful content. These contents have been proven effective in influencing people’s beliefs and behaviors, spanning from influencing political opinions to directly impacting public health, particularly during events such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Then, it becomes crucial to take proactive measures to identify the misinformation spreaders to mitigate their impact and influence over society. Existing approaches primarily focus on identifying spreaders by analyzing features such as writing style, content, user profiles, and engagement statistics. However, since fake or deceiving content is frequently crafted to closely resemble authentic information, traditional techniques alone prove insufficient to effectively identify either fake content or its spreaders. In this context, this work introduces a deep-learning model tailored for detecting misinformation spreaders in social media. Our model not only incorporates content-based features but also integrates patterns of social interactions and information propagation structures. By considering the multifaceted nature of misinformation spread, our approach provides a more holistic and accurate means of identifying its spreaders. An experimental evaluation focusing on COVID-related data yielded promising results, demonstrating a significant performance improvement compared to other techniques in the literature. Thus, this research contributes to the ongoing efforts to develop robust tools for reducing the adverse effects of misinformation in social media.},

Traditional spreading models often assume individuals play the same role in the spreading process. In reality, however, individuals’ diverse characteristics contribute differently to the spreading performance, leading to a heterogeneous infection rate across the system. To investigate network spreading dynamics under heterogeneous infection rates, we integrate two individual-level features—influence (i.e., the ability to influence neighbors) and susceptibility (i.e., the extent to be influenced by neighbors)—into the independent cascade model. Our findings reveal significant differences in spreading performance under heterogeneous and constant infection rates, with traditional structural centrality metrics proving more effective in the latter scenario. Additionally, we take the constant and heterogeneous infection rates into a state-of-the-art maximization algorithm, the well-known TIM algorithm, and find the seeds selected by heterogeneous infection rates are more dispersed compared to those under constant rates. Lastly, we find that both individuals’ influence and susceptibility are vital to the spreading performance. Strikingly, susceptible individuals are particularly important to spreading when information is disseminated by social celebrities. By integrating influence and susceptibility into the spreading model, we gain a more profound understanding of the underlying mechanisms driving information spreading.},

However, it remains a critical challenge to robustly acquire cardiac pulse information in scenarios with head motion (e.g., rotation and swing), as it inevitably introduces interfering noise, such as facial geometric deformation and displacement. Most existing methods primarily focus on how to extract subtle pulse signals while neglecting the detrimental effects of noise, especially out-of-distribution motion patterns. In response to this, we propose a temporal gated face alignment network (TGFAN) to adaptively counteract motion noise in long-term video sequences. Specifically, the bidirectional temporal face alignment (BFA) block first captures interframe motion discrepancies to align the displaced face feature and then extracts motion-robust pulse features. Furthermore, we propose a learnable temporal gating mechanism that disentangles the features and dynamically guides motion-disturbed segments for feature alignment, thereby alleviating local head motion interference. Experimental evaluations on four benchmark datasets demonstrate our superior performance on both intradataset and cross-dataset tests.},

However, most existing graph neural network models do not alleviate the problem of incomplete raw graph data and the need for extensive labels. This leads to increased labor costs and produces suboptimal or even incorrect results. In this article, we propose an end-to-end method for fusing learnable node-level and edge-level augmentation in automatic graph-level contrastive learning (NEAGCL), consisting of a graph preprocessing module and tailored graph-level contrastive learning. In the graph preprocessing module, we propose a parallel view generator method, which solves the problem of data incompleteness by simultaneously performing adaptive structure enhancement and learnable node information optimization. In tailored graph-level contrastive learning, we employ contrast learning in self-supervised learning and classification loss to jointly train graph classifiers, thus solving the problem of relying on the original labels. Besides, our model employs differentiable contrastive learning and is an end-to-end self-supervised model. Comparative tests of semisupervised learning and unsupervised learning on seven benchmark datasets for graph-level tasks demonstrate the superiority of our model. We demonstrate that effective graph contrastive learning requires learning better joint representations of graph structures and node attributes to improve the performance of graph-level tasks.},

  abstract     = {In autonomous driving, motion prediction is vital for anticipating the behaviors of surrounding vehicles, pedestrians, and other road users, enabling the system to make accurate decisions and plan driving paths effectively. Current motion prediction models typically utilize an encoder–decoder architecture, and many methods focus on the decoder’s design because the decoder is directly responsible for generating future trajectories. However, this often leads to neglecting the encoder’s capability to represent input information, resulting in a failure to provide the decoder with accurate and semantic prior features, which impacts the overall prediction accuracy. Contrastive learning, as an effective approach for enhancing feature representation through cross-modal alignment, demonstrates strong generalization and reduced reliance on labeled data. Therefore, we propose a motion prediction network named DMotion that leverages contrastive learning to align trajectory features with numeric signals and textual descriptions, improving the model’s representational capacity and enriching contextual priors. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first approach to use textual descriptions as a modality to enhance motion prediction accuracy. We sparsify dense agent attribute labels, such as historical distance and angular variation, to enable these prior features learned by the model through contrastive learning. By investigating the impact of numeric and textual supervision signals on contrastive learning effectiveness, textual supervision achieves superior results compared with numeric signals, benefiting from richer input information and more robust extraction capabilities of the text model. We further apply the low-rank adaptation (LoRA) method to fine-tune the text encoder, improving model performance and preventing catastrophic forgetting with only 0.1M additional trainable parameters. Our experiments demonstrate that DMotion shows competitive performance on the Waymo motion prediction and interaction prediction challenges. Additionally, the contrast learning module of DMotion does not introduce additional parameters or computational overhead during inference, maintaining the efficiency of the original encoder-decoder model.},

The system is built upon a model grounded solely in basic individual behavioral dynamics and free from reliance on specific technical assumptions, ensuring broad generality.

Key findings include the identification of dynamic patterns such as stationarity, inertia, and polarization tendencies in journal performance over time. The experiments further demonstrate the robustness of journal dynamics against moderate external disturbances, such as self-citation behavior, and highlight a gradual weakening of volatility in journal citation indices. These findings are further explained through a semianalytical approach.

  abstract     = {Hybrid bike-sharing systems (operating both bikes and ebikes) are emerging worldwide for flexibility and sustainability. Excessive rebalancing, while addressing supply-demand imbalances, causes financial burdens and resource waste. Hence, long-term daily operations (e.g., rebalancing at midnights for upcoming days) have practical economic significance, but they remain underexplored due to difficulties in tracking high within-day and between-day demand variability and the interplay between demand and daily inventory management strategies. Besides, cooperative operation of bikes and ebikes expands solution space, given their inherent demand coupling. This study is the first to explore long-term daily inventory strategies for the hybrid system (ebikes get charged at stations), determining spatial-heterogeneous inventory at midnight to maximize profits. To address the demand variability perception issue, we develop a recurrent-attentive neural process (RANP) model to predict hour-to-hour demand of the upcoming day. The RANP is integrated into a long-term optimization model, referred to as the generative-models-informed Markov decision process (GMI-MDP), where two cooperative intelligent agents determine the bike–ebike allocation based on demand perception and system rewards. A suite of numerical experiments utilizing a real-world dataset from New York is carried out, and various strategies are compared. The proposed method, through online and offline tests, demonstrates superiority over other MDP-based and rule-based methods, achieving a faster solution-seeking process and more stable rewards than MDP with exact upcoming demand.

This mechanism consists of three modules: 1) EEG-based emotional state computation; 2) process-based relaxation assessment; and 3) adaptive positive decision feedback. Collectively, these components form a computation-assessment-feedback closed-loop system that objectively quantifies emotions while enabling real-time decision adjustments based on emotional trends, thereby enhancing user engagement and emotion regulation efficacy through personalized feedback. The contribution of the proposed feedback mechanism was evaluated through a randomized controlled trial (N = 36). The results indicated that both physiological measures and self-reported relaxation significantly increased when compared to interventions without feedback. These findings validate that the EEG-based positive feedback mechanism effectively enhances emotion regulation while providing additional insights into improving both the engagement and effectiveness within digital mental health interventions.},

However, on one hand, within this process, the varying contributions of different modalities can cause imbalance in multimodal training. On the other hand, in unimodal representation, the inclusion of pretrained models presents challenges of slow training and difficult optimization. Based on the aforementioned findings, we have redefined the workflow for current multimodal emotion recognition. In this study, we introduce a novel approach called reward-based gradient modulation for regulating the convergence speed of individual modalities within the fusion network with LoRA (RGM-LoRA), aimed at achieving a balanced integration process. Additionally, text modality encoders commonly employ large-scale language pretraining models such as BERT. We introduce LoRA to alleviate the problem of text modality optimization being suppressed by the other two modalities. To our knowledge, we are the pioneering researchers who have provided evidence showcasing the efficacy of LoRA in the context of optimization. Finally, to further ensure the effect of textual modality, we add intermodal contrast learning.

Our approach computes the weight of the edges and their change over time, similar to memory traces in the human brain, by simulating the process of forgetting and strengthening connections depending on the intensity of interactions. We utilized five ground-truth datasets, which were used to predict social ties, missing events, and potential links. We found: 1) the cognitive mechanism enables more accurate capture of the heterogeneity of the temporal effect, leading to an average precision improvement of 9% compared to baselines with competitive area under curve (AUC); 2) the local structure and synchronous agent behavior contribute differently to different types of datasets; and 3) appropriately increasing the time intervals, which may reduce the negative impact from noise when dividing time windows to calculate the behavioral synchrony of agents, is effective for link prediction tasks.},

  abstract     = {As a crucial component of intelligent transportation systems (ITS), accurate traffic flow prediction has attracted considerable attention. Numerous popular models, such as recurrent neural networks (RNN) and graph convolution networks (GCN), have been extensively applied to this task. However, due to the constraints of the topology of urban road network and the law of dynamic change with time, the single-layer network model cannot capture the dynamic correlation between the spatial–temporal and the traditional road network characteristics for traffic flow. In this article, we propose a spatial–temporal two-layer synchronous network (ST2SNet) for traffic flow prediction. First, we introduce a novel network structure comprising a spatial–temporal fusion layer and a situation awareness layer, where temporal and spatial correlations are fused synchronously using a transformer architecture. Next, we incorporate the residual gated GCN structure and a 2-D convolution network to effectively integrate road network information and temporal trends for spatial–temporal traffic flow prediction. Finally, we evaluate ST2SNet on two benchmark datasets, PeMSD4, and PeMSD8. Compared to baseline methods, our model achieves MAE improvements ranging from 4.00% to 48.30% on PeMSD4 and from 4.88% to 54.13% on PeMSD8. These outstanding experimental results demonstrate that ST2SNet significantly enhances prediction performance.},

  abstract     = {Social networks are now the primary channels for sharing information about events, especially during emergencies. Identifying crucial information in these situations is intricate due to the absence of specific event labels and the prevalent label imbalance in social network data. Prior efforts in disaster event management have applied unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) techniques. However, these efforts encounter difficulties when focusing on specific events and dealing with class-imbalance domain adaptation (CDA), often leading to modifications in data distribution. This article introduces a solution named class-imbalanced adversarial neural network (CADNN) to address UDA challenges in emergency events across diverse domains. First, an adversarial domain adaptation model is developed to achieve cross-domain feature representation. Second, unlike existing methods that rely on data augmentation, a cross-domain interpolation model is designed to generate aligned pairwise samples. This ensures that the generated samples preserve the original data distribution by preserving the sample centroid. Third, the sample interpolation is integrated with the adversarial domain adaptation model, optimizing the overall loss function to enhance generalization performance. Experimental results on four open-source datasets demonstrate that CADNN outperforms state-of-the-art models in recognizing emergency event information.},

  abstract     = {Malware poses a great threat to information security such as user data, privacy, and assets. Early detection before it has a real impact is the main countermeasure. However, the diversity of carriers and technologies has led to a huge gap between the training scenarios and actual scenarios of detection methods. This makes it difficult for supervision-based detection frameworks to identify new malware variants and complicates threat response. We propose a novel method that integrates frequency domain techniques with feature alignment to enhance variant malware detection, reducing distribution differences between labeled (source) and new (target) samples. By converting malware into grayscale images and applying discrete cosine transform (DCT) for improved feature extraction, followed by feature extraction via a deep residual network from both domains, our model systematically aligns features. This alignment is achieved through a tailored domain adaptation technique involving the minimization of classification and domain alignment losses, which ensures the consistent learning of features across varied domains. Such rigorous alignment not only enhances detection accuracy for both known and variant malware but also supports simultaneous detection across significant distribution differences. We conduct extensive experiments on two real-world datasets to evaluate the performance of various deep learning models under consistent and inconsistent domain distributions. Compared to existing methods, our approach improves accuracy by an average of 1.4% on the BIG2015 dataset, 3.2% on the MDA dataset, 2.75% on the Malimg dataset, and also achieves the best performance on the MaleVis dataset, with similar gains in precision, recall, and F1-score across all datasets.},

Knowledge graphs have been leveraged as auxiliary information to mitigate these issues. However, current knowledge graph-based recommendation systems still struggle to accurately capture the latent features of users and items in the embedding space. In this article, we introduce a heterogeneous propagation-based recommendation framework that effectively integrates collaborative patterns derived from user–item interactions with knowledge graph data. Specifically, we first design hierarchical layerwise attention mechanisms (LAMs) tailored to the different layers of the knowledge graph propagation process. These mechanisms assign appropriate attention scores to feature representations at various levels of complexity, thereby enhancing the integration. Additionally, the feature learning is further improved by adding Gaussian noise to the initial latent features of users and items, which are then refined using a denoising autoencoder. This method helps learn more robust and discriminative representations for users and items, enhancing recommendation performance. Extensive experiments were conducted on the MovieLens-1M, Book-Crossing, and Last.FM datasets demonstrate that the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms eighteen state-of-the-art baselines. Furthermore, ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of each module, emphasizing their individual contributions to the overall performance improvement.},

First, a new fuzzy control model of the bullwhip effect is proposed.

Then, the studied system can be deemed as a closed-loop control system. Furthermore, a series of criteria are provided for the existence of fuzzy control strategies to stabilize the closed-loop system with the bullwhip effect reduction.

  abstract     = {Personalized decentralized federated learning (PDFL) has emerged recently to address the problem of single point of failure and data heterogeneity in traditional centralized federated learning. However, existing works on PDFL still have two challenges that urgently need to be solved. First, model updates exposed by point-to-point communication during collaborative training in PDFL may disclose sensitive information about clients. Second, the distributed structure makes PDFL vulnerable to Byzantine attacks, which can disrupt the network by introducing poisoned data or faulty behaviors. In this article, we propose a privacy-enhanced and Byzantine-resilient approach to effectively address the dual challenges of privacy and security in PDFL. In particular, each client is required to build a unique critical parameter index set by evaluating the importance of its model parameters and broadcasting it to neighbors. To improve Byzantine resilience, we propose a novel weight allocation scheme based on the critical parameter index set for clients to alleviate the negative impact of Byzantine neighbors in the model aggregation. To enhance privacy protection while boosting personalization, we combine with model decoupling and execute a clipping-robust personalized local training for each client to achieve user-level differential privacy. We finally conduct exhaustive experiments on FEMNIST, SVHN, and CIFAR10 datasets and various settings. Experimental results demonstrate that compared to five state-of-the-art baselines, our proposed method achieves excellent performance with user-level differential privacy guarantee in PDFL and implements additionally superior Byzantine robustness in adversarial settings.},

In this computational social systems context, we address the challenge of accurately segmenting CRC lesions from colonoscopy images, which is pivotal for early cancer detection and treatment. The complexity of intestinal environments and variations in medical expertise contribute to the high rate of undetected or misdiagnosed lesions, underscoring the need for advanced computational models. This study presents ColoSegNet, a novel self-supervised deep learning framework designed to enhance the accuracy and effectiveness of CRC diagnosis. By leveraging a comprehensive and annotated colorectal lesion segmentation dataset (CLSD), ColoSegNet incorporates a temporal correlation module to extract critical features from colonoscopy video frames, significantly improving the segmentation of colorectal lesions. Furthermore, ColoSegNet employs a masked autoencoder (MAE) module for self-supervised image reconstruction, preserving the original image integrity and facilitating precise segmentation. Comparative assessments against established models such as UNet, PraNet, and Deeplab V3 demonstrate ColoSegNet’s superior performance in detailed feature representation and overall segmentation accuracy. This research not only contributes to the field of medical imaging but also to computational social systems, by capturing inherent data patterns and integrating specialized modules for feature representation in a healthcare context. Our findings provide valuable insights into the early and accurate detection of CRC, a critical issue given the disease’s high incidence and mortality rates, and its impact on social systems.},

In contrast, deep multiview clustering overcomes this limitation by utilizing learning-based nonlinear transformations for clustering, but it may be restricted by model interpretability caused by black-box networks. Besides, previous multiview clustering methods only consider homogeneous or heterogeneous situations, resulting in restricted scalability and generalizability. To address the aforementioned issues, we design a universal interpretable clustering framework that accommodates both homogeneous and heterogeneous multiview scenarios. To realize this purpose: 1) we revisit the interpretable knowledge-driven design architecture of traditional multiview methods and formulate clustering optimization problems on multiview data attributes in homogeneous scenarios; 2) the optimization problem is leveraged to derive network modules that learn shared and self-expressive representations for clustering, with the practical meaning of each network component providing model design-level interpretability; 3) the proposed method is extended from homogeneous to heterogeneous scenarios, enhancing its universality for a broader spectrum of multiview clustering tasks; and 4) tailored training loss for the clustering task is employed to inversely enhance the affinity between objects with similar attributes.

Therefore, these methods inadequately consider the impact of trends on the overall graph. Moreover, there are a large number of nodes in temporal graphs, which make it difficult to generate effective graph embeddings directly by aggregating dynamic node embeddings. In this study, we propose a novel temporal attention network for learning graph-level embedding learning called GraphTAN. Specifically, the proposed model employs pooling attention to select crucial nodes and filter out noisy ones for each snapshot, thereby enhancing the quality of aggregated graph embeddings. Furthermore, we design a graph-level temporal attention mechanism to effectively extract temporal graph embeddings, capturing trends and patterns across snapshots. The proposed model is evaluated on three downstream tasks.

Advances in generative models have introduced image outpainting techniques that expand the size of acquired social scene images, thereby enhancing the value of social image data. Stable diffusion (SD), which benefits from the guidance of caption prompts, shows excellent performance in image outpainting. However, its heavy reliance on manual prompts leads to a significant drawback: a decrease in the quality of generated images without prompts. To overcome this challenge, we propose a novel self-prompt diffusion model for image outpainting that extrapolates images based on the semantics of the source image, thereby removing the dependence on manual prompts. Specifically, we design a prompt autoencoder that uses an autoregressive transformer to map prompt embeddings into their semantic space, facilitating the construction of a semantic decoder. The semantic decoder and prompt embeddings are then cooptimized within the proposed prompt embedding network, allowing the mapping of image features to the stable diffusion prompt embeddings. Furthermore, by exploiting the inherent generative capabilities of diffusion models, we introduce a seam line regeneration mechanism to address the common problem of seam lines when splicing input and generated images. Comparative experiments on the Places2 and COCO datasets show that our method outperforms current state-of-the-art approaches on visual quality metrics and is adaptable to the stable diffusion model without additional fine-tuning.},

However, GAN struggle with minority data that have few instances and lack accurate statistical characteristics. To mitigate this problem, a hierarchical oversampling based on Cohen’s criterion (HiOC) is proposed for extremely imbalanced data with missing information. The main idea of HiOC is to use Cohen’s criterion to design a primary rebalancing rate by considering data size, distribution, and feature information comprehensively. Then, HiOC including two stages to achieve the data balance. In the first stage, to enhance the data variety, especially for instances on the borderline as well as make a delicate imputation for missing information, a progressive oversampling method in the framework of fuzzy information decomposition (FID) is proposed. The progressive FID (PFID) introduces a small bias to expand the prediction region’s bounds and fulfills imputation step by step using newly sampled data. In the second stage, to greatly keep the original data distribution, an information granularity (IG) incorporated fuzzy c-means clustering strategy is developed. Afterward, a GAN based on Mahalanobis distance performs oversampling in each cluster to achieve ultimate data balance with unbiased evaluation. Finally, the proposed algorithm is applied to several real datasets, demonstrating higher classification accuracy compared with existing algorithms, thus proving the applicability of the research results in real-world scenarios.},

  abstract     = {Federated learning (FL) serves as a distributed framework facilitating privacy-preserving machine learning on vast data generated by mobile and IoT devices. Hierarchical federated averaging (H-FedAvg) has emerged as a solution to the communication bottleneck, enabling large-scale implementation. It leverages the client-edge-cloud aggregation hierarchy, capitalizing on the accessibility of the cloud server and the communication efficiency of edge servers (ESs). However, the full potential of H-FedAvg in real-world scenarios, particularly in the presence of imbalanced ES communication latency, remains largely unexplored. This article delves into the issue of imbalanced communication latency and introduces the edge-level imbalanced H-FedAvg (IH-FedAvg) algorithm, accompanied by convergence analysis. Theoretical and empirical results underscore the degradation of IH-FedAvg, which is influenced by the number of edge aggregation rounds and the divergence between the slowest and fastest ESs. To tackle this challenge, we propose an error-feedback compression method, leading to the edge-level compressed H-FedAvg (ECH-FedAvg) algorithm. Theoretical analysis indicates that the convergence performance depends on the compressor ratio. Going beyond compression, we present a joint optimization approach that considers both compressor ratio selection and bandwidth allocation, dynamically guiding ECH-FedAvg. Extensive experiments show that ECH-FedAvg achieves competitive performance compared to H-FedAvg, significantly enhancing communication efficiency. These findings underscore the potential of ECH-FedAvg in addressing challenges related to imbalanced communication in real-world networks.},

  abstract     = {Multibehavioral recommender systems improve the prediction accuracy of target behaviors (e.g., purchase) by integrating auxiliary user behaviors (e.g., page view), but often face the challenge of sparse data on target behaviors. Although contrastive learning can effectively alleviate this problem, existing models still have limitations: they reduce behavioral relationships to linear combinations, ignoring users’ unique behavioral combination modes for different items; meanwhile, when constructing contrastive views, they fail to adequately consider the data imbalance between auxiliary and target behaviors, resulting in learned features biased toward auxiliary behaviors. Consequently, we introduced a multibehavioral recommendation model founded on dual mode contrast learning (DMCL). DMCL innovatively defines behavior combination modes and generates interaction graphs from two perspectives: behavior combination and cascading, and designs a specialized graph encoder for each graph to learn node embedding. By introducing adversarial constraints and contrastive learning, DMCL enhances the complementary nature of node embeddings, and at the same time utilizes interaction graphs in different modes to construct a contrast view, which makes full use of the limited interaction information of the target behavior, and effectively mitigates the feature bias problem. Finally, DMCL combines multilayer perceptron to predict recommendation scores. Our comprehensive experiments on three real datasets demonstrate significant improvements in Recall and NDCG metrics, achieving increases of 2.4–10.1% and 2.6–10.3%, respectively, over current state-of-the-art methods.},

A key innovation of this work is the proposed Muls-IRWR algorithm, which improves traditional random walk with restart (RWR) by integrating various similarity measures.

  abstract     = {The prisoner’s dilemma highlights the conflict between individual gains and collective well-being, emphasizing the need for superior strategies. This article explores strategy learning through reinforcement learning, avoiding the time-intensive offline methods like genetic algorithms. Given the significance of both player behaviors and states in creating a lifelike gaming environment, two primary strategies are introduced: Q-learning (QLPlayer), focusing on game behaviors, and reinforcement learning with a finite state machine (RLFSM), integrating behaviors and states. Furthermore, two greedy strategies are developed: payoff-greedy (PG) based on historical payoffs and epsilon-greedy (EG) based on fixed probability. Following that, QLPlayer_PG, QLPlayer_EG, RLFSM_PG, and RLFSM_EG strategies are designed to choose the action with the highest expected payoffs based on different greedy strategies, and continuously update the expected payoffs in different states through online learning. Our experiments demonstrate that QLPlayer_PG and RLFSM_PG significantly outperform classical strategies in achieving higher payoffs and cooperation, especially in noisy environments, by dynamically adapting to learned opponent behaviors. Notably, QLPlayer_PG and RLFSM_PG exhibit superior performance compared to QLPlayer_EG and RLFSM_EG, indicating that the reinforcement learning strategy combining payoff-greedy can adjust its behavior over time according to the payoff information of both sides of the game, ensuring adaptability in the game. The results emphasize the importance of incorporating behaviors, states, and payoffs into strategy learning. This helps reduce exploitation, promote cooperation, and improve understanding of chosen actions.},

Most research emphasizes establishing information dissemination models and designing information processing methods within a single network platform, which is insufficient to address the accelerated information spread resulting from users’ cross-platform dissemination behavior. This article presents a multiplatform information fusion processing method based on the susceptible infected recovered disregarded (SIR-D) model, which reduces the impact of negative information dissemination. First, we introduce an enhanced comprehensive propagation model, termed the SIR-D model, which incorporates a “Disregarded” state to represent users who have received but chose to disregard the recommended content. Additionally, the user state fusion process in the coupled network structure, consisting of ER random network, BA scale-free network and small world network, is described. Moreover, an information processing method is proposed that implements three different measures based on the level of information harm: taking no measures, weakening the effectiveness and blocking the source. Finally, the effectiveness of the information processing method, which incorporates the user state fusion process, is demonstrated through a simulation within complex social networks. The results indicate that the proposed method significantly improves processing efficiency and effectively reduces dangerous information dissemination compared to the nonfusion method.},

  abstract     = {Outliers are intrinsic to recommender systems (RSs) due to user uncertainty and bring large deviations to the total loss. Classical loss functions such as $L_{1}$ and $L_{2}$ do not consider this issue, thus biasing the model toward abnormal ratings. Advanced ones such as Logcosh, Huber, and Wing losses try to control model biasing; however, they do not consider the rating ranges of recommender systems. In this article, we propose a Seagull loss combining quadratic and softsign functions to handle this issue. The quadratic function aims to preserve or appropriately increase losses caused by small deviations, while softsign function aims to suppress losses caused by large deviations. It is distinguished from three types of popular losses. Compared with $L_{1}$ and $L_{2}$, it controls the upper bound, therefore suppressing the influence of outliers. Compared with Logcosh and Huber, it not only adjusts the loss of small deviations but also suppresses the loss of large deviations. Compared with Wing loss, it considers the characteristics of data in RSs and therefore is more suitable to the matrix factorization model. Experiments are undertaken on six real-world recommendation datasets in comparison with six popular loss functions. Results show that Seagull loss function has superiority to all losses above on mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean square error (RMSE) and slight inferiority to $L_{2}$ and Wing on hit ratio (HR), mean average precision (MAP), and normalized discounted cumulative gain (NDCG).},

Addressing the issues of data scarcity and the influence of leaders on users, this article proposes a guided derived topic propagation model based on topic identity and transfer learning. To tackle the sparsity of early data on derived topics, we introduce generative adversarial networks (GANs) to enhance data integrity and continuity, given their efficacy in compensating for missing data. Additionally, recognizing the potential for domain shifts during topic evolution, we incorporate transfer learning to facilitate domain adaptation and improve the accuracy of the derived topic propagation model. To address the significant impact of leader authority on user perspectives, we incorporate the social psychological concept of “identity theory” and design a metric for topic identity based on this theory to quantify the leader’s influence on user viewpoints. Concurrently, considering user identification with topics, we propose a metric for topic domain co-presence, incorporating interest preferences to more accurately represent user engagement with the topic. Finally, to account for the dynamic nature of user viewpoints, we employ graph convolutional networks (GCNs) to model user perspectives over time. The use of GCNs, based on temporal slices, effectively handles the interconnections between user nodes and explores the influence of interuser interactions on viewpoints. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model not only enhances data integrity and continuity but also improves the prediction of the propagation dynamics of guided derived topics.},

This article investigates the minimum cost consensus modeling (MCCM) considering opinion-based variable cost and trust-based tolerance constraints. Given that the existing models ignore the preference strategy manipulation of DMs, a dynamic opinion-based variable unit cost allocation mechanism is presented to prevent the preference manipulation behavior of DMs to a certain extent. To effectively reveal the adjust willingness of DMs in the consensus reaching process, an improved tolerance level measurement which incorporates the tolerance threshold, opinion deviation, and individual return satisfaction is developed to evaluate the compromise willingness of DMs. On this basis, a trust relationship-based tolerance threshold adjustment mechanism for the consensus feedback of MCCM is proposed. Meanwhile, a relative opinion similarity-based trust relationship updating approach is presented to promote the consensus efficiency. A case of regional air pollution collaborative governance is given to verify the practicability of the proposed model. Comparative studies show that the proposed model has stable consensus performance and lower consensus cost compared with existing models.},

Discussions on consistency and consensus are crucial in group decision-making with IFPRs. Consistency prevents self-contradictory judgments, while consensus restricts the disparities among DM assessments within a predetermined threshold. Both have a significant impact on decision quality. Hence, the Shapley consistency and consensus mechanism (SHAP-CCM), which endows the adjustment to DMs by considering their marginal contributions to the minimum total adjustments of all corresponding coalitions, is introduced. Under each DM’s Shapley consensus adjustment, personalized judgment adjustment strategies are considered due to DMs’ intrinsic characteristic differences. In rare scenarios where the Shapley value may fall below zero, this could result in other DMs bearing a greater adjustment. Thus, we propose the Nash-bargaining consensus adjustment based on max–min marginal contribution. This method effectively addresses the issue associated with SHAP-CCM, enhancing the reliability of the analysis. With these mechanisms, the corresponding group decision methods are given.

We then propose a mathematical model called habit formation and behavioral inertia (HFBI), and through experiments, we demonstrate that the data generated by the model shows a robust fit to the distribution of empirical data. We also analyze the effects of different types of activities, and find that periods of high activity participation often begin with rewarded activities, suggesting the importance of incentives to sustain long-term participation. Our study provides a scientific foundation for developing optimized strategies to enhance community sports participation.

In recent years, federated learning has been successfully introduced into a recommendation, while these algorithms still encounter several challenges. First, real-world recommendation scenarios often suffer from sparse data, making it difficult for models to learn reliable representations. Second, data heterogeneity necessitates the design of personalized models to enhance recommendation performance. To address these challenges, we propose a federated recommendation approach based on graph neural networks, named federated personalized contrastive learning for recommendation. On the client side, we propose a contrastive learning approach to enhance the embedding quality of nodes (users or items) by maximizing positive similarities. Specifically, we formulate the concept of structural neighbors based on the graph structure and devise a contrastive learning objective. We treat nodes and their structural neighbors as positive pairs to better learn node representations. On the server side, we group users based on the learned representations and compute cluster-level federated models and a global model. Each user learns a personalized model by combining these two models. Extensive experiments on five real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms existing methods in terms of performance.},

In this article, we address a specific and important scenario of monitoring suicidal ideation (SI), where time-series data, such as galvanic skin response (GSR) and photoplethysmography (PPG), are susceptible to such noise. Current methods predominantly focus on image and text data or address artificially introduced noise, neglecting the complexities of natural noise in time-series analysis. To tackle this, we introduce a novel neural network model tailored for analyzing noisy physiological time-series data, named DBN_ConvNet, which integrates advanced encoding techniques with confidence learning training to enhance prediction performance. Another main contribution of our work is the collection of a specialized dataset of GSR and PPG signals derived from real-world environments for SI prediction. By employing this dataset, our DBN_ConvNet achieves a prediction accuracy of 76.67% and an F1 score of 0.74 in a binary classification task, outperforming state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, comprehensive evaluations have been conducted on three other well-known public datasets with artificially introduced noise to test the DBN_ConvNet’s capabilities rigorously.

The occurrence of Turing instability and the resultant patterns are of paramount importance to the system; hence, we delve into the conditions of Turing instability. Subsequently, we analyze the patterns under diverse scenarios to elucidate the impact of various contributing factors. Concurrently, the endeavor to optimize the control of pattern formations is addressed by delineating the first-order necessary optimality conditions pertinent to the optimal control problem. Consequently, the target patterns are achieved under the influence of optimal control. Furthermore, in conjunction with the aforementioned efforts, the gradient descent approach is utilized to ascertain the unknown parameters, specifically the cross-diffusion coefficients $d_{12}$ and $d_{21}$. The outcomes derived from this method are deemed to be satisfactory. Moreover, two distinct algorithms have been deployed for the purpose of parameter identification, with their efficacy compared through a meticulous analysis of error discrepancies. Finally, an illustrative demonstration is provided, showcasing the application of parameter identification techniques in the biological surface pattern conformation.},

  abstract     = {Happiness prediction based on large-scale online data and machine learning models is an emerging research topic that underpins a range of issues, from personal growth to social stability. Many advanced machine learning (ML) models with explanations are used for happiness online assessment while maintaining high accuracy of results. However, expert feedback and sociological theory may be absent from these models, which limits the association between prediction results and the right reasons for why they occurred. Sociological studies have shown that primary and secondary relations are inherent in happiness factors, which can be used as domain knowledge to guide model training. Inspired by such insights, this article attempts to provide new insights into the explanation consistency from an empirical study perspective. Then this article studies how to represent and introduce domain knowledge constraints to make ML models more trustworthy. We achieve this by 1) proving that multiple prediction models with additive factor attributions will have the desirable property of primary and secondary relations consistency; and 2) showing that factor relations with quantity can be represented as an importance distribution for encoding domain knowledge. Factor explanation difference is penalized by the Wasserstein distance among prediction models. Experimental results using two online datasets show that domain knowledge of stable factor relations exists. Using this knowledge not only improves happiness prediction accuracy but also reveals more significant happiness factors for assisting decisions.},

To address the issue, we introduce a space–frequency and global–local attentive network (SFGLA-Net) for sequential deepfake detection. This method is designed to identify and analyze the sophisticated manipulated attributes of deepfake images. Specifically, we introduce a space–frequency fusion module to leverage the deep feature extracted in spatial and frequency domains, so as to exploit subtle inconsistencies and artifacts that are not perceptible in the spatial domain alone. Additionally, we design a global–local attention module to pinpoint the manipulated areas more accurately.

We assess five novel SoP hypotheses about successful behavior. We propose two algorithms to automatically compute an agent’s SoP vector and describe the important factors in this computation. As an agent’s SoP depends on the game state and its perception of threat, we develop a novel “means, motive, and opportunity” (MMO) model of threat and show that we can predict threats effectively using this model.

  abstract     = {The multimodal fake news detection is challenging due to the wide scope of news topics and the frequent speed of emerging event updates on social media, which leads to the difficulty of discernible feature extraction of real and fake news. Furthermore, existing studies failed to consider the reliability of modalities and their fluctuation across different news. This poses an enormous challenge in attaining trusted multimodal fusion for fake news detection. The lack of uncertainty estimation, which shows the extent such decisions can be trusted, further compounds this issue. Thus, a novel method named trusted multimodal evidential fusion considering behavior information (TMEF-BI) was proposed, including the multimodal data evidence acquisition module, uncertainty estimation module, and trusted multimodal fusion module. It aims to: 1) acquire sufficient discernible features of real and fake news via speaker behavior information, which can provide domain invariant information beyond news content through their underlying state of mind and intentions; and 2) provide reliable decisions via uncertainty estimation. The experimental results suggest that the proposed method achieved an accuracy of 97.95%. Further experiments suggest that evidential fusion encompassed a deeper consideration of the uncertainty associated with each modality, leading to more reliable decision-making. This method sheds light on a fresh perspective on detecting multimodal fake news through reliability analysis.},

  abstract     = {The demand, technologies, and market all put forward the request for platformization of the vehicle logistics industry. In China, a few logistics companies have plans but only one has initially built a platform for vehicle logistics. This platform has also attracted a considerable number of service providers to join, which has led to competition between service providers and the platform. To promote the platformization of the vehicle logistics industry and attract more customers to use platform-based services, how to leverage the incentive effect of subsidies is a topic of concern for the government. Motivated by the above, this article discusses whether the exogenous subsidies (provided to customers for platform service or providers service) can accelerate the process of the vehicle logistics industry. We explore the role of subsidies by developing a model (a hotelling line) that describes the differentiated competition between the platform and service providers. Our study found that subsidies do not always work as expected. The effectiveness of the subsidy depends on service advantages and customer preferences. Subsidies may even be counterproductive if customers prefer service providers or if platform services lack advantages. This is a reminder for both the government and industry that to accelerate the platformization of the vehicle logistics industry, it is necessary to combine reality and not blindly subsidize.},

While these systems have demonstrated significant potential in addressing customer needs, they typically assume that users will interact with the dialogue agent in a polite manner. This assumption, however, is often unrealistic, as users may express impatience or frustration through impolite behavior. Addressing this gap, this article investigates the impact of impolite user behavior on the performance of TOD systems. To this end, we developed a novel corpus of impolite dialogues and conducted comprehensive experiments to evaluate the performance of state-of-the-art TOD systems on this dataset. Our results reveal a notable limitation: existing TOD systems struggle to handle impolite user utterances effectively, leading to degraded performance. To mitigate this issue, we introduce a data augmentation approach designed to improve the systems’ ability to manage impolite dialogues. Although this method achieves measurable improvements, managing impolite user interactions remains a challenging research problem. By making our impolite dialogue corpus publicly accessible, we aim to encourage further research in this underexplored area. This study underscores the need for more robust TOD systems capable of handling diverse user behaviors, ultimately enhancing their applicability in real-world scenarios.},

Previous studies utilize human–robot collaboration and parallel workstations to enhance disassembly efficiency.

As the number of disassembly lines in a plant increases, labor resources such as workers and robots become redundant, leading to low resource utilization and decreased disassembly revenue. This study proposes a novel disassembly scheme aimed at achieving high efficiency by leveraging parallelization and human–robot collaboration to share labor resources on a hybrid disassembly line. Specifically, this work develops a mixed-integer programming model to maximize disassembly profit. A discrete aquila optimizer algorithm, incorporating uniform variation and two-point crossover methods, provides the solution for the problem. Furthermore, the correctness of the proposed model and algorithm is verified within the solvable range of the commercial solver CPLEX.

To fill the gap, we start from the ground truth by empirically studying the breadth and depth of the DAO markets in mainstream public chain ecosystems in this article. We dive into the most widely adoptable DAO launchpad, Snapshot, which covers 95% of the wild DAO projects for data collection and analysis. By integrating extensively enrolled DAOs and corresponding data measurements, we explore statistical resources from Snapshot and analyze data from 581 DAO projects, encompassing 16 246 proposals over the course of 3+ years. Our empirical research has uncovered a multitude of previously unknown facts about DAOs, spanning topics such as their status, features, performance, threats, and ways of improvement. We have distilled these findings into a series of key insights and takeaway messages, emphasizing their significance.

This article proposes a novel approach $M^{2}RM^{2}UL$, which stands for multimodal movie recommendation with multitasking and movie–user learning. The initial phase involves preprocessing multimodal movie data to extract features encompassing visual and textual information. Subsequently, a multitasking architecture is employed, simultaneously undertaking classification and regression tasks to acquire user and movie representations. The learned representations are used to make personalized and accurate movie recommendations. Additionally, the Netflix Prize dataset has been augmented to include textual and visual features, rendering it multimodal. We conducted extensive experiments on three real-world multimodal movie datasets (Movielens-100K, MMTF-14K, and Netflix Prize) and compared our approach with several state-of-the-art movie recommendation algorithms. The experimental results illustrate that our approach outperforms the baseline methods in terms of recommendation accuracy and diversity. Furthermore, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in different scenarios, such as cold-start and sparse data. Our empirical study provides strong evidence for the effectiveness of the proposed approach in multimodal movie recommendation.},

  abstract     = {Recommender Systems in real scenarios suffer from poor representation ability of user–item interaction graph caused by data sparsity and data noise. Most of the existing models have problems of instability and limited generation ability. This article proposes a novel recommendation method called graph generative diffusion with hard negative sampling contrastive learning recommendation method (GGDHSCL) to overcome the limitations above. First, the latent diffusion model (L-diffusion) and parametric topological noise reduction network (PTDNet) were introduced as view generators to improve the limited representation ability and mitigate noise. Second, dual-view contrastive learning was constructed to alleviate the limitations of high-quality data in the recommendation system and the problem of model collapse in the training process. Third, a hard negative sampling strategy was proposed to improve the self-supervised signal. We extensively compared our method with 14 popular baselines on four public datasets (Yelp, BeerAdvocate, Gowalla, and LastFM). Experiments show an improvement of recommendation quality (e.g., that on the BeerAdocate dataset, NDCG@40 is improved by 3.6% and Recall@40 is improved by 3.3% on BeerAdvocate dataset).},

  abstract     = {The stock market is a profit-oriented, chaotic, and nonlinear market game platform. Because price changes are directly related to investors’ returns, the accurate prediction of the short-term trend of stock prices has garnered significant attention. Recently, the application of a graph neural network (GNN) has become a research hotspot because of its ability to mine the momentum spillover effect between asset prices to achieve more effective forecasting. However, the graph data used in previous studies are difficult to obtain and process, and there is much room for improvement at the feature processing level. In this study, we construct a dynamic inductive predictive graph neural network (DIP-GNN) model, which introduces a sequence decomposition algorithm to separate the wave modes of the data, which can considerably simplify the learning difficulty of the model, thereby improving the overall performance. In addition, on the basis of the information captured by a recurrent neural network in the time dimension, the model uses Pearson’s correlation coefficient, Manhattan distance, and dynamic time warping to dynamically evaluate the short-term correlation between daily stock prices, and then the identified dynamic relation network to extract valuable cross-sectional information. By combining the cross-sectional information with the temporal information and applying it to the graph representation learning task, stock dynamics can be revealed more effectively. Multiple comparative experiments show that DIP-GNN exhibits better predictive performance than the benchmark models and has robust and much superior profitability over traditional strategies in several markets.},

Existing methods focus on majority voting or integrating opinions from a few assigned annotators, leading to biased decisions and limited performance. To address this issue, this article proposes a cascade perspective network (CPNet) to uncover reliable disagreement for subjective tasks. Specifically, CPNet learns each annotator’s personalized knowledge from annotation disagreement and stores them in an annotator bank through the personal perspective module for abundant disagreement information. Then, CPNet obtains consistent opinions by referring to all annotators’ opinions from the annotator bank through the comprehensive perspective module to reduce bias caused by noise. CPNet improves decision-making by considering the diversity and comprehensiveness of all annotators’ opinions. Moreover, it performs well in subjective tasks with limited or numerous annotators. The state-of-the-art (SOTA) results on subjective datasets from different domains demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of CPNet.},

  abstract     = {Social recommendation leverages social network to complement user–item interaction data for recommendation task, aiming to mitigate the data sparsity issue in recommender systems. The information propagation mechanism of graph neural networks (GNNs) aligns well with the process of social influence diffusion in social network, thereby can theoretically boost the performance of recommendation. However, existing social recommendation methods encounter the following challenge: both social network and interaction data contain substantial noise, and the propagation of such noise through GNNs not only fails to enhance recommendation performance but may also interfere with the model’s normal training. However, despite the importance of denoising for social network and interaction data, only a limited number of studies have considered the denoising for social network and all of them overlook that for interaction data, hindering the denoising effect and recommendation performance. Based on this, we propose a novel model called dual-domain collaborative denoising for social recommendation (DCDSR). DCDSR comprises two primary modules: the structure-level collaborative denoising module and the embedding-space collaborative denoising module. In the structure-level collaborative denoising module, information from the interaction domain is first employed to guide social network denoising. Subsequently, the denoised social network is used to supervise the denoising of interaction data. The embedding-space collaborative denoising module devotes to resisting the noise cross-domain diffusion problem through contrastive learning with dual-domain embedding collaborative perturbation. Additionally, a novel contrastive learning strategy, named Anchor-InfoNCE, is introduced to better harness the denoising capability of contrastive learning. The model is jointly trained under a recommendation task and a contrastive learning task. Evaluating our model on three real-world datasets verifies that DCDSR has a considerable denoising effect, thus outperforms the state-of-the-art social recommendation methods.},

Furthermore, the randomness involved in the selection of negative samples may lead to blurred distinctions between positive and negative samples. Therefore, we introduce a graph attention-based dual enhancement multiview clustering (GA-DE-MVC). The GA-DE-MVC first encodes structure and attributes through attention mechanisms and fully connected layers to achieve dual enhancement of structure and attributes. Then, it selects the farthest sample as the negative sample based on the Euclidean distance between cluster centers, to alleviate the randomness in negative sample selection, thereby enhancing the distinctiveness between positive and negative samples.The experimental results on six datasets surpass existing algorithms, verifying the effectiveness of the GA-DE-MVC algorithm.},

This study integrated time-varying flight schedules, connecting airports, and epidemic situations in airport catchment areas for estimating a traveler's exposure risk during the user-defined flight journey and applying to the timely exposure risk during air travel (TERAT) for a spatial decision support system (SDSS). We leveraged epidemic information and dynamic flight schedules to estimate personalized and timely exposure risk. Flight frequency and arrival time of all inbound flights within 6 h before and after the current time were encompassed to determine the potentially infected passenger sources. We estimated the timely airport exposure risk for the user's destination airport and its top 10 importation risk origin airports and demonstrated the top 10 risk final destination airports from the user's destination airport. Two real-world scenarios showed that direct flight and transfer air passengers were exposed to time-varying risks at different travel stages; additionally, all high-risk exposure routes were highlighted. To our knowledge, TERAT is the first attempt to leverage real-world dynamic epidemiological data and flight schedules to estimate time-varying exposure risk for user-defined routes. We further converted airport exposure risk into four levels for determining the personal protection measures to facilitate the usage of exposure risk applications. Therefore, air passengers can protect themselves when facing passengers from high-risk areas in advance.},

  abstract     = {Individual next location prediction plays a crucial role in location-based applications, such as route navigation and service recommendation. Although the existing research based on deep learning effectively captures users' spatiotemporal travel preferences, there are challenges in the interpretability of location prediction, heavily relying on large-scale historical travel data for model training. Drawing inspiration from the powerful reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), this study proposes a novel multiround continuous dialogue mechanism and candidate set enhancement method, leveraging LLMs for next location prediction through step-by-step reasoning. In the first round of dialogue, we introduce activity prediction as an auxiliary task to narrow down the candidate locations. Subsequently, we establish an activity-aware prompt to enable LLM to achieve accurate location prediction and provide corresponding reasoning. Finally, we incorporate a third round of dialogue to prompt LLM to make necessary corrections by integrating the prediction results of deep learning models. To address the issues of LLMs being affected by element ranking within the candidate set, we propose a new candidate set enhancement method based on the entropy-weighted Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS). Our model can understand user travel preferences by fusing location, activity, and time information through natural language. Extensive experiments are conducted on two public datasets of user check-ins, and the results show that our model achieves prediction performance comparable to deep learning models in full-sample prediction and outperforms them in the few-shot settings. Our model provides logical and explainable reasoning, offering insightful guidance for downstream application tasks.},

  abstract     = {Cyber propaganda has become an increasingly sophisticated tool for manipulating public perception and discourse within online social networks (OSNs). The effectiveness of cyber propaganda is strongly influenced by the interplay between individual awareness and the underlying topology of OSNs that facilitates the spread of propaganda. However, existing interventions primarily focus on continuous control strategies, which may not be feasible in certain real-world scenarios. Therefore, effectively suppressing the spread of cyber propaganda while taking into account the above impact factors remains a challenging problem. In this study, we propose a methodology that combines the optimal impulse control (OIC) theory with a novel propagation model to address this problem. Our propagation model is the first to take into account the effects of the cognitive differences and interconnectivity of OSNs on the dynamics of cyber propaganda. By employing the OIC framework and our newly developed propagation model, we formulate an OIC problem. The goal is to find impulse strategies that optimally balance the cost of intervention against its effectiveness. Using the impulse maximum principle, we establish the necessary conditions for optimal impulse strategies and construct an algorithm to solve the OIC problem. Our numerical experiments, conducted on three distinct social networks, demonstrated that: 1) awareness levels play a crucial role in effectively suppressing the spread of cyber propaganda on OSNs; and 2) our impulse strategies are significantly superior to random strategies in terms of suppression effect, thereby evidencing their cost-effectiveness.},

Given that duplicate comments are generated from templates or predrafted texts, they can easily overwhelm the commenting process, and massive opinion spam campaigns have made manually flagging duplicate comments a costly and time-consuming task for rulemaking agencies. To help agencies in their deduplication efforts, we developed and tested a highly accurate and cost-effective technique based on unsupervised deep machine learning. Our method used the graph augmented deep learning model to embed the comment texts into vectors, and then we applied the clustering method to the embedded vectors to identify similar comments. To test the efficacy of the proposed approach, we applied our technique to the raw data from the Federal Communications Commission’s (FCC) proposed rule change on Net Neutrality in 2017.

However, most existing methods predominantly focus on the user’s psychological state and the causes of user’s emotional problem, neglecting key cues, e.g., topics of conversation and listener’s psychological state. This leads to an incomplete understanding of the user’s situation and ineffective emotional support. This article presents a novel method that utilizes prompt learning with multiperspective cues (PMPC) to generate emotional support responses. Specifically, we extract multiperspective cues from the dialogue history and the causes of user’s emotional problem. To fully utilize the different cues within the ESC system, we categorize them into two groups: semantic enhancement cues and semantic constraint cues. Subsequently, we construct two prompts based on different categories of cues, which are designed to thoroughly understand user’s emotional predicament and generate an engaging support response, respectively. Experimental results on the ESConv dataset demonstrate that our proposed PMPC can surpass other approaches in both automatic and human evaluation metrics, providing compelling evidence of its efficacy and potential impact in real-world applications.},

  abstract     = {Community detection in signed networks reveals mesoscale structures and sign characteristics, facilitating accurate and realistic understanding of real-life signed networks. Given the complexity of signed community structures and the NP-hard challenge of achieving optimal partitions, modularity optimization using memetic algorithms has emerged as a promising approach. However, the identified signed partitions still face challenges in modularity quality and precision, with many misassigned nodes or being stuck at local optima, particularly in ambiguous and complex structures. To address this issue, this article introduces a new concept: central-node signed motif, a higher order local topological feature that effectively identifies signed communities, providing richer and more efficient topological information. Furthermore, we utilize these central-node signed motifs to improve community detection through a framework named higher order local search assisted memetic modularity (HLSMM). In HLSMM, we design a central-node signed motif-based local search strategy to optimize node assignments and improve modularity quality and structural balance of optimized signed communities. Experimental results from synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the local search strategy in enhancing accuracy and modularity quality. HLSMM exhibits a general advantage in modularity quality over currently representative methods on real-world datasets, particularly in ambiguous and complex community structures.},

A reversed process of Role-Based Collaboration (RBC) is proposed for emergence studies. The Environments–Classes, Agents, Roles, Groups, and Objects (E-CARGO) model is the fundamental model of RBC. A well extended E-CARGO (EE-CARGO) model is proposed to modeling a social system with emergent properties. The system is abstracted into agent-role level, roles are modeled as a tree structure and role emergence is identified and analyzed at multiple scales. Then we derive that the masses are primary, and the individual agent is secondary to understanding the emergence forming. A case study is accomplished to verify the effectiveness of proposed approach (i.e., the reversed RBC process and EE-CARGO model). The results are revealed that the role emergence fits a cubic curve estimation by time and at a moderate scale, the role emergence happens easily. Role performances at a small scale affect super-role emergence at a large scale statistically, and vice versa. The proposed approach can be applied to investigate emergence in a variety of areas, such as social evolution.},

  abstract     = {Bound by social bonds, people often travel in groups, exhibiting mutual correlations in their mobility behaviors, known as mobility correlations. However, conventional graphs, which describe pairwise connections between vertices, fail to adequately capture the complex many-to-many connection characteristics of multiple individuals. To address this limitation, we propose a novel semisupervised hypergraph clustering (SSHC) model aimed at unraveling the intricate correlations among individuals before discerning their latent clusters. Each individual is characterized by features that encompass spatial, temporal, and attributive diversity. The high-order correlations concealed among multiple individuals are captured using a hypergraph framework featuring hyperedges. Building upon this foundation, we fuse individuals’ latent feature representations, extracted via an auto-encoder, with their structural representations derived from a hypergraph convolutional network. Through this fusion, we identify clusters of similar individuals exhibiting mobility correlations. Notably, our model incorporates a semisupervised learning scheme, leveraging priori patterns gleaned from a small pool of ground-truth data to better express latent patterns within unlabeled datasets. Experimental validations conducted in five public datasets corroborate the superiority of our proposed model over baseline methods in elucidating complex correlations within vast datasets. In addition, experiments conducted on Beijing Transit Smart Card Data showcase promising results in identifying correlated individuals with similar mobility patterns. The delineation of groups of individuals exhibiting mobility correlations is of paramount importance, particularly in accurately detecting their connection networks during public emergencies, such as the transmission of dangerous pathogens.},

Considering the interactions among multiple online social platforms, the multilayer IM problem poses further challenges ($\rm i.e.,$ high-simulation burden and low-optimization quality). To solve these problems, this article proposes a susceptible-exposed-infected1-infected2-infected12-vigilant (SE3IV) model to simulate the information spreading process in multilayer networks. The spreading dynamic is modeled by mean-field equations considering the effect of cross-layer propagation. To optimize the multilayer information maximization modeled by SE3IV, an asynchronous distributed cooperative coevolutionary algorithm (ADCA) is proposed. To improve the efficiency of the algorithm in multilayer networks, the multilayer community detection first decompresses the network into a single layer by dimension-based method. Then, the Louvain method is adopted to decompose the problems into subcomponents with lower dimensionality. The populations with the same size evolve corresponding subcomponents in an asynchronous and distributed way based on the pool model. Besides, an asynchronous communication mechanism is devised to manage the communication among the shared pool. An adaptive seeds regulation strategy is designed to adjust the number of seeds of subcomponents. Numerous experiments on different networks show that ADCA possesses good scalability and efficiency, especially in large-scale networks.},

In Opportunistic MCS, the real-time mobility of participants and requesters is a crucial feature, as it significantly impacts the quality of MCS services. However, most existing task allocation approaches focus on optimizing the overall system performance while disregarding the mobile attribute of participants and requesters. To remedy this issue, this article proposes a real-time route prediction-based multiobjective task allocation for Opportunistic MCS, called RRP-MOTA, which presents the participants’ route-considered task allocation scheme to maximize social welfare comprehensively. Specifically, instead of merely optimizing system performance, a two-stage mechanism is designed to comprehensively enhance task allocation efficiency by estimating and leveraging participants’ routes. Moreover, by utilizing participants’ spatio–temporal location information, an improved graph convolutional network-based participant route prediction method is developed to provide more accurate participant location information for task allocation. Furthermore, a reference vector-based multiobjective task allocation method is suggested to cater to diverse usage preferences by balancing quality of service and task cost. To validate the performance of our proposed method, extensive simulations are performed on synthetic and real datasets in two scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed RRP-MOTA significantly outperforms the chosen existing designs.},

First, a gas text joint extraction method (GTJM) for gas accident cases is proposed at the first stage. The multigranularity training tasks in the enhanced representation through knowledge integration (ERNIE) pretrained model are used to address the issue of insufficient context understanding when processing long texts in gas cases while combining multihead attention mechanism to obtain richer semantic information. The cascade binary tagging framework (CasRel) is then utilized to extract entities and relationships contained in the background and disposal information of accident cases, to tackle the problem of overlapping entity extraction in gas accident case texts. Second, in the second stage, the bidirectional encoder representation from transformers (BERT) is used to capture the contextual features of compressed events, while a novel Incept-text convolutional neural network (TextCNN) focuses on the global semantic information within compressed events. The combination of both models could resolve the problem of sequential relationship identification between long events much better. Finally, a clear event logic knowledge graph is formed for gas accident disposal in emergencies. The experimental results indicate that in the first phase, the GTJM model has an average improvement of 7% in F1 value compared to other baseline models. In the second phase, the accuracy of the sequential relationship identification reaches 92%. The feasibility of the proposed method is verified through real cases. The study could provide auxiliary decision support for emergency disposal in gas accidents.},

  abstract     = {3-D action recognition become a fast-pacing field in recent years. However, traditional approaches have limitations. They either focus on modeling overly detailed yet redundant information by reconstructing the coordinates of each body joint. Alternatively, they treat actions as a whole, overlooking the spatial and temporal variations in the semantic locality of actions. To address these limitations, we propose representing long-term actions as contexts of short-term actions organized by locality-aware graphs. In our framework, we take the inspiration that the continuity of motion and pose variations generate higher correlations. These correlations occur among spatio-temporally adjacent joints. Built upon this, we craft short-term actions as embeddings using spatio-temporal graph convolutions. This graph-based encoding not only captures richer high-level semantics but also maintains an awareness of the topology. To capture long-term action dynamics effectively, we integrate a graph convolutional gated recurrent unit (GraphGRU) for the fusion of action embeddings. Additionally, we introduce the context-aware topological attention (CTA) mechanism. Positioned between embedding encoding and context aggregation phases, CTA amplifies the features of context-relevant nodes. Lastly, we create self-supervision by contrasting predicted embeddings with actual encoded embeddings. This approach explicitly learns changes in dynamics to obtain distinct embeddings. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our approach outperforms mainstream unsupervised 3-D action recognition methods.},

  abstract     = {The rapid spread of online rumors has significant negative impacts on the online ecosystem and social order, which is closely tied to users’ cognitive traits. To explore the mechanisms of rumor propagation driven by cognition and mitigate its harm, we propose an information diffusion model based on the rumor, antirumor, and cognitive game. First, to address the uncertainty and difficulty in quantifying cognitive biases, and considering the advantages of fuzzy logic theory in handling uncertainty, a fuzzy logic-based algorithm for measuring user cognitive biases is proposed. Moreover, recognizing the nonlinear relationships among various factors, polynomial functions are introduced as the output of fuzzy rules to more accurately describe these complex relationships. Second, regarding the symbiotic and antagonistic relationships among multiple types of rumor information under the influence of cognitive biases, and leveraging the strengths of game theory in analyzing complex systems characterized by coexistence of symbiosis and antagonism, an evolutionary game-based rumor-antirumor user behavior mechanism is developed. This provides a robust theoretical foundation for understanding user state transitions and their evolutionary patterns. Finally, integrating the aforementioned research, and considering that the dynamic evolution of user cognition leads to variations in trust responses and attitudes toward rumor and antirumor information, the concepts of trust states—trust in rumor (TR) and trust in antirumor (TA)—are introduced into the classical susceptible-infectious-recovered (SIR) model. On this basis, a rumor propagation susceptible-trused-infectious-recovered (STIR) model incorporating user cognitive biases and evolutionary game theory is further constructed. Experimental results demonstrate that this model effectively reveals the game dynamics of multiple types of rumor information, providing a more efficient framework for studying rumor propagation in social networks.},

  abstract     = {Detecting rumors on social networks is increasingly important due to their rapid dissemination and negative societal impact. The structural characteristics of propagation play a crucial role in rumor detection. However, most current graph neural network-based methods focus on spatial structural features, overlooking the temporal structural features or exploring spatio-temporal features from a single perspective, failing to comprehensively and finely learn representations of dynamic events. Therefore, this article proposes a multiview spatio-temporal feature learning method based on dual dynamic graph convolutional networks. First, dynamic graphs of information propagation and user interactions are constructed based on retweet and reply relationships. Second, BERT is utilized to extract semantic features of content, serving as initial node representations for the information propagation graph, while social features of users serve as initial node representations for the user interaction graph.

Finally, a time fusion unit based on cross-attention is devised to facilitate the learning and fusion of the spatio-temporal features from the two dynamic graphs.

  abstract     = {Current projections indicate that many countries worldwide are experiencing an increase in the older adult population. Thus, it is important to develop methodologies and tools to improve the quality of life of aging people in terms of their cognitive, social, and physical well-being. An area that is currently showing considerable potential in coping with cognitive decline associated with the aging process is digital serious games. Recent years have witnessed a significant attention increase toward this topic with contributions from several research communities. Although some previous work aimed to synthesize the main findings in related areas, a focused and systematic review categorizing and discussing the literature on cognitive training for older adults is still lacking. To this aim, we selected 113 relevant articles from four international databases. We analyzed them on different relevant dimensions, such as the interactive technologies employed in the games, the activities supported, the user profiles participating in the studies, the factors influencing user engagement and motivation, and the effects of training on the addressed cognitive functions. The analysis of the above dimensions is useful to uncover the factors that distinguish successful cognitive interventions from less effective ones and to facilitate the creation of engaging training programs tailored to the needs of older adults. At the same time, by highlighting promising avenues for further research, the review provides useful indications to researchers and practitioners interested in this field.},

Despite the lack of appropriate benchmark video datasets for forgery detection at night time using infrared (IR) video modality, we designed a novel ground truth annotated forged video dataset named as “NV2CIR (Night Vision Video Forensic Challenges based IR Forged Dataset)” in real-world night time situations. The dataset contains various 310 infrared imaging based forged videos (i.e., object based forgery, interframe forgery, and intraframe forgery) and their corresponding 310 authentic videos. The article also proposed a novel framework named as “AFOD-Net (attention guided fake object detection network)” for localization of spliced objects in night vision outdoor scenarios. The proposed network employs a long short term memory (LSTM) module and our proposed spliced object attention module (SOA) so as to precisely localize the spatio-temporal spliced regions.

  abstract     = {Minimum-cost consensus (MCC) is an effective technique for reducing differences of opinion in group decision-making that is sensitive to adjustment costs. Classical MCC aims to obtain an optimal solution regarding the consensus reaching process (CRP) with the objective function of minimizing the group adjustment cost. However, the following limitations exist: 1) the absolute adjustment cost is usually employed as the sole criterion, which is susceptible to the uneven distribution of individual opinions; and 2) while some MCC models account for over-adjustment, how to prevent over-adjustment in the CRP with relative adjustment costs remains almost unexplored. To this end, this study proposes minimum-relative-cost consensus (MRCC) models based on personalized feedback constraints. First, the concept of relative adjustment cost is defined. The notion of personalized feedback constraint is introduced to take full account for individual willingness to adjust their respective opinions. According to different types of consensus constraints, three personalized feedback constraint-driven MRCC models are constructed. We then perform the cost analysis, which shows that MRCC changes the acting mechanism of classical MCC on CRP. In addition, we explore the integration of MCC and MRCC to fully utilize the advantages of both. Finally, a case study of online healthcare community knowledge services and the comparative analysis reveals the feasibility and advantages of the models.},

  abstract     = {Short videos have surged in popularity on social media. The emotions expressed by short videos can trigger or even magnify the public sentiment. Hence, accurate computation of these emotions is vital for social affective computing. However, the multimodal emotion analysis of short videos on social platforms faces some challenges: the accuracy of the model is tested by the disunity of video resolution; the collection of large-scale social media data, the manual transcription and segmentation of audio content, and the precise labeling process require a lot of manpower. In this article, we have proposed an affective computing system MEAS for social short videos, which combines multiscale resolution adaptability and advanced RoBERTa model to optimize the preprocessing of high definition large size short videos and improve the contribution of text modality in emotion analysis. In addition, the system also adopts automatic audio segmentation and transcription technology to realize the efficient capture of speech forms in social short videos. Experimental results show that compared with the leading open source algorithm V2EM on the IEMOCAP dataset, the proposed method achieves a significant increase in weighted accuracy and F1 score of 4.17% and 7.29%, respectively. We constructed a novel dataset named “Bili-news” based on social platform news short videos, validating the effectiveness of the MEAS system. Through experimental verification, we also find a significant positive correlation between the emotions expressed in short videos and the social sentiments of the audience.},

  abstract     = {The enigmatic link between inflation and remittances in Pakistan has puzzled economists. We argue hidden time scales, beyond short-run and long-run, hold the key. Using wavelet decomposition and employing Granger causality on 1991(07)-2022(06) data, we find a nuanced picture. Remittances from Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries engage in a “bidirectional tango” with inflation in the medium-long run, impacting each other. Intriguingly, remittances from other regions (USA, U.K., and EU) follow similar steps, except in the USA where inflation leads remittances in the medium-long term. This partially supports our hypothesis that inflation can drive remittances, particularly during the year’s first months. While in short run, a counterintuitive dynamic emerges where inflation exerts a transitory influence on remittances, the relationship undergoes a reversal across the year, with remittances becoming a catalyst for inflation, potentially mediated by an upsurge in construction activity. Furthermore, our analysis indicates that remittances are predominantly utilized for essential necessities or investments, rather than nonfood purchases. Overall, in the short and medium term, inflation acts as a driver of remittances, with cyclical fluctuations in inflation mirroring those in remittances, particularly during the first half of the year. This dynamic weakens or disappears in the long run, suggesting other factors dominate. The complex relationship between inflation and remittances unfolds across timeframes and depends on remittance source country and inflation indicator. This study paves the way for research informing policy decisions that promote economic growth, maintain stability, and harness the full potential of remittances for Pakistan.},

This model directly analyzes and synthesizes customer feedback from online reviews to generate dynamic and precise hotel ratings.

The proposed hotel rating model outperformed baseline models across experiments, demonstrating superior adaptability, scalability, and robustness. Notably, it achieved an accuracy of 0.9123 and an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.9536 on diverse datasets, and its performance consistently improved with increased data volumes, reaching 0.9376 accuracy and 0.9612 AUC at 75% data volume.

Graphs with weak information lack adequate training data to guide the graph learning process, resulting in performance loss. This article presents a novel automated data augmentation for graphs with weak information, namely AutoDAW, which aims to derive more informative node representations from incomplete input graphs in an adaptive way. To learn local features at the subgraph level, we adopt a reinforcement learning method to optimize the aggregation range for each node. To capture global semantic information, we present a graph diffusion-based long-range propagation method to facilitate more effective node feature propagation and aggregation. The dual-stage information aggregation promotes synergistic interactions between the two node representations. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness, generalization, and robustness of AutoDAW.},

  abstract     = {In multimedia social networks, the user's geo-location can be inferred by matching his shared images with the referenced satellite images, viz. cross-view image geo-localization. Although the existing most cross-view image geo-localization methods perform well in the center-misaligned scenario, in practical application, the shooting location of the query ground image is most likely not aligned with the center point of satellite images. Then, their geo-localization accuracy would drastically decrease. Therefore, we propose a novel cross-view image geo-localization model based on ground-to-satellite (G2S) transform, named CIG2S. First, the queried ground image is transformed into the aerial-view by spherical transform, generating G2S images, which could improve the similarity between ground and satellite images. Second, multiscale features are extracted from the original ground image, G2S images, and satellite images by twins-PCPVT. Furthermore, a dynamic similarity weighted loss function is designed to measure the distance between the query ground image and the referenced satellite image. Experimental results on three center-misaligned datasets, including VIGOR and the center-misaligned versions of CVUSA and CVACT, demonstrate that the proposed CIG2S model can significantly improve the geo-localization accuracy. For example, when compared with another vision-transformer-based model L2LTR-polar, CIG2S can outperform about 6.6% and 15.8% in the center-misaligned datasets CVUSA_CM and CVACT_CM.},

Existing methods improve ASC performance by incorporating syntactic dependencies through a graph convolution layer on top of BERT. However, these approaches often assign a fixed weight to edges with the same dependency type, overlooking the contextual nuances these dependencies can convey. To address this, we propose syntax-enhanced BERT (SE-BERT), which integrates syntactic distance embeddings, a syntax-enhanced transformer, aspect-specific masking, and a sentiment classification layer. SE-BERT advances previous methods in two main ways. First, SE-BERT enables dynamic weighting for edges with the same dependency type based on the source node's part-of-speech (POS) tags, which enhances graph propagation accuracy and enables more precise edge associations. Second, rather than adding additional graph convolutional layers on top of BERT, SE-BERT replaces BERT's final Transformer layers with the proposed SE-Transformer. This approach directly encodes syntactic information into the attention distribution and word representation within scaled dot-product attention. The model can be initialized from a pretrained checkpoint and fine-tuned for downstream tasks without requiring additional training parameters. Experimental results on five benchmark datasets demonstrate that SE-BERT outperforms existing ASC methods.},

The sustainability and success of open source projects rely heavily on the active community of contributors, who have the freedom to join or depart voluntarily. The churn of core developers can have detrimental effects on the continuous development and progress of these communities. Therefore, previous studies have aimed to identify the factors that influence developer churn and reveal its impact on open source communities. However, there is currently a lack of research on predicting whether a developer will leave or retain within a given timeframe. This article aims to bridge this gap by introducing a novel model called context-aware dynamic graph neural network (ConDyGNN), which is designed specifically for predicting developer churn in open source communities. By leveraging historical data, this model takes into consideration various factors such as developers’ activities, collaborative networks, and community context information. To capture both temporal dependencies and spatial correlations among different developers, temporal convolutional network (TCN) and graph convolutional network (GCN) modules are employed in ConDyGNN. Furthermore, a context-aware module based on a multihead attention mechanism is proposed to effectively integrate macrolevel community information and enhance the predictive performance. The superiority of the proposed model is empirically demonstrated through extensive comparative experiments and an ablation study.},

  abstract     = {With the continuous development of the health insurance system, the problem of health insurance fraud is becoming more and more prominent. Health insurance fraud not only harms health insurance organizations financially but also causes serious disruptions to the normal provision of healthcare services. Current fraud detection methods usually rely on a single data source or specific features, making it difficult to comprehensively capture the complex patterns and intrinsic associations of fraudulent behavior. Therefore, the aim of this study is to efficiently integrate feature information from different perspectives of health insurance data using multiperspective representation learning. Health insurance fraud detection via multiview heterogeneous information networks with augmented graph structure learning (MHINAGSL) is proposed. Initially, multiple heterogeneous graphs are constructed based on health insurance datasets, encompassing diffusion, topology, feature, and semantic graphs. To enhance these foundational perspectives, a confidence fusion optimizer is employed. Additionally, a multichannel semantic graph convolution with shared parameters is introduced to effectively integrate diverse meta-path semantic graphs. Subsequently, an adaptive attention mechanism assigns weights to different views, facilitating the comprehensive fusion of information from multiple perspectives and enabling a more accurate characterization of the richness of health insurance data. Ultimately, the combination of multiple loss functions is employed for end-to-end model training, aiming to fully leverage the complementary advantages of multiview data, thereby enhancing the robustness and generalization ability of fraud detection models. We fully apply the proposed method to real health insurance datasets and provide in-depth validation of its comprehensive utility in real-world scenarios. Extensive experimental results fully confirm that our approach achieves significant results in improving accuracy and recall. Particularly noteworthy is that in the anomaly detection experiments, our method achieved an F1 score as high as 0.92, further proving its excellent performance. This also demonstrates the practical application and research value of the approach based on multiview heterogeneous information network structure learning in the field of health insurance fraud detection.},

To address this issue, this article proposes a two-stage MADM consensus method for large-scale participatory budget project selection problems. In the first stage, the ISODATA algorithm segments large participatory districts into subclusters, followed by an iterative algorithm based on group contribution theory to generate subcluster decision matrices. In the second stage, each subcluster is treated as a new participant, with district fairness considered to refine decision-making power through iterative adjustments, resulting in more manageable decisions. Finally, the iterative consensus-reaching algorithm is applied again to get the final group decision result. The applicability of the proposed methodology is verified through a case study in the Poland participant city project selection budget and comparative analysis. The result demonstrates that the methodology can integrate the preferences of different districts, facilitate budget consensus reaching, and improve the misrepresentations and fairness of decision-making.},

  abstract     = {Empowered by blockchain technology, smart contracts have attracted considerable interest from Web3 users due to their distinct advantages. Nevertheless, it is challenging to address problems caused by the dramatic expansion of the Web3 ecosystem. This article introduces the smart contract-as-a-service (SCaaS) paradigm to mitigate smart contracts’ redundant deployment via their composability and reusability. Moreover, we design trust and incentive schemes to ensure project security and developer engagement in SCaaS. Specifically, we first introduce a reputation filter by leveraging the authentic on-chain data, aiming to eliminate high-risk contracts. We then design a contract-based incentive mechanism to help the foundation attract heterogeneous developers with multidimensional private information, and maximize the foundation’s utility by inducing developers to undertake projects of differing complexities based on their ability. We further differentiate between veteran and newcome developers and examine their influences on foundational strategies. Finally, extensive experimental results demonstrate that our proposed contracts can efficiently remove high-risk smart contracts, maximize the foundation’s utility, and ensure that developers select contracts honestly and participate in the SCaaS ecosystem actively.},

  abstract     = {Fake news detection on social media is crucial to purifying the online environment and protecting public safety. Many existing methods explore the news propagation structures through graph neural networks (GNNs) to determine the truthfulness of news. End-to-end supervised GNNs notoriously depend on large amounts of labels. Recently, self-supervised graph pretraining has been a promising solution to alleviate the dependence on labels. However, the application of graph pretraining in fake news detection still suffers from two challenges: 1) the missing and unreliable interactions intrinsic in the news propagation structures seriously damage the pretraining performance. 2) There is an inherent gap between pretraining and downstream fake news detection tasks due to inconsistency in optimization objectives, which hinders the efficient transfer of pretrained prior knowledge and causes suboptimal detection results. To address the above two challenges, we propose RGCP, a structure redefined graph pretraining with contrastive prompting for fake news detection. Specifically, we design a propagation structure refinement module that adds potential implicit interactions and removes noisy interactions according to the connection probabilities between posts estimated under the guidance of self-supervised contrastive learning. Thereby, the redefined structures provide reliable news propagation patterns to generate robust pretrained news representations. Moreover, we propose a novel prompt tuning based on the contrastive learning module that reformulates the downstream fake news detection task in a similar form as the graph contrastive pretraining, bridging the optimization objective gap. The extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of RGCP, achieving an average improvement of 10.15% in few-shot classification.},

  abstract     = {In real-world networks, such as social networks, the occurrence of random failures or external attacks on network components can lead to the discontinuation of information flow in the network. Hence, ensuring the existence and robustness of these networks is a crucial concern these days. To address this problem, one possible solution is to redesign the connection between individual nodes in the network using some budget-constrained rewiring operations. Multiple rewiring operations help in building trust between individuals and strengthening their connections, further enhancing overall connectivity and information flow in the network. The effectiveness of rewiring approaches is determined by analyzing some important facts, such as the rewiring cost, adherence to budget constraints, and enhancement in network connectivity. To assess the efficacy of rewiring approaches, the rewiring cost has been regularly updated after each rewiring operation by measuring the evolution of the size of the giant component in the social network. The performance of the proposed budget-constrained rewiring approaches is evaluated against the random rewiring approach. The results show the superiority of the proposed approaches on the benchmark real-world dataset. By leveraging these budget-constrained rewiring approaches, it becomes possible to design social systems that exhibit enhanced stability and reliability of social networks in the face of various disruptions.},

With increased economic activity, various interrelations between listed companies have become important for accurate predictions. These relations can be represented as complex financial networks, aiding the development of effective graph neural network (GNN) prediction methods. However, current GNN-based methods for stock prediction typically rely on a single static network representation, which fails to capture the dynamic and multifaceted relationships inherent in financial markets. In this article, we propose the multilayer spatial–temporal graph neural network (MST-GNN) to model the complex and evolving interactions between stocks. The MST-GNN framework incorporates a novel spatial–temporal cross-layer high-order fusion mechanism, which includes two key components: spatial–temporal neighborhood aggregation and cross-layer high-order feature fusion. These components enable the model to effectively capture both the temporal evolution and cross-network feature interactions of stocks. Our extensive experiments on four stock networks from the China A-share market demonstrate that MST-GNN significantly outperforms existing GNN-based methods on stock price trend classification and return ranking tasks.},

  abstract     = {Multimodal emotion recognition from electroencephalogram (EEG) and eye movement signals has shown to be a promising approach to provide more discriminative information about human emotional states. However, most current works rely on a subject-dependent approach, limiting their applicability to new users. Recently, some studies have explored multimodal domain adaptation to address the mentioned issue by transferring information from known subjects to new ones. Unfortunately, existing methods are still exposed to negative transfer as a suboptimal distribution alignment is performed between subjects, while irrelevant information is not discarded. In this article, we present a multimodal and multisource domain adaptation (MMDA) method, which adopts the following three strategies: 1) marginal and conditional distribution alignments must be performed between each known subject and a new one; 2) relevant distribution alignments must be prioritized to avoid a negative transfer; and 3) modality fusion results should be improved by extracting more discriminative features from EEG signals and selecting relevant features across modalities. Our proposed method was evaluated with leave-one-subject-out cross validation on four public datasets: SEED, SEED-GER, SEED-IV, and SEED-V. Experimental results show that our proposal outperforms state-of-the-art results for each dataset when subject data from different sessions are combined into a single dataset. Moreover, MMDA exceeds the state of the art in 8 out of 11 different sessions when each session is evaluated.},

  abstract     = {The two most common families of electoral systems (ESs), defining the rules used to elect assemblies and legislative institutions, are proportional representation (PR) and plurality (Bormann and Golder, 2013; Farrell, 2011). When they are evaluated, most often the arguments come from social choice theory and political science. The former overall uses an axiomatic approach that includes a list of mathematical criteria a system should fulfill (Urken et al., 1995; Sen, 1995). The latter predominantly focuses on the tradeoff between proportionality of apportionment and governability (Monroe, 1994; Carey and Hix, 2011). However, there is an ongoing discussion about which ES is the best (Bowler et al., 2005; Farrell and Gallagher, 1999) and which set of indexes and measures would be the most important in such assessment (Pennisi, 1998). Although previous research addressed various perceptions of fairness related to the proportionality of different ESs (Blau, 2004; Plescia et al., 2020), the sensitivity of ES to efforts that influence opinions has been neglected. Here, we address this research gap with a framework that can measure ESs’ susceptibility to different means of influence. Using a simulation study, we show that plurality ESs are less stable than PR. They are more susceptible to coordinated efforts to influence opinions, for example, by political agitators and media propaganda. A review of real-world ES reveals possible improvements in their design, leading to lower susceptibility. Additionally, our simulation framework allows the computation of popular indexes, such as the Gallagher index and the effective number of parties, in different scenarios. Our work provides a new tool for dealing with modern threats to democracy that could destabilize voting processes (Hyde, 2020). Furthermore, our results add an important argument to a long-standing discussion on the evaluation of ES.},

However, factors such as hidden social relationships between users, various social contents, and diverse application scenarios in the vast social network bring severe challenges to the timely and accurate detection of rumors. Therefore, for the sake of exploring the infulence of the above factors, we propose an adaptive rumor detection model combining propagation link prediction (PLP) and semantic-structure adaptive fusion, PLP and semantic-structure adaptive fusion (PLP-SSAF). First, we investigate in depth the impact of hidden social relationships on the propagation structure of posts. We leverage the hidden social relationships between users, and utilize the graph attention neural network to extract propagation structure features that simultaneously include both current and future propagation structure. Second, in order to overcome regional and cultural differences among users in multidialect environment, we enhance the text in the original dataset and merge it with the source text. We use a language representation model to extract semantic features from the joint text, getting joint semantic features that can more comprehensively represent the text. Finally, we propose a parallel features adaptive fusion mechanism that can dynamically update the weights between propagating structure features and semantic features. This enables the obtained post features to better adapt to rumor detection scenarios in social networks under massive data environments. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets show that our PLP-SSAF significantly improving rumor detection performance in accuracy and generalization over existing methods, and demonstrates superior rumor detection capabilities at early stages.},

However, existing techniques face two challenges: 1) the inherent sparse supervision signals and noise issues in real-world social networks; 2) current social recommendation methods suffer from the neglect of user preference and social attribute heterogeneity, which hinders the extraction of preference-related information from social networks. Taking inspiration from social enhancement and contrastive learning methods, we propose a social recommendation model DSVC based on dual social view contrastive learning. Specifically, in response to the first challenge, our model derives the consistency factors of users in different augmented social views, which are used to highlight noise-resistant users and jettison preference-independent social relationships in social views. To address the second challenge, we adopt probability vectors generated from consistency factors. These vectors guide the cross-view augmentation process of the interaction graph, which helps supplement social self-supervised signals and effectively avoid noise retained due to indiscriminate augmentation. The baseline model comparison experiment, ablation experiment, parameter adjustment experiment and robustness experiment conducted on three different real-world datasets consistently validated the effectiveness of our model in improving recommendation performance.},

  abstract     = {Cross-corpus speech emotion recognition (SER) poses a challenge due to feature distribution mismatch between the training and testing speech samples, potentially degrading the performance of established SER methods. In this article, we tackle this challenge by proposing a novel transfer subspace learning method called acoustic knowledge-guided transfer linear regression (AKTLR). Unlike existing approaches, which often overlook domain-specific knowledge related to SER and simply treat cross-corpus SER as a generic transfer learning task, our AKTLR method is built upon a well-designed acoustic knowledge-guided dual sparsity constraint mechanism. This mechanism emphasizes the potential of minimalistic acoustic parameter feature sets to alleviate classifier over-adaptation, which is empirically validated acoustic knowledge in SER, enabling superior generalization in cross-corpus SER tasks compared to using large feature sets. Through this mechanism, we extend a simple transfer linear regression model to AKTLR. This extension harnesses its full capability to seek emotion-discriminative and corpus-invariant features from established acoustic parameter feature sets used for describing speech signals across two scales: contributive acoustic parameter groups and constituent elements within each contributive group. We evaluate our method through extensive cross-corpus SER experiments on three widely used speech emotion corpora: EmoDB, eNTERFACE, and CASIA. The proposed AKTLR achieves an average UAR of 42.12% across six tasks using the eGeMAPS feature set, outperforming many recent state-of-the-art transfer subspace learning and deep transfer learning methods. This demonstrates the effectiveness and superior performance of our approach. Furthermore, our work provides experimental evidence supporting the feasibility and superiority of incorporating domain-specific knowledge into the transfer learning model to address cross-corpus SER tasks.},

  abstract     = {In the film industry, movie posters have been an essential part of advertising and marketing for many decades and continue to play a vital role even today in the form of digital posters through online, social media, and over-the-top (OTT) platforms. Typically, movie posters can effectively promote and communicate the essence of a film, such as its genre, visual style/tone, vibe, and storyline cue/theme, which are essential to attract potential viewers. Identifying the genres of a movie often has significant practical applications in recommending the film to target audiences. Previous studies on genre identification have primarily focused on sources such as plot synopses, subtitles, metadata, movie scenes, and trailer videos; however, posters precede the availability of these sources and provide prerelease implicit information to generate mass interest. In this article, we work for automated multilabel movie genre identification only from poster images, without any aid of additional textual/metadata/video information about movies, which is one of the earliest attempts of its kind. Here, we present a deep transformer network with a probabilistic module to identify the movie genres exclusively from the poster. For experiments, we procured 13882 number of posters of 13 genres from the Internet movie database (IMDb), where our model performances were encouraging and even outperformed some major contemporary architectures.},

  abstract     = {Information leakage easily occurs in large-scale information interactions and brings harm to individuals, enterprises, and society. As a well-known security policy, Chinese Wall (CW) provides a security guideline, which combines mandatory and discretionary access control to avoid information leakage. Colored Petri nets (CPNs) are a widely used formal method, well suited for verification of CW policy due to the capability of characterizing the concurrency. However, CPN easily suffers from the problem of state space explosion due to the interleaving semantics. The unfolding techniques can effectively alleviate this problem. In this article, we apply simplified CPN and their unfolding techniques to detect information leakage against CW policy. Specifically, we define a CPN-based CW model, propose an algorithm to generate the merged process of CPN, and detect the potential information leakage by analyzing the structural behaviors of its unfoldings. Furthermore, we conduct a case study and several experiments to show the advantages of our method. The results exhibit that our method can effectively detect information leakage against CW policy and alleviate the state space explosion.},

  abstract     = {Density-based techniques are gaining popularity due to their inherent capability to detect nonconvex shaped clusters in the presence of noises and outliers. However, existing approaches suffer from higher computational costs and require optimization of global parameter values to determine similar density regions present within the data. The sparse similarity graphs can aid in detecting the neighborhood information which is essential to calculate the density distribution. We propose a technique, “graphical and gravitational force-based density clustering (GGDC)” by combining the concepts of graph neighborhood, density distribution, and gravitational force of attraction to obtain satisfying results with higher efficacy. First, the neighbors are identified using the similarity graph, and then a new density computation technique is proposed which considers the number of neighbors as well as their proximity information. Next, the density values are utilized to identify the similar density distributed regions using the force of gravity between the data points and their neighbors. Lastly, the neighboring denser regions are merged together to form the actual clusters using the gravitational force of attraction based on their density distribution and proximity. A thorough experimental study is performed to evaluate the performance of GGDC by comparing it to nine other well-known clustering algorithms on 26 diversified synthetic, gene expression, and real datasets including three application areas from computational social systems. The results show that GGDC is effective in identifying complex clusters and is also superior in terms of time complexity, and robustness against noise.},

However, traditional studies ignore DMs’ loss aversion behavior under uncertain environments. To address this gap, this article develops a two-stage distributionally robust minimum cost consensus model under uncertainty with loss aversion (TSDR-MCCM-LA). In the first stage, group opinion is obtained based on a predefined consensus level function. The second stage considers loss aversion under uncertainty. Further, considering DMs’ acceptance degrees of recommendations, we develop $\varepsilon$-TSDR-MCCM-LA and RB-TSDR-MCCM-LA to address DMs’ compromise limit and rejection behaviors, respectively. The proposed models are equivalently transformed into tractable mixed-integer programming models. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed models is proved by the case of urban demolition compensation negotiation. Sensitivity and comparison analysis further demonstrate the validity of the proposed model in coping with uncertainty and improving consensus outcomes.},

  abstract     = {Equipment manufacturing industry plays a pivotal role in a nation's economy, national development, and technological innovation. Traditional equipment manufacturing enterprises often face the problem of untimely information sharing and inconsistent focus of various departments in the process of operation, which causes difficulties in analysis and conflict in decision-making. Considering the subjectivity of interdepartmental decisions, reinforcement learning is introduced to analyze the decisions of various departments and get the decisions that best meet the needs of the enterprise. In addition, due to the instability of the internal and external environment of the enterprise, the decision obtained only by the machine usually cannot meet the development requirements of the enterprise, so human–machine coordination is used to adapt to the environmental changes. Therefore, a decision conflict resolution for equipment manufacturing enterprises based on human–machine coordination is proposed in this article. The resolution of conflicts in the context of deep human–computer collaborative decision-making is achieved through the incorporation of expert knowledge twice within the framework of reinforcement learning, thereby expressing preferences for both production factors and decision model structures. The experiments indicate that our model achieves superior performance in resolving decision conflicts.},

However, few existing researches fully consider the inherent characteristics of misinformation (e.g. evoking repulsive effects), as well as the adaptive nature of social relationship or come to see the impacts of algorithmic interventions on online misinformation and the formation process of social groups. To comprehensively investigate the coevolution process of user misinformation beliefs and social relationships under algorithmic interventions, we proposed a novel model with configurations as follows: 1) a nonlinear social influence function constructed to reflect the process of reinforcing misinformation beliefs; 2) probabilities for the rewiring of links among individuals determined by their opinion distance and social distance; and 3) multiple algorithmic mechanisms reformulated, regarding five recommendation processes and the information distribution rules integrating three information sources. Such extensive numerical simulation experiments have revealed diversification, radicalization, and polarization of misinformation. We observe that the introduction of moderate repulsive interactions fosters the emergence of diverse opinions. In absence of algorithmic interventions, misinformation naturally evolves into radicalization, while the introduction of algorithmic interventions exacerbates polarization, particularly with extensive reliance on content-based recommendations and excessive allowance of distributed opinions from recommendations. It is noteworthy that we discover that encouraging recommendation based on predetermined information effectively reverses the trend of misinformation evolution. Our research contributes to clarifying the interaction between human behavior and artificial intelligence, as well as providing insights for misinformation supervision and governance.},

This study proposes an innovative emergency evacuation framework that optimizes the crowd evacuation by integrating multiagent reinforcement learning (MARL) with adversarial reinforcement learning (ARL). The developed simulation environment models realistic human behavior in complex buildings and incorporates robotic navigation and intelligent path planning. A novel simulated human behavior model was integrated, capable of complex human–robot interaction, independent escape route searching, and exhibiting herd mentality and memory mechanisms. We also proposed a multiagent framework that combines MARL and ARL to enhance overall evacuation efficiency and robustness. Additionally, we developed a new ARL evaluation framework that provides a novel method for quantifying agents’ performance. Various experiments of differing difficulty levels were conducted, and the results demonstrate that the proposed framework exhibits advantages in emergency evacuation scenarios. Specifically, our ARLR approach increased survival rates by 1.8% points in low-difficulty evacuation tasks compared to the RLR approach using only MARL algorithms. In high-difficulty evacuation tasks, the ARLR approach raised survival rates from 46.7% without robots to 64.4%, exceeding the RLR approach by 1.7% points. This study aims to enhance the efficiency and safety of human–robot collaborative fire evacuations and provides theoretical support for evaluating and improving the performance and robustness of ARL agents.},

However, despite their advanced capabilities, these methods often struggle with significant computational complexity and limited ability to capture temporal dynamic contextual relationships. Recently, a new model architecture called mamba has emerged, noted for its capability to capture complex dependencies in sequences while significantly reducing computational complexity. Building on this, we propose a novel method, TDG-mamba, which integrates mamba for TDG learning. TDG-mamba introduces deep semantic spatiotemporal embeddings into the mamba architecture through a specially designed spatiotemporal prior tokenization module (SPTM). Furthermore, to better leverage temporal information differences and enhance the modeling of dynamic changes in graph structures, we separately design a bidirectional mamba and a directed GNN for improved spatiotemporal embedding learning. Link prediction experiments on multiple public datasets demonstrate that our method delivers superior performance, with an average improvement of 5.11% over baseline methods across various settings.},

  abstract     = {With the increasing popularity of mashup development composed of various Web APIs in the realm of Web services, API recommendation research has gained significant attention. However, it faces challenges, particularly in dealing with nonpopular APIs. Studies suggest that focusing on nonpopular APIs may better align with developer needs, necessitating a deeper exploration of effective depopular API recommendation methods. Much of the existing research on nonpopular APIs recommendation employs deep learning methods, which focus on studying recommendation strategies to improve accuracy rather than composition recommendation strategies. Currently, there are two main challenges regarding depopular API composition recommendation methods, including compatibility concerns and the impact of popularity bias. To address these issues, this article proposes a novel approach called the depopularity web API compatible compositions recommendation approach (DPAR), which is a recommendation method designed for the compatible composition of Web APIs with long-tail mining capabilities that can mitigate the effects of popularity bias. DPAR builds a depopularity web API correlation graph (DP-ACG) and proposes a minimum weighted subgraph algorithm to select candidate Web API compositions that meet development requirements based on DP-ACG. The design of DP-ACG assures that candidate compositions generated by this method are depopularized and compatible. Subsequently, utilize the DPP algorithm to rerank the candidate Web API compositions, enhancing the diversity of the results. To evaluate DPARs performance, we conducted extensive experiments on real datasets to verify the efficacy of each module in DPAR and illustrate the impact of parameter settings. The experimental results demonstrate that DPAR consistently outperforms comparative methods, yielding significantly superior performance.},

The research incorporates bibliometric analyses along with small business innovation research (SBIR) data to yield a holistic view of the science-industry interface. We quantify the temporal effects and impact latency of scientific advancements on industrial activity across 10873 topics and take into account their taxonomic relationships, spanning from 2010 to 2021. We find that the impact of scientific advances on industrial projects across different thematic depths consistently exhibited p-values less than 0.05, underscoring the significant predictive power of contemporary scientific activities on future industrial projects. Further, we demonstrate that the semantic contents of scientific paper abstracts within a topic are associated with future industrial project description text embeddings. The frequency analysis reveals that various scientific activities significantly inform future industrial project funding across varying depths of MeSH topic categorization, highlighting the significant role of science in steering industrial innovation.

During the early phase of infection, asymptomatic carriers exhibit the same activity level as susceptible individuals, which presents challenges for incorporating control measures in epidemic projection models. This article focuses on modeling and cost-efficient activity control of susceptible and carrier individuals in the context of the susceptible-carrier-infected-removed (SCIR) epidemic model over a two-layer contact network. In this model, individuals switch from a static contact layer to create new links in a temporal layer based on state-dependent activation rates. We derive conditions for the infection to die out or persist in a homogeneous network. Considering the significant costs associated with reducing the activity of susceptible and carrier individuals, we formulate an optimization problem to minimize the disease decay rate while constrained by a limited budget. We propose the use of successive geometric programming (SGP) approximation for this optimization task. Through simulation experiments on Poisson random graphs, we assess the impact of different parameters on disease prevalence. The results demonstrate that our SGP framework achieves a cost reduction of nearly $33$% compared to conventional methods based on degree and closeness centrality.},

  abstract     = {Node classification tasks aim to assign labels or categories to entire graphs based on their structural properties or node attributes. It can be adopted for various types of graph systems, including but not limited to network traffic, biological networks, knowledge graphs, etc., especially to social networks. This problem is well-studied, and solutions have demonstrated significant success in numerous real-world applications. However, in the situation where emerging categories are scarce or even have no labeled data, classical methods perform poorly on the whole, which has attracted growing attention. Based on this, in this article, we divide researches for node classification in social networks into two broad categories: traditional methods and novel strategies (few-shot/zero-shot learning). In traditional node classification methods, we summarize some classical methods for both homogeneous and heterogeneous networks, which includes unsupervised classifier, matrix factorization techniques, supervised methods, random-walk, and meta-path. Meanwhile, we introduce novel methods in few-shot or zero-shot learning. The article outlines the technical principles of various methods and analyzes their performance across different classes. It further summarizes the benchmark datasets used for evaluating node classification tasks. Finally, the major opportunities, challenges, and future research directions in few-shot and zero-shot learning for node classification in graph scenarios are discussed.},

  abstract     = {Unlabeled text representation learning (UTRL), encompassing static word embeddings such as Word2Vec and contextualized word embeddings such as bidirectional encoder representations from transformer (BERT), aims to capture semantic word relationships in a low-dimensional space without the need for manual labeling. These word embeddings are invaluable for downstream tasks such as document classification and clustering. However, the surge of short texts generated daily on social media platforms results in sparse word cooccurrences, compromising UTRL outcomes. Contextualized models such as recurrent neural network (RNN) and BERT, while impressive, often struggle with predicting the next word due to sparse word sequences in short texts. To address this, we introduce CGraphNet, a contrastive graph context prediction model designed for UTRL. This approach converts short texts into graphs, establishing links between sequentially occurring words. Information from the next word and its neighbors informs the target prediction, a process referred to as graph context prediction, mitigating sparse word cooccurrence issues in brief sentences. To minimize noise, an attention mechanism assigns importance to neighbors, while a contrastive objective encourages more distinctive representations by comparing the target word with its neighbors. Our experiments demonstrate CGraphNet's superior performance over other baselines, particularly in classification and clustering tasks on real-world datasets.},

Nonetheless, current state-of-the-art (SOTA) analyses reveal a marked variability in their performance across users with differing levels of activity, which substantially undermines the quality of personalized recommendation services. Prevailing research tends to overlook this discrepancy, often presuming a uniform probability distribution in user preferences and employing a static model (such as a single latent vector) for user representation. This oversimplification impedes the adaptability of existing models to accommodate the spectrum of user activity levels. In our research, we introduce the variational kernel density estimation (VKDE) approach, an innovative nonparametric method designed to accurately capture the unique preference distributions of individual users. The VKDE framework integrates multiple local distributions to construct a comprehensive global preference profile for each user. We have developed a novel variational kernel function that delineates user-specific interests and constructs each local distribution accordingly. Additionally, we present a tailored sampling strategy that simplifies the complexity of the training process while preserving the efficacy of the recommendations. Empirical evaluations conducted on four widely recognized public datasets demonstrate that our VKDE model achieves superior performance over the SOTA alternatives, significantly enhancing accuracy for users with a broad range of activity levels.},

  abstract     = {Few-shot anomalous node detection in dynamic networks has been extensively investigated in the field of research. In this few-shot scenario, the detection of these anomalous nodes is particularly challenging due to the continuously evolving network topology and data distribution over time, which is known as concept drift. Concept drift refers to the phenomenon where the underlying concepts or patterns in the data generation process change over time, leading to varying data distributions across different periods. Due to these changes in data distribution, the patterns learned during training may become invalid under the new data distribution. Existing models primarily aim to enhance the representation of evolving node attributes and relationships to mitigate the impact of concept drift in few-shot scenarios. However, the scarcity of anomalous samples further limits the model's ability to learn new patterns, thereby reducing its effectiveness in addressing concept drift in few-shot scenarios. To address this challenge, we propose the multitask asynchronous metalearning framework (MAMF), which aims to mitigate bias induced by concept drift in few-shot anomalous node detection. Our framework consists of four main components: a feature extractor, an anomaly simulator, an asynchronous learner, and a type detector. The feature extractor captures the relative variations of each node in an evolving graph stream. The anomaly simulator uses generative adversarial models to learn anomaly distributions and generate samples at different time intervals. The asynchronous learner samples from various time distributions to create metatasks for anomalous node detection, allowing it to adapt to changes between these distributions. To aid in few-shot anomalous node detection, the type detector is used for anomaly type recognition. Our framework achieves AUC improvements of 5.12%, 6.87%, and 1.91% over the best existing methods on Wikipedia, Reddit, and Mooc datasets, respectively, demonstrating its effectiveness and robustness in adapting to concept drift and detecting anomalous nodes.},

  abstract     = {Healthcare social networks (HSNs) are pivotal in spreading healthcare knowledge, providing support to both potential patients and medical professionals, and enhancing healthcare services. However, identifying unseen data in HSN poses a significant challenge due to their intrinsic heterogeneity, dynamic characteristics, and the scarcity of labeled data. Employing semantic knowledge transfer for class-agnostic zero-shot recognition stands out as a promising and innovative solution to this problem, but the visual-semantic gap and domain shift problems considerably hinder advancements in zero-shot recognition capabilities. Previous zero-shot models often impose constraints between vision and semantics in the loss part without explicitly injecting intermodality guidance into the feature refinement process. This article yields a novel zero-shot recognition framework for HSN, named the dual tensor prototype graph network, devoted to improving the performance of recognizing unseen objects in HSN leveraging semantic knowledge. We have developed an iterative and interactive updating strategy for dual tensor prototype graphs, explicitly leveraging the distribution information from one modality to guide the prototype graph updates of another modality. We constrain the update process of the dual prototype graphs by several tailored loss functions and episodic training, alleviating the inconsistency between semantic and visual manifolds. Extensive comparative experiments conducted on two medical imaging datasets and five zero-shot benchmarks affirm the stronger generalization ability of our proposed method compared with other advanced approaches, showing the potential of addressing zero-shot problems in HSN.},

  abstract     = {As multilingual artificial intelligence systems proliferate, achieving robust cross-lingual understanding remains an open challenge. Recent works have made progress on visual question answering (VQA) models by pretraining on large English image-text datasets. However, there is a language gap as most models are English-centric. Existing attempts at multilingual VQA rely on machine translation or multilingual model pretraining, but cannot effectively transfer rich cross-modal knowledge from English models. In this work, we propose the cross-lingual multimodal knowledge transfer (CMKT) framework to efficiently extend English VQA models to non-English languages via knowledge distillation. Specifically, we introduce a code-mixed cross-lingual mask modeling (CCM) method to establish representations for new languages using small image-text data. We also design a multimodal knowledge distillation (MMKD) method to transfer modal understanding from English models by imitating their sequence processing. Experiments on the xGQA benchmark demonstrate that CMKT can effectively improve zero-shot learning and few-shot learning in non-English languages. Our method reduces the data and computation needed to train multilingual VQA models from scratch. The knowledge transfer paradigm enables non-English languages to inherit and generalize the intricate visual-semantic relationships learned from English. The results also show that the proposed method outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods in the zero-shot setting on the xGQA dataset.},

  abstract     = {In traditional binary classification tasks, learning algorithms conventionally distinguish positive and negative samples by leveraging fully labeled training data. However, in practical applications, there frequently arises a scenario where only a small number of positive samples and a large volume of unlabeled data exist, with the latter potentially containing a mix of positive and negative instances. This situation is known as positive-unlabeled learning (PUL) and has drawn considerable interest across various domains, such as text categorization. Despite numerous studies addressing PUL issues, few have focused on improving the two-step methodology in the data partitioning process, and even fewer have explored the application of genetic programming (GP) to PUL challenges. This article introduces a GP-based embedded unlabeled data partitioning method (EPGP) tailored for the PUL problem, particularly in the context of few-shot learning scenarios. The approach adopts a multiphase data partitioning strategy, integrating the partitioning process into the evolutionary cycle of the GP population, progressively isolating positive samples from the unlabeled data to yield a PU dataset closer to the real-world distribution. To achieve smoother data partitioning, a dynamically adjusted partitioning threshold strategy is incorporated. Finally, an ensemble method is devised, capitalizing on the high confidence associated with the originally labeled positive samples to generate the final classification outcome via weighted voting. Experimental evaluations of EPGP against other state-of-the-art PUL methods on 22 datasets show significant advantages in terms of balanced accuracy and macro-F1 scores on 17 datasets. Moreover, a case study on text data classification tasks demonstrates that EPGP consistently delivers substantial performance enhancements under varying proportions of labeled positive samples.},

Most existing models assume that network structures evolve monotonically and fail to leverage the fluctuating variation in the real world. Moreover, it is difficult to extract valuable community knowledge from previous snapshots, leading to a negative transfer to the current snapshot. In this article, we design a novel transferring strategy for dynamic community detection based on dual-population cooperation and competition. The transfer strategy guides the search by leveraging the meaningful community structures among previous snapshots based on the similarity between the current and all previous ones. Furthermore, to avoid the problem of insufficient population diversity caused by previous single-population algorithms, this article utilizes dual-population cooperative competition for multiobjective optimization. An intercooperation method effectively interchanges information according to normalized mutual information of different individuals in dual-population. Each population optimizes according to different objectives with a role-oriented teaching–learning-based optimizer to compensate for defects such as many hyperparameters, declining diversity, and insufficient convergence. Top students integrate the fine-grained strategy to mutate boundary nodes depending on embedding-based node activity; Ordinary students fuse the coarse-grained method to separate loosely connected subcommunities, while the bottom students do normal learning.

Effectively integrating multimodal missing data still poses significant challenges. Different combinations of missing modes can form feature sets of inconsistent dimensions and quantities. Additionally, effectively merging multimodal data requires a thorough understanding of specific modal information and intermodal interactions. The abundance of missing data can significantly reduce the sample set size, leading to learning interaction features from only a few samples. Moreover, there is a lack of clear correspondence between heterogeneous data from different sources. To address these issues, we focus our research on multimodal knowledge graph scenarios with different types of structures and content and develop a new knowledge graph embedding method. First, we use three embedding components to automatically extract feature vector representations of items from the structural content, textual content, and visual content of the knowledge graph. Then, we divide the dataset into several modal groups and model these modal groups using a multilayer network structure, with each multilayer network corresponding to a specific multimodal combination. Subsequently, we construct corresponding multilayer network projection layers and propose a two-stage GAT-based transfer learning framework for the projection layers, in which the extracted incomplete multimodal information and intermodal interaction information are integrated and mapped to a low-dimensional space. Finally, we not only theoretically prove the feasibility of the proposed method but also validate its effectiveness through extensive comparative experiments on multiple datasets.},

We consider that stabilizing the adversarial training leads to superior performance on the target domain when converging to a smooth minima with respect to task loss. Contrary to task loss, our analysis demonstrates that smooth minima convergence with respect to adversarial loss results in suboptimal generalization on the target domain.

  abstract     = {Generalized few-shot node classification (GFS-NC) is a very important challenge for graph-based algorithms, as it requires to identify novel classes and base classes simultaneously. Although there are several methods that try to combine metalearning or metric learning with graph neural networks to solve few-shot problem, most of them assume that test samples only come from the novel classes, which is impractical in reality. Besides, they overlook the relationship among classes, which can provide additional information for the novel classes classification. In this article, we propose a graph-based knowledge distillation network (GraphKD) to extract the class relationship and learn better nodes representations for nodes from novel classes in GFS-NC task. GraphKD consists of two modules: balanced pretraining module and class-relation transferring module. Balanced pretraining can optimize network parameters to a suitable manifold for subsequent initialization. The class-relation transferring module leverages a knowledge distillation model, where a teacher model generates soft labels containing interclass relationships and then transfer them to the student model. The student model is optimized to fit both the soft labels and hard labels concurrently.

  abstract     = {Online social networks often enforce a restricted web interface to allow third part users to access their data objects in one-by-one manner along links. The heavy cost of collecting data from them makes it very difficult to train a graph neural networks (GNNs) algorithm by using valuable data resources from those social network services. In this article, we endeavor to harness the potential of collected data in order to cultivate robust node representations, all while taking into account the prevalent class-imbalanced scenario. To this end, we propose a framework based on the reinforcement learning technique that can implement training while sampling. We employee deep Q-learning network (DQN) as the basic reinforcement learning framework which maintains an experience replay buffer to store experiences in order to improve efficiency and generalization ability of the algorithm. The proposed framework can guide the training process according to the label distribution of the currently collected training data. To maximize the utility of the collected data, we introduce two ways to guide the agent to learn more robust node representations under the natural class-imbalanced scenario. Specifically, effective-number GNNs (ENG) try to employ a reward function with the technique of effective number and resampling GNNs (RSG) attempts to modify the state transition function motivated by resampling technique. Extensive experiments are conducted on several real-world imbalanced datasets and the proposed methods significantly outperform the state-of-the-art methods in node classification task, accomplishing higher performance while utilizing a reduced volume of data.},

The essence of this task lies in acquiring features that are both discriminative and invariant across domains. One common approach to achieve this is through adversarial DG, with techniques like generative adversarial networks (GANs). However, these methods often struggle with limited intraclass diversity, hindering their generalization capabilities. To address this, we introduce the graph adversarial domain generalization (GADG) method. This novel approach, to our knowledge, is the first to incorporate graph information in DG, effectively learning domain-invariant and semantic representations. Our extensive image classification tests on benchmark datasets show that GADG not only achieves robust generalization but also surpasses existing state-of-the-art DG methods.},

  abstract     = {Stance detection on social media has become increasingly important for understanding public opinions on controversial issues. Existing methods often require large amounts of labeled data to learn target-independent transferable knowledge, which is infeasible under zero-shot settings where the target is unseen. Furthermore, most current stance detection models, primarily based on end-to-end deep learning architectures, lack transparency and may produce counter-intuitive and uninterpretable predictions. In this article, we propose a novel knowledge-augmented interpretable network (KAI) to enable zero-shot stance detection (ZSSD). First, we introduce an unsupervised approach based on large language models (LLM-KE) to elicit analysis perspectives, which is target-independent knowledge shared across different targets. This transferable knowledge bridges connections between seen and unseen targets. Second, we develop a bidirectional knowledge-guided neural production system (Bi-KGNPS) that effectively integrates such transferable knowledge through an iterative knowledge-variable binding process to guide stance predictions. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate KAI achieves new state-of-the-art performance on ZSSD. Moreover, our approach also delivers strong results on conventional in-target and cross-target stance detection. With the dual benefits of knowledge-augmented accuracy and model interpretability, this work represents an important advance toward practical stance detection systems that can generalize to emerging topics of interest. The proposed KAI framework provides an interpretable approach to effectively transfer knowledge across domains for zero-shot learning.},

The FCLFD system integrates a central server with multiple mobile users to address a diverse range of HAR challenges. The framework encompasses two pivotal elements: a contrastive student–teacher (CST) architecture with feature-based distillation and an average weight scheme (AWS). The CST framework facilitates the transfer of comprehensive knowledge from a teacher model to a student model through feature-based distillation and contrastive learning, with both models sharing an identical architecture. Each participating user periodically uploads the weights of its student model to the central server, where the AWS deployed on the server calculates the average weights based on contributions from all connected users. The aggregated weights are then redistributed to each user, who updates their teacher model accordingly. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that when 50 users are connected, the proposed FCLFD scheme obtains the highest $F_{1}$ values of 89.01 and 94.19, outperforming several state-of-the-art federated learning algorithms on the wireless sensor data mining (WISDM) and PAMAP2 datasets.},

This technology is crucial in various fields such as education and E-learning. However, deep graph clustering can be more misled by the graph topology, disregarding node information. For example, an excessive number of intercommunity edges or insufficient intracommunity edges can lead to inaccurate community distinction by the model. In this article, we propose a novel model, deep Graph Clustering with Triple Fusion Autoencoder (GC-TriFA) for community detection, which utilizes a triple encoding fusion mechanism to balance the incorporation of node and topological information, thereby mitigating this issue. Specifically, GC-TriFA employs a shallow linear coding fusion and a deep coding fusion method within an autoencoder structure. This approach enables the model to simultaneously learn and capture the embedding of cross-modality information and later utilizes weight fusion to equalize the two modalities. Furthermore, GC-TriFA also reconstructs the graph structure, learns relaxed $k$-means, and undergoes self-supervised training to enhance the quality of the graph embedding. The experimental results of GC-TriFA, when evaluated as an end-to-end model on publicly available datasets, demonstrate its superiority compared to the baseline models.},

  abstract     = {Human beings live in a world full of risks, from minor risks such as colds and fevers to major crises such as economic crises and hurricanes. How to cope with these risks is a constant topic in the evolution of humankind. The impact of various characteristics of risk on the risk-resistance outcomes has been well studied, including the probability, intensity and spread of risks. However, as an additional dimension independent of the above main characteristics, risk-resistance solutions that are appropriate to the risk have not received sufficient attention. We abstract this characteristic as the relative cost-effectiveness between collective solution and individual solution in resisting a risk and name it communality. Taking communality and intensity as the two main characteristics of risk, we propose a risk-resistance model and explore the critical impact of risk communality on the outcomes of risk resistance. Using numerical analysis, we map the state transition of the population on a two-dimensional surface consisting of communality and intensity. Simulation experiments validate the results from numerical analysis and reveal four regions in this surface, each of which corresponds to a governance structure endogenous to the population. The complex impact of population-endogenous governance structures on the risk-resistance outcomes reflects the real-world challenges of risk governance. This article suggests that social governors need to implement different logics in the face of risks with different communalities.},

This problem has applications in various fields such as social networks, viral marketing, advertisements, and political campaigns, where understanding and exploiting network dynamics lead to effective strategies to promote behaviors, products, or ideas. The goal is to strategically select seed nodes to maximize the overall impact or adoption of an idea, behavior, or product in the network. Most of the existing IM algorithms give equal cost to selecting nodes and maximizing the active nodes, which overlook the number of influenced communities. To make it applicable to real-world applications, this article presents a diversified budgeted influence maximization (DBIM) algorithm for dynamic social networks. The DBIM algorithm considers the different costs of the nodes and maximizes the number of communities. This work proposes an objective function for diversification and presents an algorithm that finds the seed set utilizing the suggested strategy. Further, we show the monotone, submodular, and NP-hardness properties of the objective function. The proposed work experimentally shows the results on eight datasets and concludes that the proposed algorithm outperforms the activated nodes and the number of communities on all the datasets.},

  abstract     = {Hate speech is a complex, multifaceted form of harmful material that targets individuals or groups. Detecting implicit hate speech poses a significant challenge due to its subtle expressions and the critical role of context in its identification. In response to this challenge, we have fine-tuned BERT and DistilBERT models on three publicly available datasets: Toxigen, Implicit Gab, and the Implicit Hate Corpus (IHC). Our approach involves meticulous data preprocessing, customized model configurations, and strategic hyperparameter optimization, all tailored to enhance the models’ performance in binary, 3-way, and 7-way implicit hate detection. We observed notable improvements in the detection capabilities of our proposed work. To enhance the explainability of model behavior, we visualized attention mechanisms, including attention heads and compatibility scores, using tools such as BertViz, local interpretable model-agnostic explanations (LIME), and Shapley additive explanations (SHAP). This facilitated the clear interpretation of model decisions. We developed a software application called HateFusion, which integrates our fine-tuned models with an intuitive graphical interface. The application includes a flagging option that allows users or moderators to mark highly hateful content, supporting continuous model refinement and updates. Our proposed model achieved the highest macro-weighted F1 scores across multiple datasets. On the IHC dataset (for 2-, 3-, and 7-way classification tasks), it achieved F1 scores of 0.75, 0.73, and 0.61 with DistilBERT, and 0.77, 0.72, and 0.60 with BERT.

However, the digital transformation process of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) is progressing slowly. Therefore, it is necessary to study the constraints and enhancement strategies related to the adoption of artificial intelligence technology in SMEs. This article takes robotic process automation (RPA) technology as an example to construct a tripartite game relationship involving enterprise employees, technology service platforms, and enterprise leaders in the introduction of artificial intelligence technology. It explores the factors influencing the strategic choices of each party and summarizes the mechanisms underlying these strategic choices. Research findings indicate that 1) in the tripartite evolutionary game introduced by AI technology, three relatively stable equilibrium states exist; 2) when all participants have the same initial intentions, the degree of strategy evolution for each participant varies under different circumstances. The initial intentions of enterprise employees significantly influence their choices 3) participants’ strategy choices are significantly influenced by various factors related to the adoption and management of RPA technology. These factors include the benefits employees gain from adopting RPA technology and the incentives provided by leadership for employees to use RPA technology. Consequently, we recommend that firms implement targeted promotional activities and incentive measures, integrating RPA technology adoption into their overarching strategy. This approach aims to enhance the initial willingness of all strategic stakeholders, ensuring the stability of AI technology adoption, particularly within SMEs.},

First, the dynamic behavior of the production-inventory quantity of two different level factories is modeled by the ordinary differential equations. Second, the issue of inconsistent production rates among different factories is considered, and the singular perturbation theory is introduced to describe the phenomenon. In addition, to deal with the bullwhip effect caused by the variation of order demand and the phenomenon of inaccurate inventory levels caused by misplacing and theft, the $\mathscr{H}_{\infty}$ control strategy is considered to improve the system's robustness. Then, the finite-time boundedness of the production-inventory system is analyzed by combining it with the Lyapunov control theory, and the theorem is given to ensure that the dynamic change of the factory inventory is bounded and controllable. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by a simulation example of the potassium carbonate production process in a chemical plant.},

The proposed BlenderBot-ThTra involves the following three training processes: fine-tuning with supplemental feedback utterance, fine-tuning with auxiliary situation restoration, and calibration with the helpfulness estimation. The first stage aims to intensify the backbone's perception of conversational context, the second stage propels the backbone into excavating the causes of the emotional distress faced by the seeker. In the third stage, we leverage a Bayesian method based on the seeker's feedback scores to train a helpfulness evaluation model, then exploit a contrastive learning method to calibrate the ESC backbone. We conduct experiments on the standard multiturn ESC dataset, and the results demonstrate that BlenderBot-ThTra has a significant advantage in generating more supportive and adaptive responses.},

  abstract     = {Existing solutions for rumor containment typically model social networks as regular graphs, focusing solely on dyadic relationships between pairs of individuals. However, these solutions overlook the crowd influence, which arises from higher order relationships involving multiple individuals. This crowd influence is a distinct concept that cannot be substituted by the cumulative effect of individual influences through dyadic relationships. Therefore, it is important to consider the impact of crowd influence when modeling influence diffusion in the network. Moreover, traditional rumor containment methods lack generalization capacity. These methods require complete reexecution of algorithms whenever the target network changes, rendering them less efficient. In this work, we model the network as a hypergraph to effectively capture the crowd influence through higher order social relationships. We propose RCDRL-H, a deep reinforcement learning framework capable of constructing a trained model for containing rumors in previously unseen networks. Additionally, we introduce hyper-structure2vec, a node embedding technique for hypergraphs, and an efficient rumor containment estimation function that eliminates the need for computationally expensive Monte Carlo simulations during training. Experiments carried out on real-world social networks demonstrate that improved rumor containment can be achieved by treating the network as a hypergraph. It has also been observed that the achieved rumor containment is close to that of the greedy approach. Moreover, using the new estimation function significantly reduces training time.},

  abstract     = {3-D printing, or additive manufacturing (AM), leverages 3-D computer-aided design models and numerical control to produce objects layer-by-layer, playing a key role in Industry 4.0 and Industry 5.0. Despite its potential to revolutionize manufacturing by creating complex structures more efficiently and cost-effectively, 3-D printing still faces quality issues due to a lack of sufficient data, resulting in improper process parameter settings and poor analyzability. This work introduces a data-driven and physics-assisted machine learning (DP-ML) approach for a 3-D-printed BeltClip object, integrating finite element analysis (FEA) and physics-informed machine learning (PIML). The proposed DP-ML framework provides a cost-effective and time-efficient data collection method using Digimat-AM and a warpage classification algorithm. The data collection begins with obtaining the STereoLithography (STL) file of the BeltClip object from Thingiverse and slicing it in Ultimaker©  Cura, considering process parameters such as infill amount, toolpath pattern, layer height, print speed, and extrusion temperature. The resulting G-code file is then input into Digimat-AM for further parameter setting and analysis. In Digimat-AM, glass fiber-filled and unfilled material types are set, undergoing the virtual 3-D printing process, followed by a warpage analysis of the printed BeltClip. The collected 3-D printing data is used to build ML models—deep neural network (DNN), decision tree (DT), support vector machine (SVM), logistic regression (LR), and random forest. The DNN contains three architectures—DNN-1, DNN-2, and DNN-3. Based on the metrics of precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy, DNN-3 outperforms the others and is chosen for the warpage classification algorithm. The presented DP-ML approach is compared with the state-of-the-art methods and shows a promising capability to predicting warpage, optimizing process parameters, and improving the overall quality and efficiency of a 3-D-printed BeltClip.},

Addressing this gap, this research introduces an innovative automated framework, ParallelWorkforce, which integrates blockchain intelligence and decentralized autonomous organizations and operations (DAOs) to drive the evolution from digital twins to parallel intelligence. First, this research conducts a comprehensive investigation into smart manufacturing in I5.0, summarizing the ongoing evolution.

Finally, the development of ParallelWorkforce across various key applications of smart manufacturing is demonstrated, including autonomous transportation, task assignment, and worker management.

Hence, there is a need to handle this challenge of multipolarity that misleads due to conflicting or contradicting sentiments in the text. This research article implements the HDL-Fuzzy-RMDL model, which includes hierarchical deep learning for text classification, fuzzy sets, and random multimodel deep learning for multipolarity-based sentimental classification. The bidirectional encoder representations from transformers initially convert the input sentence tokens. The bidirectional long short-term memory performs the multiword aspect term extraction. The hybrid model utilizes significant keywords or aspects for multipolarity sentiment classification. The efficacy of the proposed approach is evaluated based on the accuracy concerning ATE, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Existing methods rely on features extracted from external resources and are tested on data from either Twitter or Reddit; therefore, their generalizability and transferability are unproven. In this work, we present MASK-Net, which masks disease or symptom terms and relies on the context of a post. Furthermore, to capture the negative sentiments associated with the experience of having a disease, we incorporate sentiment information to improve the HMC. We conduct experiments using publicly available health-mention datasets collected from Twitter and Reddit. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods on both HMC datasets, highlighting the relevance of context words in identifying HMC.

  abstract     = {The $k$-plex is a popular definition of communities in networks, offering more flexibility than cliques by allowing each node to miss up to $k$ connections. However, finding $k$-plexes in large graphs is a theoretically challenging task due to the large number of possible $k$-plexes. In this article, we propose a novel approach for detecting $k$-plexes under various sizes and time constraints using an automated strategy to learn bounds, called the constraint learning and bounding (CLB) method. Specifically, our proposed CLB approach, leverages the concept of constraint learning to develop a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) instance as a model to learn a bounding strategy in the branch-and-bound process. The variables in the MILP instances correspond to the natural properties of the $k$-plex problem. Unlike previous works, we focus on learning the bounding strategy rather than learning the branching strategy. Thus, the strategy learned by our proposed approach avoids visiting infeasible solutions, which accelerates the branch-and-bound algorithm and reduces the computational load. To evaluate our approach, we conduct experiments on various real graphs to validate the superiority and the generality of our proposed approach. In summary, our approach offers an effective and efficient solution for detecting $k$-plexes under various conditions.},

  abstract     = {Civil unrest, a major trouble in the country's progress, requires timely detection and prevention. It causes numerous major issues, including loss of life and injury, resource depletion, political instability, and violations of human rights. Automating the early warning civil unrest event prediction with social media data becomes critically important. Existing baseline methods through text datasets obtained from social media have shown promising results. However, most existing baseline methods are domain-specific and lacking in robustness and generalization. As of now, there has been less work done addressing these issues in civil unrest event prediction. To overcome these limitations, this article presents a novel method as CUP_CDLSTM by combining the convolutional neural network-long short-term memory (CNN-LSTM) model and the pretrained distilBERT model to predict civil unrest event prediction using social media data. First, the proposed CUP_CDLSTM model utilizes the LSTM model to learn temporal features followed by CNN utilized to learn spatial features from the correlation matrix of different features. DistilBERT is utilized to generate weighted word embedding to advance the contextual features. The proposed CUP_CDLSTM model is trained with two datasets of different geographical locations for predicting civil unrest events which include spatial, temporal, and event weights as input features. The proposed CUP_CDLSTM model outperforms the baseline methods by up to 5% on both the Hong Kong protest dataset and the black lives matter (BLM) protest dataset in terms of accuracy. It has shown significantly faster training and inference times than existing baseline models.},

To ensure robust security, a data aggregation protocol should provide features such as data privacy, fault tolerance, lightweight computation, and fine-grained data aggregation. However, existing data aggregation protocols employing techniques such as homomorphic encryption, masking, or differential privacy fail to deliver these features concurrently. To address this challenge, we propose a novel lightweight privacy-preserving data aggregation scheme based on proxy reencryption and asymmetric scalar product-preserving encryption, in which encryption operations only involve addition and multiplication over the integer field, thus avoiding time-consuming exponentiation and pairing operations and achieving lightweight computation. Furthermore, through the use of an asymmetric scalar-product-preserving encryption scheme, we effectively align aggregation policies while maintaining the privacy of power consumption data. Finally, when compared to three recent data aggregation schemes with analogous structures, experimental results demonstrate that our proposed scheme outperforms others regarding computational and communication overheads, thus enhancing its efficiency.},

The inherent ambiguity of emotion labels poses challenges for conventional supervised representation learning methods. Moreover, directly learning the mapping from a facial expression image to an emotion label lacks explicit supervision signals for capturing fine-grained facial features. In this article, we propose a novel FER model, named poker face vision transformer or PF-ViT, to address these challenges. PF-ViT aims to separate and recognize the disturbance-agnostic emotion from a static facial image by generating its corresponding poker face without the need for paired images. Inspired by the facial action coding system, we regard an expressive face as the combined result of a set of facial muscle movements on one's poker face (i.e., an emotionless face). PF-ViT utilizes vanilla vision transformers, and its components are first pretrained as masked autoencoders on a large facial expression dataset without emotion labels, yielding excellent representations. Subsequently, we train PF-ViT using a GAN framework. During training, the auxiliary task of poke face generation promotes the disentanglement between emotional and emotion-irrelevant components, guiding the FER model to holistically capture discriminative facial details. Quantitative and qualitative results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, surpassing the state-of-the-art methods on four popular FER datasets.},

The successful execution of these complex tasks relies on task decomposition (TD) and allocation, with the former being a prerequisite for the latter. Recently, pretrained language models-based methods have garnered significant attention. However, they are constrained to handling straightforward common-sense tasks due to their inherent restrictions involving limited and difficult-to-update knowledge as well as the presence of “hallucinations.” To address these issues, we propose a retrieval-augmented generation-based crowdsourcing framework that reformulates TD as event detection from the perspective of natural language understanding. However, the existing detection methods fail to distinguish differences between event types and always depend on heuristic rules and external semantic analyzing tools. Therefore, we present a prompt-based contrastive learning framework for TD (PBCT), which incorporates a prompt-based trigger detector to overcome dependence. Additionally, trigger-attentive sentinel and masked contrastive learning are designed to provide varying attention to trigger and contextual features according to different event types. Extensive experiment results demonstrate our method is highly competitive in both supervised and zero-shot detection. A case study on printed circuit board design and manufacturing is used to validate its adaptability and scalability in unfamiliar professional domains.},

The preference, based on ordered preference statements, is influenced by the authenticity and the order of preference statements. Owing to ambiguous evidence and incomplete information in complex real-world conflicts, it is of great difficulty to determine crisp preference over states for DMs. Some uncertain preferences have been introduced to cope with two situations that uncertain about preference statements authenticity or prioritization. The belief structure can be used to capture vagueness or unknown in subjective judgments. In this article, we propose a belief option prioritization technique by considering two situations of preference statements to elicit preferences comprehensively and efficiently. First, a belief structure is applied to describe the uncertainty of preference statement authenticity. The belief degree represents the accuracy of each preference statement and the real preference attitude of a DM. Second, a belief distribution, associated with an ordered sequence of preference statements, is used to capture the uncertainty on the prioritization of preference statements. The belief preference over feasible states can be obtained by the scoring scheme of option prioritization based on the ordered preference statements. Last, we propose an overall belief option prioritization technique by combining two uncertain situations. The application of Gisborne Lake water export conflict is utilized to illustrate the use of belief option prioritization.},

In this context, rich node labels undoubtedly play a very important role. However, existing methods fail to generate high-quality pseudolabels that serve as a potential solution to alleviate label scarcity on graphs and reduce time-consuming annotation issues. Moreover, it is an interesting problem to boost the performance of GCNs with feature interaction and propagation. To tackle these limitations, we propose a new pseudolabels generation and feature interaction propagation based GCN, named PF-GCN. Specifically, the proposed PF-GCN first generates high-quality pseudolabels to enlarge the input set of node labels. Meanwhile, it fully exploits the information of feature interactions to enhance our PF-GCN model. We then present a straightforward yet highly effective cross-layer approach which is equipped with feature transformation to encode feature interaction at each layer. Finally, we propagate feature interactions through both topology space and feature space, and then employ an adaptive attention mechanism to learn rich node embeddings. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed PF-GCN outperforms several state-of-the-art methods in the extensive evaluations of node classification.

  abstract     = {Cross-domain speech emotion recognition (SER) has received increasing attention in recent years. Existing transfer subspace learning and regression-based SER methods have the following drawbacks. The features in the subspace are still insufficiently representative and discriminative, and direct regression would lead to information loss. To address these problems, we present a novel common discriminative latent space learning (CDLSL) method for cross-domain SER. To be specific, we first obtain a common latent space by imposing a projection matrix on the cross-domain data. Meanwhile, we impose an uncorrelated constraint on the projection matrix to ensure that the features are representative and discriminative after dimension reduction. Then, we implement a graph regularization term on the latent representations of the samples to capture the local similarity information. Furthermore, to obtain a more discriminative common latent space, we introduce the label information by aligning the latent space with the relaxed label space, while mitigating the information loss for regression. Extensive experimental results validate the superiority of the proposed method over the state-of-the-art competitors.},

  abstract     = {The rapid evolution of the Internet of Underwater Things (IoUT) has led to the widespread adoption of autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV)-assisted underwater acoustic sensor networks (UASNs) for various applications such as marine environment monitoring and resource exploration. This article introduces an energy-balanced data collection scheme tailored for AUV-supported UASNs. The proposed scheme combines a node clustering method based on a social welfare function and an intelligent path planning strategy for the AUV. The node clustering approach integrates canopy and K-means algorithms for initial node clustering, followed by reclustering using an enhanced hierarchical clustering algorithm. To balance energy distribution, Atkinson's social welfare function is employed to select and rotate cluster heads (CHs) within each cluster. To address limited CH memory constraints, a lossless compression technique is introduced to reduce data storage requirements at the CHs. Moreover, the article introduces the use of the deep Q-network (DQN) technique for AUV path planning, considering multiple pertinent factors simultaneously. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed data collection scheme effectively reduces energy consumption, prolongs network lifespan, and enhances data collection efficiency when compared to recent research endeavors.},

The integration of social networks and scientific communication has dissolved the central focus of scientific communication, moving toward a more diversified subject centered around the public networks. Due to the special nature of science communication, the key nodes in the community network often play a crucial role. Specifically, by identifying key nodes and analyzing the trend of grouping them into clusters, the stability and robustness of the complex network of science communication can be significantly improved. This is of great significance for expanding the influence of science communication and attracting relevant practitioners to join. However, the sensitive attributes and potential influence factors of community network nodes can lead to deviations in key node mining using existing algorithms. From the perspective of algorithm fairness, we combine graph neural networks and counterfactual theory to address this issue in this work and propose a framework for key node mining for the characteristics of science communication, CounteRfActual Fairness discriminaTor (CRAFT).

To address these limitations, we employ graph neural networks (GNNs) to learn node representations in exercise recommendation contexts and propose a new knowledge tracing-enhanced multitask exercise recommendation framework, called MLKT4Rec. Unlike previous graph-based approaches that focus on explicitly observed relationships in the data, we use implicit edges to augment the graph structure and incorporate exercise difficulty attributes, relative time intervals, and location coding to enrich the exercise representation. Based on this, we construct a knowledge tracing model to capture students’ knowledge levels and integrate it into the exercise sequential recommendation process for joint multitask training.

To overcome the challenge of modeling type hierarchy in vector space, this article proposes for the first time to model the type hierarchy in high-dimensional box space. In addition, previous approaches focus more on the influence of the context of entity mentions, while neglecting the influence of entity mentions themselves. Based on the above challenges, we present a new approach called THBox, which not only successfully boosts the influence of entity mentions but also models the type hierarchy well. To verify the effectiveness of the method presented in this article, experimental results on three publicly available fine-grained entity typing benchmark datasets are provided to verify that the presented method is a new state-of-the-art solution for fine-grained entity typing.},

Research on this incident has important practical significance for predicting and intervening in the evolution of similar hot incidents. In this article, the case of Messi's absence from the Hong Kong match is delved into. A stance detection method and a quantification approach for stance divergence have been devised to analyze the evolution of the stance surrounding the incident. Furthermore, by examining topic clusters over time, the topical progression of public stances is tracked. Findings reveal that nearly 60% of posts expressed an explicit stance throughout the incident, with the majority (66.9%) taking an opposing stance. Additionally, it was noted that the topics discussed at various stages followed a long-tail distribution, indicating that most discussions revolved around a few dominant themes. Within more segmented and specific topics, stance divergences were often more prominent.},

  abstract     = {Event-aware information flow security in cyber–physical systems (CPSs) emphasizes the correlation among events. Event-aware noninterference is a security property capable to describe such a correlation. In light of the event-aware noninterference assessment problem, system modeling is a common means, and many studies have been done on such a problem by using formal modeling tools, i.e., Petri nets (PNs), at present. However, classical PNs suffer from the lack of modeling for patterns with semantic sharing of events, which can be modeled by labeled PNs (LPNs). In this article, we present the concept of semantics-based noninterference for the CPSs modeled by LPNs and focus on the assessment problem of semantics-based noninterference properties represented by semantics-based strong nondeterministic noninterference (SNNI) and extended bisimulation SNNI (EBSNNI). To this end, we first give the formal definitions of semantics-based SNNI and EBSNNI. Then, we analyze the assessment mechanisms of them according to the characteristics of semantic sharing of events in LPNs. On this basis, we provide the semantics-based noninterference assessment method involving the coarse and fine assessments to reveal the event-aware security of CPSs. Finally, a case study is provided to explain the significance of our research and the effectiveness of our method.},

However, modern sentiment analysis models using deep learning lack explainability, acting as black box and limiting trust. This study focuses on improving the explainability of sentiment analysis models of social media platforms by leveraging explainable artificial intelligence (XAI). We propose a novel explainable sentiment analysis (XSA) framework incorporating intrinsic and posthoc XAI methods, i.e., local interpretable model-agnostic explanations (LIME) and counterfactual explanations. Specifically, to solve the problem of lack of local fidelity and stability in interpretations caused by the LIME random perturbation sampling method, a new model-independent interpretation method is proposed, which uses the isometric mapping virtual sample generation method based on manifold learning instead of LIMEs random perturbation sampling method to generate samples. Additionally, a generative link tree is presented to create counterfactual explanations that maintain strong data fidelity, which constructs counterfactual narratives by leveraging examples from the training data, employing a divide-and-conquer strategy combined with local greedy. Experiments conducted on social media datasets from Twitter, YouTube comments, Yelp, and Amazon demonstrate XSAs ability to provide local aspect-level explanations while maintaining sentiment analysis performance. Analyses reveal improved model explainability and enhanced user trust, demonstrating XAIs potential in sentiment analysis of social media platforms. The proposed XSA framework provides a valuable direction for developing transparent and trustworthy sentiment analysis models for social media platforms.},

  abstract     = {Social media platforms such as Weibo and TikTok have become more influential than traditional media. Sentiment in social media comments reflects users’ attitudes and impacts society, making sentiment analysis (SA) crucial. AI driven models, especially deep-learning models, have achieved excellent results in SA tasks. However, most existing models are not interpretable enough. First, deep learning models have numerous parameters, and their transparency is insufficient. People cannot easily understand how the models extract features from input data and make sentiment judgments. Second, most models lack intuitive explanations. They cannot clearly indicate which words or phrases are key for emotion prediction. Moreover, extracting sentiment factors from comments is challenging because a comment often contains multiple sentiment characteristics. To address these issues, we propose a dual-branch combination network (DCN) for SA of social media short comments, achieving both word-level and sentence-level interpretability. The network includes a key word feature extraction network (KWFEN) and a key word order feature extraction network (KWOFEN). KWFEN uses popular emotional words and SHAP for word-level interpretability. KWOFEN employs position embedding and an attention layer to visualize attention weights for sentence-level interpretability. We validated our method on the public dataset weibo2018 and TSATC. The results show that our method effectively extracts positive and negative sentiment factors, establishing a clear mapping between model inputs and outputs, demonstrating good interpretability performance.},

By analyzing the maximum Influence of sentiment propagation, we can gain a better understanding of how network group events arise and evolve. Influence maximization (IM) is a critical fundamental issue in the field of informatics, whose purpose is to identify the collection of individuals and maximize the specific information's influence in real-world social networks, and the sentiments expressed by nodes with the greatest influence can significantly impact the emotions of the entire group. The IM issue has been established to be an NP-hard (nondeterministic polynomial) challenge. Although some methods based on the greedy framework can achieve ideal results, they bring unacceptable computational overhead, while the performance of other methods is unsatisfactory. In this article, we explicate the IM problem and design a local influence evaluation function as the objective function of the IM to estimate the influence spread in the cascade diffusion models. We redefine particle parameters, update rules for IM problems, and introduce learning automata to realize multiple search modes. Then, we propose a multisearch particle Swarm optimization algorithm (MSPSO) to optimize the objective function. This algorithm incorporates a heuristic-based initialization strategy and a local search scheme to expedite MSPSO convergence. Experimental results on five real-world social network datasets consistently demonstrate MSPSO's superior efficiency and performance compared with baseline algorithms.},

However, current MSA models heavily rely on black-box deep learning (DL) methods, which lack interpretability. Additionally, effectively integrating multimodal data, reducing noise and redundancy, as well as bridging the semantic gap between heterogeneous data remain challenging issues in multimodal DL. To address these challenges, we propose an interpretable multimodal Tucker fusion model with information filtering (IMTFMIF). We are the first to utilize the multimodal Tucker fusion model for MSA tasks. This approach maps multimodal data into a unified tensor space for fusion, effectively reducing modal heterogeneity and eliminating redundant information while maintaining interpretability. Furthermore, mutual information is employed to filter out task-irrelevant information and explain the association between input and output from an information flow perspective. We propose a novel approach to enhance the comprehension of multimodal data and optimize model performance in MSA tasks. Finally, extensive experiments conducted on three public multimodal datasets demonstrate that our proposed IMTFMIF achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.},

This research area explores how to extract sentiment information from different modalities (e.g., text, images, and audio). However, the currently existing techniques face several challenges. It is difficult to achieve effective interaction with completely heterogeneous data, and these techniques cannot adequately guarantee data security during data interaction, which is particularly important when dealing with sensitive information. Therefore, this article introduces existing methods for protecting data privacy. Based on this foundation, we propose a novel algorithm called collaborative dynamic hierarchical federated learning with hypernetwork aggregation (CDHFL-HA), which is suitable for sentimental analysis. CDHFL-HA ensures that the data remain local to each participant while leveraging the data similarity between participants on the server and processing interference data on the participant to enhance the accuracy of the current sentimental analysis. In addition, an essential aspect considered in the proposed algorithm is explainability. Understanding the decisions and predictions made by sentiment analysis models is crucial for gaining trust and acceptance in real-world applications. CDHFL-HA incorporates explainability features, providing insights into the decision-making process, thus enhancing the interpretability of sentiment analysis results. Numerous experimental results show that the algorithm outperforms existing algorithms in complex scenarios, with a minimum accuracy of 0.6007 and a maximum of 0.9962. In addition, it can be seen from the experimental results in this article, that the communication parameters in the experiments are similar to those of other federated learning, while the number of training rounds is improved by up to 50% (i.e., 20 rounds faster) relative to other algorithms.},

  abstract     = {With the development of Internet technology, deepfake (DF) videos can spread rapidly through online platforms, providing a new way of cyberbullying by generating nude pictures of female victims and using their faces to generate pornographic movies, which bring potential harm to individuals, society, and the country. Recently, there have been some really impressive results with DF detection models. These models have shown excellent outstanding performance when they are trained and tested using data from the same dataset. However, detecting DF remains difficult when the data comes from challenging datasets. To address this issue, this article aims to enhance the model's generalization by taking full advantage of the learning and representation capabilities of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to adaptively suppress image texture information and catch deeper and more universal forgery features. Specifically, we introduce the texture suppression module (TSM) as a first step to suppress image content while simultaneously revealing the differences between authentic and tampered regions. Then, we carefully designed the cross stream interaction module (CSIM) and the cross stream mix block (CSMB) module to fully exploit the extracted forgery traces. Our proposed model has demonstrated superior generalization performance in extensive experiments.},

  abstract     = {Distributed learning empowers social media platforms to handle massive data for image sentiment classification and deliver intelligent services. However, with the increase of privacy threats and malicious activities, three major challenges are emerging: securing privacy, alleviating straggler problems, and mitigating Byzantine attacks. Although recent studies explore coded computing for privacy and straggler problems, as well as Byzantine-robust aggregation for poisoning attacks, they are not well-designed against both threats simultaneously. To tackle these obstacles and achieve an efficient Byzantine-robust and straggler-resilient distributed learning framework, in this article, we present Byzantine-robust and cost-effective distributed machine learning (BCML), a codesign of coded computing and Byzantine-robust aggregation. To balance the Byzantine resilience and efficiency, we design a cosine-similarity-based Byzantine-robust aggregation method tailored for coded computing to filter out malicious gradients efficiently in real time. Furthermore, trust scores derived from similarity are published to the blockchain for the reliability and traceability of social users. Experimental results show that our BCML can tolerate Byzantine attacks without compromising convergence accuracy with lower time consumption, compared with the state-of-the-art approaches. Specifically, it is 6x faster than the uncoded approach and 2x faster than the Lagrange coded computing (LCC) approach. Besides, the cosine-similarity-based aggregation method can effectively detect and filter out malicious social users in real time.},

  abstract     = {The interactive attention graph convolution network (IAGCN), a novel model proposed in this article, will revolutionize aspect-level sentiment analysis (SA). IAGCN effectively addresses these key features, in contrast to prior research that ignored the meaning of aspect terms and their relationship with context. The model combines a modified dynamic weighting layer with bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) to accurately acquire context. It takes use of graph convolutional networks (GCNs) to encrypt syntactic information from the syntactic dependency tree. Furthermore, a method for interactive attention is employed to discover the intricate relationships between context and aspect terms, which results in the reconstruction of those terms' representations. Comparing the proposed IAGCN model to baseline models, impressive gains are made. Across five datasets, the model beats previous methods with an amazing improvement in F1 scores that ranges from 1.34% to 4.04% and an impressive improvement in accuracy that ranges from 0.56% to 1.75%. Additionally, the IAGCN model outperforms the global vectors (GloVe)-based strategy when the potent pretrained model bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT) is included in the challenge, resulting in even greater improvements. The F1 score considerably increases from 2.59% to 7.55%, and accuracy increases from 1.47% to 3.95%, making the IAGCN model a standout performer in aspect-level SA.},

  abstract     = {Many people have been severely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, which has caused intense anxiety, fear, and complex feelings or emotions. People's emotions have changed and become more complicated since coronavirus vaccinations were introduced. Sentiment analysis of COVID-19 vaccination is critical for understanding public perception, vaccine hesitancy, monitoring vaccine impact, identifying adverse reactions, making policies, and allocating resources. Some artificial intelligence (AI)-based systems have been reported in the literature to analyze the sentiment of COVID-19 vaccination. However, most of them are end-to-end models that require explanation for their results in identifying COVID-19 vaccination sentiment. An explainable AI-based model can improve decision-making, transparency, and interpretability. It can enable users to comprehend how the model makes predictions and the factors that influence the outcome. Therefore, this study suggests a COVID-Twitter-BERT and LSTM (CT-BERT-LSTM) staking that is explicable for determining people's views on the COVID-19 vaccination. The prediction of the proposed CT-BERT-LSTM model is then examined to determine where the suggested system successfully learned the context of the tweet and where it failed to do so. The proposed CT-BERT-LSTM model performed exceptionally well and outperformed the existing models with a $F_{1}$-score of 0.88 in the sentiment identification of the COVID-19 vaccination.},

  abstract     = {The prediction of remaining execution time is a critical area of research in business process monitoring. However, limited data availability and deficiencies in existing models have hindered progress in this area. To address these challenges, we introduce two production log datasets, coarse-grained log for television (CGL-TV) and fine-grained log for television (FGL-TV), collected from a semiautomated assembly line for television manufacturing. These datasets aim to address the issue of data scarcity in monitoring, analyzing, and optimizing the manufacturing process. Then, we investigate the significance of role information in semiautomated production processes and propose a novel feature selection strategy. That strategy replaces the traditional activity attributes with role attributes as the basis for prediction, resulting in a significant improvement in prediction accuracy. Furthermore, existing recurrent neural network (RNN)-based prediction methods have two major drawbacks: limited ability to capture long-term dependencies and the inability to parallelize computations. To address these issues, we propose a novel transformer-based remaining time prediction (TRTP) model. This model utilizes the self-attention mechanism instead of hidden state passing, which effectively incorporates global contextual information and enables potential parallel computing. The experimental results across four datasets demonstrate that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance, e.g., a 5.2% performance gain on FGL-TV.},

  abstract     = {As one representative framework of self-supervised learning (SSL), contrastive learning (CL) has drawn enormous attention in the representation learning area. By pulling together a “positive” example and an anchor, as well as pushing away many “negative” examples from the anchor, CL is able to generate high-quality representations for the data of different modalities. Therefore, the qualities of selected positive and negative examples are critical for the performance of CL-based models. However, due to the assumption of label unavailability, most existing work follows the paradigm of contrastive instance discrimination, which treats each input instance as an individual category. Therefore, they focused more on positive example generation and designed plenty of data augmentation strategies. For negative examples, they just leverage the in-batch negative sampling strategy. We argue that this negative sampling strategy will easily select false negatives and inhibit the capability of CL, which we also believe is one of the reasons why a large size of negatives is needed in CL. Apart from using annotated labels, we try to tackle this problem in an unsupervised manner. We propose to integrate expectation maximization (EM) into the selection of negative examples and develop a novel EM-enhanced negative sampling strategy (EMCRL) to distinguish false negatives from true ones for CL performance improvement. Specifically, EMCRL employs EM to estimate the distribution of ground-truth relations between each sample and corresponding in-batch negatives and then optimizes model parameters with the estimations. Considering the sensitivity of EM algorithm to the parameter initialization, we propose to add a random flip into the distribution estimation to enhance the robustness of the learning process. Extensive experiments over several advanced models on sentence representation and image representation tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of EMCRL. Our method is easy to implement, and the code is publicly available at https://github.com/zhangkunzk/EMCRL_pytorch.},

It also employs an explicit graph learning approach to ensure the independence of disentangled representations during information propagation, which mitigates noise from review features. Furthermore, we define and model one kind of cross-rating correlation, based on the characteristics of user rating behavior. By leveraging this approach, we introduce a cross-rating constraint as an additional task to further enhance the independence among disentangled representations and improve the stability of model training.

Specifically, the temporal social network embedding method is employed to learn dynamic representations of node and node's interaction relationships from the evolutionary network by preserving both the explicit structural proximity information and implicit multiview association information. The joint temporal heterogeneous social network embeddings are learned by fusing the different dimensional representation at their temporal granularity, which can be used to naturally support sentiment analysis on social network in a dynamic way. The results demonstrate that the raised approach reports better performance than the baseline methods.

Based on this, this study took the concentrated outbreak of COVID-19 in various cities in China as an example, collected 22 meteorological, social-ecological and population mobility indicators, and established a random forest-kernel density estimation-quantile stepwise regression (RF-KDE-QSR) model to make a preliminary estimate of the daily outbreak scale in cities. The RF model was used for preliminary estimation, and the KDE-QSR model was used for residual correction to correct the prediction results. The evaluation of the prediction accuracy proved the effectiveness of the prediction model. When the RF model was used alone, the R-squared (R2) was 0.82 and the corrected R2 was 0.90. The KDE-QSR model effectively improved the prediction accuracy of the model.},

  abstract     = {This study examines the dynamics of bargaining in a social system that incorporates risk sharing through exchange network models and stochastic matching between agents. The analysis explores three scenarios: convergent expectations, divergent expectations, and social preferences among model players. The study introduces stochastic shocks through a Poisson process, which can disrupt coordination within the decentralized exchange mechanism. Despite these shocks, agents can employ a risk-sharing protocol utilizing Pareto weights to mitigate their effects. The model outcomes do not align with the generalized Nash bargaining solutions across all scenarios. However, over a sufficiently long time frame, the dynamics consistently converge to a fixed point that slightly deviates from the balanced outcome or Nash equilibrium. This minor deviation represents the risk premium necessary for hedging against mutual risk. The risk premium is at its minimum in the scenario with convergent expectations and remains unchanged in the case involving social preferences.},

Existing methods, which generally aim to protect social relationships by erasing friendship links or introducing uniform noise into datasets, do not take into account the risk of inference attacks or the actual privacy needs of users. To address these concerns, we present a novel method, named exponential mechanism of personalized difference privacy (EPDP), for preserving the privacy of social relationships, based on the EPDP. We develop specific social relationship indices to group friendship links and divided these links into distinct privacy levels, each with a unique privacy budget. Then, we select representative elements from each group using sampling and the exponential mechanism to generalize the original datasets, ensuring compliance with personalized difference privacy principles. Metrics for privacy and utility assessment are devised to evaluate method performance. Experimental results reveal that EPDP offers superior utility compared to uniform differential privacy (UDP) and provides better privacy protection than the state-of-the-art. Moreover, we explore the impact of various parameters on data utility. This article marks the pioneering effort to introduce a privacy-preserving method based on the exponential mechanism for the safeguarding of social relationships.},

  abstract     = {The rapid advancement of deep learning and the exponential growth of multimodal data have led to increased attention on multimodal emotion analysis and comprehension in affect computing. While existing multimodal works have achieved notable results in emotion recognition, several challenges remain. First, the scarcity of public large-scale multimodal emotion datasets is attributed to the high cost of manual annotation and the subjectivity of handcrafted labels. Second, most approaches only focus on learning emotion category information, disregarding the crucial evaluation indicator of emotion intensity, which hampers the development of fine-grained emotion recognition. Third, a significant emotion semantic discrepancy exists in different modalities, and current methodologies struggle to bridge the cross-modal gap and effectively utilize a vast amount of unlabeled emotion data, hindering the production of high-quality pseudolabels and superior classification performance. To address these challenges, based on the multitask learning architecture, we propose a novel semisupervised fine-grained emotion recognition model SMEIR-net for multimodal emotion and intensity recognition. Concretely, in semisupervised learning (SSL) phase, we design multistage self-training and consistency regularization paradigm to generate high-quality pseudolabels. Then, in supervised learning phase, we leverage multimodal transformer fusion and adversarial learning to eliminate the cross-modal semantic discrepancy. Extensive experiments are conducted on three benchmark datasets, namely RAVDESS, eNTERFACE, and Lombard-GRID, to evaluate the proposed model. The series sets of experimental results demonstrate that our SSL model successfully utilizes multimodal data and available labels to transfer emotion and intensity information from labeled to unlabeled datasets. Moreover, the corresponding evaluation metrics demonstrate that the utilize high-quality pseudolabels can achieve superior emotion and intensity classification performance, which outperforms other state-of-the-art baselines under the same condition.},

Currently, the bid optimization problem has narrowed down to two specific forms: Budget-constrained bidding (BCB) and Multi-constraint bidding (MCB). Existing solutions try to solve BCB/MCB via linear programming solvers, learning methods, or feedback control. However, in large-scale complex e-commerce, they still suffer from inefficiency, poor convergence, or slow adaptation to the changing market. This research presents an online receding optimization method as a solution for practical bid optimization problems. We conduct a theoretical analysis of the optimal bidding strategy's structure. Further, an online receding optimization process is designed based on open-loop feedback control, which periodically updates a constructed optimal bid formulation that can be solved by linear programming. Then, considering large-scale linear programming problems, we propose an efficient down sampling scheme. Besides, a neural-network-based auction scale prediction is used to adapt to the changing market.

However, the extent to which external information influences LLMs’ cognition and behaviors remains unclear. This study investigates how external statements and opinions influence LLMs’ thoughts and behaviors from a social cognitive perspective. Three experiments were conducted to explore the effects of external information on LLMs’ memories, opinions, and social media behavioral decisions. Sociocognitive factors, including source authority, social identity, and social role, were analyzed to investigate their moderating effects. Results showed that external information can significantly shape LLMs’ memories, opinions, and behaviors, with these changes mirroring human social cognitive patterns such as authority bias, in-group bias, emotional positivity, and emotion contagion. This underscores the challenges in developing safe and unbiased LLMs, and emphasizes the importance of understanding the susceptibility of LLMs to external influences.},

However, these systems still encounter two major challenges: noise edges in interaction graphs and noise in multimodal features of items. Existing works tend to address only one type of noise problem to enhance recommendation performance. This article proposes a new Dual Denoising Multimodal Graph Recommendation (DDRec) model, designed to enhance multimodal recommendation systems by tackling both challenges simultaneously. Specifically, we design two denoising techniques: hard denoising and soft denoising. For noise edges in interaction graphs, the hard denoising method uses preference scores of user nodes and item nodes in different modality interaction graphs as edge weights and prunes edges below a certain threshold to eliminate noise. For noise in multimodal features, the soft denoising method leverages item and item semantic graph information to denoise modal features, thus obtaining modality features related to user preferences. Finally, we employ contrastive learning to compare user and item representations derived from the denoised modality interaction graphs against those from the original graph, ensuring the consistency of nodes across various views. Our comprehensive experiments across four public datasets validate the enhanced performance and effectiveness of the DDRec model.},

Traditional life satisfaction assessments rely on self-report questionnaires, which can be time-consuming and resource intensive. To address these limitations, we developed a method that utilizes LLMs for feature extraction from open-ended self-statement texts, followed by ML prediction. We compared this approach with standalone LLM predictions and expert ratings. A sample of 378 participants completed the satisfaction with life scale (SWLS) and wrote self-statements about their current life situation. The LLM-based ML model, using a LightGBM regressor, achieved a correlation of 0.542 with self-reported SWLS scores, outperforming both the standalone LLM (r $=$ 0.491) and expert ratings (r $=$ 0.455). Effect size analysis revealed a statistically significant moderate effect size difference between the LLM-based ML model and expert ratings (Cohen's d $=$ 0.499, 95% CI [0.043, 0.955]). These findings demonstrate the potential of integrating LLM and ML for an efficient and accurate assessment of life satisfaction, challenging conventional methods, and opening new avenues for psychological measurement.

Our research aims to compare the performance metrics of social bots that employ AI photos with those that use other types of photographs. To accomplish this, we analyzed a dataset with 13 748 measurements of 11 423 bots from the VK social network and identified 73 cases where bots employed generative adversarial network (GAN)-photos and 84 cases where bots employed diffusion or transformers photos. We conducted a qualitative comparison of these bots using metrics such as price, survival rate, quality, speed, and human trust. Our study findings indicate that bots that use AI-photos exhibit less danger and lower levels of sophistication compared to other types: AI-enhanced bots are less expensive, less popular on exchange platforms, of inferior quality, less likely to be operated by humans, and, as a consequence, faster and more susceptible to being blocked by social networks. We also did not observe any significant difference between GAN-based and diffusion/transformers-based bots, indicating that diffusion/transformers models did not contribute to increased bot sophistication compared to GAN models. Our contributions include a proposed methodology for evaluating the impact of photos on bot sophistication, along with a publicly available dataset for other researchers to study and analyze bots. Our research findings suggest a contradiction to theoretical expectations: in practice, bots using AI-generated photos pose less danger.},

Exploring fairness in image forensic algorithms is an initial step toward mitigating these biases. This study explores bias in visual transformer based image forensic algorithms that classify natural and GAN images, since visual transformers are recently being widely used in image classification based tasks, including in the area of image forensics. The proposed study procures bias evaluation corpora to analyze bias in gender, racial, affective, and intersectional domains using a wide set of individual and pairwise bias evaluation measures. Since the robustness of the algorithms against image compression is an important factor to be considered in forensic tasks, this study also analyzes the impact of image compression on model bias. Hence, to study the impact of image compression on model bias, a two-phase evaluation setting is followed, where the experiments are carried out in uncompressed and compressed evaluation settings. The study could identify bias existences in the visual transformer based models distinguishing natural and GAN images, and also observes that image compression impacts model biases, predominantly amplifying the presence of biases in class GAN predictions.},

  abstract     = {Sharding presents an enticing path toward improving blockchain scalability. However, the consensus mechanism within individual shards faces mounting security challenges due to the restricted number of consensus nodes and the reliance on conventional, unchanging nodes for consensus. Common strategies to enhance shard consensus security often involve increasing the number of consensus nodes per shard. While effective in bolstering security, this approach also leads to a notable rise in consensus delay within each shard, potentially offsetting the scalability advantages of sharding. Hence, it becomes imperative to strategically select nodes to form dedicated consensus groups for each shard. These groups should not only enhance shard consensus security but also do so without exacerbating consensus delay. In this article, we propose a novel consensus group selection based on transmission delay between nodes (CGSTD) to address this challenge, with the goal of minimizing the overall consensus delay across the system. CGSTD intelligently selects nodes from various shards to form distinct consensus groups for each shard, thereby enhancing shard security while maintaining optimal system-wide consensus efficiency. We conduct a rigorous theoretical analysis to evaluate the security properties of CGSTD and derive approximation ratios under various operational scenarios. Simulation results validate the superior performance of CGSTD compared to baseline algorithms, showcasing reductions in total consensus delay, mitigated increases in shard-specific delay, optimized block storage utilization per node, and streamlined participation of nodes in consensus groups.},

Most existing methods focus on learning different scales of graphs or using augmented data to improve the quality of feature representation. However, the performance is limited due to two critical problems. First, the high sensitivity of attributed networks makes it uncontrollable and uncertain to use conventional methods for data augmentation, leading to limited improvement in representation and generalization capabilities. Second, under the unsupervised paradigm, anomalous nodes mixed in the training data may interfere with the learning of normal patterns and weaken the discrimination ability. In this work, we propose a novel multiview and multiscale contrastive learning framework to address these two issues. Specifically, a network augmentation method based on parameter perturbation is introduced to generate augmented views for both node–node and node–subgraph level contrast branches. Then, cross-view graph contrastive learning is employed to improve the representation without the need for augmented data. We also provide a cycle training strategy where normal samples detected in the former step are collected for an additional training step. In this way, the ability to learn normal patterns is enhanced. Extensive experiments on six benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms the existing state-of-the-art baselines.},

To this end, we propose a novel cross-modal aggregation attention network (CMAAN), which interactively learns multiview representations from POI sequence and content sequence for predicting the next POI. Our approach models inter-modal interaction correlations, intra-modal sequence correlations, and intra-modal semantic correlations simultaneously to fully discover contextual potential relations along the trajectories. Specifically, the intra-modal semantic correlations are able to capture the variable location functionalities under different contextual relationships of cross-modal interaction information. Moreover, we apply the aggregation attention to adaptively aggregate multiview representations which represent the comprehensive hidden state of the next POI. Extensive experiments on two large-scale datasets clearly demonstrate that our CMAAN achieves state-of-the-art performance.},

  abstract     = {Room-temperature superconductors (esp. LK-99 in the recent) have attracted extensive academic attention in recent years, both in academic circles and among the general public. This topic has spread through a number of social media channels, a plethora of contradiction in information has emerged within social networks. There arises the question on how to analyze the consistency and controversy of such scientific knowledge in the dissemination process, and how this process impact on public cognition on the scientific knowledge. In this article, taking room-temperature superconductor as example, we first designed a large language model based factual consistency detection approach to analyze the consistency between research papers and media reports. Then the consistency between media reports and comments is analyzed, by proposing a novel quantification method for media agenda-setting capability, which evaluates the agenda-setting capability of media based on emotional and positional consistencies. The results indicate that two significant deviations occur when room-temperature superconductor knowledge is spread from specialized fields to the public through the various media. One deviation is due to the specialized nature of room-temperature superconductor knowledge, leading to discrepancies between reported content and factual information in research papers. The other deviation is caused by conflicting knowledge, resulting in disparities between media reports and public perception.},

  abstract     = {In this article, we introduce FairLPG, a framework for ensuring fairness for the task of link prediction in graphs with multiple sensitive attributes. In the context of link prediction in graphs, the fairness notions of demographic parity and equalized odds try to ensure equal average linking probability and true positive rates across different demographic groups consisting of various node pairs. Existing methods for achieving fairness in link prediction only consider a single sensitive attribute, which makes them unsuited for applications where multiple sensitive attributes need to be accounted for. Additionally, considering multiple sensitive attributes in the context of link prediction leads to overlapping and intersectional groups, which further complicates designing such a framework. The proposed framework FairLPG assumes that the link prediction model generates a prediction score for each node pair to form an edge, and formulates a convex optimization problem that minimizes the squared Euclidean distance between the original prediction scores and transformed scores, subject to the fairness constraints. The transformed scores are then utilized for fair link prediction. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to handle the case of intersectional sensitive groups in the graph setting. To demonstrate its effectiveness, we deploy FairLPG on several real-world datasets and graph neural network based link prediction models. It either outperforms or performs competitively with existing methods both in terms of fairness and prediction accuracy across all the datasets and link prediction models at the same time being computationally more efficient.},

  abstract     = {Hypertension is a prevalent cardiovascular disease that requires timely and precise medication management. However, previous medication recommendation studies have largely relied on analyzing electronic health records (EHR), overlooking the specialized knowledge required for hypertension treatment. Moreover, the hypertension-related knowledge contained in existing general medical knowledge graphs is overly simplistic, and the binary relation representations they employ fail to accurately represent the complex treatment logic, thus falling short of meeting medication recommendation needs. To tackle these concerns, we present a novel hyper-relational knowledge-enhanced hypertension medication recommendation model (HKRec). HKRec incorporates both professional treatment knowledge and individual characteristics of patients to provide personalized medication treatment plans. Specifically, a hyper-relational knowledge graph designed for hypertension medication treatment is first constructed. Next, we design a knowledge-driven encoder to capture the representations of hyper-relational knowledge within the graph, and develop an EHR-driven encoder to extract patient-specific features from the EHRs. By integrating medical knowledge entities and patient information, a recurrent mechanism is introduced to model the development process of patients’ hypertension conditions, thereby enabling more effective medication recommendations. Results from experiments on real-world MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV datasets demonstrate that the HKRec model outperforms several competitive baseline methods. The approach enables physicians to create more accurate and personalized medication plans, leading to better management of hypertension and improved patient outcomes. Our code is publicly accessible at https://github.com/zk0814/HKRec.},

  abstract     = {Motor imagery (MI)-based electroencephalography (EEG) stands as a prominent paradigm in the brain–computer interface (BCI) field, which is frequently applied in neural rehabilitation and gaming due to its accessibility and reliability. Despite extensive research dedicated to MI EEG classification algorithms, a notable deficiency still remains: their performance is often optimal only in subject-specific or dataset-specific scenarios, which undermines their generalization capability, hence restricting BCI systems' practical utility in real-world contexts. To address this limitation, this study introduces a cutting-edge approach: a discriminative adversarial network based on spatial–temporal–graph fusion (STG-DAN). This innovation aims to learn features that are not only class-discriminative but also domain-invariant. Specifically, the feature extraction module guarantees the feature discriminativeness by amalgamating spatial–temporal and graph-related features, while the domain alignment module focuses on both global domain and local subdomain. The two modules are incorporated into one adversarial learning framework to facilitate the acquisition of domain-invariant features. Evaluations on two publicly accessible datasets, BCI competition IV 2a and OpenBMI, affirm the superiority of our proposed model (averaged accuracy = 62.94% and 73.01% for the two datasets in cross-subject circumstance, respectively). In cross-dataset circumstances, it also outperforms several state-of-the-art algorithms, attesting to the potency of STG-DAN.},

Although great efforts have been taken to optimize DNNs, few studies focused on the inefficiency caused by the data samples with less value for model training. In this article, we empirically demonstrate that sample complexity is important for model efficiency and selecting representative samples is constructive to the model efficiency. In particular, we propose hardness-aware dataset pruning method ($\gamma$-Razor) to select representative samples from large-scale datasets to remove the less valuable data samples for model training. $\gamma$-Razor is a two-stage framework that includes interclass sampling and intraclass sampling. First, we introduce the inverse self-paced learning strategy to learn hard samples and adjust their weights adaptively according to the inverse frequency of effective samples of each class. For intraclass sampling, hardness-aware cluster sampling algorithm is proposed to downsample easy samples within each class. To evaluate the performance of $\gamma$-Razor, we conducted extensive experiments on three large-scale datasets for image classification tasks. The experimental results show that models trained with the pruned datasets show competitive performances against their counterparts trained with the original large-scale datasets in terms of robustness and efficiency. Furthermore, models trained with the pruned datasets converge faster with lower energy consumption.},

Whereas hate speech in social media has garnered much attention, inciting speech has not been well studied in domains such as religion. We address two aspects of religious incitement: 1) what rhetorical strategies are used in it?; and 2) do the same strategies apply across disparate social contexts and targets? We identify inciting speech against Muslims but demonstrate the generality of the construct vis à vis other targets. We adopt existing datasets of Islamophobic WhatsApp posts and hateful and offensive posts (Twitter and Gab) against other targets. Our methods include: 1) qualitative analysis revealing rhetorical strategies; and 2) an iterative process to label the data, yielding a tool to detect incitement. Incitement applies three rhetorical strategies focused, respectively, on the target group's identity, their imputed misdeeds, and an exhortation to act against them. These strategies carry distinct textual signatures. Our tool (with additional verification) reveals that inciting sentences appear in non-Islamophobic posts and in other contexts (e.g., posts against certain gender identities), indicating the generality of incitement as a concept. Incitement reflects a wide swath of malicious speech omitted from traditional analyses. Understanding and identifying incitement can facilitate online moderation and thus concomitantly reduce harm in real life.},

In this work, we aim to achieve robust emotion prediction through efficient disentanglement of affective semantic representations. In detail, the data generation mechanism behind observations from different perspectives is causally set, where latent variables that relate to emotion are explicitly separate into three parts: the intrinsic-related part, the extrinsic-related part, and the spurious-related part. Affective semantic features consist of the first two parts, with the understanding that spurious latent variables generate the inherent biases in the data. Furthermore, a variational autoencoder with a reformulated objective function is proposed to learn such disentangled latent variables, and only adopts semantic representations to perform the final classification task, avoiding the interference of spurious variables. In addition, for electroencephalography (EEG) data used in this article, a space-frequency mapping method is introduced to improve information utilization. Comprehensive experiments on popular emotion datasets show that the proposed method can achieve competitive intersubject generalization performance. Our results highlight the potential of efficient latent representation disentanglement in addressing the complexity challenges of emotion recognition.},

In the article, we propose video echoed in harmony (VEH), a method for learning and sampling video-integrated chord progression sequences. Our approach adopts harmony, represented by chord progressions that are aligned with various music formats [musical instrument digital interface (MIDI), audio, and score], imitating chord precedence in human music composition. Visual-language models link visual features to chord progressions through genre labels and descriptive words in generated textualized videos. The two aforementioned features collectively obviate the necessity of extensive video–music paired data. Besides, an energy-based chord progression learning and sampling algorithm quantifies abstract harmony impressions to statistical features, serving as interpretable factors for the controllable music generation based on music theory. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art, producing a superior music alignment for the given video.},

  abstract     = {Affective music generation is a challenge for symbolic music generation. Existing methods face the problem that the perceived emotion of the generated music is not evident because music datasets containing emotional labels are relatively small in quantity and scale. To address this issue, an attribute-enhanced affective music transformer (AE-AMT) model is proposed to generate perceived affective music with attribute enhancement. In addition, a multiquantile-based attribute discretization (MQAD) strategy is designed, enabling the model to generate intensity-controllable affective music pieces. Furthermore, A replication-expanded compound representation of the control signals (RECR) method is designed for control signals to improve the controllability of the model. In objective experiments, the AE-AMT model demonstrated a 29.25% and 19.5% improvement in overall emotion accuracy, along with a 30% and 32% improvement in arousal accuracy on the datasets EMOPIA and VGMIDI. These improvements are achieved without significant difference in objective music quality, while also providing ample novelty and diversity compared to the current state-of-the-art approach. Moreover, subjective experiments revealed that the AE-AMT model outperformed comparison models, especially in low valence and arousal based on the Wilcoxon signed ranks test. Additionally, the soft variant model of AE-AMT exhibited a significant advantage in valence, low arousal, and overall music quality. These experiments showcase the AE-AMT model's ability to significantly enhance arousal performance and strike a balance between emotional intensity and musical quality through adaptable strategies.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, multitrack music generation has garnered significant attention in both academic and industrial spheres for its versatile utilization of various instruments in collaborative settings. The primary challenge lies in achieving a harmonious balance within individual tracks and fostering effective collaboration across multiple tracks. To address this issue, this article introduces a pioneering hybrid learning encoder architecture. Each music track's encoder is implemented as an independent transformer architecture, preserving self-attention mechanisms within a single track and interattention mechanisms between different tracks. The resulting features are then seamlessly integrated into the decoder through concatenation. Of particular significance, previous multitrack music generation efforts have predominantly operated under unconditional settings, yielding music that lacks practical value due to noncompliance with established music theory principles. Recognizing this limitation, the article proposes a novel approach to multitrack music generation guided by music theory rules. Employing reinforcement learning techniques, the decoder-generated music serves as the initial state. Positive feedback is provided when the generated music adheres to music theory rules; conversely, negative feedback is applied to compel the multitrack music to align with widely accepted music theory principles. Finally, comprehensive simulation validation is conducted on both the publicly available LMD dataset and the self-constructed MUT dataset. The plethora of experimental results overwhelmingly corroborates the efficacy of the proposed methodology.},

  abstract     = {Music recommendation systems aim to suggest tracks that users may enjoy. However, the accuracy of recommendation results is affected by popularity bias. Previous studies have focused on mitigating the direct effect of single-item popularity in video, news, or e-commerce recommendations, but have overlooked the multisource popularity biases in music recommendations. This article proposes a causal inference-based method to reduce the influence of both track and artist popularity. First, we construct a causal graph that encompasses users, tracks, and artists within the context of music recommendations. Next, we employ matrix factorization in conjunction with counterfactual inference theory to mitigate the popularity effects of artists and tracks, taking into account both the natural direct and indirect effects of these entities on music recommendations. Experimental results evaluated on four music recommendation datasets indicate that our method outperforms other baselines and effectively alleviates the popularity bias of both tracks and artists.},

This article proposes a new community-enhanced dynamic graph convolutional network (CDGCN) for effective rumor detection on online social networks, which utilize the communities formed in a rumor propagation process to improve rumor detection accuracy. CDGCN uses a designed method that combines node features and topology features to identify the communities and learn the community features of rumors. Following this, a graph convolutional network (GCN) with a community-aware attention mechanism is proposed to enable the nodes to dynamically aggregate information from their neighboring nodes’ global and community features, effectively prioritizing critical neighborhood information, enhancing the representation of both local community structures and global network patterns for improved analytical performance. The final rumor representations generated by the GCN are processed by a classifier to detect false rumors. Comprehensive experiments and comparison studies are conducted on four real-world datasets to validate the effectiveness of CDGCN.},

  abstract     = {Generative large language models (GLLMs) have achieved extreme success in the academic community of recommender systems. However, the application of such a powerful tool in the industrial world is still nascent. In Chinese home renovation industry, advisory consultants engage in offline conversations to fully understand the intentions of potential clients before subsequently recommending designers to them. Although conventional recommender systems can somewhat substitute for the consultants, they fall short in addressing two significant challenges. First, clients frequently revise their intentions during conversations, complicating the accurate capture of key intentions. Second, the process of recommending designers, which relies heavily on consultants’ manual efforts, is not only time-consuming but also prone to inaccuracies. To address the challenges, we present a recommendation agent, named DCICDRec, which leverages the robust conversational understanding and generation capabilities of the large language model MOSS. The creation of this agent involves two key steps. The first step is to prepare the corpus from the renovation domain by organizing it into conversational graphs, to which balanced sampling and profile normalization mechanisms are applied. This preparation ensures that the corpus is well-structured and unbiased before proceeding to fine-tune MOSS. The second step is to utilize the fine-tuned MOSS as a recommendation agent. In this capacity, the agent engages in conversations with potential clients and recommends designers, providing detailed reasons for each recommendation. Furthermore, if the client is dissatisfied with the recommended designers, the agent will delve deeper into understanding the client's true intentions and continually update the recommendations until the client is satisfied. We evaluate the agent's effectiveness on a real dialog dataset CRM between clients and consultants, as well as two publicly available datasets, INSPIRED and ReDIAL. Through comprehensive experiments with six baseline models, the DCICDRec agent demonstrate superior performances on the three datasets. Such experimental achievements indicate that the DCICDRec agent holds significant potential for generalization and commercial value. Moreover, the results of case study with 11 offline tests illustrate the scalability and efficiency of the agent in real-time scenarios.},

  abstract     = {Through the use of sarcastic sentences on social media, people can express their strong emotions. Therefore, the detection of sarcasm in social media has received more and more attention over the past years. Classifying a sentence as sarcastic or nonsarcastic heavily relies on the contextual information of the sentence. However, only focusing on the features of target text is the main solution of most existing research. Moreover, the scale of publicly available Chinese sarcasm dataset is very small and does not contain the contextual information. To address the issues mentioned above, we build a Chinese sarcasm dataset from Bilibili, which is one of the most widely used social network platforms in China and has a significant number of sarcastic comments and contextual information. As far as we know, our dataset is the first publicly available large-scale Chinese sarcasm dataset including contextual information. Additionally, we have proposed a novel retrospective reading method for detecting sarcasm that leverages contextual information to improve model's performance. The experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed model and the significance of contextual information for Chinese sarcasm detection: achieving the highest F-score of 0.6942, outperforming existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches. The study presented in this article offers approaches and ideas for future Chinese sarcasm detection studies.},

  abstract     = {Although promising, federated edge learning (FEL) is being plagued by unreliable clients with low-quality parameters due to tight edge association and frequent edge aggregation. Existing efforts mainly focus on setting thresholds or identifying malicious behaviors to resist unreliable clients, which comes at the cost of losing their training samples and leads to unsustainable and collaborative inefficiencies. To tackle this issue, we propose the first sustainable contract, named FedSC, which allows for sustaining truthful contributions in more general conditions including clients’ multidimensional attributes and imperfect system monitoring. Specifically, by modeling the long-term strategic behaviors of self-interested clients as a Markov decision process, we quantify the impact of client behavior on their utilities and derive the critical conditions that make the rating-based contract sustainable, thereby promoting honest participation as the optimal choice for strategic clients. Since directly deriving the optimal design of FedSC under multiple constraints and nonlinear coupling of parameters is intractable, we characterize the impact of design parameters on objective function and analytically prove the existence of closed solution. Then, through a low-time-complexity greedy-based algorithm, the optimality of sustainable contracts under different system errors is guaranteed. Extensive experiments using both synthetic and real datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of FedSC compared to the state-of-the-art baselines. Excitingly, FedSC can reduce the number of free-riders up to 34.52% and improve the amount of contributed data and model performance up to 22.98% and 8.62%, respectively.},

This article addresses this gap with two primary objectives: 1) by developing a calculation model for PPO that integrates the forwarding dynamics within social networks; and 2) by establishing a predictive model that is applied to the temporal evolution of forwarding circles, thus enabling a time-series prediction for PPO. The approach commenced by determining the information entropy based on the structural attributes of forwarding circles. Then, we assess the similarity between information entropy production and the Baidu search index to validate the calculation model’s accuracy. Building on this foundation, public opinion data centered around 30 social events with a total sample size of 15.567 million blogs were collected for modeling. Finally, we design a deep learning algorithm to predict the PPO trend. The results demonstrate that the information entropy of forwarding circles accurately represents PPO, and the proposed predictive model can capture the time-series evolution trend of PPO on social media. These findings offer valuable insights into public opinion analysis and present a robust method for academics and social media practitioners.},

  abstract     = {Opinion Dynamics models in social networks are a valuable tool to study how opinions evolve within a population. However, these models often rely on agent-level parameters that are difficult to measure in a real population. This is the case of the confidence threshold in opinion dynamics models based on bounded confidence, where agents are only influenced by other agents having a similar opinion (given by this confidence threshold). Consequently, a common practice is to apply a universal threshold to the entire population and calibrate its value to match observed real-world data, despite being an unrealistic assumption. In this work, we propose an alternative approach using graph neural networks to infer agent-level confidence thresholds in the opinion dynamics of the Hegselmann-Krause model of bounded confidence. This eliminates the need for additional simulations when faced with new case studies. To this end, we construct a comprehensive synthetic training dataset that includes different network topologies and configurations of thresholds and opinions. Through multiple training runs utilizing different architectures, we identify GraphSAGE as the most effective solution, achieving a coefficient of determination $R^{2}$ above 0.7 in test datasets derived from real-world topologies. Remarkably, this performance holds even when the test topologies differ in size from those considered during training.},

  abstract     = {This article proposes a methodological framework for quantitative estimations of height and weight using behavioral data collected from smart devices. We analyze the connections between height and weight information and behavioral data from three aspects: walking speed, stride length, and step frequency and then extract two kinds of motion features including basic kinematic features and advanced features which use statistical measurements summarizing the dynamics of walking behavior over time and relative intensity of walking speed change, energy cost of one step during walking, and walking frequency, respectively, to describe the motion behavior. After that, we qualitatively and quantitatively analyze the complementarity of different motion data sources and show that more useful information existed in multisource motion data than that of only one motion data source. Based on this, we propose a feature fusion approach named Serial+CC to dealing with the relationships between all motion features from multiple smart devices and user traits of height and weight and then a fused feature set with high discrimination and low complexity is constructed. Finally, five regression models of SVM, BP neural networks, Random Forest, LSTM, and BiLSTM are built with the fused feature set. Empirical evaluations were performed on a dataset collected from 56 subjects. The results demonstrate that motion data collected from smart devices can be used for height and weight quantitative estimation. The results also illustrate our method of using motion data collected from multiple smart devices can achieve better performance than those of only using one smart devices. The best performance is achieved with average errors of 0.95% (1.59 cm) and 4.75% (2.90 kg) for height and weight estimations, respectively, in the scenario of using multiple devices.},

  abstract     = {The underlying time-variant and subject-specific brain dynamics lead to statistical uncertainty in electroencephalogram (EEG) representations and connectivities under diverse individual biases. Current works primarily augment statisticallike EEG data based on deterministic modes without comprehensively considering uncertain statistical discrepancies in representations and connectivities. This results in insufficient domain diversity to cover more domain variations for a generalized model independent of individuals. This article proposes an uncertainty-guided graph augmentation network (Ugan) to generalize EEG emotion recognition across subjects by comprehensively mimicking and constraining the uncertain statistical shifts across individuals. Specifically, an uncertainty-guided graph augmentation module is employed to augment both connectivities and features of EEG graph by manipulating domain statistical characteristics. With the original and augmented EEG graph covering diverse domain variations, the model can mimic the uncertain domain shifts to achieve better generalizability against potential subject variability. To extract discriminative characteristics and preserve emotional semantics after augmentation, a graph coteaching learning module is designed to facilitate coteaching knowledge learning between the original and augmented views. Moreover, a coteaching regularization module is developed to constrain semantic domain invariance and consistency, thereby rendering the model invariant to uncertain statistical shifts. Extensive experiments on three public EEG emotion datasets, i.e., Shanghai Jiao Tong University emotion EEG dataset (SEED), SEED-IV, and SEED-V, validate the superior generalizability of Ugan compared to the state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract     = {The widespread diffusion of fake news has become a critical problem on dynamic social media worldwide, which requires effective strategies for fake news detection to alleviate its hazardous consequences for society. However, most recent efforts only focus on the features of news content and social context without realizing the benefits of large language models (LLMs) and multiple knowledge graphs (KGs), thus failing to improve detection capabilities further. To tackle this issue, we present a multiknowledge and LLM-inspired heterogeneous graph neural network for fake news detection (MiLk-FD), by combining KGs, LLMs, and graph neural networks (GNNs). Specifically, we first model news content as a heterogeneous graph (HG) containing news, entity, and topic nodes and then fuse the knowledge from three KGs to augment the factual basis of news articles. Meanwhile, we leverage TransE to initialize the knowledge features and employ LLaMa2-7B to obtain the initial feature vectors of news articles. After that, we utilize the devised HG transformer to learn news embeddings with specific feature distribution in high-dimensional spaces by aggregating neighborhood information according to metapaths. Finally, a classifier based on multilayer perceptron (MLP) is trained to predict each news article as fake or true. Through experiments, we demonstrate that our proposed framework surpasses ten baselines according to accuracy, precision, F1-score, recall, and ROC in four public real-world benchmarks (i.e., COVID-19, FakeNewsNet, PAN2020, Liar).},

Accurately identifying these bots is essential for effective community governance and opinion management. This article introduces a category of online social behavior features (OSBF), derived from microblog behaviors such as emotional expression, language organization, and self-description. Through a series of experiments, OSBF has demonstrated the stable and robust performance in characterizing and detecting microblog bots on Twitter and Chinese Weibo. By identifying significant differences in OSBF between bot and human accounts, we established an OSBF-based detection model. This model showed excellent performance across multitask and multiscale challenges in two English Twitter datasets. Additionally, we explored cross-language and cross-dataset applications using two Chinese Weibo datasets, further affirming the model's effectiveness and robustness.

A previous experimental study has investigated the decision-making and motion behavior of subgroups when facing a static obstacle during movement. However, it is hard to quantify social attributes (e.g., interpersonal relationships and sense of identity) and little is known about how they affect the movement process of subgroups. Here, we propose a vision-driven model to solve this problem, in which two key model parameters are defined to control the spatial cohesion and attraction intensity, respectively. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the optimal regions of model parameters vary depending on different conditions of the three control variables (obstacle width, time pressure, and subgroup size). The spatial cohesion and attraction intensity barely change the movement process of subgroups in the maintaining state but significantly affect it in the splitting-merging state. This model can reproduce the herding effect of subgroup members in the merging process, which is affected to varying degrees by the modulation of model parameters. Overall, this work contributes to the simulation of subgroup behaviors from a sociopsychological perspective.},

With advancements in network infrastructure, FL has been seamlessly integrated into edge computing. However, the limited resources on edge devices introduce security vulnerabilities to FL in the context. While blockchain technology promises to bolster security, practical deployment on resource-constrained edge devices remains a challenge. Moreover, the exploration of FL with multiple aggregators in edge computing is still new in the literature. Addressing these gaps, we introduce the blockchain-empowered heterogeneous multiaggregator federated learning architecture (BMA-FL). We design a novel lightweight Byzantine consensus mechanism, namely PBCM, to enable secure and fast model aggregation and synchronization in BMA-FL. We study the heterogeneity problem in BMA-FL that the aggregators are associated with varied number of connected trainers with non-IID data distributions and diverse training speed. We propose a multiagent deep reinforcement learning algorithm (MASB-DRL) to help aggregators decide the best training strategies. Experiments on real-word datasets demonstrate the efficiency of BMA-FL to achieve better models faster than baselines, showing the efficacy of PBCM and MASB-DRL.},

To address the critical need for secure and effective CTI sharing in smart grid systems, this article proposes a novel approach. Our solution leverages encrypted federated learning (FL) with integrated malicious client detection mechanisms. This approach facilitates collaborative learning of a threat detection model while preserving the privacy of raw CTI data. Employing real-world, heterogeneous smart grid datasets, we rigorously evaluated our approach under two distinct attack scenarios.

A defensive approach, based on integer-order differential equations, has been recently developed to analyze the effects of verification and blocking of users for containing the spread of fake news. Starting from it, we introduce a novel fractional model providing a more accurate, powerful, and realistic representation of the transmission of fake news messages. The model aims to predict the spread of such messages, by better considering the effect of the system's status evolution over time. The use of fractional differential equations to schematize the propagation of fake news results in incorporating a greater amount of memory information and better considering hereditary properties of the system of interest, also capturing its hidden nonlinear dynamics, mainly related to fractality and multiscale nature.},

  abstract     = {Graph neural networks (GNNs) have recently gained attention for capturing complex relations, prompting researchers to explore their potential in document classification. Existing studies serving this purpose fall into two directions: inductive learning focusing on personalized context relations within documents and transductive learning targeting the global distribution relations among documents in a corpus. Both directions extract distinct types of beneficial structural information and yield encouraging outcomes. However, due to the incompatibility of underlying graph structures and learning settings, developing an enhanced model that effectively integrates local and global relational learning within existing frameworks is challenging. To address this issue, we propose a new GNN-based document representation learning framework that incorporates multiview global graphs at both the word and document levels, focusing on learning the diverse global distribution information of texts at different granularities. Additionally, a contextual encoder derives the initial representations of document nodes from the updated representations of word nodes, integrating personalized context relations into document representations during this process. Finally, we tailor a node representation learning strategy for the multiview global graphs, called the multiview graph sampling and updating module, which allows our framework to operate efficiently during training without being constrained by the scale of the global graph. Experiments indicate that our framework generally enhances performance by integrating both global and local relational learning. When combined with large-scale language models, our framework achieves state-of-the-art results for GNN-based models across multiple datasets.},

  abstract     = {In e-learning, extracting suitable learning objects (LOs) from a vast resource pool and organizing them into high-quality learning paths is crucial for helping e-learners achieve their goals. Numerous approaches have been proposed to recommend optimal learning paths for e-learners. However, it is essential to emphasize that e-learning systems typically consist of a wide range of LOs with varying levels of granularity, ranging from fine-grained to coarse-grained. Unfortunately, current research has not adequately considered the underlying granularity structure of LOs when optimizing learning paths. Existing methods primarily focus on organizing LOs at a single granularity level, limiting their applicability in real-world e-learning systems. To address the limitations, we propose a multigranularity learning path recommendation (MGLPR) framework that aims to flexibly and effectively integrate the diverse granularity levels of LOs into high-quality learning paths. In this framework, a two-layer [knowledge point (KP) and LO layers] model is developed to formulate the MGLPR problem as a constrained optimization problem and an improved ant colony optimization algorithm (IACO) is introduced to solve it to identify optimal learning paths for e-learners. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed IACO, we conducted extensive computational experiments using 30 simulation datasets with varying problem sizes and complexities. The results demonstrate that our proposed IACO achieves superior performance and robustness compared with other competitors. Additionally, an empirical study was conducted to investigate the efficacy of the proposed approach in an authentic learning context, with results indicating that the proposed method outperforms the traditional self-organized ones.},

The consensus of a majority of members on specific topics often guides the collective decision-making in groups. Group influence maximization (GIM) aims to select $k$ seed users in a network to maximize the number of eventually activated groups. A group is said to be activated if $\beta$ percent of users in this group are activated. This study delves into the strategic selection of seed users in social networks to maximize the spread of a topic, thereby activating the highest number of groups. The GIM problem, inherently NP-hard when computing the influence spread from a selected set of nodes, has traditionally faced obstacles in ensuring theoretical robustness, time efficiency, and adaptability in large and complex network environments. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a robust framework called GIMDRL that addresses the GIM problem in social networks using deep reinforcement learning (DRL). Our approach integrates node embeddings from multiple graph neural networks, thereby utilizing diverse information for effective network analysis. This integration plays a crucial role in optimizing the parameter learning process. Extensive experiments are conducted on real-world and synthetic datasets to assess the performance of our proposed framework. The results of these experiments indicate that our approach significantly outperforms existing methods in GIM, even when trained on sampled graphs.

Hence, a bifurcated logistics operation and cyberattack defense strategy have been propounded for green integrated power-transportation networks (IPTN) with renewable penetration. This strategy leverages the potential of social participation from EVs to amplify the defense operation. The bifurcation comprises of a preclusive stage aimed at fortifying and preserving resource allocation within IPTN and a defensive stage aimed at mitigating the deleterious impacts of cyberattacks through rapid response measures. Conventional measures such as load shedding and operation adjustments are augmented by an innovative defense involvement incentive, designed to elicit additional support from EV users. A mean-risk distributionally robust optimization methodology predicated on Kullback–Leibler divergence is posited to address the limitations in data availability in simulating cyberattack consequences.

Specifically, we construct multi-turn dialogues through a three-step pipeline comprising multiturn QA generation, evidence judgment, and dialogue refinement. We augment this process with real-world psychological case backgrounds extracted from online platforms, enhancing the relevance and applicability of the generated data. Additionally, to compare the performance of PsycoLLM with other LLMs, we develop a comprehensive psychological benchmark based on authoritative psychological counseling examinations in China, which includes assessments of professional ethics, theoretical proficiency, and case analysis. The experimental results on the benchmark illustrate the effectiveness of PsycoLLM, which demonstrates superior performance compared with other LLMs.},

  abstract     = {Accurately predicting the future trajectories of traffic agents is paramount for autonomous unmanned systems, such as self-driving cars and mobile robotics. Extracting abundant temporal and social features from trajectory data and integrating the resulting features effectively pose great challenges for predictive models. To address these issues, this article proposes a novel multibranch attentive transformer (MBAT) trajectory prediction network for traffic agents. Specifically, to explore and reveal diverse correlations of agents, we propose a decoupled temporal and spatial feature learning module with multibranch to extract temporal, spatial, as well as spatiotemporal features. Such design ensures each branch can be specifically tailored for different types of correlations, thus enhancing the flexibility and representation ability of features. Besides, we put forward an attentive transformer architecture that simultaneously models the complex correlations possibly occurring in historical and future timesteps. Moreover, the temporal, spatial, and spatiotemporal features can be effectively integrated based on different types of attention mechanisms. Empirical results demonstrate that our model achieves outstanding performance on public ETH, UCY, SDD, and INTERACTION datasets. Detailed ablation studies are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the model components.},

  abstract     = {Ethereum, as one of the most active cryptocurrency trading platforms, has garnered significant academic interest due to its transparent and accessible transaction data. In recent years, phishing scams have emerged as a serious criminal activity on Ethereum. Although most studies model Ethereum account transactions as networks and analyze them using traditional machine learning or network representation learning techniques, these approaches often rely solely on the latest static transaction records or use manually designed features while neglecting transaction histories, thus failing to fully capture the dynamic interactions and potential trading patterns between accounts. This article introduces an innovative multiperspective cascaded dynamic graph neural network model named DMPCG, which extracts phishing transaction data from authoritative databases like blockchain explorers to construct transaction network graphs. The model elevates the analysis from the microscopic features of nodes to the macroscopic dynamics of the entire network, integrating the attributes of static snapshot graphs with the evolution of dynamic trading networks, significantly enhancing the accuracy of phishing detection. Experimental results demonstrate that the DMPCG method achieves an impressive precision of 92.6% and an F1-score of 90.9%, outperforming existing baseline models and traditional subgraph sampling techniques.},

  abstract     = {Graph anomaly detection is a challenging task in graph data mining, aiming to recognize unconventional patterns within a network. Recently, there has been increasing attention on graph anomaly detection based on contrastive learning due to its high adaptability to the sample imbalance problem. However, most existing work typically focuses on the contrast of local views while neglecting global comparison information, leading to suboptimal performance. To address this issue, we introduce a new multiscale contrastive self-supervised learning framework for graph anomaly detection (GADMCLG). Our approach incorporates local-level contrasts involving node–node and node–subgraph contrast, and global-level subgraph–subgraph contrast. The former mines localized abnormal information, while the latter is intended to capture global anomalous patterns. Specifically, our proposed subgraph–subgraph contrast adopts the h-order neighbor subgraph sampling instead of augmented subgraphs through edge perturbation. This sampling strategy ensures a comprehensive observation of the neighborhood surrounding the target node, thereby mitigating the introduction of extraneous noise and providing interpretability for the detected results. Furthermore, we incorporate a subgraph centralization technique to reduce the bias caused by the absolute position of subgraphs in the attribute space, which enhances the model's ability to identify anomalies at different scales. Extensive experimental results on six real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method and its superiority compared with state-of-the-art approaches.},

This problem has compounded with the evolution and increased adoption of machine learning (ML), which has necessitated balancing the security of sensitive information with model utility. Traditional data privacy techniques, such as differential privacy and anonymization, focus on protecting data at rest and in transit but often fail to maintain high utility for machine learning models due to their impact on data accuracy. In this article, we explore the use of synthetic data as a privacy-preserving method that can effectively balance data privacy and utility. Synthetic data is generated to replicate the statistical properties of the original dataset while obscuring identifying details, offering enhanced privacy guarantees. We evaluate the performance of synthetic data against differentially private and anonymized data in terms of prediction accuracy across various settings—different learning rates, network architectures, and datasets from various domains. Our findings demonstrate that synthetic data maintains higher utility (prediction accuracy) than differentially private and anonymized data. The study underscores the potential of synthetic data as a robust privacy-enhancing technology (PET) capable of preserving both privacy and data utility in machine learning environments.},

We probe into pure bundle and mixed bundle pricing decisions for the product line and value-added services in monopolistic settings and delve into the impacts of the reference price and search cost on pricing, profit, product variety, and strategy. Based on model analysis and numerical simulations, the results show that the reference price effect benefits low-priced offerings but undermines high-priced products, overall market share, and profit. As the reference price effect or search cost increases, product variety diminishes. In scenarios where the reference price effect and the proportion of bundled purchases are minimal, the pure bundling strategy is preferable; otherwise, the mixed bundling strategy is more advantageous. When enterprises overlook the reference price effect, there is an imbalance in the pricing of various products and services within the product line, which results in the actual market share and profit consistently falling below the ideal expectations.},

  abstract     = {The graph-based multiview clustering has gained significant attention due to its effectiveness in representing complex relationships among multiview data for enhanced clustering. Among the previous graph-based methods, the multiview graph learning (or graph fusion) technique has rapidly emerged as a promising direction, which, however, still suffers from two critical limitations. First, most of previous methods adopt a single-level of graph fusion, which lack the ability to go from single-level graph fusion to multilevel (deep) graph fusion. Second, they generally focus on constructing an optimal unified graph but cannot fully investigate the correlations among multiple views. Therefore, it is difficult to establish a comprehensive and obvious graph structure. In light of this, this article presents a new multiview graph learning method called deep similarity graph fusion (DSGF) for the multiview clustering task, where three pathways are simultaneously leveraged to fuse multilevel similarity into a unified graph. Particularly, multilevel graph fusion is utilized to obtain a view-specific similarity graph for each view and then fuse these single-view graphs (via three levels of graph fusion) into a robust graph, which takes advantage of deeper consensus information between various similarity graphs and improves the quality of the learned graph for the final spectral clustering process. Extensive experiments are conducted on six real-world multiview datasets, which demonstrate the highly competitive clustering performance of DSGF in comparison with state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract     = {Deep learning, as an important branch of machine learning, has been widely applied in computer vision, natural language processing, speech recognition, and more. However, recent studies have revealed that deep learning systems are vulnerable to backdoor attacks. Backdoor attackers inject a hidden backdoor into the deep learning model, such that the predictions of the infected model will be maliciously changed if the hidden backdoor is activated by input with a backdoor trigger while behaving normally on any benign sample. This kind of attack can potentially result in severe consequences in the real world. Therefore, research on defending against backdoor attacks has emerged rapidly. In this article, we have provided a comprehensive survey of backdoor attacks, detections, and defenses previously demonstrated on deep learning. We have investigated widely used model architectures, benchmark datasets, and metrics in backdoor research and have classified attacks, detections and defenses based on different criteria. Furthermore, we have analyzed some limitations in existing methods and, based on this, pointed out several promising future research directions. Through this survey, beginners can gain a preliminary understanding of backdoor attacks and defenses. Furthermore, we anticipate that this work will provide new perspectives and inspire extra research into the backdoor attack and defense methods in deep learning.},

Based on this finding, we propose a derivation topic dissemination model based on iterative multitopic derivation and social psychology, taking into full consideration users’ emotional accumulation of antecedent topics and repeated derivation of topics. First, a multiple linear regression model is used to construct a metric algorithm for user antecedent sentiment and to effectively analyze the dynamics of antecedent sentiment accumulation affecting the spread of derivative topics. Second, to analyze the interactions between and within multitopic layers in full, an iterative multitopic dissemination model iterative-susceptible infectious recovery (SIR) is proposed. In addition, the association degree is introduced to define the cross-model state transition equation by considering the association and differences among multitopics. Last, considering the influence of cognitive inertia and “continuous attention psychology” in social psychology, we construct a user psychology-based driving force model which can further improve the cross-model state transition equation. According to the experiments, the model can effectively reveal the influence of different factors on the dissemination trend of derivative topics in social networks, as well as depict the dissemination dynamics of derivative topics.},

First, we employ a multiple linear regression method to construct the information influence mechanism by extracting network structure, topic content information, and historical behavior information, considering the complexity of spreading multitype compound rumor messages. Then, we introduce game theory and formulate a game strategy to capture the competition and cooperation among rumors, antirumors, and prom-rumors.

The agents learn using fuzzy actor critic learning algorithms in either a hierarchical structure or a single actor critic policy. The genetic algorithm selects the discount factors, the reward weights, and the standard deviation of noise applied to actor during learning. The genetic algorithm uses a fitness function based on the ratio of successful tests the group of agents can pass after training.

  abstract     = {Most research investigating how social influence affects election results mainly uses diffusion models for binary opinions. However, these diffusion models are progressive and focus on the diffusion of one opinion. In this article, we introduce a general diffusion model for ordinal opinions expressed as linear orderings over a finite set of candidates. We employ agent-based modeling to simulate a nonprogressive diffusion process, allowing multiple types of opinion diffusion about different candidates. The proposed agent-based diffusion model can forecast long-term trends of opinion diffusion in social networks by capturing voters’ personalized features and incorporating dynamic social contexts. Furthermore, we examine the possibility of affecting election outcomes by externally changing the ordinal opinions of certain vertices, i.e., campaigning. Since finding influential voters from the social network is computationally challenging, we propose a heuristic approach, i.e., backward influence rank (BIR). Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed BIR approach is superior to the classic greedy approach for campaigning by achieving a similar margin of victory to that of the greedy approach but running two orders of magnitude faster than the greedy approach did.},

Numerous incidents have been reported that have resulted in a substantial loss of cryptocurrency. The existing literature in this area primarily leverages traditional feature engineering or network representation learning to recover crucial information from transaction records to identify suspected users. However, these methods mainly rely on handcrafted feature engineering or conventional node representation learning from a static network while ignoring the network dynamism and inherent temporal sparsity in the user behavior that results in underperformance after an extended period. This article proposes a novel sparsity-aware tensor decomposition-based architecture: SpaTeD, which retrieves efficient user representation utilizing the evolving transaction and structural information and subsequently mitigates the temporal sparsity problem. Our model is evaluated on a real-world Ethereum phishing scam dataset and reports a significant performance improvement over the baselines (96% recall and 96% F1-score). We have conducted an extensive set of experiments to verify the temporal robustness of the model. Additionally, we have provided the ablation study to demonstrate the contribution of each component of the framework.},

In the midst of chaos and uncertainty, communities often rely on these platforms to share urgent pleas for help, extend support, and organize relief efforts. However, the overwhelming volume of conversations during such periods can escalate to unprecedented levels, necessitating the automated identification and matching of requests and offers to streamline relief operations. Additionally, there is a notable absence of studies conducted in multilingual settings despite the fact that any geographical area can have a diverse linguistic population. Therefore, we propose crisis response matcher (CReMa), a systematic approach that integrates textual, temporal, and spatial features to address the challenges of effectively identifying and matching requests and offers on social media platforms during emergencies. Our approach utilizes a crisis-specific pretrained model and a multilingual embedding space. We emulate human decision-making to compute temporal and spatial features and nonlinearly weigh the textual features. The results from our experiments are promising, outperforming strong baselines. Additionally, we introduce a novel multilingual dataset, simulating help-seeking and offering assistance on social media in 16 languages, and conduct comprehensive cross-lingual experiments. Furthermore, we analyze a million-scale geotagged global dataset to understand patterns in seeking help and offering assistance on social media.

However, the existing research predominantly focuses on platform-user interactions, often neglecting the potential for user collaboration, which is crucial for improving data quality and task efficiency. In practical applications, mobile users tend to cooperate with familiar individuals based on their preferences in sensing tasks. To tackle this issue, we introduce a novel MCS model that integrates user cooperation, significantly enhancing the system's overall effectiveness. Specifically, users’ capabilities and costs are synthesized and managed through a cooperation degree matrix. Additionally, cooperation is updated based on historical behaviors and user preferences. To incentivize user participation, currencies are employed for recruitment. Within this framework, we investigate the maximum collaborative user selection (MCUS) problem, which is dedicated to the problem of maximizing the amount of recruitment under user cooperation. The MCUS problem is proved to be an NP-hard problem and thus intractable. To address this, we propose the minimum weighted cost replacement (MWCR) algorithm. Experimental results demonstrate that the MWCR algorithm exhibits low complexity and high efficiency across various scales, making it an excellent solution for collaborative crowd recruitment.},

We apply natural language processing (NLP) techniques to analyze sentiments and emotional cues across datasets from social media and other text-based communication. Using ML, deep learning, and transfer learning models such as bidirectional encoder representations (BERTs), robustly optimized BERT approach (RoBERTa), distilled BERT (DistilBERT), and generalized autoregressive pretraining for language understanding (XLNet), we assess their ability to detect early signs of mental health concerns. The results show that BERT, RoBERTa, and XLNet consistently achieve over 95% accuracy, highlighting their strong contextual understanding and effectiveness in this application. The significance of this research lies in its potential to revolutionize mental health diagnostics by providing a scalable, data-driven approach to early detection.

  abstract     = {Role-based collaboration (RBC) theory is a promising paradigm for problem-solving in complex systems. Multigroup role assignment (MGRA) specifically tackles the task of assigning roles for multigroup collaboration. However, due to the constraint that an agent can only play a role in one group, the current MGRA models are incapable of handling when required agents outnumber the available supply. Group multirole assignment (GMRA) resolves the problem by permitting an agent to be assigned multiple roles, but it cannot address the assignment involving multiple environments-classes, agents, roles, groups, objects (E-CARGO) groups. Therefore, this article presents a comprehensive overview of the GMRA problem in multiple E-CARGO groups under various conditions, generalized as the multigroup multirole assignment (MGMRA) problem. The MGMRA problem primarily revolves around two key factors: the maximum number of roles that an agent can undertake within an E-CARGO group, and the maximum number of different roles across all E-CARGO groups, which have a significant impact on the sufficiency or necessity conditions of the algorithm as well as its performance. Therefore, a unified model and its special cases are proposed to solve the concrete assignment problems under different conditions.

  abstract     = {COVID-19 has been spreading globally from 2019 to 2022, prompting many countries to establish consistent, timely, and strict intervention policies during this period. However, the existing analysis of central epidemiological parameters (CPPs) falls short in exploring the consistency of transmission laws implied by these policies. To resolve this limitation, we propose a consistent transmission law inference framework. This framework first provides a coarse-to-fine detection method to extract outbreaks and devises an autonomous inference sliding window (ASW) algorithm to estimate the infected-case-dependent CPPs of these outbreaks. Then, we reveal consistent transmission laws through a differential analysis of the estimated CPPs. Focusing on the transmission of COVID-19 in China, a typical country with a consistent intervention policy, our model reveals remarkably consistent outbreak laws. In short, the policy controls the effective growth rate almost to zero (to a 1E-03 scale) within three days since the outbreak started. Specifically: 1) the policy was very effective at the beginning of the outbreak, leading to the exposure rate hitting the bottom on one day between the second and eleventh days and then keeping it at a plateau; 2) under large-scale nucleic acid testing and contact tracking, the incubation rate decreased and reached a plateau mainly on the third day; and 3) the recovery rate fluctuated extremely little on a 1E-03 scale, showing no significant breakthrough in COVID-19 treatment that helped the policy work. Our method can be readily adapted to other countries and SEIR epidemic.},

Despite numerous approaches being developed, many existing methods rely on centrality metrics that have inherent deficiencies and limitations. These approaches face challenges such as network sparsity and ignoring relationships between distant nodes. To address these issues, this article proposes an efficient and influential node identification approach named semilocal (SL) average shortest path with augmented graph (ASPAG). We configure the average shortest path (ASP) theory with the extended neighborhood concept to address the network sparsity problem with less complexity. The aim is to develop a SL centrality metric based on ASP that can extract a local subgraph for each node in a distributed manner. ASPAG, on the other hand, uses a combined augmented graph and the SL ASP centrality metric to improve the representation of global relationships in the network and make the most of relationships between nodes that are far apart. By leveraging local topological information and incorporating additional graph structures, our method provides a comprehensive analysis of node influence. Extensive experiments on real-world networks demonstrate that ASPAG outperforms traditional centrality metrics and other state-of-the-art techniques in terms of computational efficiency. Specifically, ASPAG improves Kendall’s τ coefficient under the susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model by 4.6% compared to the best available method.},

To address these issues, we introduce a new model called filter knowledge tracing (FKT). This innovative model incorporates a learnable filter into KT to filter out noise information from students’ exercise sequences. We redefine the input paradigm of the data, using learnable filters to perform filtering operations in its frequency domain representation space, effectively removing noise. Additionally, an attention module has been introduced in the FKT model to evaluate the impact of students’ historical interactions on their current knowledge state. To validate our model, we conduct extensive experiments utilizing four publicly available datasets.

However, we face significant challenges in isolated attribute manipulation and balancing the tradeoff between editing fidelity and facial identity preservation. Here, this article presents a novel approach to constructing an orthogonal decomposition subspace, enabling precise editing control over individual attributes with minimal impact on others and maintaining identity consistency. We introduce an adaptive weight modulation (AWM) method and a maximum slope truncation (MST) formula. The AWM method, founded on a sufficient convergent criterion, performs singular value decomposition to yield subspace parameters that preserve rich facial knowledge within the generative model, facilitating high-quality facial generation with reduced parameterization. This empowers meaningful semantic interpretation of attributes, supporting diverse editing tasks such as pose, age, and eyewear adjustments. The MST formula rigorously defines the editing bounds to effectively navigate the tradeoff between editing depth and identity retention. We also propose a guideline for deciphering the specific meanings of unsupervised semantics, potentially advancing interpretability in social behavioral studies.

  abstract     = {The devastation led by the COVID-19 pandemic was accompanied by a plethora of misinformation, laden with pseudoscience, hoaxes, and myths, often intertwined with hate speech. This phenomenon was particularly pronounced in India, where the intricate political and communal landscape provided fertile ground. The misinformation, with its elements of hate speech, posed a significant threat to societal cohesion. In response, this article delves into the dynamics of misinformation during the COVID-19 crisis in India, with a specific focus on differentiating general misinformation (GM) from hateful misinformation (HM). To this end, we construct an Indian COVID-19 misinformation dataset collected from various online social and mainstream media and analyze it from various perspectives. Mainly, we focus on temporal evolution, content and topics involved, and emotions and sentiment sensationalism of COVID-19 misinformation. We found the emotions of sadness and fear as key amplifiers of misinformation in general, with negative sentiments dominating HM. Through our comprehensive analysis, we found many such interesting insights and patterns.

Our results show that while GM is relatively easier to identify, it is challenging to detect HM. Overall, deep learning models are found to be more effective than unsupervised methods.

  abstract     = {Empathy and identity recognition are two core social interaction factors that greatly affect efficiency and effectiveness. The selection of a profile picture in social media is crucial as it serves as a visual representation of virtual identity. It not only reflects the user's personality but also influences the level of empathy and identification that others feel toward them. However, the potential impact of profile pictures with different styles (e.g., real faces, cartoon faces, and landscape images) on empathy and identity recognition is still unclear. To explore its effects, a controlled laboratory experiment and an ecological online experiment were conducted. Participants were shown a picture each time, informed to imagine interacting with the person using it as his/her profile picture, and instructed to rate an item from the basic empathy scale (BES) based on it. After rating all pictures, users then completed an identity recognition task. Results show that participants’ empathy scores for users with cartoon or real face profile pictures are greater than those with landscape profile pictures. In addition, participants performed better in identity recognition for users with real face or landscape images as profile pictures than for those with cartoon face profile pictures. Moreover, users of social media often make social categorizations (i.e., in-group/out-group categorization) based on the social identities expressed by their profile pictures. Our results also indicate that the affective empathy scale rating score was positively associated with the degree to which users of the corresponding profile pictures were categorized as in-group members.},

  abstract     = {Collaborative filtering (CF) is an essential technique in recommender systems that provides personalized recommendations by only leveraging user-item interactions. However, most CF methods represent users and items as fixed points in the latent space, lacking the ability to capture uncertainty. While probabilistic embedding is proposed to intergrate uncertainty, they suffer from several limitations when introduced to graph-based recommender systems. Graph convolutional network framework would confuse the semantic of uncertainty in the nodes, and similarity measured by Kullback–Leibler (KL) divergence suffers from degradation problem and demands an exponential number of samples. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach, called the Wasserstein dependent Graph ATtention network (W-GAT), for collaborative filtering with uncertainty. We utilize GAT and Wasserstein distance to learn Gaussian embedding for each user and item. Additionally, our method incorporates Wasserstein-dependent mutual information further to increase the similarity between positive pairs. Experimental results on three benchmark datasets show the superiority of W-GAT compared to several representative baselines. Extensive experimental analysis validates the effectiveness of W-GAT in capturing uncertainty by modeling the range of user preferences and categories associated with items.},

  abstract     = {Nowadays, shared social images often contain multiple privacy subjects, and the disclosure of these privacy subjects increases the risk of privacy violations; thus, the protection of visual privacy is particularly important. However, existing means of visual privacy protection render images unavailable and are typically protected only for images with a single privacy subject. Combining compressed sensing (CS) and 2DCS, this article proposes a multilevel visual privacy protection scheme (MLVPP) via thumbnail preservation (TPE) and key sharing (KS), which includes two stages, that is, CS-TPE multilevel encryption and KS multilevel decryption. In the first stage, we utilize 2DCS to enable the compressed sampled observations to preserve the structural similarity of the nonsensitive part and leverage CS to encrypt multiple sensitive parts of the image. The CS-processed image is then made to strike a good balance between privacy and availability through TPE. In the second stage, with the help of KS mechanism, the CS encryption keys and TPE key are shared in different combinations with the users related to the privacy subjects for meeting the MLVPP requirements. The quality of decrypted images varies for different classes of related users, e.g., unrelated users, semirelated users, and full-related users. The proposed approach preserves the visual information in the nonsensitive part of the image while providing security for the sensitive parts. Compared with related works, MLVPP reveals that the PSNR of the fully decrypted image can reach 34.04, and the SSIM is greater than 0.96 at a compression rate of 0.25. Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of MLVPP.},

Stock market prediction is a challenging task due to multiple influencing factors, its nonlinear and volatile nature, and complex interdependencies. Recent approaches have neglected the interconnections between stocks and relied on predefined static relationships. The collection of relational data is difficult to access due to confidentiality and privacy agreements for emerging economies. Moreover, these predefined relationships lack the ability to explain the latent interactions between stocks. This work proposes a data-driven end-to-end framework, dynamic relation aware relational temporal network (DR2TNet), that learns the hidden intra- and intersector associations between stock pairs and temporal patterns. A financial knowledge graph is built from historical data and is updated dynamically during the training process to reflect the interactions between the stocks according to the current market situation. We have proposed a new loss function that considers prediction loss and directional movement loss to train a model. The applicability of prediction results obtained by DR2TNet is demonstrated in the portfolio optimization problem. The results show a higher return compared to other existing baseline models.},

To effectively manage the resilience of healthcare systems, it is essential to model their working domains.

In particular, at the departmental level, the substance flow is primarily patient-centric, while at the hospital level, it includes orders, bills, and report flows. Interhospital scenarios may involve case flows and healthcare personnel movements. Therefore, this article proposes a healthcare system domain modeling framework based on the function-context-behavior-principle-state-structure (FCBPSS) tool, outlining its application in three hierarchical healthcare system levels. Unlike FCBPSS applications in other systems engineering fields, this framework not only captures the system's semantics but also encompasses ethical rules and operational standards within the healthcare system, making it an ideal tool for healthcare system domain modeling. Finally, the model's effectiveness is validated through the optimization of a case study at Sheng-Jing Hospital in Shenyang.},

The MultiSEAO-Mix is annotated with offensiveness, sentiment, emotion, and their respective intensities. Additionally, it is also annotated with author support. A multimodal, multitask framework is proposed that considers offensive detection, intensity prediction, and author support as the primary tasks and improves their performance using sentiment, emotion, and corresponding intensities as the auxiliary tasks. Further, we propose a fusion technique that captures the enhanced multimodal representation to improve the performance of our model. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed multitask framework improves the model performance by more than 4.5 points compared to multitask system without sentiment and emotion as the auxiliary tasks.},

This user-generated content (UGC) serves various purposes, including user profiling, sentiment analysis, and disease detection or tracking. Notably, researchers recognized the potential of UGC for assessing mental health due to its unobtrusive and real-time monitoring capabilities. Recent reviews on depression identification from textual UGC using AI models covered tools and techniques but overlooked critical components such as datasets, lexicons, features, and subtasks, which are essential for understanding the progress and tasks undertaken. This survey adopts a systematic approach and formulates five research questions to examine the relevant literature concerning these elements. Additionally, it organizes machine learning and deep learning (ML/DL) training features from textual UGC in a hierarchical manner and maps the literature on depression detection into various subtasks. The review highlights that despite the prevalence studies, datasets are limited in both quantity and size, with many relying on less reliable ground truth collection methods such as self-reported diagnosis statements (SRDS). Furthermore, the review identifies an overemphasis on certain textual features, such as n-grams and affective elements, while others, such as life events, egocentric graphs, and intervention/coping style, remain largely unexplored. It is crucial for practical AI depression detection systems to develop expertise in tasks such as severity, symptom detection, and explainable/interpretable depression analysis to instill confidence and trust among users.},

The number of individuals diagnosed with depression continues to rise each year. Currently, clinical practice relies entirely on self-reporting and clinical assessment, which carries the risk of subjective biases. In this article, we propose a multimodal method based on facial expression and pupil to detect depression more objectively and precisely. Our method first extracts the features of facial expressions and pupil diameter using residual networks and 1-D convolutional neural networks. Second, a cross-modal fusion model based on self-attention networks (CMF-SNs) is proposed, which utilizes cross-modal attention networks within modalities and parallel self-attention networks between different modalities to extract CMF features of facial expressions and pupil diameter, effectively complementing information between different modalities. Finally, the obtained features are fully connected to identify depression. Multiple controlled experiments show that compared to single modality, the multimodal fusion method based on self-attention networks has a higher ability to recognize depression, with the highest accuracy of 75.0%. In addition, we conducted comparative experiments under three different stimulation paradigms, and the results showed that the classification accuracy under negative and neutral stimuli was higher than that under positive stimuli, indicating a bias of depressed patients toward negative images. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our multimodal fusion method.},

  abstract     = {In the realm of e-commerce, where online shopping has become a staple of daily life, the generation of personalized product descriptions presents a unique challenge and opportunity for enhancing customer experience. Traditional retail interactions allow for personalized communication between salespersons and customers, ensuring that consumer needs are directly addressed. This level of personalization is harder to achieve online, where customers must navigate through generic, often lengthy product descriptions to make informed purchasing decisions. Recognizing the dual necessity of personalizing content to individual preferences while ensuring the descriptions remain faithful to the product's core attributes, this article introduces a novel approach, the gated pointer-generator transformer (GPGT). This framework is designed to bridge the gap between customer preferences and product features, enabling the generation of descriptions that are not only customized to the user's interests—such as emphasizing appearance for fashion-forward individuals or functionality for tech enthusiasts—but also accurately reflect the product's distinctive qualities, including brand names and technical specifications. GPGT leverages the select-attention mechanism combined with a Transformer encoder to capture the nuanced interactions between user attributes and product features, further refined by a copy mechanism during the decoding phase for the precise inclusion of specific product-related terms. Extensive experiments show that our framework substantially improves the quality of generation ($+$10.6% on ROUGE-2 and $+$15.9% on BLEU) while being more faithful to draw people's attention. The results on human evaluation, in terms of fluency, faithfulness, and personalization, also exhibit that descriptions generated by GPGT can be better accepted by real users.},

As the platforms, sellers, and consumers are the main participants and their decision-making is restricted by historical experiences and contextual conditions, they exhibit constrained rationality. Utilizing evolutionary game theory, the study constructs a tripartite game model that analyses the influence of relevant parameters on the behavior of the participants. To deal with the behaviors of the participants, we built a simulation system on MATLAB to demonstrate the effects of beginning circumstances and associated parameter adjustments on the evolution outcomes for participants. Through theoretical analysis and numerical simulation analysis, we identify that the e-commerce platforms should standardize the good faith behavior of sellers by increasing the punishment, which can reduce the malicious return behavior of consumers. Sellers can mitigate the probability of fraud by improving production technology. Consumers can improve their learning to avoid returning products. This research provides a theoretical framework and decision support for e-commerce platforms, and it also promotes the long-term growth of online transactions.},

  abstract     = {The multivariate Hawkes process (MHP) is widely used for analyzing data streams that interact with each other, where events generate new events within their own dimension (via self-excitation) or across different dimensions (via cross excitation). However, in certain applications, the timestamps of individual events in some dimensions are unobservable, and only event counts within intervals are known, referred to as partially interval-censored data. The MHP is unsuitable for handling such data since its estimation requires event timestamps. In this study, we introduce the partially censored multivariate Hawkes process (PCMHP), a novel point process that shares parameter equivalence with the MHP and can effectively model both timestamped and interval-censored data. We demonstrate the capabilities of the PCMHP using synthetic and real-world datasets. First, we illustrate that the PCMHP can approximate MHP parameters and recover the spectral radius using synthetic event histories. Next, we assess the performance of the PCMHP in predicting YouTube popularity and find that the PCMHP outperforms the popularity estimation algorithm Hawkes intensity process (HIP) [1]. Comparing with the fully interval-censored HIP, we show that the PCMHP improves prediction performance by accounting for point process dimensions, particularly when there exist significant cross-dimension interactions. Last, we leverage the PCMHP to gain qualitative insights from a dataset comprising daily COVID-19 case counts from multiple countries and COVID-19-related news articles. By clustering the PCMHP-modeled countries, we unveil hidden interaction patterns between occurrences of COVID-19 cases and news reporting.},

This study constructs a classification-based product selection method driven by online reviews to assist consumers in making purchase decisions. First, the multifaceted attribute evaluations of products are extracted from textual reviews that contain more abundant and useful information than those provided by vendors. The evaluations are modeled by probabilistic linguistic term sets such that sentiment words in texts are described at different frequencies. Then, a classification-based product selection method is developed to rank products considering multifaceted attributes in which alternative products are divided into the acceptance class, rejection class, and uncertainty class through a classification strategy. Each class of products is compared based on the performance scores calculated by a probabilistic linguistic aggregation operator. A case study of selecting laptops based on real data from Amazon.com is given to illustrate the method. Comparative analysis with existing ranking methods shows the advantages of the proposed method in matching consumers’ risk aversion behavior and preserving uncertain information.},
