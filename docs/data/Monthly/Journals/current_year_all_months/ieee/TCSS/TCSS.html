  abstract     = {Node classification tasks aim to assign labels or categories to entire graphs based on their structural properties or node attributes. It can be adopted for various types of graph systems, including but not limited to network traffic, biological networks, knowledge graphs, etc., especially to social networks. This problem is well-studied, and solutions have demonstrated significant success in numerous real-world applications. However, in the situation where emerging categories are scarce or even have no labeled data, classical methods perform poorly on the whole, which has attracted growing attention. Based on this, in this article, we divide researches for node classification in social networks into two broad categories: traditional methods and novel strategies (few-shot/zero-shot learning). In traditional node classification methods, we summarize some classical methods for both homogeneous and heterogeneous networks, which includes unsupervised classifier, matrix factorization techniques, supervised methods, random-walk, and meta-path. Meanwhile, we introduce novel methods in few-shot or zero-shot learning. The article outlines the technical principles of various methods and analyzes their performance across different classes. It further summarizes the benchmark datasets used for evaluating node classification tasks. Finally, the major opportunities, challenges, and future research directions in few-shot and zero-shot learning for node classification in graph scenarios are discussed.},

  abstract     = {Unlabeled text representation learning (UTRL), encompassing static word embeddings such as Word2Vec and contextualized word embeddings such as bidirectional encoder representations from transformer (BERT), aims to capture semantic word relationships in a low-dimensional space without the need for manual labeling. These word embeddings are invaluable for downstream tasks such as document classification and clustering. However, the surge of short texts generated daily on social media platforms results in sparse word cooccurrences, compromising UTRL outcomes. Contextualized models such as recurrent neural network (RNN) and BERT, while impressive, often struggle with predicting the next word due to sparse word sequences in short texts. To address this, we introduce CGraphNet, a contrastive graph context prediction model designed for UTRL. This approach converts short texts into graphs, establishing links between sequentially occurring words. Information from the next word and its neighbors informs the target prediction, a process referred to as graph context prediction, mitigating sparse word cooccurrence issues in brief sentences. To minimize noise, an attention mechanism assigns importance to neighbors, while a contrastive objective encourages more distinctive representations by comparing the target word with its neighbors. Our experiments demonstrate CGraphNet's superior performance over other baselines, particularly in classification and clustering tasks on real-world datasets.},

  abstract     = {Top-N recommendation systems are recognized as highly effective for delivering personalized services that cater to the varied interests of users. Nonetheless, current state-of-the-art (SOTA) analyses reveal a marked variability in their performance across users with differing levels of activity, which substantially undermines the quality of personalized recommendation services. Prevailing research tends to overlook this discrepancy, often presuming a uniform probability distribution in user preferences and employing a static model (such as a single latent vector) for user representation. This oversimplification impedes the adaptability of existing models to accommodate the spectrum of user activity levels. In our research, we introduce the variational kernel density estimation (VKDE) approach, an innovative nonparametric method designed to accurately capture the unique preference distributions of individual users. The VKDE framework integrates multiple local distributions to construct a comprehensive global preference profile for each user. We have developed a novel variational kernel function that delineates user-specific interests and constructs each local distribution accordingly. Additionally, we present a tailored sampling strategy that simplifies the complexity of the training process while preserving the efficacy of the recommendations. Empirical evaluations conducted on four widely recognized public datasets demonstrate that our VKDE model achieves superior performance over the SOTA alternatives, significantly enhancing accuracy for users with a broad range of activity levels.},

  abstract     = {Few-shot anomalous node detection in dynamic networks has been extensively investigated in the field of research. In this few-shot scenario, the detection of these anomalous nodes is particularly challenging due to the continuously evolving network topology and data distribution over time, which is known as concept drift. Concept drift refers to the phenomenon where the underlying concepts or patterns in the data generation process change over time, leading to varying data distributions across different periods. Due to these changes in data distribution, the patterns learned during training may become invalid under the new data distribution. Existing models primarily aim to enhance the representation of evolving node attributes and relationships to mitigate the impact of concept drift in few-shot scenarios. However, the scarcity of anomalous samples further limits the model's ability to learn new patterns, thereby reducing its effectiveness in addressing concept drift in few-shot scenarios. To address this challenge, we propose the multitask asynchronous metalearning framework (MAMF), which aims to mitigate bias induced by concept drift in few-shot anomalous node detection. Our framework consists of four main components: a feature extractor, an anomaly simulator, an asynchronous learner, and a type detector. The feature extractor captures the relative variations of each node in an evolving graph stream. The anomaly simulator uses generative adversarial models to learn anomaly distributions and generate samples at different time intervals. The asynchronous learner samples from various time distributions to create metatasks for anomalous node detection, allowing it to adapt to changes between these distributions. To aid in few-shot anomalous node detection, the type detector is used for anomaly type recognition. Our framework achieves AUC improvements of 5.12%, 6.87%, and 1.91% over the best existing methods on Wikipedia, Reddit, and Mooc datasets, respectively, demonstrating its effectiveness and robustness in adapting to concept drift and detecting anomalous nodes.},

  abstract     = {Healthcare social networks (HSNs) are pivotal in spreading healthcare knowledge, providing support to both potential patients and medical professionals, and enhancing healthcare services. However, identifying unseen data in HSN poses a significant challenge due to their intrinsic heterogeneity, dynamic characteristics, and the scarcity of labeled data. Employing semantic knowledge transfer for class-agnostic zero-shot recognition stands out as a promising and innovative solution to this problem, but the visual-semantic gap and domain shift problems considerably hinder advancements in zero-shot recognition capabilities. Previous zero-shot models often impose constraints between vision and semantics in the loss part without explicitly injecting intermodality guidance into the feature refinement process. This article yields a novel zero-shot recognition framework for HSN, named the dual tensor prototype graph network, devoted to improving the performance of recognizing unseen objects in HSN leveraging semantic knowledge. We have developed an iterative and interactive updating strategy for dual tensor prototype graphs, explicitly leveraging the distribution information from one modality to guide the prototype graph updates of another modality. We constrain the update process of the dual prototype graphs by several tailored loss functions and episodic training, alleviating the inconsistency between semantic and visual manifolds. Extensive comparative experiments conducted on two medical imaging datasets and five zero-shot benchmarks affirm the stronger generalization ability of our proposed method compared with other advanced approaches, showing the potential of addressing zero-shot problems in HSN.},

  abstract     = {As multilingual artificial intelligence systems proliferate, achieving robust cross-lingual understanding remains an open challenge. Recent works have made progress on visual question answering (VQA) models by pretraining on large English image-text datasets. However, there is a language gap as most models are English-centric. Existing attempts at multilingual VQA rely on machine translation or multilingual model pretraining, but cannot effectively transfer rich cross-modal knowledge from English models. In this work, we propose the cross-lingual multimodal knowledge transfer (CMKT) framework to efficiently extend English VQA models to non-English languages via knowledge distillation. Specifically, we introduce a code-mixed cross-lingual mask modeling (CCM) method to establish representations for new languages using small image-text data. We also design a multimodal knowledge distillation (MMKD) method to transfer modal understanding from English models by imitating their sequence processing. Experiments on the xGQA benchmark demonstrate that CMKT can effectively improve zero-shot learning and few-shot learning in non-English languages. Our method reduces the data and computation needed to train multilingual VQA models from scratch. The knowledge transfer paradigm enables non-English languages to inherit and generalize the intricate visual-semantic relationships learned from English. The results also show that the proposed method outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods in the zero-shot setting on the xGQA dataset.},

  abstract     = {In traditional binary classification tasks, learning algorithms conventionally distinguish positive and negative samples by leveraging fully labeled training data. However, in practical applications, there frequently arises a scenario where only a small number of positive samples and a large volume of unlabeled data exist, with the latter potentially containing a mix of positive and negative instances. This situation is known as positive-unlabeled learning (PUL) and has drawn considerable interest across various domains, such as text categorization. Despite numerous studies addressing PUL issues, few have focused on improving the two-step methodology in the data partitioning process, and even fewer have explored the application of genetic programming (GP) to PUL challenges. This article introduces a GP-based embedded unlabeled data partitioning method (EPGP) tailored for the PUL problem, particularly in the context of few-shot learning scenarios. The approach adopts a multiphase data partitioning strategy, integrating the partitioning process into the evolutionary cycle of the GP population, progressively isolating positive samples from the unlabeled data to yield a PU dataset closer to the real-world distribution. To achieve smoother data partitioning, a dynamically adjusted partitioning threshold strategy is incorporated. Finally, an ensemble method is devised, capitalizing on the high confidence associated with the originally labeled positive samples to generate the final classification outcome via weighted voting. Experimental evaluations of EPGP against other state-of-the-art PUL methods on 22 datasets show significant advantages in terms of balanced accuracy and macro-F1 scores on 17 datasets. Moreover, a case study on text data classification tasks demonstrates that EPGP consistently delivers substantial performance enhancements under varying proportions of labeled positive samples.},

Most existing models assume that network structures evolve monotonically and fail to leverage the fluctuating variation in the real world. Moreover, it is difficult to extract valuable community knowledge from previous snapshots, leading to a negative transfer to the current snapshot. In this article, we design a novel transferring strategy for dynamic community detection based on dual-population cooperation and competition. The transfer strategy guides the search by leveraging the meaningful community structures among previous snapshots based on the similarity between the current and all previous ones. Furthermore, to avoid the problem of insufficient population diversity caused by previous single-population algorithms, this article utilizes dual-population cooperative competition for multiobjective optimization. An intercooperation method effectively interchanges information according to normalized mutual information of different individuals in dual-population. Each population optimizes according to different objectives with a role-oriented teaching–learning-based optimizer to compensate for defects such as many hyperparameters, declining diversity, and insufficient convergence. Top students integrate the fine-grained strategy to mutate boundary nodes depending on embedding-based node activity; Ordinary students fuse the coarse-grained method to separate loosely connected subcommunities, while the bottom students do normal learning.

This involves encouraging representations within the same category to form clusters while ensuring those from different categories remain distinct, thus enhancing the model's classification strength. Additionally, we establish an upper limit for this loss function. This approach efficiently handles an infinite array of both similar and dissimilar sample pairs.

Effectively integrating multimodal missing data still poses significant challenges. Different combinations of missing modes can form feature sets of inconsistent dimensions and quantities. Additionally, effectively merging multimodal data requires a thorough understanding of specific modal information and intermodal interactions. The abundance of missing data can significantly reduce the sample set size, leading to learning interaction features from only a few samples. Moreover, there is a lack of clear correspondence between heterogeneous data from different sources. To address these issues, we focus our research on multimodal knowledge graph scenarios with different types of structures and content and develop a new knowledge graph embedding method. First, we use three embedding components to automatically extract feature vector representations of items from the structural content, textual content, and visual content of the knowledge graph. Then, we divide the dataset into several modal groups and model these modal groups using a multilayer network structure, with each multilayer network corresponding to a specific multimodal combination. Subsequently, we construct corresponding multilayer network projection layers and propose a two-stage GAT-based transfer learning framework for the projection layers, in which the extracted incomplete multimodal information and intermodal interaction information are integrated and mapped to a low-dimensional space. Finally, we not only theoretically prove the feasibility of the proposed method but also validate its effectiveness through extensive comparative experiments on multiple datasets.},

We consider that stabilizing the adversarial training leads to superior performance on the target domain when converging to a smooth minima with respect to task loss. Contrary to task loss, our analysis demonstrates that smooth minima convergence with respect to adversarial loss results in suboptimal generalization on the target domain.

  abstract     = {Generalized few-shot node classification (GFS-NC) is a very important challenge for graph-based algorithms, as it requires to identify novel classes and base classes simultaneously. Although there are several methods that try to combine metalearning or metric learning with graph neural networks to solve few-shot problem, most of them assume that test samples only come from the novel classes, which is impractical in reality. Besides, they overlook the relationship among classes, which can provide additional information for the novel classes classification. In this article, we propose a graph-based knowledge distillation network (GraphKD) to extract the class relationship and learn better nodes representations for nodes from novel classes in GFS-NC task. GraphKD consists of two modules: balanced pretraining module and class-relation transferring module. Balanced pretraining can optimize network parameters to a suitable manifold for subsequent initialization. The class-relation transferring module leverages a knowledge distillation model, where a teacher model generates soft labels containing interclass relationships and then transfer them to the student model. The student model is optimized to fit both the soft labels and hard labels concurrently. This relationship information can help the student model better understand the similarities and differences between classes, thereby improving its classification performance. In addition, we employee information entropy to distinguish the samples locate at the boundary of a base class and novel class and then assign them larger weights in the student model to enhance its expressive capacity for novel nodes. Our experiments show that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on various few-shot node classification datasets.},

  abstract     = {Online social networks often enforce a restricted web interface to allow third part users to access their data objects in one-by-one manner along links. The heavy cost of collecting data from them makes it very difficult to train a graph neural networks (GNNs) algorithm by using valuable data resources from those social network services. In this article, we endeavor to harness the potential of collected data in order to cultivate robust node representations, all while taking into account the prevalent class-imbalanced scenario. To this end, we propose a framework based on the reinforcement learning technique that can implement training while sampling. We employee deep Q-learning network (DQN) as the basic reinforcement learning framework which maintains an experience replay buffer to store experiences in order to improve efficiency and generalization ability of the algorithm. The proposed framework can guide the training process according to the label distribution of the currently collected training data. To maximize the utility of the collected data, we introduce two ways to guide the agent to learn more robust node representations under the natural class-imbalanced scenario. Specifically, effective-number GNNs (ENG) try to employ a reward function with the technique of effective number and resampling GNNs (RSG) attempts to modify the state transition function motivated by resampling technique. Extensive experiments are conducted on several real-world imbalanced datasets and the proposed methods significantly outperform the state-of-the-art methods in node classification task, accomplishing higher performance while utilizing a reduced volume of data.},

The essence of this task lies in acquiring features that are both discriminative and invariant across domains. One common approach to achieve this is through adversarial DG, with techniques like generative adversarial networks (GANs). However, these methods often struggle with limited intraclass diversity, hindering their generalization capabilities. To address this, we introduce the graph adversarial domain generalization (GADG) method. This novel approach, to our knowledge, is the first to incorporate graph information in DG, effectively learning domain-invariant and semantic representations. Our extensive image classification tests on benchmark datasets show that GADG not only achieves robust generalization but also surpasses existing state-of-the-art DG methods.},

  abstract     = {Stance detection on social media has become increasingly important for understanding public opinions on controversial issues. Existing methods often require large amounts of labeled data to learn target-independent transferable knowledge, which is infeasible under zero-shot settings where the target is unseen. Furthermore, most current stance detection models, primarily based on end-to-end deep learning architectures, lack transparency and may produce counter-intuitive and uninterpretable predictions. In this article, we propose a novel knowledge-augmented interpretable network (KAI) to enable zero-shot stance detection (ZSSD). First, we introduce an unsupervised approach based on large language models (LLM-KE) to elicit analysis perspectives, which is target-independent knowledge shared across different targets. This transferable knowledge bridges connections between seen and unseen targets. Second, we develop a bidirectional knowledge-guided neural production system (Bi-KGNPS) that effectively integrates such transferable knowledge through an iterative knowledge-variable binding process to guide stance predictions. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate KAI achieves new state-of-the-art performance on ZSSD. Moreover, our approach also delivers strong results on conventional in-target and cross-target stance detection. With the dual benefits of knowledge-augmented accuracy and model interpretability, this work represents an important advance toward practical stance detection systems that can generalize to emerging topics of interest. The proposed KAI framework provides an interpretable approach to effectively transfer knowledge across domains for zero-shot learning.},

The FCLFD system integrates a central server with multiple mobile users to address a diverse range of HAR challenges. The framework encompasses two pivotal elements: a contrastive student–teacher (CST) architecture with feature-based distillation and an average weight scheme (AWS). The CST framework facilitates the transfer of comprehensive knowledge from a teacher model to a student model through feature-based distillation and contrastive learning, with both models sharing an identical architecture. Each participating user periodically uploads the weights of its student model to the central server, where the AWS deployed on the server calculates the average weights based on contributions from all connected users. The aggregated weights are then redistributed to each user, who updates their teacher model accordingly. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that when 50 users are connected, the proposed FCLFD scheme obtains the highest $F_{1}$ values of 89.01 and 94.19, outperforming several state-of-the-art federated learning algorithms on the wireless sensor data mining (WISDM) and PAMAP2 datasets.},

This technology is crucial in various fields such as education and E-learning. However, deep graph clustering can be more misled by the graph topology, disregarding node information. For example, an excessive number of intercommunity edges or insufficient intracommunity edges can lead to inaccurate community distinction by the model. In this article, we propose a novel model, deep Graph Clustering with Triple Fusion Autoencoder (GC-TriFA) for community detection, which utilizes a triple encoding fusion mechanism to balance the incorporation of node and topological information, thereby mitigating this issue. Specifically, GC-TriFA employs a shallow linear coding fusion and a deep coding fusion method within an autoencoder structure. This approach enables the model to simultaneously learn and capture the embedding of cross-modality information and later utilizes weight fusion to equalize the two modalities. Furthermore, GC-TriFA also reconstructs the graph structure, learns relaxed $k$-means, and undergoes self-supervised training to enhance the quality of the graph embedding. The experimental results of GC-TriFA, when evaluated as an end-to-end model on publicly available datasets, demonstrate its superiority compared to the baseline models.},

How to cope with these risks is a constant topic in the evolution of humankind. The impact of various characteristics of risk on the risk-resistance outcomes has been well studied, including the probability, intensity and spread of risks. However, as an additional dimension independent of the above main characteristics, risk-resistance solutions that are appropriate to the risk have not received sufficient attention. We abstract this characteristic as the relative cost-effectiveness between collective solution and individual solution in resisting a risk and name it communality. Taking communality and intensity as the two main characteristics of risk, we propose a risk-resistance model and explore the critical impact of risk communality on the outcomes of risk resistance. Using numerical analysis, we map the state transition of the population on a two-dimensional surface consisting of communality and intensity. Simulation experiments validate the results from numerical analysis and reveal four regions in this surface, each of which corresponds to a governance structure endogenous to the population. The complex impact of population-endogenous governance structures on the risk-resistance outcomes reflects the real-world challenges of risk governance. This article suggests that social governors need to implement different logics in the face of risks with different communalities.},

This problem has applications in various fields such as social networks, viral marketing, advertisements, and political campaigns, where understanding and exploiting network dynamics lead to effective strategies to promote behaviors, products, or ideas. The goal is to strategically select seed nodes to maximize the overall impact or adoption of an idea, behavior, or product in the network. Most of the existing IM algorithms give equal cost to selecting nodes and maximizing the active nodes, which overlook the number of influenced communities. To make it applicable to real-world applications, this article presents a diversified budgeted influence maximization (DBIM) algorithm for dynamic social networks. The DBIM algorithm considers the different costs of the nodes and maximizes the number of communities. This work proposes an objective function for diversification and presents an algorithm that finds the seed set utilizing the suggested strategy. Further, we show the monotone, submodular, and NP-hardness properties of the objective function. The proposed work experimentally shows the results on eight datasets and concludes that the proposed algorithm outperforms the activated nodes and the number of communities on all the datasets.},

Detecting implicit hate speech poses a significant challenge due to its subtle expressions and the critical role of context in its identification. In response to this challenge, we have fine-tuned BERT and DistilBERT models on three publicly available datasets: Toxigen, Implicit Gab, and the Implicit Hate Corpus (IHC). Our approach involves meticulous data preprocessing, customized model configurations, and strategic hyperparameter optimization, all tailored to enhance the models’ performance in binary, 3-way, and 7-way implicit hate detection. We observed notable improvements in the detection capabilities of our proposed work. To enhance the explainability of model behavior, we visualized attention mechanisms, including attention heads and compatibility scores, using tools such as BertViz, local interpretable model-agnostic explanations (LIME), and Shapley additive explanations (SHAP). This facilitated the clear interpretation of model decisions. We developed a software application called HateFusion, which integrates our fine-tuned models with an intuitive graphical interface. The application includes a flagging option that allows users or moderators to mark highly hateful content, supporting continuous model refinement and updates. Our proposed model achieved the highest macro-weighted F1 scores across multiple datasets. On the IHC dataset (for 2-, 3-, and 7-way classification tasks), it achieved F1 scores of 0.75, 0.73, and 0.61 with DistilBERT, and 0.77, 0.72, and 0.60 with BERT.

This article takes robotic process automation (RPA) technology as an example to construct a tripartite game relationship involving enterprise employees, technology service platforms, and enterprise leaders in the introduction of artificial intelligence technology. It explores the factors influencing the strategic choices of each party and summarizes the mechanisms underlying these strategic choices. Research findings indicate that 1) in the tripartite evolutionary game introduced by AI technology, three relatively stable equilibrium states exist; 2) when all participants have the same initial intentions, the degree of strategy evolution for each participant varies under different circumstances. The initial intentions of enterprise employees significantly influence their choices 3) participants’ strategy choices are significantly influenced by various factors related to the adoption and management of RPA technology. These factors include the benefits employees gain from adopting RPA technology and the incentives provided by leadership for employees to use RPA technology. Consequently, we recommend that firms implement targeted promotional activities and incentive measures, integrating RPA technology adoption into their overarching strategy. This approach aims to enhance the initial willingness of all strategic stakeholders, ensuring the stability of AI technology adoption, particularly within SMEs.},

First, the dynamic behavior of the production-inventory quantity of two different level factories is modeled by the ordinary differential equations. Second, the issue of inconsistent production rates among different factories is considered, and the singular perturbation theory is introduced to describe the phenomenon. In addition, to deal with the bullwhip effect caused by the variation of order demand and the phenomenon of inaccurate inventory levels caused by misplacing and theft, the $\mathscr{H}_{\infty}$ control strategy is considered to improve the system's robustness. Then, the finite-time boundedness of the production-inventory system is analyzed by combining it with the Lyapunov control theory, and the theorem is given to ensure that the dynamic change of the factory inventory is bounded and controllable. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by a simulation example of the potassium carbonate production process in a chemical plant.},

The proposed BlenderBot-ThTra involves the following three training processes: fine-tuning with supplemental feedback utterance, fine-tuning with auxiliary situation restoration, and calibration with the helpfulness estimation. The first stage aims to intensify the backbone's perception of conversational context, the second stage propels the backbone into excavating the causes of the emotional distress faced by the seeker. In the third stage, we leverage a Bayesian method based on the seeker's feedback scores to train a helpfulness evaluation model, then exploit a contrastive learning method to calibrate the ESC backbone. We conduct experiments on the standard multiturn ESC dataset, and the results demonstrate that BlenderBot-ThTra has a significant advantage in generating more supportive and adaptive responses.},

  abstract     = {Existing solutions for rumor containment typically model social networks as regular graphs, focusing solely on dyadic relationships between pairs of individuals. However, these solutions overlook the crowd influence, which arises from higher order relationships involving multiple individuals. This crowd influence is a distinct concept that cannot be substituted by the cumulative effect of individual influences through dyadic relationships. Therefore, it is important to consider the impact of crowd influence when modeling influence diffusion in the network. Moreover, traditional rumor containment methods lack generalization capacity. These methods require complete reexecution of algorithms whenever the target network changes, rendering them less efficient. In this work, we model the network as a hypergraph to effectively capture the crowd influence through higher order social relationships. We propose RCDRL-H, a deep reinforcement learning framework capable of constructing a trained model for containing rumors in previously unseen networks. Additionally, we introduce hyper-structure2vec, a node embedding technique for hypergraphs, and an efficient rumor containment estimation function that eliminates the need for computationally expensive Monte Carlo simulations during training.

  abstract     = {3-D printing, or additive manufacturing (AM), leverages 3-D computer-aided design models and numerical control to produce objects layer-by-layer, playing a key role in Industry 4.0 and Industry 5.0. Despite its potential to revolutionize manufacturing by creating complex structures more efficiently and cost-effectively, 3-D printing still faces quality issues due to a lack of sufficient data, resulting in improper process parameter settings and poor analyzability. This work introduces a data-driven and physics-assisted machine learning (DP-ML) approach for a 3-D-printed BeltClip object, integrating finite element analysis (FEA) and physics-informed machine learning (PIML). The proposed DP-ML framework provides a cost-effective and time-efficient data collection method using Digimat-AM and a warpage classification algorithm. The data collection begins with obtaining the STereoLithography (STL) file of the BeltClip object from Thingiverse and slicing it in Ultimaker©  Cura, considering process parameters such as infill amount, toolpath pattern, layer height, print speed, and extrusion temperature. The resulting G-code file is then input into Digimat-AM for further parameter setting and analysis. In Digimat-AM, glass fiber-filled and unfilled material types are set, undergoing the virtual 3-D printing process, followed by a warpage analysis of the printed BeltClip. The collected 3-D printing data is used to build ML models—deep neural network (DNN), decision tree (DT), support vector machine (SVM), logistic regression (LR), and random forest. The DNN contains three architectures—DNN-1, DNN-2, and DNN-3. Based on the metrics of precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy, DNN-3 outperforms the others and is chosen for the warpage classification algorithm. The presented DP-ML approach is compared with the state-of-the-art methods and shows a promising capability to predicting warpage, optimizing process parameters, and improving the overall quality and efficiency of a 3-D-printed BeltClip.},

Finally, the development of ParallelWorkforce across various key applications of smart manufacturing is demonstrated, including autonomous transportation, task assignment, and worker management.

This research article implements the HDL-Fuzzy-RMDL model, which includes hierarchical deep learning for text classification, fuzzy sets, and random multimodel deep learning for multipolarity-based sentimental classification.

Existing methods rely on features extracted from external resources and are tested on data from either Twitter or Reddit; therefore, their generalizability and transferability are unproven. In this work, we present MASK-Net, which masks disease or symptom terms and relies on the context of a post.

  abstract     = {The $k$-plex is a popular definition of communities in networks, offering more flexibility than cliques by allowing each node to miss up to $k$ connections. However, finding $k$-plexes in large graphs is a theoretically challenging task due to the large number of possible $k$-plexes. In this article, we propose a novel approach for detecting $k$-plexes under various sizes and time constraints using an automated strategy to learn bounds, called the constraint learning and bounding (CLB) method. Specifically, our proposed CLB approach, leverages the concept of constraint learning to develop a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) instance as a model to learn a bounding strategy in the branch-and-bound process. The variables in the MILP instances correspond to the natural properties of the $k$-plex problem. Unlike previous works, we focus on learning the bounding strategy rather than learning the branching strategy. Thus, the strategy learned by our proposed approach avoids visiting infeasible solutions, which accelerates the branch-and-bound algorithm and reduces the computational load. To evaluate our approach, we conduct experiments on various real graphs to validate the superiority and the generality of our proposed approach. In summary, our approach offers an effective and efficient solution for detecting $k$-plexes under various conditions.},

  abstract     = {Civil unrest, a major trouble in the country's progress, requires timely detection and prevention. It causes numerous major issues, including loss of life and injury, resource depletion, political instability, and violations of human rights. Automating the early warning civil unrest event prediction with social media data becomes critically important. Existing baseline methods through text datasets obtained from social media have shown promising results. However, most existing baseline methods are domain-specific and lacking in robustness and generalization. As of now, there has been less work done addressing these issues in civil unrest event prediction. To overcome these limitations, this article presents a novel method as CUP_CDLSTM by combining the convolutional neural network-long short-term memory (CNN-LSTM) model and the pretrained distilBERT model to predict civil unrest event prediction using social media data. First, the proposed CUP_CDLSTM model utilizes the LSTM model to learn temporal features followed by CNN utilized to learn spatial features from the correlation matrix of different features. DistilBERT is utilized to generate weighted word embedding to advance the contextual features. The proposed CUP_CDLSTM model is trained with two datasets of different geographical locations for predicting civil unrest events which include spatial, temporal, and event weights as input features. The proposed CUP_CDLSTM model outperforms the baseline methods by up to 5% on both the Hong Kong protest dataset and the black lives matter (BLM) protest dataset in terms of accuracy. It has shown significantly faster training and inference times than existing baseline models.},

However, existing data aggregation protocols employing techniques such as homomorphic encryption, masking, or differential privacy fail to deliver these features concurrently. To address this challenge, we propose a novel lightweight privacy-preserving data aggregation scheme based on proxy reencryption and asymmetric scalar product-preserving encryption, in which encryption operations only involve addition and multiplication over the integer field, thus avoiding time-consuming exponentiation and pairing operations and achieving lightweight computation. Furthermore, through the use of an asymmetric scalar-product-preserving encryption scheme, we effectively align aggregation policies while maintaining the privacy of power consumption data. Finally, when compared to three recent data aggregation schemes with analogous structures, experimental results demonstrate that our proposed scheme outperforms others regarding computational and communication overheads, thus enhancing its efficiency.},

The inherent ambiguity of emotion labels poses challenges for conventional supervised representation learning methods. Moreover, directly learning the mapping from a facial expression image to an emotion label lacks explicit supervision signals for capturing fine-grained facial features. In this article, we propose a novel FER model, named poker face vision transformer or PF-ViT, to address these challenges. PF-ViT aims to separate and recognize the disturbance-agnostic emotion from a static facial image by generating its corresponding poker face without the need for paired images. Inspired by the facial action coding system, we regard an expressive face as the combined result of a set of facial muscle movements on one's poker face (i.e., an emotionless face). PF-ViT utilizes vanilla vision transformers, and its components are first pretrained as masked autoencoders on a large facial expression dataset without emotion labels, yielding excellent representations. Subsequently, we train PF-ViT using a GAN framework. During training, the auxiliary task of poke face generation promotes the disentanglement between emotional and emotion-irrelevant components, guiding the FER model to holistically capture discriminative facial details. Quantitative and qualitative results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, surpassing the state-of-the-art methods on four popular FER datasets.},

The successful execution of these complex tasks relies on task decomposition (TD) and allocation, with the former being a prerequisite for the latter. Recently, pretrained language models-based methods have garnered significant attention. However, they are constrained to handling straightforward common-sense tasks due to their inherent restrictions involving limited and difficult-to-update knowledge as well as the presence of “hallucinations.” To address these issues, we propose a retrieval-augmented generation-based crowdsourcing framework that reformulates TD as event detection from the perspective of natural language understanding. However, the existing detection methods fail to distinguish differences between event types and always depend on heuristic rules and external semantic analyzing tools. Therefore, we present a prompt-based contrastive learning framework for TD (PBCT), which incorporates a prompt-based trigger detector to overcome dependence. Additionally, trigger-attentive sentinel and masked contrastive learning are designed to provide varying attention to trigger and contextual features according to different event types. Extensive experiment results demonstrate our method is highly competitive in both supervised and zero-shot detection. A case study on printed circuit board design and manufacturing is used to validate its adaptability and scalability in unfamiliar professional domains.},

The preference, based on ordered preference statements, is influenced by the authenticity and the order of preference statements. Owing to ambiguous evidence and incomplete information in complex real-world conflicts, it is of great difficulty to determine crisp preference over states for DMs. Some uncertain preferences have been introduced to cope with two situations that uncertain about preference statements authenticity or prioritization. The belief structure can be used to capture vagueness or unknown in subjective judgments. In this article, we propose a belief option prioritization technique by considering two situations of preference statements to elicit preferences comprehensively and efficiently. First, a belief structure is applied to describe the uncertainty of preference statement authenticity. The belief degree represents the accuracy of each preference statement and the real preference attitude of a DM. Second, a belief distribution, associated with an ordered sequence of preference statements, is used to capture the uncertainty on the prioritization of preference statements. The belief preference over feasible states can be obtained by the scoring scheme of option prioritization based on the ordered preference statements. Last, we propose an overall belief option prioritization technique by combining two uncertain situations. The application of Gisborne Lake water export conflict is utilized to illustrate the use of belief option prioritization.},

  abstract     = {The task of node classification based on graph convolutional networks (GCNs) is widely applied in many social media and e-commerce websites. In this context, rich node labels undoubtedly play a very important role. However, existing methods fail to generate high-quality pseudolabels that serve as a potential solution to alleviate label scarcity on graphs and reduce time-consuming annotation issues. Moreover, it is an interesting problem to boost the performance of GCNs with feature interaction and propagation. To tackle these limitations, we propose a new pseudolabels generation and feature interaction propagation based GCN, named PF-GCN. Specifically, the proposed PF-GCN first generates high-quality pseudolabels to enlarge the input set of node labels. Meanwhile, it fully exploits the information of feature interactions to enhance our PF-GCN model. We then present a straightforward yet highly effective cross-layer approach which is equipped with feature transformation to encode feature interaction at each layer. Finally, we propagate feature interactions through both topology space and feature space, and then employ an adaptive attention mechanism to learn rich node embeddings. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed PF-GCN outperforms several state-of-the-art methods in the extensive evaluations of node classification. We have released the source codes of PF-GCN for public usage and evaluation at https://github.com/ZZY-GraphMiningLab/PF-GCN.},

  abstract     = {Cross-domain speech emotion recognition (SER) has received increasing attention in recent years. Existing transfer subspace learning and regression-based SER methods have the following drawbacks. The features in the subspace are still insufficiently representative and discriminative, and direct regression would lead to information loss. To address these problems, we present a novel common discriminative latent space learning (CDLSL) method for cross-domain SER. To be specific, we first obtain a common latent space by imposing a projection matrix on the cross-domain data. Meanwhile, we impose an uncorrelated constraint on the projection matrix to ensure that the features are representative and discriminative after dimension reduction. Then, we implement a graph regularization term on the latent representations of the samples to capture the local similarity information. Furthermore, to obtain a more discriminative common latent space, we introduce the label information by aligning the latent space with the relaxed label space, while mitigating the information loss for regression. Extensive experimental results validate the superiority of the proposed method over the state-of-the-art competitors.},

  abstract     = {The rapid evolution of the Internet of Underwater Things (IoUT) has led to the widespread adoption of autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV)-assisted underwater acoustic sensor networks (UASNs) for various applications such as marine environment monitoring and resource exploration. This article introduces an energy-balanced data collection scheme tailored for AUV-supported UASNs. The proposed scheme combines a node clustering method based on a social welfare function and an intelligent path planning strategy for the AUV. The node clustering approach integrates canopy and K-means algorithms for initial node clustering, followed by reclustering using an enhanced hierarchical clustering algorithm. To balance energy distribution, Atkinson's social welfare function is employed to select and rotate cluster heads (CHs) within each cluster. To address limited CH memory constraints, a lossless compression technique is introduced to reduce data storage requirements at the CHs. Moreover, the article introduces the use of the deep Q-network (DQN) technique for AUV path planning, considering multiple pertinent factors simultaneously. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed data collection scheme effectively reduces energy consumption, prolongs network lifespan, and enhances data collection efficiency when compared to recent research endeavors.},

The integration of social networks and scientific communication has dissolved the central focus of scientific communication, moving toward a more diversified subject centered around the public networks. Due to the special nature of science communication, the key nodes in the community network often play a crucial role. Specifically, by identifying key nodes and analyzing the trend of grouping them into clusters, the stability and robustness of the complex network of science communication can be significantly improved. This is of great significance for expanding the influence of science communication and attracting relevant practitioners to join. However, the sensitive attributes and potential influence factors of community network nodes can lead to deviations in key node mining using existing algorithms.

To address these limitations, we employ graph neural networks (GNNs) to learn node representations in exercise recommendation contexts and propose a new knowledge tracing-enhanced multitask exercise recommendation framework, called MLKT4Rec. Unlike previous graph-based approaches that focus on explicitly observed relationships in the data, we use implicit edges to augment the graph structure and incorporate exercise difficulty attributes, relative time intervals, and location coding to enrich the exercise representation. Based on this, we construct a knowledge tracing model to capture students’ knowledge levels and integrate it into the exercise sequential recommendation process for joint multitask training.

To overcome the challenge of modeling type hierarchy in vector space, this article proposes for the first time to model the type hierarchy in high-dimensional box space. In addition, previous approaches focus more on the influence of the context of entity mentions, while neglecting the influence of entity mentions themselves. Based on the above challenges, we present a new approach called THBox, which not only successfully boosts the influence of entity mentions but also models the type hierarchy well. To verify the effectiveness of the method presented in this article, experimental results on three publicly available fine-grained entity typing benchmark datasets are provided to verify that the presented method is a new state-of-the-art solution for fine-grained entity typing.},

Research on this incident has important practical significance for predicting and intervening in the evolution of similar hot incidents. In this article, the case of Messi's absence from the Hong Kong match is delved into. A stance detection method and a quantification approach for stance divergence have been devised to analyze the evolution of the stance surrounding the incident. Furthermore, by examining topic clusters over time, the topical progression of public stances is tracked. Findings reveal that nearly 60% of posts expressed an explicit stance throughout the incident, with the majority (66.9%) taking an opposing stance. Additionally, it was noted that the topics discussed at various stages followed a long-tail distribution, indicating that most discussions revolved around a few dominant themes. Within more segmented and specific topics, stance divergences were often more prominent.},

  abstract     = {Event-aware information flow security in cyber–physical systems (CPSs) emphasizes the correlation among events. Event-aware noninterference is a security property capable to describe such a correlation. In light of the event-aware noninterference assessment problem, system modeling is a common means, and many studies have been done on such a problem by using formal modeling tools, i.e., Petri nets (PNs), at present. However, classical PNs suffer from the lack of modeling for patterns with semantic sharing of events, which can be modeled by labeled PNs (LPNs). In this article, we present the concept of semantics-based noninterference for the CPSs modeled by LPNs and focus on the assessment problem of semantics-based noninterference properties represented by semantics-based strong nondeterministic noninterference (SNNI) and extended bisimulation SNNI (EBSNNI). To this end, we first give the formal definitions of semantics-based SNNI and EBSNNI. Then, we analyze the assessment mechanisms of them according to the characteristics of semantic sharing of events in LPNs. On this basis, we provide the semantics-based noninterference assessment method involving the coarse and fine assessments to reveal the event-aware security of CPSs. Finally, a case study is provided to explain the significance of our research and the effectiveness of our method.},

However, modern sentiment analysis models using deep learning lack explainability, acting as black box and limiting trust. This study focuses on improving the explainability of sentiment analysis models of social media platforms by leveraging explainable artificial intelligence (XAI). We propose a novel explainable sentiment analysis (XSA) framework incorporating intrinsic and posthoc XAI methods, i.e., local interpretable model-agnostic explanations (LIME) and counterfactual explanations. Specifically, to solve the problem of lack of local fidelity and stability in interpretations caused by the LIME random perturbation sampling method, a new model-independent interpretation method is proposed, which uses the isometric mapping virtual sample generation method based on manifold learning instead of LIMEs random perturbation sampling method to generate samples. Additionally, a generative link tree is presented to create counterfactual explanations that maintain strong data fidelity, which constructs counterfactual narratives by leveraging examples from the training data, employing a divide-and-conquer strategy combined with local greedy. Experiments conducted on social media datasets from Twitter, YouTube comments, Yelp, and Amazon demonstrate XSAs ability to provide local aspect-level explanations while maintaining sentiment analysis performance. Analyses reveal improved model explainability and enhanced user trust, demonstrating XAIs potential in sentiment analysis of social media platforms. The proposed XSA framework provides a valuable direction for developing transparent and trustworthy sentiment analysis models for social media platforms.},

  abstract     = {Social media platforms such as Weibo and TikTok have become more influential than traditional media. Sentiment in social media comments reflects users’ attitudes and impacts society, making sentiment analysis (SA) crucial. AI driven models, especially deep-learning models, have achieved excellent results in SA tasks. However, most existing models are not interpretable enough. First, deep learning models have numerous parameters, and their transparency is insufficient. People cannot easily understand how the models extract features from input data and make sentiment judgments. Second, most models lack intuitive explanations. They cannot clearly indicate which words or phrases are key for emotion prediction. Moreover, extracting sentiment factors from comments is challenging because a comment often contains multiple sentiment characteristics. To address these issues, we propose a dual-branch combination network (DCN) for SA of social media short comments, achieving both word-level and sentence-level interpretability. The network includes a key word feature extraction network (KWFEN) and a key word order feature extraction network (KWOFEN). KWFEN uses popular emotional words and SHAP for word-level interpretability. KWOFEN employs position embedding and an attention layer to visualize attention weights for sentence-level interpretability. We validated our method on the public dataset weibo2018 and TSATC. The results show that our method effectively extracts positive and negative sentiment factors, establishing a clear mapping between model inputs and outputs, demonstrating good interpretability performance.},

By analyzing the maximum Influence of sentiment propagation, we can gain a better understanding of how network group events arise and evolve. Influence maximization (IM) is a critical fundamental issue in the field of informatics, whose purpose is to identify the collection of individuals and maximize the specific information's influence in real-world social networks, and the sentiments expressed by nodes with the greatest influence can significantly impact the emotions of the entire group. The IM issue has been established to be an NP-hard (nondeterministic polynomial) challenge. Although some methods based on the greedy framework can achieve ideal results, they bring unacceptable computational overhead, while the performance of other methods is unsatisfactory. In this article, we explicate the IM problem and design a local influence evaluation function as the objective function of the IM to estimate the influence spread in the cascade diffusion models. We redefine particle parameters, update rules for IM problems, and introduce learning automata to realize multiple search modes. Then, we propose a multisearch particle Swarm optimization algorithm (MSPSO) to optimize the objective function. This algorithm incorporates a heuristic-based initialization strategy and a local search scheme to expedite MSPSO convergence. Experimental results on five real-world social network datasets consistently demonstrate MSPSO's superior efficiency and performance compared with baseline algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Multimodal sentiment analysis (MSA) integrates multiple sources of sentiment information for processing and has demonstrated superior performance compared to single-modal sentiment analysis, making it widely applicable in domains such as human–computer interaction and public opinion supervision. However, current MSA models heavily rely on black-box deep learning (DL) methods, which lack interpretability. Additionally, effectively integrating multimodal data, reducing noise and redundancy, as well as bridging the semantic gap between heterogeneous data remain challenging issues in multimodal DL. To address these challenges, we propose an interpretable multimodal Tucker fusion model with information filtering (IMTFMIF). We are the first to utilize the multimodal Tucker fusion model for MSA tasks. This approach maps multimodal data into a unified tensor space for fusion, effectively reducing modal heterogeneity and eliminating redundant information while maintaining interpretability. Furthermore, mutual information is employed to filter out task-irrelevant information and explain the association between input and output from an information flow perspective. We propose a novel approach to enhance the comprehension of multimodal data and optimize model performance in MSA tasks. Finally, extensive experiments conducted on three public multimodal datasets demonstrate that our proposed IMTFMIF achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, more and more scholars have begun to focus on sentiment analysis on social media. Current sentiment analysis collects all relevant data, including public thoughts, opinions, and feelings, from a variety of open sources. In addition, it automatically predicts different aspects of outcomes or trends based on information collected globally in real time. This research area explores how to extract sentiment information from different modalities (e.g., text, images, and audio). However, the currently existing techniques face several challenges. It is difficult to achieve effective interaction with completely heterogeneous data, and these techniques cannot adequately guarantee data security during data interaction, which is particularly important when dealing with sensitive information. Therefore, this article introduces existing methods for protecting data privacy. Based on this foundation, we propose a novel algorithm called collaborative dynamic hierarchical federated learning with hypernetwork aggregation (CDHFL-HA), which is suitable for sentimental analysis. CDHFL-HA ensures that the data remain local to each participant while leveraging the data similarity between participants on the server and processing interference data on the participant to enhance the accuracy of the current sentimental analysis. In addition, an essential aspect considered in the proposed algorithm is explainability. Understanding the decisions and predictions made by sentiment analysis models is crucial for gaining trust and acceptance in real-world applications. CDHFL-HA incorporates explainability features, providing insights into the decision-making process, thus enhancing the interpretability of sentiment analysis results. Numerous experimental results show that the algorithm outperforms existing algorithms in complex scenarios, with a minimum accuracy of 0.6007 and a maximum of 0.9962. In addition, it can be seen from the experimental results in this article, that the communication parameters in the experiments are similar to those of other federated learning, while the number of training rounds is improved by up to 50% (i.e., 20 rounds faster) relative to other algorithms.},

  abstract     = {With the development of Internet technology, deepfake (DF) videos can spread rapidly through online platforms, providing a new way of cyberbullying by generating nude pictures of female victims and using their faces to generate pornographic movies, which bring potential harm to individuals, society, and the country. Recently, there have been some really impressive results with DF detection models. These models have shown excellent outstanding performance when they are trained and tested using data from the same dataset. However, detecting DF remains difficult when the data comes from challenging datasets. To address this issue, this article aims to enhance the model's generalization by taking full advantage of the learning and representation capabilities of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to adaptively suppress image texture information and catch deeper and more universal forgery features. Specifically, we introduce the texture suppression module (TSM) as a first step to suppress image content while simultaneously revealing the differences between authentic and tampered regions. Then, we carefully designed the cross stream interaction module (CSIM) and the cross stream mix block (CSMB) module to fully exploit the extracted forgery traces. Our proposed model has demonstrated superior generalization performance in extensive experiments.},

  abstract     = {Distributed learning empowers social media platforms to handle massive data for image sentiment classification and deliver intelligent services. However, with the increase of privacy threats and malicious activities, three major challenges are emerging: securing privacy, alleviating straggler problems, and mitigating Byzantine attacks. Although recent studies explore coded computing for privacy and straggler problems, as well as Byzantine-robust aggregation for poisoning attacks, they are not well-designed against both threats simultaneously. To tackle these obstacles and achieve an efficient Byzantine-robust and straggler-resilient distributed learning framework, in this article, we present Byzantine-robust and cost-effective distributed machine learning (BCML), a codesign of coded computing and Byzantine-robust aggregation. To balance the Byzantine resilience and efficiency, we design a cosine-similarity-based Byzantine-robust aggregation method tailored for coded computing to filter out malicious gradients efficiently in real time. Furthermore, trust scores derived from similarity are published to the blockchain for the reliability and traceability of social users. Experimental results show that our BCML can tolerate Byzantine attacks without compromising convergence accuracy with lower time consumption, compared with the state-of-the-art approaches. Specifically, it is 6x faster than the uncoded approach and 2x faster than the Lagrange coded computing (LCC) approach. Besides, the cosine-similarity-based aggregation method can effectively detect and filter out malicious social users in real time.},

  abstract     = {The interactive attention graph convolution network (IAGCN), a novel model proposed in this article, will revolutionize aspect-level sentiment analysis (SA). IAGCN effectively addresses these key features, in contrast to prior research that ignored the meaning of aspect terms and their relationship with context. The model combines a modified dynamic weighting layer with bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) to accurately acquire context. It takes use of graph convolutional networks (GCNs) to encrypt syntactic information from the syntactic dependency tree. Furthermore, a method for interactive attention is employed to discover the intricate relationships between context and aspect terms, which results in the reconstruction of those terms' representations. Comparing the proposed IAGCN model to baseline models, impressive gains are made. Across five datasets, the model beats previous methods with an amazing improvement in F1 scores that ranges from 1.34% to 4.04% and an impressive improvement in accuracy that ranges from 0.56% to 1.75%. Additionally, the IAGCN model outperforms the global vectors (GloVe)-based strategy when the potent pretrained model bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT) is included in the challenge, resulting in even greater improvements. The F1 score considerably increases from 2.59% to 7.55%, and accuracy increases from 1.47% to 3.95%, making the IAGCN model a standout performer in aspect-level SA.},

  abstract     = {Many people have been severely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, which has caused intense anxiety, fear, and complex feelings or emotions. People's emotions have changed and become more complicated since coronavirus vaccinations were introduced. Sentiment analysis of COVID-19 vaccination is critical for understanding public perception, vaccine hesitancy, monitoring vaccine impact, identifying adverse reactions, making policies, and allocating resources. Some artificial intelligence (AI)-based systems have been reported in the literature to analyze the sentiment of COVID-19 vaccination. However, most of them are end-to-end models that require explanation for their results in identifying COVID-19 vaccination sentiment. An explainable AI-based model can improve decision-making, transparency, and interpretability. It can enable users to comprehend how the model makes predictions and the factors that influence the outcome. Therefore, this study suggests a COVID-Twitter-BERT and LSTM (CT-BERT-LSTM) staking that is explicable for determining people's views on the COVID-19 vaccination. The prediction of the proposed CT-BERT-LSTM model is then examined to determine where the suggested system successfully learned the context of the tweet and where it failed to do so. The proposed CT-BERT-LSTM model performed exceptionally well and outperformed the existing models with a $F_{1}$-score of 0.88 in the sentiment identification of the COVID-19 vaccination.},

  abstract     = {The prediction of remaining execution time is a critical area of research in business process monitoring. However, limited data availability and deficiencies in existing models have hindered progress in this area. To address these challenges, we introduce two production log datasets, coarse-grained log for television (CGL-TV) and fine-grained log for television (FGL-TV), collected from a semiautomated assembly line for television manufacturing. These datasets aim to address the issue of data scarcity in monitoring, analyzing, and optimizing the manufacturing process. Then, we investigate the significance of role information in semiautomated production processes and propose a novel feature selection strategy. That strategy replaces the traditional activity attributes with role attributes as the basis for prediction, resulting in a significant improvement in prediction accuracy. Furthermore, existing recurrent neural network (RNN)-based prediction methods have two major drawbacks: limited ability to capture long-term dependencies and the inability to parallelize computations. To address these issues, we propose a novel transformer-based remaining time prediction (TRTP) model. This model utilizes the self-attention mechanism instead of hidden state passing, which effectively incorporates global contextual information and enables potential parallel computing. The experimental results across four datasets demonstrate that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance, e.g., a 5.2% performance gain on FGL-TV.},

  abstract     = {As one representative framework of self-supervised learning (SSL), contrastive learning (CL) has drawn enormous attention in the representation learning area. By pulling together a “positive” example and an anchor, as well as pushing away many “negative” examples from the anchor, CL is able to generate high-quality representations for the data of different modalities. Therefore, the qualities of selected positive and negative examples are critical for the performance of CL-based models. However, due to the assumption of label unavailability, most existing work follows the paradigm of contrastive instance discrimination, which treats each input instance as an individual category. Therefore, they focused more on positive example generation and designed plenty of data augmentation strategies. For negative examples, they just leverage the in-batch negative sampling strategy. We argue that this negative sampling strategy will easily select false negatives and inhibit the capability of CL, which we also believe is one of the reasons why a large size of negatives is needed in CL. Apart from using annotated labels, we try to tackle this problem in an unsupervised manner. We propose to integrate expectation maximization (EM) into the selection of negative examples and develop a novel EM-enhanced negative sampling strategy (EMCRL) to distinguish false negatives from true ones for CL performance improvement. Specifically, EMCRL employs EM to estimate the distribution of ground-truth relations between each sample and corresponding in-batch negatives and then optimizes model parameters with the estimations. Considering the sensitivity of EM algorithm to the parameter initialization, we propose to add a random flip into the distribution estimation to enhance the robustness of the learning process. Extensive experiments over several advanced models on sentence representation and image representation tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of EMCRL. Our method is easy to implement, and the code is publicly available at https://github.com/zhangkunzk/EMCRL_pytorch.},

Specifically, we introduce a rating-oriented disentangled representation learning that segments representations and rating graph based on ratings. It also employs an explicit graph learning approach to ensure the independence of disentangled representations during information propagation, which mitigates noise from review features. Furthermore, we define and model one kind of cross-rating correlation, based on the characteristics of user rating behavior. By leveraging this approach, we introduce a cross-rating constraint as an additional task to further enhance the independence among disentangled representations and improve the stability of model training.

Specifically, the temporal social network embedding method is employed to learn dynamic representations of node and node's interaction relationships from the evolutionary network by preserving both the explicit structural proximity information and implicit multiview association information. The joint temporal heterogeneous social network embeddings are learned by fusing the different dimensional representation at their temporal granularity, which can be used to naturally support sentiment analysis on social network in a dynamic way. The results demonstrate that the raised approach reports better performance than the baseline methods.

It is urgent to make a rapid estimate of the scale of outbreaks when the disease information is still unclear in the early stages of the outbreak, so as to buy time for a timely response to infectious diseases and provide reference for the allocation of medical resources and the formulation of control measures. Based on this, this study took the concentrated outbreak of COVID-19 in various cities in China as an example, collected 22 meteorological, social-ecological and population mobility indicators, and established a random forest-kernel density estimation-quantile stepwise regression (RF-KDE-QSR) model to make a preliminary estimate of the daily outbreak scale in cities. The RF model was used for preliminary estimation, and the KDE-QSR model was used for residual correction to correct the prediction results. The evaluation of the prediction accuracy proved the effectiveness of the prediction model. When the RF model was used alone, the R-squared (R2) was 0.82 and the corrected R2 was 0.90. The KDE-QSR model effectively improved the prediction accuracy of the model.},

  abstract     = {This study examines the dynamics of bargaining in a social system that incorporates risk sharing through exchange network models and stochastic matching between agents. The analysis explores three scenarios: convergent expectations, divergent expectations, and social preferences among model players. The study introduces stochastic shocks through a Poisson process, which can disrupt coordination within the decentralized exchange mechanism. Despite these shocks, agents can employ a risk-sharing protocol utilizing Pareto weights to mitigate their effects. The model outcomes do not align with the generalized Nash bargaining solutions across all scenarios. However, over a sufficiently long time frame, the dynamics consistently converge to a fixed point that slightly deviates from the balanced outcome or Nash equilibrium. This minor deviation represents the risk premium necessary for hedging against mutual risk. The risk premium is at its minimum in the scenario with convergent expectations and remains unchanged in the case involving social preferences.},

Existing methods, which generally aim to protect social relationships by erasing friendship links or introducing uniform noise into datasets, do not take into account the risk of inference attacks or the actual privacy needs of users. To address these concerns, we present a novel method, named exponential mechanism of personalized difference privacy (EPDP), for preserving the privacy of social relationships, based on the EPDP. We develop specific social relationship indices to group friendship links and divided these links into distinct privacy levels, each with a unique privacy budget. Then, we select representative elements from each group using sampling and the exponential mechanism to generalize the original datasets, ensuring compliance with personalized difference privacy principles. Metrics for privacy and utility assessment are devised to evaluate method performance. Experimental results reveal that EPDP offers superior utility compared to uniform differential privacy (UDP) and provides better privacy protection than the state-of-the-art. Moreover, we explore the impact of various parameters on data utility. This article marks the pioneering effort to introduce a privacy-preserving method based on the exponential mechanism for the safeguarding of social relationships.},

  abstract     = {The rapid advancement of deep learning and the exponential growth of multimodal data have led to increased attention on multimodal emotion analysis and comprehension in affect computing. While existing multimodal works have achieved notable results in emotion recognition, several challenges remain. First, the scarcity of public large-scale multimodal emotion datasets is attributed to the high cost of manual annotation and the subjectivity of handcrafted labels. Second, most approaches only focus on learning emotion category information, disregarding the crucial evaluation indicator of emotion intensity, which hampers the development of fine-grained emotion recognition. Third, a significant emotion semantic discrepancy exists in different modalities, and current methodologies struggle to bridge the cross-modal gap and effectively utilize a vast amount of unlabeled emotion data, hindering the production of high-quality pseudolabels and superior classification performance. To address these challenges, based on the multitask learning architecture, we propose a novel semisupervised fine-grained emotion recognition model SMEIR-net for multimodal emotion and intensity recognition. Concretely, in semisupervised learning (SSL) phase, we design multistage self-training and consistency regularization paradigm to generate high-quality pseudolabels. Then, in supervised learning phase, we leverage multimodal transformer fusion and adversarial learning to eliminate the cross-modal semantic discrepancy. Extensive experiments are conducted on three benchmark datasets, namely RAVDESS, eNTERFACE, and Lombard-GRID, to evaluate the proposed model. The series sets of experimental results demonstrate that our SSL model successfully utilizes multimodal data and available labels to transfer emotion and intensity information from labeled to unlabeled datasets. Moreover, the corresponding evaluation metrics demonstrate that the utilize high-quality pseudolabels can achieve superior emotion and intensity classification performance, which outperforms other state-of-the-art baselines under the same condition.},

Currently, the bid optimization problem has narrowed down to two specific forms: Budget-constrained bidding (BCB) and Multi-constraint bidding (MCB). Existing solutions try to solve BCB/MCB via linear programming solvers, learning methods, or feedback control. However, in large-scale complex e-commerce, they still suffer from inefficiency, poor convergence, or slow adaptation to the changing market. This research presents an online receding optimization method as a solution for practical bid optimization problems. We conduct a theoretical analysis of the optimal bidding strategy's structure. Further, an online receding optimization process is designed based on open-loop feedback control, which periodically updates a constructed optimal bid formulation that can be solved by linear programming. Then, considering large-scale linear programming problems, we propose an efficient down sampling scheme. Besides, a neural-network-based auction scale prediction is used to adapt to the changing market.

However, the extent to which external information influences LLMs’ cognition and behaviors remains unclear. This study investigates how external statements and opinions influence LLMs’ thoughts and behaviors from a social cognitive perspective. Three experiments were conducted to explore the effects of external information on LLMs’ memories, opinions, and social media behavioral decisions. Sociocognitive factors, including source authority, social identity, and social role, were analyzed to investigate their moderating effects. Results showed that external information can significantly shape LLMs’ memories, opinions, and behaviors, with these changes mirroring human social cognitive patterns such as authority bias, in-group bias, emotional positivity, and emotion contagion. This underscores the challenges in developing safe and unbiased LLMs, and emphasizes the importance of understanding the susceptibility of LLMs to external influences.},

However, these systems still encounter two major challenges: noise edges in interaction graphs and noise in multimodal features of items. Existing works tend to address only one type of noise problem to enhance recommendation performance. This article proposes a new Dual Denoising Multimodal Graph Recommendation (DDRec) model, designed to enhance multimodal recommendation systems by tackling both challenges simultaneously. Specifically, we design two denoising techniques: hard denoising and soft denoising. For noise edges in interaction graphs, the hard denoising method uses preference scores of user nodes and item nodes in different modality interaction graphs as edge weights and prunes edges below a certain threshold to eliminate noise. For noise in multimodal features, the soft denoising method leverages item and item semantic graph information to denoise modal features, thus obtaining modality features related to user preferences. Finally, we employ contrastive learning to compare user and item representations derived from the denoised modality interaction graphs against those from the original graph, ensuring the consistency of nodes across various views. Our comprehensive experiments across four public datasets validate the enhanced performance and effectiveness of the DDRec model.},

Traditional life satisfaction assessments rely on self-report questionnaires, which can be time-consuming and resource intensive. To address these limitations, we developed a method that utilizes LLMs for feature extraction from open-ended self-statement texts, followed by ML prediction. We compared this approach with standalone LLM predictions and expert ratings. A sample of 378 participants completed the satisfaction with life scale (SWLS) and wrote self-statements about their current life situation. The LLM-based ML model, using a LightGBM regressor, achieved a correlation of 0.542 with self-reported SWLS scores, outperforming both the standalone LLM (r $=$ 0.491) and expert ratings (r $=$ 0.455). Effect size analysis revealed a statistically significant moderate effect size difference between the LLM-based ML model and expert ratings (Cohen's d $=$ 0.499, 95% CI [0.043, 0.955]). These findings demonstrate the potential of integrating LLM and ML for an efficient and accurate assessment of life satisfaction, challenging conventional methods, and opening new avenues for psychological measurement.

Our research aims to compare the performance metrics of social bots that employ AI photos with those that use other types of photographs. To accomplish this, we analyzed a dataset with 13 748 measurements of 11 423 bots from the VK social network and identified 73 cases where bots employed generative adversarial network (GAN)-photos and 84 cases where bots employed diffusion or transformers photos. We conducted a qualitative comparison of these bots using metrics such as price, survival rate, quality, speed, and human trust. Our study findings indicate that bots that use AI-photos exhibit less danger and lower levels of sophistication compared to other types: AI-enhanced bots are less expensive, less popular on exchange platforms, of inferior quality, less likely to be operated by humans, and, as a consequence, faster and more susceptible to being blocked by social networks. We also did not observe any significant difference between GAN-based and diffusion/transformers-based bots, indicating that diffusion/transformers models did not contribute to increased bot sophistication compared to GAN models. Our contributions include a proposed methodology for evaluating the impact of photos on bot sophistication, along with a publicly available dataset for other researchers to study and analyze bots. Our research findings suggest a contradiction to theoretical expectations: in practice, bots using AI-generated photos pose less danger.},

Exploring fairness in image forensic algorithms is an initial step toward mitigating these biases. This study explores bias in visual transformer based image forensic algorithms that classify natural and GAN images, since visual transformers are recently being widely used in image classification based tasks, including in the area of image forensics. The proposed study procures bias evaluation corpora to analyze bias in gender, racial, affective, and intersectional domains using a wide set of individual and pairwise bias evaluation measures. Since the robustness of the algorithms against image compression is an important factor to be considered in forensic tasks, this study also analyzes the impact of image compression on model bias. Hence, to study the impact of image compression on model bias, a two-phase evaluation setting is followed, where the experiments are carried out in uncompressed and compressed evaluation settings. The study could identify bias existences in the visual transformer based models distinguishing natural and GAN images, and also observes that image compression impacts model biases, predominantly amplifying the presence of biases in class GAN predictions.},

  abstract     = {Sharding presents an enticing path toward improving blockchain scalability. However, the consensus mechanism within individual shards faces mounting security challenges due to the restricted number of consensus nodes and the reliance on conventional, unchanging nodes for consensus. Common strategies to enhance shard consensus security often involve increasing the number of consensus nodes per shard. While effective in bolstering security, this approach also leads to a notable rise in consensus delay within each shard, potentially offsetting the scalability advantages of sharding. Hence, it becomes imperative to strategically select nodes to form dedicated consensus groups for each shard. These groups should not only enhance shard consensus security but also do so without exacerbating consensus delay. In this article, we propose a novel consensus group selection based on transmission delay between nodes (CGSTD) to address this challenge, with the goal of minimizing the overall consensus delay across the system. CGSTD intelligently selects nodes from various shards to form distinct consensus groups for each shard, thereby enhancing shard security while maintaining optimal system-wide consensus efficiency. We conduct a rigorous theoretical analysis to evaluate the security properties of CGSTD and derive approximation ratios under various operational scenarios. Simulation results validate the superior performance of CGSTD compared to baseline algorithms, showcasing reductions in total consensus delay, mitigated increases in shard-specific delay, optimized block storage utilization per node, and streamlined participation of nodes in consensus groups.},

Most existing methods focus on learning different scales of graphs or using augmented data to improve the quality of feature representation. However, the performance is limited due to two critical problems. First, the high sensitivity of attributed networks makes it uncontrollable and uncertain to use conventional methods for data augmentation, leading to limited improvement in representation and generalization capabilities. Second, under the unsupervised paradigm, anomalous nodes mixed in the training data may interfere with the learning of normal patterns and weaken the discrimination ability. In this work, we propose a novel multiview and multiscale contrastive learning framework to address these two issues. Specifically, a network augmentation method based on parameter perturbation is introduced to generate augmented views for both node–node and node–subgraph level contrast branches. Then, cross-view graph contrastive learning is employed to improve the representation without the need for augmented data. We also provide a cycle training strategy where normal samples detected in the former step are collected for an additional training step. In this way, the ability to learn normal patterns is enhanced. Extensive experiments on six benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms the existing state-of-the-art baselines.},

To this end, we propose a novel cross-modal aggregation attention network (CMAAN), which interactively learns multiview representations from POI sequence and content sequence for predicting the next POI. Our approach models inter-modal interaction correlations, intra-modal sequence correlations, and intra-modal semantic correlations simultaneously to fully discover contextual potential relations along the trajectories. Specifically, the intra-modal semantic correlations are able to capture the variable location functionalities under different contextual relationships of cross-modal interaction information. Moreover, we apply the aggregation attention to adaptively aggregate multiview representations which represent the comprehensive hidden state of the next POI. Extensive experiments on two large-scale datasets clearly demonstrate that our CMAAN achieves state-of-the-art performance.},

  abstract     = {Room-temperature superconductors (esp. LK-99 in the recent) have attracted extensive academic attention in recent years, both in academic circles and among the general public. This topic has spread through a number of social media channels, a plethora of contradiction in information has emerged within social networks. There arises the question on how to analyze the consistency and controversy of such scientific knowledge in the dissemination process, and how this process impact on public cognition on the scientific knowledge. In this article, taking room-temperature superconductor as example, we first designed a large language model based factual consistency detection approach to analyze the consistency between research papers and media reports. Then the consistency between media reports and comments is analyzed, by proposing a novel quantification method for media agenda-setting capability, which evaluates the agenda-setting capability of media based on emotional and positional consistencies. The results indicate that two significant deviations occur when room-temperature superconductor knowledge is spread from specialized fields to the public through the various media. One deviation is due to the specialized nature of room-temperature superconductor knowledge, leading to discrepancies between reported content and factual information in research papers. The other deviation is caused by conflicting knowledge, resulting in disparities between media reports and public perception.},

  abstract     = {In this article, we introduce FairLPG, a framework for ensuring fairness for the task of link prediction in graphs with multiple sensitive attributes. In the context of link prediction in graphs, the fairness notions of demographic parity and equalized odds try to ensure equal average linking probability and true positive rates across different demographic groups consisting of various node pairs. Existing methods for achieving fairness in link prediction only consider a single sensitive attribute, which makes them unsuited for applications where multiple sensitive attributes need to be accounted for. Additionally, considering multiple sensitive attributes in the context of link prediction leads to overlapping and intersectional groups, which further complicates designing such a framework. The proposed framework FairLPG assumes that the link prediction model generates a prediction score for each node pair to form an edge, and formulates a convex optimization problem that minimizes the squared Euclidean distance between the original prediction scores and transformed scores, subject to the fairness constraints. The transformed scores are then utilized for fair link prediction. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to handle the case of intersectional sensitive groups in the graph setting. To demonstrate its effectiveness, we deploy FairLPG on several real-world datasets and graph neural network based link prediction models. It either outperforms or performs competitively with existing methods both in terms of fairness and prediction accuracy across all the datasets and link prediction models at the same time being computationally more efficient.},

  abstract     = {Hypertension is a prevalent cardiovascular disease that requires timely and precise medication management. However, previous medication recommendation studies have largely relied on analyzing electronic health records (EHR), overlooking the specialized knowledge required for hypertension treatment. Moreover, the hypertension-related knowledge contained in existing general medical knowledge graphs is overly simplistic, and the binary relation representations they employ fail to accurately represent the complex treatment logic, thus falling short of meeting medication recommendation needs. To tackle these concerns, we present a novel hyper-relational knowledge-enhanced hypertension medication recommendation model (HKRec). HKRec incorporates both professional treatment knowledge and individual characteristics of patients to provide personalized medication treatment plans. Specifically, a hyper-relational knowledge graph designed for hypertension medication treatment is first constructed. Next, we design a knowledge-driven encoder to capture the representations of hyper-relational knowledge within the graph, and develop an EHR-driven encoder to extract patient-specific features from the EHRs. By integrating medical knowledge entities and patient information, a recurrent mechanism is introduced to model the development process of patients’ hypertension conditions, thereby enabling more effective medication recommendations. Results from experiments on real-world MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV datasets demonstrate that the HKRec model outperforms several competitive baseline methods. The approach enables physicians to create more accurate and personalized medication plans, leading to better management of hypertension and improved patient outcomes. Our code is publicly accessible at https://github.com/zk0814/HKRec.},

  abstract     = {Motor imagery (MI)-based electroencephalography (EEG) stands as a prominent paradigm in the brain–computer interface (BCI) field, which is frequently applied in neural rehabilitation and gaming due to its accessibility and reliability. Despite extensive research dedicated to MI EEG classification algorithms, a notable deficiency still remains: their performance is often optimal only in subject-specific or dataset-specific scenarios, which undermines their generalization capability, hence restricting BCI systems' practical utility in real-world contexts. To address this limitation, this study introduces a cutting-edge approach: a discriminative adversarial network based on spatial–temporal–graph fusion (STG-DAN). This innovation aims to learn features that are not only class-discriminative but also domain-invariant. Specifically, the feature extraction module guarantees the feature discriminativeness by amalgamating spatial–temporal and graph-related features, while the domain alignment module focuses on both global domain and local subdomain. The two modules are incorporated into one adversarial learning framework to facilitate the acquisition of domain-invariant features. Evaluations on two publicly accessible datasets, BCI competition IV 2a and OpenBMI, affirm the superiority of our proposed model (averaged accuracy = 62.94% and 73.01% for the two datasets in cross-subject circumstance, respectively). In cross-dataset circumstances, it also outperforms several state-of-the-art algorithms, attesting to the potency of STG-DAN.},

Although great efforts have been taken to optimize DNNs, few studies focused on the inefficiency caused by the data samples with less value for model training. In this article, we empirically demonstrate that sample complexity is important for model efficiency and selecting representative samples is constructive to the model efficiency. In particular, we propose hardness-aware dataset pruning method ($\gamma$-Razor) to select representative samples from large-scale datasets to remove the less valuable data samples for model training. $\gamma$-Razor is a two-stage framework that includes interclass sampling and intraclass sampling. First, we introduce the inverse self-paced learning strategy to learn hard samples and adjust their weights adaptively according to the inverse frequency of effective samples of each class. For intraclass sampling, hardness-aware cluster sampling algorithm is proposed to downsample easy samples within each class. To evaluate the performance of $\gamma$-Razor, we conducted extensive experiments on three large-scale datasets for image classification tasks. The experimental results show that models trained with the pruned datasets show competitive performances against their counterparts trained with the original large-scale datasets in terms of robustness and efficiency. Furthermore, models trained with the pruned datasets converge faster with lower energy consumption.},

Whereas hate speech in social media has garnered much attention, inciting speech has not been well studied in domains such as religion. We address two aspects of religious incitement: 1) what rhetorical strategies are used in it?; and 2) do the same strategies apply across disparate social contexts and targets? We identify inciting speech against Muslims but demonstrate the generality of the construct vis à vis other targets. We adopt existing datasets of Islamophobic WhatsApp posts and hateful and offensive posts (Twitter and Gab) against other targets. Our methods include: 1) qualitative analysis revealing rhetorical strategies; and 2) an iterative process to label the data, yielding a tool to detect incitement. Incitement applies three rhetorical strategies focused, respectively, on the target group's identity, their imputed misdeeds, and an exhortation to act against them. These strategies carry distinct textual signatures. Our tool (with additional verification) reveals that inciting sentences appear in non-Islamophobic posts and in other contexts (e.g., posts against certain gender identities), indicating the generality of incitement as a concept. Incitement reflects a wide swath of malicious speech omitted from traditional analyses. Understanding and identifying incitement can facilitate online moderation and thus concomitantly reduce harm in real life.},

In this work, we aim to achieve robust emotion prediction through efficient disentanglement of affective semantic representations. In detail, the data generation mechanism behind observations from different perspectives is causally set, where latent variables that relate to emotion are explicitly separate into three parts: the intrinsic-related part, the extrinsic-related part, and the spurious-related part. Affective semantic features consist of the first two parts, with the understanding that spurious latent variables generate the inherent biases in the data. Furthermore, a variational autoencoder with a reformulated objective function is proposed to learn such disentangled latent variables, and only adopts semantic representations to perform the final classification task, avoiding the interference of spurious variables. In addition, for electroencephalography (EEG) data used in this article, a space-frequency mapping method is introduced to improve information utilization. Comprehensive experiments on popular emotion datasets show that the proposed method can achieve competitive intersubject generalization performance. Our results highlight the potential of efficient latent representation disentanglement in addressing the complexity challenges of emotion recognition.},

In the article, we propose video echoed in harmony (VEH), a method for learning and sampling video-integrated chord progression sequences. Our approach adopts harmony, represented by chord progressions that are aligned with various music formats [musical instrument digital interface (MIDI), audio, and score], imitating chord precedence in human music composition. Visual-language models link visual features to chord progressions through genre labels and descriptive words in generated textualized videos. The two aforementioned features collectively obviate the necessity of extensive video–music paired data. Besides, an energy-based chord progression learning and sampling algorithm quantifies abstract harmony impressions to statistical features, serving as interpretable factors for the controllable music generation based on music theory. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art, producing a superior music alignment for the given video.},

  abstract     = {Affective music generation is a challenge for symbolic music generation. Existing methods face the problem that the perceived emotion of the generated music is not evident because music datasets containing emotional labels are relatively small in quantity and scale. To address this issue, an attribute-enhanced affective music transformer (AE-AMT) model is proposed to generate perceived affective music with attribute enhancement. In addition, a multiquantile-based attribute discretization (MQAD) strategy is designed, enabling the model to generate intensity-controllable affective music pieces. Furthermore, A replication-expanded compound representation of the control signals (RECR) method is designed for control signals to improve the controllability of the model. In objective experiments, the AE-AMT model demonstrated a 29.25% and 19.5% improvement in overall emotion accuracy, along with a 30% and 32% improvement in arousal accuracy on the datasets EMOPIA and VGMIDI. These improvements are achieved without significant difference in objective music quality, while also providing ample novelty and diversity compared to the current state-of-the-art approach. Moreover, subjective experiments revealed that the AE-AMT model outperformed comparison models, especially in low valence and arousal based on the Wilcoxon signed ranks test. Additionally, the soft variant model of AE-AMT exhibited a significant advantage in valence, low arousal, and overall music quality. These experiments showcase the AE-AMT model's ability to significantly enhance arousal performance and strike a balance between emotional intensity and musical quality through adaptable strategies.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, multitrack music generation has garnered significant attention in both academic and industrial spheres for its versatile utilization of various instruments in collaborative settings. The primary challenge lies in achieving a harmonious balance within individual tracks and fostering effective collaboration across multiple tracks. To address this issue, this article introduces a pioneering hybrid learning encoder architecture. Each music track's encoder is implemented as an independent transformer architecture, preserving self-attention mechanisms within a single track and interattention mechanisms between different tracks. The resulting features are then seamlessly integrated into the decoder through concatenation. Of particular significance, previous multitrack music generation efforts have predominantly operated under unconditional settings, yielding music that lacks practical value due to noncompliance with established music theory principles. Recognizing this limitation, the article proposes a novel approach to multitrack music generation guided by music theory rules. Employing reinforcement learning techniques, the decoder-generated music serves as the initial state. Positive feedback is provided when the generated music adheres to music theory rules; conversely, negative feedback is applied to compel the multitrack music to align with widely accepted music theory principles. Finally, comprehensive simulation validation is conducted on both the publicly available LMD dataset and the self-constructed MUT dataset. The plethora of experimental results overwhelmingly corroborates the efficacy of the proposed methodology.},

  abstract     = {Music recommendation systems aim to suggest tracks that users may enjoy. However, the accuracy of recommendation results is affected by popularity bias. Previous studies have focused on mitigating the direct effect of single-item popularity in video, news, or e-commerce recommendations, but have overlooked the multisource popularity biases in music recommendations. This article proposes a causal inference-based method to reduce the influence of both track and artist popularity. First, we construct a causal graph that encompasses users, tracks, and artists within the context of music recommendations. Next, we employ matrix factorization in conjunction with counterfactual inference theory to mitigate the popularity effects of artists and tracks, taking into account both the natural direct and indirect effects of these entities on music recommendations. Experimental results evaluated on four music recommendation datasets indicate that our method outperforms other baselines and effectively alleviates the popularity bias of both tracks and artists.},

This article proposes a new community-enhanced dynamic graph convolutional network (CDGCN) for effective rumor detection on online social networks, which utilize the communities formed in a rumor propagation process to improve rumor detection accuracy. CDGCN uses a designed method that combines node features and topology features to identify the communities and learn the community features of rumors. Following this, a graph convolutional network (GCN) with a community-aware attention mechanism is proposed to enable the nodes to dynamically aggregate information from their neighboring nodes’ global and community features, effectively prioritizing critical neighborhood information, enhancing the representation of both local community structures and global network patterns for improved analytical performance. The final rumor representations generated by the GCN are processed by a classifier to detect false rumors. Comprehensive experiments and comparison studies are conducted on four real-world datasets to validate the effectiveness of CDGCN.},

  abstract     = {Generative large language models (GLLMs) have achieved extreme success in the academic community of recommender systems. However, the application of such a powerful tool in the industrial world is still nascent. In Chinese home renovation industry, advisory consultants engage in offline conversations to fully understand the intentions of potential clients before subsequently recommending designers to them. Although conventional recommender systems can somewhat substitute for the consultants, they fall short in addressing two significant challenges. First, clients frequently revise their intentions during conversations, complicating the accurate capture of key intentions. Second, the process of recommending designers, which relies heavily on consultants’ manual efforts, is not only time-consuming but also prone to inaccuracies. To address the challenges, we present a recommendation agent, named DCICDRec, which leverages the robust conversational understanding and generation capabilities of the large language model MOSS. The creation of this agent involves two key steps. The first step is to prepare the corpus from the renovation domain by organizing it into conversational graphs, to which balanced sampling and profile normalization mechanisms are applied. This preparation ensures that the corpus is well-structured and unbiased before proceeding to fine-tune MOSS. The second step is to utilize the fine-tuned MOSS as a recommendation agent. In this capacity, the agent engages in conversations with potential clients and recommends designers, providing detailed reasons for each recommendation. Furthermore, if the client is dissatisfied with the recommended designers, the agent will delve deeper into understanding the client's true intentions and continually update the recommendations until the client is satisfied. We evaluate the agent's effectiveness on a real dialog dataset CRM between clients and consultants, as well as two publicly available datasets, INSPIRED and ReDIAL. Through comprehensive experiments with six baseline models, the DCICDRec agent demonstrate superior performances on the three datasets. Such experimental achievements indicate that the DCICDRec agent holds significant potential for generalization and commercial value. Moreover, the results of case study with 11 offline tests illustrate the scalability and efficiency of the agent in real-time scenarios.},

  abstract     = {Through the use of sarcastic sentences on social media, people can express their strong emotions. Therefore, the detection of sarcasm in social media has received more and more attention over the past years. Classifying a sentence as sarcastic or nonsarcastic heavily relies on the contextual information of the sentence. However, only focusing on the features of target text is the main solution of most existing research. Moreover, the scale of publicly available Chinese sarcasm dataset is very small and does not contain the contextual information. To address the issues mentioned above, we build a Chinese sarcasm dataset from Bilibili, which is one of the most widely used social network platforms in China and has a significant number of sarcastic comments and contextual information. As far as we know, our dataset is the first publicly available large-scale Chinese sarcasm dataset including contextual information. Additionally, we have proposed a novel retrospective reading method for detecting sarcasm that leverages contextual information to improve model's performance. The experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed model and the significance of contextual information for Chinese sarcasm detection: achieving the highest F-score of 0.6942, outperforming existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches. The study presented in this article offers approaches and ideas for future Chinese sarcasm detection studies.},

  abstract     = {Although promising, federated edge learning (FEL) is being plagued by unreliable clients with low-quality parameters due to tight edge association and frequent edge aggregation. Existing efforts mainly focus on setting thresholds or identifying malicious behaviors to resist unreliable clients, which comes at the cost of losing their training samples and leads to unsustainable and collaborative inefficiencies. To tackle this issue, we propose the first sustainable contract, named FedSC, which allows for sustaining truthful contributions in more general conditions including clients’ multidimensional attributes and imperfect system monitoring. Specifically, by modeling the long-term strategic behaviors of self-interested clients as a Markov decision process, we quantify the impact of client behavior on their utilities and derive the critical conditions that make the rating-based contract sustainable, thereby promoting honest participation as the optimal choice for strategic clients. Since directly deriving the optimal design of FedSC under multiple constraints and nonlinear coupling of parameters is intractable, we characterize the impact of design parameters on objective function and analytically prove the existence of closed solution. Then, through a low-time-complexity greedy-based algorithm, the optimality of sustainable contracts under different system errors is guaranteed. Extensive experiments using both synthetic and real datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of FedSC compared to the state-of-the-art baselines. Excitingly, FedSC can reduce the number of free-riders up to 34.52% and improve the amount of contributed data and model performance up to 22.98% and 8.62%, respectively.},

This article addresses this gap with two primary objectives: 1) by developing a calculation model for PPO that integrates the forwarding dynamics within social networks; and 2) by establishing a predictive model that is applied to the temporal evolution of forwarding circles, thus enabling a time-series prediction for PPO. The approach commenced by determining the information entropy based on the structural attributes of forwarding circles. Then, we assess the similarity between information entropy production and the Baidu search index to validate the calculation model’s accuracy. Building on this foundation, public opinion data centered around 30 social events with a total sample size of 15.567 million blogs were collected for modeling. Finally, we design a deep learning algorithm to predict the PPO trend. The results demonstrate that the information entropy of forwarding circles accurately represents PPO, and the proposed predictive model can capture the time-series evolution trend of PPO on social media. These findings offer valuable insights into public opinion analysis and present a robust method for academics and social media practitioners.},

  abstract     = {Opinion Dynamics models in social networks are a valuable tool to study how opinions evolve within a population. However, these models often rely on agent-level parameters that are difficult to measure in a real population. This is the case of the confidence threshold in opinion dynamics models based on bounded confidence, where agents are only influenced by other agents having a similar opinion (given by this confidence threshold). Consequently, a common practice is to apply a universal threshold to the entire population and calibrate its value to match observed real-world data, despite being an unrealistic assumption. In this work, we propose an alternative approach using graph neural networks to infer agent-level confidence thresholds in the opinion dynamics of the Hegselmann-Krause model of bounded confidence. This eliminates the need for additional simulations when faced with new case studies. To this end, we construct a comprehensive synthetic training dataset that includes different network topologies and configurations of thresholds and opinions. Through multiple training runs utilizing different architectures, we identify GraphSAGE as the most effective solution, achieving a coefficient of determination $R^{2}$ above 0.7 in test datasets derived from real-world topologies. Remarkably, this performance holds even when the test topologies differ in size from those considered during training.},

  abstract     = {This article proposes a methodological framework for quantitative estimations of height and weight using behavioral data collected from smart devices. We analyze the connections between height and weight information and behavioral data from three aspects: walking speed, stride length, and step frequency and then extract two kinds of motion features including basic kinematic features and advanced features which use statistical measurements summarizing the dynamics of walking behavior over time and relative intensity of walking speed change, energy cost of one step during walking, and walking frequency, respectively, to describe the motion behavior. After that, we qualitatively and quantitatively analyze the complementarity of different motion data sources and show that more useful information existed in multisource motion data than that of only one motion data source. Based on this, we propose a feature fusion approach named Serial+CC to dealing with the relationships between all motion features from multiple smart devices and user traits of height and weight and then a fused feature set with high discrimination and low complexity is constructed. Finally, five regression models of SVM, BP neural networks, Random Forest, LSTM, and BiLSTM are built with the fused feature set. Empirical evaluations were performed on a dataset collected from 56 subjects. The results demonstrate that motion data collected from smart devices can be used for height and weight quantitative estimation. The results also illustrate our method of using motion data collected from multiple smart devices can achieve better performance than those of only using one smart devices. The best performance is achieved with average errors of 0.95% (1.59 cm) and 4.75% (2.90 kg) for height and weight estimations, respectively, in the scenario of using multiple devices.},

  abstract     = {The underlying time-variant and subject-specific brain dynamics lead to statistical uncertainty in electroencephalogram (EEG) representations and connectivities under diverse individual biases. Current works primarily augment statisticallike EEG data based on deterministic modes without comprehensively considering uncertain statistical discrepancies in representations and connectivities. This results in insufficient domain diversity to cover more domain variations for a generalized model independent of individuals. This article proposes an uncertainty-guided graph augmentation network (Ugan) to generalize EEG emotion recognition across subjects by comprehensively mimicking and constraining the uncertain statistical shifts across individuals. Specifically, an uncertainty-guided graph augmentation module is employed to augment both connectivities and features of EEG graph by manipulating domain statistical characteristics. With the original and augmented EEG graph covering diverse domain variations, the model can mimic the uncertain domain shifts to achieve better generalizability against potential subject variability. To extract discriminative characteristics and preserve emotional semantics after augmentation, a graph coteaching learning module is designed to facilitate coteaching knowledge learning between the original and augmented views. Moreover, a coteaching regularization module is developed to constrain semantic domain invariance and consistency, thereby rendering the model invariant to uncertain statistical shifts. Extensive experiments on three public EEG emotion datasets, i.e., Shanghai Jiao Tong University emotion EEG dataset (SEED), SEED-IV, and SEED-V, validate the superior generalizability of Ugan compared to the state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract     = {The widespread diffusion of fake news has become a critical problem on dynamic social media worldwide, which requires effective strategies for fake news detection to alleviate its hazardous consequences for society. However, most recent efforts only focus on the features of news content and social context without realizing the benefits of large language models (LLMs) and multiple knowledge graphs (KGs), thus failing to improve detection capabilities further. To tackle this issue, we present a multiknowledge and LLM-inspired heterogeneous graph neural network for fake news detection (MiLk-FD), by combining KGs, LLMs, and graph neural networks (GNNs). Specifically, we first model news content as a heterogeneous graph (HG) containing news, entity, and topic nodes and then fuse the knowledge from three KGs to augment the factual basis of news articles. Meanwhile, we leverage TransE to initialize the knowledge features and employ LLaMa2-7B to obtain the initial feature vectors of news articles. After that, we utilize the devised HG transformer to learn news embeddings with specific feature distribution in high-dimensional spaces by aggregating neighborhood information according to metapaths. Finally, a classifier based on multilayer perceptron (MLP) is trained to predict each news article as fake or true. Through experiments, we demonstrate that our proposed framework surpasses ten baselines according to accuracy, precision, F1-score, recall, and ROC in four public real-world benchmarks (i.e., COVID-19, FakeNewsNet, PAN2020, Liar).},

Accurately identifying these bots is essential for effective community governance and opinion management. This article introduces a category of online social behavior features (OSBF), derived from microblog behaviors such as emotional expression, language organization, and self-description. Through a series of experiments, OSBF has demonstrated the stable and robust performance in characterizing and detecting microblog bots on Twitter and Chinese Weibo. By identifying significant differences in OSBF between bot and human accounts, we established an OSBF-based detection model. This model showed excellent performance across multitask and multiscale challenges in two English Twitter datasets. Additionally, we explored cross-language and cross-dataset applications using two Chinese Weibo datasets, further affirming the model's effectiveness and robustness.

A previous experimental study has investigated the decision-making and motion behavior of subgroups when facing a static obstacle during movement. However, it is hard to quantify social attributes (e.g., interpersonal relationships and sense of identity) and little is known about how they affect the movement process of subgroups. Here, we propose a vision-driven model to solve this problem, in which two key model parameters are defined to control the spatial cohesion and attraction intensity, respectively. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the optimal regions of model parameters vary depending on different conditions of the three control variables (obstacle width, time pressure, and subgroup size). The spatial cohesion and attraction intensity barely change the movement process of subgroups in the maintaining state but significantly affect it in the splitting-merging state. This model can reproduce the herding effect of subgroup members in the merging process, which is affected to varying degrees by the modulation of model parameters. Overall, this work contributes to the simulation of subgroup behaviors from a sociopsychological perspective.},

With advancements in network infrastructure, FL has been seamlessly integrated into edge computing. However, the limited resources on edge devices introduce security vulnerabilities to FL in the context. While blockchain technology promises to bolster security, practical deployment on resource-constrained edge devices remains a challenge. Moreover, the exploration of FL with multiple aggregators in edge computing is still new in the literature. Addressing these gaps, we introduce the blockchain-empowered heterogeneous multiaggregator federated learning architecture (BMA-FL). We design a novel lightweight Byzantine consensus mechanism, namely PBCM, to enable secure and fast model aggregation and synchronization in BMA-FL. We study the heterogeneity problem in BMA-FL that the aggregators are associated with varied number of connected trainers with non-IID data distributions and diverse training speed. We propose a multiagent deep reinforcement learning algorithm (MASB-DRL) to help aggregators decide the best training strategies. Experiments on real-word datasets demonstrate the efficiency of BMA-FL to achieve better models faster than baselines, showing the efficacy of PBCM and MASB-DRL.},

To address the critical need for secure and effective CTI sharing in smart grid systems, this article proposes a novel approach. Our solution leverages encrypted federated learning (FL) with integrated malicious client detection mechanisms. This approach facilitates collaborative learning of a threat detection model while preserving the privacy of raw CTI data. Employing real-world, heterogeneous smart grid datasets, we rigorously evaluated our approach under two distinct attack scenarios.

A defensive approach, based on integer-order differential equations, has been recently developed to analyze the effects of verification and blocking of users for containing the spread of fake news. Starting from it, we introduce a novel fractional model providing a more accurate, powerful, and realistic representation of the transmission of fake news messages. The model aims to predict the spread of such messages, by better considering the effect of the system's status evolution over time. The use of fractional differential equations to schematize the propagation of fake news results in incorporating a greater amount of memory information and better considering hereditary properties of the system of interest, also capturing its hidden nonlinear dynamics, mainly related to fractality and multiscale nature.},

  abstract     = {Graph neural networks (GNNs) have recently gained attention for capturing complex relations, prompting researchers to explore their potential in document classification. Existing studies serving this purpose fall into two directions: inductive learning focusing on personalized context relations within documents and transductive learning targeting the global distribution relations among documents in a corpus. Both directions extract distinct types of beneficial structural information and yield encouraging outcomes. However, due to the incompatibility of underlying graph structures and learning settings, developing an enhanced model that effectively integrates local and global relational learning within existing frameworks is challenging. To address this issue, we propose a new GNN-based document representation learning framework that incorporates multiview global graphs at both the word and document levels, focusing on learning the diverse global distribution information of texts at different granularities. Additionally, a contextual encoder derives the initial representations of document nodes from the updated representations of word nodes, integrating personalized context relations into document representations during this process. Finally, we tailor a node representation learning strategy for the multiview global graphs, called the multiview graph sampling and updating module, which allows our framework to operate efficiently during training without being constrained by the scale of the global graph. Experiments indicate that our framework generally enhances performance by integrating both global and local relational learning. When combined with large-scale language models, our framework achieves state-of-the-art results for GNN-based models across multiple datasets.},

  abstract     = {In e-learning, extracting suitable learning objects (LOs) from a vast resource pool and organizing them into high-quality learning paths is crucial for helping e-learners achieve their goals. Numerous approaches have been proposed to recommend optimal learning paths for e-learners. However, it is essential to emphasize that e-learning systems typically consist of a wide range of LOs with varying levels of granularity, ranging from fine-grained to coarse-grained. Unfortunately, current research has not adequately considered the underlying granularity structure of LOs when optimizing learning paths. Existing methods primarily focus on organizing LOs at a single granularity level, limiting their applicability in real-world e-learning systems. To address the limitations, we propose a multigranularity learning path recommendation (MGLPR) framework that aims to flexibly and effectively integrate the diverse granularity levels of LOs into high-quality learning paths. In this framework, a two-layer [knowledge point (KP) and LO layers] model is developed to formulate the MGLPR problem as a constrained optimization problem and an improved ant colony optimization algorithm (IACO) is introduced to solve it to identify optimal learning paths for e-learners. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed IACO, we conducted extensive computational experiments using 30 simulation datasets with varying problem sizes and complexities. The results demonstrate that our proposed IACO achieves superior performance and robustness compared with other competitors. Additionally, an empirical study was conducted to investigate the efficacy of the proposed approach in an authentic learning context, with results indicating that the proposed method outperforms the traditional self-organized ones.},

The consensus of a majority of members on specific topics often guides the collective decision-making in groups. Group influence maximization (GIM) aims to select $k$ seed users in a network to maximize the number of eventually activated groups. A group is said to be activated if $\beta$ percent of users in this group are activated. This study delves into the strategic selection of seed users in social networks to maximize the spread of a topic, thereby activating the highest number of groups. The GIM problem, inherently NP-hard when computing the influence spread from a selected set of nodes, has traditionally faced obstacles in ensuring theoretical robustness, time efficiency, and adaptability in large and complex network environments. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a robust framework called GIMDRL that addresses the GIM problem in social networks using deep reinforcement learning (DRL). Our approach integrates node embeddings from multiple graph neural networks, thereby utilizing diverse information for effective network analysis. This integration plays a crucial role in optimizing the parameter learning process. Extensive experiments are conducted on real-world and synthetic datasets to assess the performance of our proposed framework. The results of these experiments indicate that our approach significantly outperforms existing methods in GIM, even when trained on sampled graphs.

Hence, a bifurcated logistics operation and cyberattack defense strategy have been propounded for green integrated power-transportation networks (IPTN) with renewable penetration. This strategy leverages the potential of social participation from EVs to amplify the defense operation. The bifurcation comprises of a preclusive stage aimed at fortifying and preserving resource allocation within IPTN and a defensive stage aimed at mitigating the deleterious impacts of cyberattacks through rapid response measures. Conventional measures such as load shedding and operation adjustments are augmented by an innovative defense involvement incentive, designed to elicit additional support from EV users. A mean-risk distributionally robust optimization methodology predicated on Kullback–Leibler divergence is posited to address the limitations in data availability in simulating cyberattack consequences.

Specifically, we construct multi-turn dialogues through a three-step pipeline comprising multiturn QA generation, evidence judgment, and dialogue refinement. We augment this process with real-world psychological case backgrounds extracted from online platforms, enhancing the relevance and applicability of the generated data. Additionally, to compare the performance of PsycoLLM with other LLMs, we develop a comprehensive psychological benchmark based on authoritative psychological counseling examinations in China, which includes assessments of professional ethics, theoretical proficiency, and case analysis. The experimental results on the benchmark illustrate the effectiveness of PsycoLLM, which demonstrates superior performance compared with other LLMs.},

  abstract     = {Accurately predicting the future trajectories of traffic agents is paramount for autonomous unmanned systems, such as self-driving cars and mobile robotics. Extracting abundant temporal and social features from trajectory data and integrating the resulting features effectively pose great challenges for predictive models. To address these issues, this article proposes a novel multibranch attentive transformer (MBAT) trajectory prediction network for traffic agents. Specifically, to explore and reveal diverse correlations of agents, we propose a decoupled temporal and spatial feature learning module with multibranch to extract temporal, spatial, as well as spatiotemporal features. Such design ensures each branch can be specifically tailored for different types of correlations, thus enhancing the flexibility and representation ability of features. Besides, we put forward an attentive transformer architecture that simultaneously models the complex correlations possibly occurring in historical and future timesteps. Moreover, the temporal, spatial, and spatiotemporal features can be effectively integrated based on different types of attention mechanisms. Empirical results demonstrate that our model achieves outstanding performance on public ETH, UCY, SDD, and INTERACTION datasets. Detailed ablation studies are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the model components.},

  abstract     = {Ethereum, as one of the most active cryptocurrency trading platforms, has garnered significant academic interest due to its transparent and accessible transaction data. In recent years, phishing scams have emerged as a serious criminal activity on Ethereum. Although most studies model Ethereum account transactions as networks and analyze them using traditional machine learning or network representation learning techniques, these approaches often rely solely on the latest static transaction records or use manually designed features while neglecting transaction histories, thus failing to fully capture the dynamic interactions and potential trading patterns between accounts. This article introduces an innovative multiperspective cascaded dynamic graph neural network model named DMPCG, which extracts phishing transaction data from authoritative databases like blockchain explorers to construct transaction network graphs. The model elevates the analysis from the microscopic features of nodes to the macroscopic dynamics of the entire network, integrating the attributes of static snapshot graphs with the evolution of dynamic trading networks, significantly enhancing the accuracy of phishing detection. Experimental results demonstrate that the DMPCG method achieves an impressive precision of 92.6% and an F1-score of 90.9%, outperforming existing baseline models and traditional subgraph sampling techniques.},

  abstract     = {Graph anomaly detection is a challenging task in graph data mining, aiming to recognize unconventional patterns within a network. Recently, there has been increasing attention on graph anomaly detection based on contrastive learning due to its high adaptability to the sample imbalance problem. However, most existing work typically focuses on the contrast of local views while neglecting global comparison information, leading to suboptimal performance. To address this issue, we introduce a new multiscale contrastive self-supervised learning framework for graph anomaly detection (GADMCLG). Our approach incorporates local-level contrasts involving node–node and node–subgraph contrast, and global-level subgraph–subgraph contrast. The former mines localized abnormal information, while the latter is intended to capture global anomalous patterns. Specifically, our proposed subgraph–subgraph contrast adopts the h-order neighbor subgraph sampling instead of augmented subgraphs through edge perturbation. This sampling strategy ensures a comprehensive observation of the neighborhood surrounding the target node, thereby mitigating the introduction of extraneous noise and providing interpretability for the detected results. Furthermore, we incorporate a subgraph centralization technique to reduce the bias caused by the absolute position of subgraphs in the attribute space, which enhances the model's ability to identify anomalies at different scales. Extensive experimental results on six real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method and its superiority compared with state-of-the-art approaches.},

This problem has compounded with the evolution and increased adoption of machine learning (ML), which has necessitated balancing the security of sensitive information with model utility. Traditional data privacy techniques, such as differential privacy and anonymization, focus on protecting data at rest and in transit but often fail to maintain high utility for machine learning models due to their impact on data accuracy. In this article, we explore the use of synthetic data as a privacy-preserving method that can effectively balance data privacy and utility. Synthetic data is generated to replicate the statistical properties of the original dataset while obscuring identifying details, offering enhanced privacy guarantees. We evaluate the performance of synthetic data against differentially private and anonymized data in terms of prediction accuracy across various settings—different learning rates, network architectures, and datasets from various domains. Our findings demonstrate that synthetic data maintains higher utility (prediction accuracy) than differentially private and anonymized data. The study underscores the potential of synthetic data as a robust privacy-enhancing technology (PET) capable of preserving both privacy and data utility in machine learning environments.},

We probe into pure bundle and mixed bundle pricing decisions for the product line and value-added services in monopolistic settings and delve into the impacts of the reference price and search cost on pricing, profit, product variety, and strategy. Based on model analysis and numerical simulations, the results show that the reference price effect benefits low-priced offerings but undermines high-priced products, overall market share, and profit. As the reference price effect or search cost increases, product variety diminishes. In scenarios where the reference price effect and the proportion of bundled purchases are minimal, the pure bundling strategy is preferable; otherwise, the mixed bundling strategy is more advantageous. When enterprises overlook the reference price effect, there is an imbalance in the pricing of various products and services within the product line, which results in the actual market share and profit consistently falling below the ideal expectations.},

  abstract     = {The graph-based multiview clustering has gained significant attention due to its effectiveness in representing complex relationships among multiview data for enhanced clustering. Among the previous graph-based methods, the multiview graph learning (or graph fusion) technique has rapidly emerged as a promising direction, which, however, still suffers from two critical limitations. First, most of previous methods adopt a single-level of graph fusion, which lack the ability to go from single-level graph fusion to multilevel (deep) graph fusion. Second, they generally focus on constructing an optimal unified graph but cannot fully investigate the correlations among multiple views. Therefore, it is difficult to establish a comprehensive and obvious graph structure. In light of this, this article presents a new multiview graph learning method called deep similarity graph fusion (DSGF) for the multiview clustering task, where three pathways are simultaneously leveraged to fuse multilevel similarity into a unified graph. Particularly, multilevel graph fusion is utilized to obtain a view-specific similarity graph for each view and then fuse these single-view graphs (via three levels of graph fusion) into a robust graph, which takes advantage of deeper consensus information between various similarity graphs and improves the quality of the learned graph for the final spectral clustering process. Extensive experiments are conducted on six real-world multiview datasets, which demonstrate the highly competitive clustering performance of DSGF in comparison with state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract     = {Deep learning, as an important branch of machine learning, has been widely applied in computer vision, natural language processing, speech recognition, and more. However, recent studies have revealed that deep learning systems are vulnerable to backdoor attacks. Backdoor attackers inject a hidden backdoor into the deep learning model, such that the predictions of the infected model will be maliciously changed if the hidden backdoor is activated by input with a backdoor trigger while behaving normally on any benign sample. This kind of attack can potentially result in severe consequences in the real world. Therefore, research on defending against backdoor attacks has emerged rapidly. In this article, we have provided a comprehensive survey of backdoor attacks, detections, and defenses previously demonstrated on deep learning. We have investigated widely used model architectures, benchmark datasets, and metrics in backdoor research and have classified attacks, detections and defenses based on different criteria. Furthermore, we have analyzed some limitations in existing methods and, based on this, pointed out several promising future research directions. Through this survey, beginners can gain a preliminary understanding of backdoor attacks and defenses. Furthermore, we anticipate that this work will provide new perspectives and inspire extra research into the backdoor attack and defense methods in deep learning.},

Based on this finding, we propose a derivation topic dissemination model based on iterative multitopic derivation and social psychology, taking into full consideration users’ emotional accumulation of antecedent topics and repeated derivation of topics. First, a multiple linear regression model is used to construct a metric algorithm for user antecedent sentiment and to effectively analyze the dynamics of antecedent sentiment accumulation affecting the spread of derivative topics. Second, to analyze the interactions between and within multitopic layers in full, an iterative multitopic dissemination model iterative-susceptible infectious recovery (SIR) is proposed. In addition, the association degree is introduced to define the cross-model state transition equation by considering the association and differences among multitopics. Last, considering the influence of cognitive inertia and “continuous attention psychology” in social psychology, we construct a user psychology-based driving force model which can further improve the cross-model state transition equation. According to the experiments, the model can effectively reveal the influence of different factors on the dissemination trend of derivative topics in social networks, as well as depict the dissemination dynamics of derivative topics.},

First, we employ a multiple linear regression method to construct the information influence mechanism by extracting network structure, topic content information, and historical behavior information, considering the complexity of spreading multitype compound rumor messages. Then, we introduce game theory and formulate a game strategy to capture the competition and cooperation among rumors, antirumors, and prom-rumors.

The agents learn using fuzzy actor critic learning algorithms in either a hierarchical structure or a single actor critic policy. The genetic algorithm selects the discount factors, the reward weights, and the standard deviation of noise applied to actor during learning. The genetic algorithm uses a fitness function based on the ratio of successful tests the group of agents can pass after training.

  abstract     = {Most research investigating how social influence affects election results mainly uses diffusion models for binary opinions. However, these diffusion models are progressive and focus on the diffusion of one opinion. In this article, we introduce a general diffusion model for ordinal opinions expressed as linear orderings over a finite set of candidates. We employ agent-based modeling to simulate a nonprogressive diffusion process, allowing multiple types of opinion diffusion about different candidates. The proposed agent-based diffusion model can forecast long-term trends of opinion diffusion in social networks by capturing voters’ personalized features and incorporating dynamic social contexts. Furthermore, we examine the possibility of affecting election outcomes by externally changing the ordinal opinions of certain vertices, i.e., campaigning. Since finding influential voters from the social network is computationally challenging, we propose a heuristic approach, i.e., backward influence rank (BIR). Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed BIR approach is superior to the classic greedy approach for campaigning by achieving a similar margin of victory to that of the greedy approach but running two orders of magnitude faster than the greedy approach did.},

Numerous incidents have been reported that have resulted in a substantial loss of cryptocurrency. The existing literature in this area primarily leverages traditional feature engineering or network representation learning to recover crucial information from transaction records to identify suspected users. However, these methods mainly rely on handcrafted feature engineering or conventional node representation learning from a static network while ignoring the network dynamism and inherent temporal sparsity in the user behavior that results in underperformance after an extended period. This article proposes a novel sparsity-aware tensor decomposition-based architecture: SpaTeD, which retrieves efficient user representation utilizing the evolving transaction and structural information and subsequently mitigates the temporal sparsity problem. Our model is evaluated on a real-world Ethereum phishing scam dataset and reports a significant performance improvement over the baselines (96% recall and 96% F1-score). We have conducted an extensive set of experiments to verify the temporal robustness of the model. Additionally, we have provided the ablation study to demonstrate the contribution of each component of the framework.},

In the midst of chaos and uncertainty, communities often rely on these platforms to share urgent pleas for help, extend support, and organize relief efforts. However, the overwhelming volume of conversations during such periods can escalate to unprecedented levels, necessitating the automated identification and matching of requests and offers to streamline relief operations. Additionally, there is a notable absence of studies conducted in multilingual settings despite the fact that any geographical area can have a diverse linguistic population. Therefore, we propose crisis response matcher (CReMa), a systematic approach that integrates textual, temporal, and spatial features to address the challenges of effectively identifying and matching requests and offers on social media platforms during emergencies. Our approach utilizes a crisis-specific pretrained model and a multilingual embedding space. We emulate human decision-making to compute temporal and spatial features and nonlinearly weigh the textual features. The results from our experiments are promising, outperforming strong baselines. Additionally, we introduce a novel multilingual dataset, simulating help-seeking and offering assistance on social media in 16 languages, and conduct comprehensive cross-lingual experiments. Furthermore, we analyze a million-scale geotagged global dataset to understand patterns in seeking help and offering assistance on social media.

However, the existing research predominantly focuses on platform-user interactions, often neglecting the potential for user collaboration, which is crucial for improving data quality and task efficiency. In practical applications, mobile users tend to cooperate with familiar individuals based on their preferences in sensing tasks. To tackle this issue, we introduce a novel MCS model that integrates user cooperation, significantly enhancing the system's overall effectiveness. Specifically, users’ capabilities and costs are synthesized and managed through a cooperation degree matrix. Additionally, cooperation is updated based on historical behaviors and user preferences. To incentivize user participation, currencies are employed for recruitment. Within this framework, we investigate the maximum collaborative user selection (MCUS) problem, which is dedicated to the problem of maximizing the amount of recruitment under user cooperation. The MCUS problem is proved to be an NP-hard problem and thus intractable. To address this, we propose the minimum weighted cost replacement (MWCR) algorithm. Experimental results demonstrate that the MWCR algorithm exhibits low complexity and high efficiency across various scales, making it an excellent solution for collaborative crowd recruitment.},

We apply natural language processing (NLP) techniques to analyze sentiments and emotional cues across datasets from social media and other text-based communication. Using ML, deep learning, and transfer learning models such as bidirectional encoder representations (BERTs), robustly optimized BERT approach (RoBERTa), distilled BERT (DistilBERT), and generalized autoregressive pretraining for language understanding (XLNet), we assess their ability to detect early signs of mental health concerns. The results show that BERT, RoBERTa, and XLNet consistently achieve over 95% accuracy, highlighting their strong contextual understanding and effectiveness in this application. The significance of this research lies in its potential to revolutionize mental health diagnostics by providing a scalable, data-driven approach to early detection.

  abstract     = {Role-based collaboration (RBC) theory is a promising paradigm for problem-solving in complex systems. Multigroup role assignment (MGRA) specifically tackles the task of assigning roles for multigroup collaboration. However, due to the constraint that an agent can only play a role in one group, the current MGRA models are incapable of handling when required agents outnumber the available supply. Group multirole assignment (GMRA) resolves the problem by permitting an agent to be assigned multiple roles, but it cannot address the assignment involving multiple environments-classes, agents, roles, groups, objects (E-CARGO) groups. Therefore, this article presents a comprehensive overview of the GMRA problem in multiple E-CARGO groups under various conditions, generalized as the multigroup multirole assignment (MGMRA) problem. The MGMRA problem primarily revolves around two key factors: the maximum number of roles that an agent can undertake within an E-CARGO group, and the maximum number of different roles across all E-CARGO groups, which have a significant impact on the sufficiency or necessity conditions of the algorithm as well as its performance. Therefore, a unified model and its special cases are proposed to solve the concrete assignment problems under different conditions.

  abstract     = {COVID-19 has been spreading globally from 2019 to 2022, prompting many countries to establish consistent, timely, and strict intervention policies during this period. However, the existing analysis of central epidemiological parameters (CPPs) falls short in exploring the consistency of transmission laws implied by these policies. To resolve this limitation, we propose a consistent transmission law inference framework. This framework first provides a coarse-to-fine detection method to extract outbreaks and devises an autonomous inference sliding window (ASW) algorithm to estimate the infected-case-dependent CPPs of these outbreaks. Then, we reveal consistent transmission laws through a differential analysis of the estimated CPPs. Focusing on the transmission of COVID-19 in China, a typical country with a consistent intervention policy, our model reveals remarkably consistent outbreak laws. In short, the policy controls the effective growth rate almost to zero (to a 1E-03 scale) within three days since the outbreak started. Specifically: 1) the policy was very effective at the beginning of the outbreak, leading to the exposure rate hitting the bottom on one day between the second and eleventh days and then keeping it at a plateau; 2) under large-scale nucleic acid testing and contact tracking, the incubation rate decreased and reached a plateau mainly on the third day; and 3) the recovery rate fluctuated extremely little on a 1E-03 scale, showing no significant breakthrough in COVID-19 treatment that helped the policy work. Our method can be readily adapted to other countries and SEIR epidemic.},

Despite numerous approaches being developed, many existing methods rely on centrality metrics that have inherent deficiencies and limitations. These approaches face challenges such as network sparsity and ignoring relationships between distant nodes. To address these issues, this article proposes an efficient and influential node identification approach named semilocal (SL) average shortest path with augmented graph (ASPAG). We configure the average shortest path (ASP) theory with the extended neighborhood concept to address the network sparsity problem with less complexity. The aim is to develop a SL centrality metric based on ASP that can extract a local subgraph for each node in a distributed manner. ASPAG, on the other hand, uses a combined augmented graph and the SL ASP centrality metric to improve the representation of global relationships in the network and make the most of relationships between nodes that are far apart. By leveraging local topological information and incorporating additional graph structures, our method provides a comprehensive analysis of node influence. Extensive experiments on real-world networks demonstrate that ASPAG outperforms traditional centrality metrics and other state-of-the-art techniques in terms of computational efficiency. Specifically, ASPAG improves Kendall’s τ coefficient under the susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model by 4.6% compared to the best available method.},

To address these issues, we introduce a new model called filter knowledge tracing (FKT). This innovative model incorporates a learnable filter into KT to filter out noise information from students’ exercise sequences. We redefine the input paradigm of the data, using learnable filters to perform filtering operations in its frequency domain representation space, effectively removing noise. Additionally, an attention module has been introduced in the FKT model to evaluate the impact of students’ historical interactions on their current knowledge state. To validate our model, we conduct extensive experiments utilizing four publicly available datasets.

However, we face significant challenges in isolated attribute manipulation and balancing the tradeoff between editing fidelity and facial identity preservation. Here, this article presents a novel approach to constructing an orthogonal decomposition subspace, enabling precise editing control over individual attributes with minimal impact on others and maintaining identity consistency. We introduce an adaptive weight modulation (AWM) method and a maximum slope truncation (MST) formula. The AWM method, founded on a sufficient convergent criterion, performs singular value decomposition to yield subspace parameters that preserve rich facial knowledge within the generative model, facilitating high-quality facial generation with reduced parameterization. This empowers meaningful semantic interpretation of attributes, supporting diverse editing tasks such as pose, age, and eyewear adjustments. The MST formula rigorously defines the editing bounds to effectively navigate the tradeoff between editing depth and identity retention. We also propose a guideline for deciphering the specific meanings of unsupervised semantics, potentially advancing interpretability in social behavioral studies.

  abstract     = {The devastation led by the COVID-19 pandemic was accompanied by a plethora of misinformation, laden with pseudoscience, hoaxes, and myths, often intertwined with hate speech. This phenomenon was particularly pronounced in India, where the intricate political and communal landscape provided fertile ground. The misinformation, with its elements of hate speech, posed a significant threat to societal cohesion. In response, this article delves into the dynamics of misinformation during the COVID-19 crisis in India, with a specific focus on differentiating general misinformation (GM) from hateful misinformation (HM). To this end, we construct an Indian COVID-19 misinformation dataset collected from various online social and mainstream media and analyze it from various perspectives. Mainly, we focus on temporal evolution, content and topics involved, and emotions and sentiment sensationalism of COVID-19 misinformation. We found the emotions of sadness and fear as key amplifiers of misinformation in general, with negative sentiments dominating HM. Through our comprehensive analysis, we found many such interesting insights and patterns.

Our results show that while GM is relatively easier to identify, it is challenging to detect HM. Overall, deep learning models are found to be more effective than unsupervised methods.

  abstract     = {Empathy and identity recognition are two core social interaction factors that greatly affect efficiency and effectiveness. The selection of a profile picture in social media is crucial as it serves as a visual representation of virtual identity. It not only reflects the user's personality but also influences the level of empathy and identification that others feel toward them. However, the potential impact of profile pictures with different styles (e.g., real faces, cartoon faces, and landscape images) on empathy and identity recognition is still unclear. To explore its effects, a controlled laboratory experiment and an ecological online experiment were conducted. Participants were shown a picture each time, informed to imagine interacting with the person using it as his/her profile picture, and instructed to rate an item from the basic empathy scale (BES) based on it. After rating all pictures, users then completed an identity recognition task. Results show that participants’ empathy scores for users with cartoon or real face profile pictures are greater than those with landscape profile pictures. In addition, participants performed better in identity recognition for users with real face or landscape images as profile pictures than for those with cartoon face profile pictures. Moreover, users of social media often make social categorizations (i.e., in-group/out-group categorization) based on the social identities expressed by their profile pictures. Our results also indicate that the affective empathy scale rating score was positively associated with the degree to which users of the corresponding profile pictures were categorized as in-group members.},

  abstract     = {Collaborative filtering (CF) is an essential technique in recommender systems that provides personalized recommendations by only leveraging user-item interactions. However, most CF methods represent users and items as fixed points in the latent space, lacking the ability to capture uncertainty. While probabilistic embedding is proposed to intergrate uncertainty, they suffer from several limitations when introduced to graph-based recommender systems. Graph convolutional network framework would confuse the semantic of uncertainty in the nodes, and similarity measured by Kullback–Leibler (KL) divergence suffers from degradation problem and demands an exponential number of samples. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach, called the Wasserstein dependent Graph ATtention network (W-GAT), for collaborative filtering with uncertainty. We utilize GAT and Wasserstein distance to learn Gaussian embedding for each user and item. Additionally, our method incorporates Wasserstein-dependent mutual information further to increase the similarity between positive pairs. Experimental results on three benchmark datasets show the superiority of W-GAT compared to several representative baselines. Extensive experimental analysis validates the effectiveness of W-GAT in capturing uncertainty by modeling the range of user preferences and categories associated with items.},

  abstract     = {Nowadays, shared social images often contain multiple privacy subjects, and the disclosure of these privacy subjects increases the risk of privacy violations; thus, the protection of visual privacy is particularly important. However, existing means of visual privacy protection render images unavailable and are typically protected only for images with a single privacy subject. Combining compressed sensing (CS) and 2DCS, this article proposes a multilevel visual privacy protection scheme (MLVPP) via thumbnail preservation (TPE) and key sharing (KS), which includes two stages, that is, CS-TPE multilevel encryption and KS multilevel decryption. In the first stage, we utilize 2DCS to enable the compressed sampled observations to preserve the structural similarity of the nonsensitive part and leverage CS to encrypt multiple sensitive parts of the image. The CS-processed image is then made to strike a good balance between privacy and availability through TPE. In the second stage, with the help of KS mechanism, the CS encryption keys and TPE key are shared in different combinations with the users related to the privacy subjects for meeting the MLVPP requirements. The quality of decrypted images varies for different classes of related users, e.g., unrelated users, semirelated users, and full-related users. The proposed approach preserves the visual information in the nonsensitive part of the image while providing security for the sensitive parts. Compared with related works, MLVPP reveals that the PSNR of the fully decrypted image can reach 34.04, and the SSIM is greater than 0.96 at a compression rate of 0.25. Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of MLVPP.},

Stock market prediction is a challenging task due to multiple influencing factors, its nonlinear and volatile nature, and complex interdependencies. Recent approaches have neglected the interconnections between stocks and relied on predefined static relationships. The collection of relational data is difficult to access due to confidentiality and privacy agreements for emerging economies. Moreover, these predefined relationships lack the ability to explain the latent interactions between stocks. This work proposes a data-driven end-to-end framework, dynamic relation aware relational temporal network (DR2TNet), that learns the hidden intra- and intersector associations between stock pairs and temporal patterns. A financial knowledge graph is built from historical data and is updated dynamically during the training process to reflect the interactions between the stocks according to the current market situation. We have proposed a new loss function that considers prediction loss and directional movement loss to train a model. The applicability of prediction results obtained by DR2TNet is demonstrated in the portfolio optimization problem. The results show a higher return compared to other existing baseline models.},

To effectively manage the resilience of healthcare systems, it is essential to model their working domains.

In particular, at the departmental level, the substance flow is primarily patient-centric, while at the hospital level, it includes orders, bills, and report flows. Interhospital scenarios may involve case flows and healthcare personnel movements. Therefore, this article proposes a healthcare system domain modeling framework based on the function-context-behavior-principle-state-structure (FCBPSS) tool, outlining its application in three hierarchical healthcare system levels. Unlike FCBPSS applications in other systems engineering fields, this framework not only captures the system's semantics but also encompasses ethical rules and operational standards within the healthcare system, making it an ideal tool for healthcare system domain modeling. Finally, the model's effectiveness is validated through the optimization of a case study at Sheng-Jing Hospital in Shenyang.},

The MultiSEAO-Mix is annotated with offensiveness, sentiment, emotion, and their respective intensities. Additionally, it is also annotated with author support. A multimodal, multitask framework is proposed that considers offensive detection, intensity prediction, and author support as the primary tasks and improves their performance using sentiment, emotion, and corresponding intensities as the auxiliary tasks. Further, we propose a fusion technique that captures the enhanced multimodal representation to improve the performance of our model. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed multitask framework improves the model performance by more than 4.5 points compared to multitask system without sentiment and emotion as the auxiliary tasks.},

This user-generated content (UGC) serves various purposes, including user profiling, sentiment analysis, and disease detection or tracking. Notably, researchers recognized the potential of UGC for assessing mental health due to its unobtrusive and real-time monitoring capabilities. Recent reviews on depression identification from textual UGC using AI models covered tools and techniques but overlooked critical components such as datasets, lexicons, features, and subtasks, which are essential for understanding the progress and tasks undertaken. This survey adopts a systematic approach and formulates five research questions to examine the relevant literature concerning these elements. Additionally, it organizes machine learning and deep learning (ML/DL) training features from textual UGC in a hierarchical manner and maps the literature on depression detection into various subtasks. The review highlights that despite the prevalence studies, datasets are limited in both quantity and size, with many relying on less reliable ground truth collection methods such as self-reported diagnosis statements (SRDS). Furthermore, the review identifies an overemphasis on certain textual features, such as n-grams and affective elements, while others, such as life events, egocentric graphs, and intervention/coping style, remain largely unexplored. It is crucial for practical AI depression detection systems to develop expertise in tasks such as severity, symptom detection, and explainable/interpretable depression analysis to instill confidence and trust among users.},

The number of individuals diagnosed with depression continues to rise each year. Currently, clinical practice relies entirely on self-reporting and clinical assessment, which carries the risk of subjective biases. In this article, we propose a multimodal method based on facial expression and pupil to detect depression more objectively and precisely. Our method first extracts the features of facial expressions and pupil diameter using residual networks and 1-D convolutional neural networks. Second, a cross-modal fusion model based on self-attention networks (CMF-SNs) is proposed, which utilizes cross-modal attention networks within modalities and parallel self-attention networks between different modalities to extract CMF features of facial expressions and pupil diameter, effectively complementing information between different modalities. Finally, the obtained features are fully connected to identify depression. Multiple controlled experiments show that compared to single modality, the multimodal fusion method based on self-attention networks has a higher ability to recognize depression, with the highest accuracy of 75.0%. In addition, we conducted comparative experiments under three different stimulation paradigms, and the results showed that the classification accuracy under negative and neutral stimuli was higher than that under positive stimuli, indicating a bias of depressed patients toward negative images. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our multimodal fusion method.},

  abstract     = {In the realm of e-commerce, where online shopping has become a staple of daily life, the generation of personalized product descriptions presents a unique challenge and opportunity for enhancing customer experience. Traditional retail interactions allow for personalized communication between salespersons and customers, ensuring that consumer needs are directly addressed. This level of personalization is harder to achieve online, where customers must navigate through generic, often lengthy product descriptions to make informed purchasing decisions. Recognizing the dual necessity of personalizing content to individual preferences while ensuring the descriptions remain faithful to the product's core attributes, this article introduces a novel approach, the gated pointer-generator transformer (GPGT). This framework is designed to bridge the gap between customer preferences and product features, enabling the generation of descriptions that are not only customized to the user's interests—such as emphasizing appearance for fashion-forward individuals or functionality for tech enthusiasts—but also accurately reflect the product's distinctive qualities, including brand names and technical specifications. GPGT leverages the select-attention mechanism combined with a Transformer encoder to capture the nuanced interactions between user attributes and product features, further refined by a copy mechanism during the decoding phase for the precise inclusion of specific product-related terms. Extensive experiments show that our framework substantially improves the quality of generation ($+$10.6% on ROUGE-2 and $+$15.9% on BLEU) while being more faithful to draw people's attention. The results on human evaluation, in terms of fluency, faithfulness, and personalization, also exhibit that descriptions generated by GPGT can be better accepted by real users.},

As the platforms, sellers, and consumers are the main participants and their decision-making is restricted by historical experiences and contextual conditions, they exhibit constrained rationality. Utilizing evolutionary game theory, the study constructs a tripartite game model that analyses the influence of relevant parameters on the behavior of the participants. To deal with the behaviors of the participants, we built a simulation system on MATLAB to demonstrate the effects of beginning circumstances and associated parameter adjustments on the evolution outcomes for participants. Through theoretical analysis and numerical simulation analysis, we identify that the e-commerce platforms should standardize the good faith behavior of sellers by increasing the punishment, which can reduce the malicious return behavior of consumers. Sellers can mitigate the probability of fraud by improving production technology. Consumers can improve their learning to avoid returning products. This research provides a theoretical framework and decision support for e-commerce platforms, and it also promotes the long-term growth of online transactions.},

  abstract     = {The multivariate Hawkes process (MHP) is widely used for analyzing data streams that interact with each other, where events generate new events within their own dimension (via self-excitation) or across different dimensions (via cross excitation). However, in certain applications, the timestamps of individual events in some dimensions are unobservable, and only event counts within intervals are known, referred to as partially interval-censored data. The MHP is unsuitable for handling such data since its estimation requires event timestamps. In this study, we introduce the partially censored multivariate Hawkes process (PCMHP), a novel point process that shares parameter equivalence with the MHP and can effectively model both timestamped and interval-censored data. We demonstrate the capabilities of the PCMHP using synthetic and real-world datasets. First, we illustrate that the PCMHP can approximate MHP parameters and recover the spectral radius using synthetic event histories. Next, we assess the performance of the PCMHP in predicting YouTube popularity and find that the PCMHP outperforms the popularity estimation algorithm Hawkes intensity process (HIP) [1]. Comparing with the fully interval-censored HIP, we show that the PCMHP improves prediction performance by accounting for point process dimensions, particularly when there exist significant cross-dimension interactions. Last, we leverage the PCMHP to gain qualitative insights from a dataset comprising daily COVID-19 case counts from multiple countries and COVID-19-related news articles. By clustering the PCMHP-modeled countries, we unveil hidden interaction patterns between occurrences of COVID-19 cases and news reporting.},

This study constructs a classification-based product selection method driven by online reviews to assist consumers in making purchase decisions. First, the multifaceted attribute evaluations of products are extracted from textual reviews that contain more abundant and useful information than those provided by vendors. The evaluations are modeled by probabilistic linguistic term sets such that sentiment words in texts are described at different frequencies. Then, a classification-based product selection method is developed to rank products considering multifaceted attributes in which alternative products are divided into the acceptance class, rejection class, and uncertainty class through a classification strategy. Each class of products is compared based on the performance scores calculated by a probabilistic linguistic aggregation operator. A case study of selecting laptops based on real data from Amazon.com is given to illustrate the method. Comparative analysis with existing ranking methods shows the advantages of the proposed method in matching consumers’ risk aversion behavior and preserving uncertain information.},
