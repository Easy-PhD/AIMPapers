  abstract     = {Massive multiple-input multiple-output (massive MIMO)-based low Earth orbit (LEO) intersatellite link communications is a promising research topic for the fifth generation (5G) and forthcoming sixth generation (6G) wireless networks. However, due to the fast relative movement between the transmitter and receiver in LEO satellites, intersatellite link communication is facing serious Doppler shifts and delays, which makes it difficult to obtain the accurate channel state information (CSI). Therefore, this article proposes an improved channel prediction method, that is, spatial-delay domain-based Prony (SDD-Prony) prediction, which not only realizes the accurate CSI acquisition for massive MIMO-based LEO intersatellite link systems but also substantially reduces the computational complexity. In particular, it is shown that the prediction error of the proposed method can converge to zero with the increase in antenna number and bandwidth. In addition, we combine the SDD-Prony prediction method with the total least squares method to reduce the influence of the noise and error components on the prediction accuracy, which further improves the prediction performance. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated by a theoretical proof and simulation results.},

  abstract     = {This article studies the event-triggered distributed model predictive control (ET-DMPC) strategy for the load frequency control (LFC) issue of multiarea interconnected power systems (IPSs) subject to bounded disturbances and load reference set-point constraints. The entire IPS comprises multiple dynamically coupled subsystems, each exchanging information with interconnected subsystems through the communication network. Local DMPC controllers are designed with robust constraints and load reference set-point constraints, where robust constraints limit the impact of tie-line power deviations and disturbances. To further alleviate the computational and communication burdens of subsystems, a distributed event-triggered mechanism is proposed, in which the threshold integrates the information of current subsystem state, disturbances, and tie-line power deviations between areas. By comparing this threshold with the deviation between the actual trajectory and the optimal prediction, the instants of optimization problem solving and information transmission are determined, effectively balancing control performance and resource utilization. Moreover, the theoretical conditions guaranteeing Zeno-free behavior, recursive feasibility, and closed-loop stability are analyzed. Finally, simulation results and analysis for a three-area IPS demonstrate that computational and communication burdens are significantly reduced while achieving a satisfactory LFC objective, which validates the effectiveness of the ET-DMPC strategy.},

Moreover, it is ensured that the sequence of triggering times does not exhibit Zeno behavior under given conditions. Remarkably, clustering naturally occurs in matrix-weighted networks, which reflects the important role of matrix coupling in the convergence process. Furthermore, Lyapunov stability theory is applied to achieve leader-following consensus in matrix-weighted multiagent networks.

This article investigates a U-IRS-assisted data collection system in WSNs that employs the hover priority scheme. Given the energy constraints of UAV, the combined energy consumption from UAV moving/hovering and IRS reflecting elements configuration circuitry poses significant challenges to improving the system’s energy efficiency (EE). To address this challenge, we formulate a multiobjective optimization problem under the constraints of UAV and SN power budgets to make a tradeoff between EE and spectral efficiency. Due to the nonconvexity of the formulated problem, we divide the main problem into three subproblems: user association, the number of reflecting elements, and UAV trajectory optimization. An alternating optimization algorithm integrating the genetic algorithm, the CJ-BS-based cyclic iteration algorithm, Dinkelbach’s algorithm, and the successive convex approximation method is proposed to solve these subproblems. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed solution outperforms the UAV hovering directly above each SN scheme.},

Although extensive research has been explored on these interactions, most studies are oversimplified and idealized. Therefore, more in-depth and practical studies on communication in control systems are needed. Our study aims to explore the practical impacts of communication networks on control systems. We provide a general overhead analysis for the structure of NCSs and design an express delivery-based cost chart, referred to as an E-Chart, for the control message sizes. We found an effect in the express delivery service known as the “Rice Grain Effect,” defined as the cost of delivering a single rice grain is the same as the cost of delivering two rice grains. We apply the effect to the control overhead analysis and the E-Chart. We present the results of the E-Chart and the overhead under different message sizes and compression ratios; furthermore, we define a new metric to reflect the stability of the formation control and conduct simulations to study the impacts of message size and error on NCSs. In particular, formation control is affected by both bit error rate and message size, and the system exhibits high sensitivity to variations in bit error rate.},

The convergence speed of DPI is fast, but the initial control strategy must be admissible. The DVI algorithm avoids the shortcomings of the DPI algorithm, but its convergence speed is slow. To find a method to balance the DPI algorithm and DVI algorithm to solve the DCG problem in discrete-time linear (DTL) multiagent systems (MASs), a model-based multistep DVI RL algorithm is proposed in this article. First, the distributed leader-follower tracking control in general DTL MASs is transformed into a DCG problem. The Nash equilibrium solution of the DCG is obtained by using the proposed algorithm to solve the Bellman equation. Then, based on the analysis of the DVI and DPI algorithms, a multistep DVI algorithm with the advantages of these two iterative algorithms is proposed. Second, we demonstrate the convergence of the proposed algorithm and design a universal stability criterion to ensure that the obtained control strategy is admissible. Finally, the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm were verified through numerical simulation experiments.},

To achieve the optimal objective and guarantee the constraint condition, a two-stage distributed optimization algorithm comprising the optimization layer and local control layer is proposed. First, the optimal signal estimator is designed as the reference signal to transform the optimal problem into a tracking control issue. Due to the unavailability of global information, the estimator only uses the measured gradients of the output states. Second, an adaptive control method is presented in the spirit of the backstepping technique and barrier Lyapunov function, ensuring the agents’ outputs converge to the optimal solution. Novel damping terms are integrated into the backstepping method to address the nonlinear coupling between the agents and the optimization algorithm. Based on the convex analysis and Barbalat’s lemma, the asymptotic stability of the two-stage distributed optimization algorithm is proved, full-state constraints are guaranteed, and all signals of the closed-loop systems are bounded. An interesting extension of the main results to the constrained MASs with time-varying UNCDs (unknown and may multiple reverses) is investigated, and a novel time-elongation Nussbaum function is introduced to deal with the shock chattering issue caused by UNCDs. Finally, numerical examples are provided to show the efficacy of the developed control approach.},

However, conventional deep reinforcement learning (DRL) methods often lack this ability to focus on critical cues, limiting their efficiency and decision quality. To address this gap, we propose a novel framework that enhances agent decision-making by incorporating human visual attention (HVA) into DRL through two key innovations. First, we develop an improved convolutional neural network for visual attention prediction, which outperforms existing models across multiple evaluation metrics. Second, we propose HVA proximal policy optimization (PPO), a novel DRL framework that integrates HVA through two mechanisms: 1) attention-guided sampling; and 2) multimodal feature fusion for comprehensive state representation. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework achieves an 84.4% winning rate (15.6% higher than standard PPO) with significantly faster convergence. Ablation studies further confirm that both the attention prediction model and its integration mechanism contribute substantially to performance gains. These findings highlight the effectiveness of incorporating human cognitive patterns into agent learning, offering new insights for human-agent hybrid strategies in dynamic tasks.},

  abstract     = {The multienergy system consumption forecasting plays a crucial role in managing the operation and scheduling of integrated energy systems and multicarrier energy markets. However, the intricate interdependencies among different energy sources and their varying sampling frequencies pose significant challenges for accurate forecasting. Existing studies often overlook the complex cross-energy relationships and the multitime-scale nature of energy consumption data. To address these challenges, we introduce a multiscale time-aware graph mamba neural network-based model (MSTAGMN), a novel approach for forecasting electricity consumption, gas consumption and water consumption, which have different sampling rates. Specifically, we employ a time-aware self-attention message-passing mechanism to learn the relationship between multivariate time series sampled at different time intervals. The information propagated from observed sensors is dependent on edges in the time-varying graph $G$ to neighboring sensors. Furthermore, we leverage mamba structure to capture temporal attention weights to aggregate sensor’s embedding. In addition, we incorporate uncertainty quantification via log-variance prediction, which enables the model to quantify aleatoric uncertainty. This adaptive mechanism improves predictive accuracy by adjusting forecasts based on input variability. Experiments on the UNICON dataset confirm that MSTAGMN outperforms state-of-the-art models in forecasting irregular time series. Specifically, MSTAGMN reduces quantile loss by 6.03% for water consumption, 7.53% for gas consumption, and 4.02% for electricity consumption compared to the leading model. These results demonstrate MSTAGMN’s superior accuracy and enhanced uncertainty estimation in multienergy system forecasting.},

The multifaceted impact of ICV mobility on these elements requires a comprehensive analysis to understand its cascading effects on privacy protection and model performance within FL-based VCS. To address these complexities, we propose DFed-ADP, a dynamic FL framework with an adaptive DP mechanism tailored for VCS. DFed-ADP includes a rigorous theoretical derivation to quantify the influence of ICV mobility on the DP noise scale and a dynamic ICV selection strategy that prioritizes data importance and adapts to mobility patterns. Specifically, we introduce an adaptive user-level DP and derive a closed-form expression to quantify the impact of ICV mobility on noise variance. Then, based on theoretical analysis, we propose an efficient ICV selection scheme that ensures participating ICVs can provide high-value data and complete training tasks on time. These designs ensure a robust balance between privacy and model performance. Experimental results demonstrate the adaptability and efficiency of DFed-ADP, achieving significant accuracy improvements under independent and identically distributed (IID) and non-IID settings in VCS.},

  abstract     = {To fulfill computing demands of numerous Internet of Things (IoT) devices in infrastructure-free regions, low earth orbit (LEO) satellite edge computing has been proposed in recent years, to circumvent the latency arising from long backhaul and link congestion in traditional cloud computing mode. This article proposes a novel time-varying graph-based collaborative task offloading strategy for LEO satellite IoT to reduce task computing latency. To this end, a computing coordinate graph (CCG) is designed to characterize the time-varying topology and resource distribution of LEO satellite networks. When a task is offloaded to LEO satellite networks because local computing capability is unable to meet latency constraint, the position of the task access satellite in the CCG is determined first. Then, the expanded hop counts from all satellite nodes to the access satellite are calculated, which informs the partitioning of different node sets. Afterwards, considering both link and on-board computing resources, with the access satellite as the reference node, the minimum total task computing latency for each node set is obtained in an ascending order of the expanded hop counts. Finally, the minimum one among obtained latency values is the anticipated total task computing latency. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed task offloading strategy in reducing task computing latency.},

The algorithm comprehensively considers factors, such as AUV maneuverability, energy consumption, seabed topography, and obstacle avoidance. A key innovation is the hybrid enhancement using the greedy algorithm and the Cauchy mutation operator, which significantly boosts the algorithm’s evolutionary capabilities. In addition, the convergence factor of the traditional GWO algorithm is improved through the incorporation of the cosine law, addressing its inherent convergence limitations. A position update strategy, based on the sine cosine algorithm and iterative correlation of dynamic and static elements, is also introduced to better balance exploration and accelerate convergence. To tackle the orientation problem during GWO boundary processing, a novel approach is proposed that generates new individuals based on the minimum distance optimal weights. Simulation results demonstrate the superior performance of the IMMP-GWO algorithm in terms of computational complexity, convergence speed, and stability, validated through ablation studies and sensitivity analyses of key parameters. Overall, IMMP-GWO fulfills multi-AUV planning requirements and outperforms existing methods in various performance metrics.},

  abstract     = {Wireless sensor networks (WSNs), the fundamental sensing layer of the Internet of Things, are widely deployed in environmental monitoring, smart agriculture, and other fields. However, sensor nodes rely on limited battery power, and the intertwined issues of uneven energy consumption, node failure, and data loss in complex environments severely constrain network reliability and lifetime. To address these challenges, this article proposes an adaptive energy-efficient strategy based on location density awareness in wireless sensor networks (AEELD) protocol. This protocol introduces and optimizes the application of the clustering by fast search and find of density peaks (CFSFDPs) algorithm in WSNs, enhancing the cluster head selection process through improvements to the CFSFDP algorithm. In addition, an adaptive data transmission round adjustment mechanism is designed to dynamically regulate the number of transmission rounds based on the results of each clustering process. Furthermore, a cluster head state optimization mechanism is proposed, categorizing the energy levels of cluster heads. Data transmission is activated only when the energy meets specific requirements, effectively preventing network data loss and improving the utilization of limited node energy. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to low-energy adaptive clustering hierarchy (LEACH), improved LEACH, K-means algorithm supported by LEACH-KMe, and balanced residual energy-LEACH protocols, AEELD exhibits superior performance in key metrics such as network lifetime, total effective data transmission volume, and energy consumption balance among nodes, validating its effectiveness in practical deployments.},

To ensure the fault-tolerant cooperative operation of MAS, a networked-based fault interference estimator is developed to observe fault online. In addition, the optimized control design utilizes an actor-critic architecture to approximate Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman equation for MAS with nonlinear strict-feedback dynamics to realize optimal containment fault-tolerant control. Finally, the proposed optimal algorithm for MAS containment is validated through numerical simulations and practical multiple unmanned aerial vehicles systems (UAV). The proposed algorithm is named human-in-the-loop reinforcement learning with backstepping (HiRLBC).

This study investigates the adoption of polynomial petri fuzzy neural network (PPFNN) based controller in MGCs to address these challenges. The PPFNN-based controller combines the strengths of polynomial theory, Petri nets, and fuzzy neural networks, providing a robust framework for dynamic consensus and coordination among interconnected microgrids. Traditional control methods often fall short in dealing with the dynamic and stochastic nature of microgrid systems. The PPFNN-based controller, with its ability to combine the robustness of fuzzy logic and the learning capabilities of neural networks, offers a superior solution for maintaining voltage stability, frequency regulation, and efficient power sharing. This study demonstrates that adopting PPFNN-based controller not only improves the operational resilience of MGCs but also maintains voltage and frequency stability, enhances system robustness against disturbances. By leveraging the adaptive learning capabilities of neural networks and the logical structuring of Petri nets, PPFNN-based controller provides a sophisticated solution for the real-time operational demands of modern MGCs, ensuring a resilient and efficient power system.

Mobile cloud computing has recently been introduced to tackle these problems, especially in the context of the formation control problem. Therefore, in this article, the problem of formation producing control of multiquadcopter systems under asynchronous access to the cloud is investigated. Here, it is assumed that the quadcopters exchange the information fully through the cloud storage service while the calculation for motion control is carried out on the edge. The scheduling rule is also designed to make cloud access more efficient without the need for constant communication. The formation producing is achieved by designing consensus-based control laws for the altitude and the translational subsystems while guaranteeing the asymptotic convergence of the quadcopters’ positions to the biased average of the initial values. The results show that the modified controller after being applied through cloud access guarantees practical consensus with a calculated bounded error. The access to the cloud is achieved by designing a Zeno behavior-free scheduling rule.},

  abstract     = {Smart cities and their associated applications integrate various cutting-edge technologies, such as machine learning (ML) and edge computing (EC). ML-driven services within smart cities are often computationally intensive and time-sensitive. While EC serves as a complementary infrastructure to traditional cloud-end users architecture, enhancing the quality-of-service (QoS) for end users, the advent of ML-dependent services necessitates a redefinition of QoS to incorporate relevant ML performance metrics. On the other side, the limited computational capabilities of EC servers make such QoS metrics conflicting. Therefore, there is a tradeoff between system cost for running ML models and ML model performance. In this article, we present an effective offloading scheme designed for a three-layer cloud–edge–users system, aiming to optimize the performance-QoS tradeoff in the long run, especially for ML-dependent services, considering the dynamic of the system. Leveraging Lyapunov optimization techniques, we transform the offloading problem from a long-term perspective into a frame-based problem. Recognizing that the new per-frame problem is NP-hard, we introduce a tabu search-based algorithm, termed TSMALE, to address this challenge. Analytically, we demonstrate that our proposed TSMALE algorithm achieves an approximate solution of roughly 0.923 compared to the optimal solution.},

Finally, simulation results indicate that under the proposed algorithm, QoE of the proposed offloading scheme is 3.4 times higher than that of local offloading. Moreover, under the proposed offloading scheme, the QoE of the GGOA algorithm is 37.9% higher than that of the Gray Wolf algorithm, providing a more efficient and stable offloading service.},

Recent anomaly detection techniques employ dynamic graph representations to capture the complex interactions in networked systems that evolve over time. However, many existing methods focus on identifying anomalous node behavior and often rely on additional information, such as node features, node attributes, and edge features to detect them effectively. In this study, we propose a probabilistic approach to predict future anomalous links in dynamically evolving scale-free-like networks. Specifically, we introduce three probabilistic models exploiting the scale-free property of networked systems based on past communication patterns. We perform a grid search on the receiver operating characteristic curves of the proposed models to determine the best decision boundaries for identifying anomalous links. Our approach is able to determine the direction of future links and estimate their probabilities based on link orientations. We evaluate our proposed models on a synthetic dataset derived from a dynamically evolving real-world communication network. Our empirical results show that the accuracy rates of the proposed models change between 63.20% to 96.50%, while the F1 score is between 66.25% and 96.52%.

Existing relative localization methods face challenges, including the redundancy of range and localization errors, which are caused by the large-scale and long-range characteristics of AAV swarms. This article proposes a AAV group cooperative localization strategy based on multistage self-organizing clustering and super multidimensional scaling (SMDS), referred to as M-SMDS. First, to reduce the information range redundancy and improve the communication ability between clusters, the clustering problem is decomposed into a multistage competition between clusters using the idea of the empire game. Given the clustering objective and principle, it has been demonstrated that the proposed method has a stable clustering ability. Second, the M-SMDS combines interclustering and intraclustering range information. Specifically, the distance between each AAV and beacon AAV is inferred based on the relative distance among cluster members, heads, and the cluster group. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed strategy effectively enhances the communication transmission rate and localization accuracy of the AAV on a large scale, even under various GPS attacks.},

  abstract     = {Data analysis and monitoring on smart grids are jeopardized by attacks on cyber-physical systems. False data injection attack (FDIA) is one of the attack classes that targets smart measurement devices by injecting malicious data. Machine learning techniques are proven to be effective in detecting and localizing FDIAs. Training of such models requires centralized processing of sensitive user data that may not be plausible in a practical scenario. By employing federated learning, it is possible to train a model for the detection and localization of FDIAs while preserving the privacy of sensitive user data. However, federated learning introduces new problems, such as the personalization of the detectors in each node. In this article, we propose a federated learning-based scheme combined with a hybrid deep neural network architecture that exploits the local correlations between the connected power buses by employing graph neural networks as well as the temporal patterns in the data by using long short term memory layers. The proposed mechanism offers flexible and efficient training of an FDIA detector in a distributed setup while preserving the privacy of the clients.

The main goal is on overloading multiple transmission lines while maintaining a high level of stealth. The proposed model employs cluster-based approach to form distinct clusters, each representing different load patterns within the power system. This enables the design of attack vectors that seamlessly blend with these load patterns, thereby challenging advanced anomaly detection systems. The stealth of the attack is quantified by the Stealth Distance Index (SDI), ensuring that injected false data remain within the maximum permissible distance from the centroid of its corresponding cluster.

The aim of the present study is to improve the search efficiency through an enhanced bioinspired neural network method. In this work, a connected Glasius bioinspired neural network (CGBNN) model is introduced to address the lack of consideration for neuronal connectivity and transmission properties in existing studies. The dynamic search environment is represented by the changes in neurons' activity values, which guide the robots in performing the search task. Each robot automatically plans its search path according to the principle of the decreasing gradient of CGBNN activity values until the task is completed. Experimental results demonstrate that the robots can avoid different types of obstacles to complete the coverage search, confirming the effectiveness of the proposed method. Meanwhile, it indicates that the proposed method outperforms others, the coverage rate is improved by 6.90%, 6.22%, and 4.02% compared to the GBNN, A-RPSO, and DMPC algorithms, respectively.

  abstract     = {The current Internet struggles to meet the deterministic transmission requirements in terms of end-to-end delay. Time-sensitive networking (TSN) provides a solution by offering deterministic forwarding services for critical flows, ensuring strict latency requirements. However, the costs and complexity of hardware associated with TSN increases the barriers for researchers to build prototype for validating newly proposed queue scheduling algorithms. To address this dilemma, software-based simulation platforms are widely used for reduction of simulation expenses. However, these platforms cannot flexibly simulate various queue scheduling algorithms. Although existing programmable packet scheduling methods can adapt to TSN queue scheduling algorithms for common hardware base, they cannot be directly applied to software-based TSN simulation platforms. In response, we propose a novel lightweight software-defined packet scheduling primitive—first-in-pick-out (FIPO), based on the programmable switch behavior-model-version-2 (BMV2). FIPO is capable of expressing customized queue scheduling algorithms to support current TSN algorithms and can be flexibly extended to future algorithms. Particularly, FIPO consists only of multipriority queues and eligible time comparator to implement TSN queue scheduling with minimal computational and management overhead. We also propose a fine-grained logical queue-based flow queue mechanism to enhance FIPO. Finally, a lightweight prototype system for the FIPO is established, incorporating four customized deterministic scheduling algorithms. Extensive experimental results show that FIPO can quickly implement customized queue scheduling algorithms and simulate network conditions that closely resemble real environments. It also demonstrates increased implementation flexibility, achieving millisecond-level configuration times with only a moderate increase in CPU utilization (less than 10%).},

An active disturbance rejection control is utilized to design a disturbance observer for estimating the disturbances in the input channel. To enhance communication efficiency and reduce energy consumption during information interaction between agents, the disturbances estimator is integrated into the consensus controller to suppress these disturbances. The convergence condition and lower bound of DTSs are derived. Finally, numerical simulations validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. Note to Practitioners— The complete system composed of multiple controlled objects in industrial production, transportation, aerospace, and other fields is inevitably influenced by external uncertain signals to varying degrees. The disturbance observer-based control technique effectively addresses the robust consensus problem of MASs. This significantly enhances the stability of most controlled systems operating in complex environments. Simultaneously, the distributed DTSs efficiently reduce communication burden between devices, minimize microprocessor computing power requirements, and save substantial economic costs. Undoubtedly, this offers a novel approach for the development of MASs.},

The proposed novel protocol has the characteristics of traditional FRP time-triggered and event-triggered mechanisms. In addition, such protocol is able to avoid selecting sensors affected by DoS attacks. Subsequently, a set of dynamic output feedback controllers related to the selection of sensor nodes is designed to guarantee the finite-time boundedness of the closed-loop system with the prescribed $H_\infty$ performance. However, the co-design problem of protocol and dynamic control includes more nonlinear terms, making the problem more challenging to be solved. In order to address the co-design problem and enhance system performance, a genetic-algorithm-based controller design approach has been proposed.

When transmitting the local measurement output to the local controller and neighboring agents, a multiple description coding (MDC) scheme is introduced to reduce the communication burden and enhance data transmission reliability in a resource-constrained environment. The MDC scheme encodes each signal into two descriptions, which are then transmitted through separate channels, and decoding schemes are employed to address the different characteristics of the arrival of the two descriptions, ensuring the boundedness of the decoding error. The proposed consensus control scheme uses the relative decoded measurement errors between local agents and their neighbors. The aim is to design an output-feedback control scheme that ensures the error dynamics of the controlled MAS reach exponentially mean-square boundedness. Sufficient conditions are established for the existence of the controllers through stochastic analysis techniques, and the desired controller gains are parameterized using the feasibility of certain matrix inequalities. The effectiveness of the proposed coding-decoding-based consensus control scheme is verified through a numerical simulation.},

This article, thus, proposes a deep reinforcement learning based evolutionary architecture path selection method that considers uncertainties and interdependency. The approach employs an architecture framework to guide the design and defines SoS architecture decisions as the addition of systems and the allocation of operational architecture to physical architecture across sequential stages. Capability evaluation leverages a capability-activity-system structure, supported by a functional dependency network analysis method. Utilizing a deep neural network as a functional approximator to predict future SoS capability, the article develops a proximal policy optimization (PPO) algorithm that balances immediate and future needs. Applied to a mosaic warfare-oriented naval antisubmarine SoS, the proposed method outperforms heuristic optimization techniques by achieving higher SoS capability, reduced instability, and fewer violations of budget and intermediate requirements constraints in both deterministic and stochastic scenarios.

This article focuses on the distributed optimization of the WVCP$_{k}$ problem, where individual vertices, acting as rational agents, make decisions independently based on incomplete information. We formulate a Bayesian game model to capture the interactions among agents, who face the uncertainty to the statuses of their $k$-path neighbors and rely on communications to enhance their individual beliefs on the actual cover state. Our analysis delves into the Bayesian Nash equilibrium and the ex-post Pareto optimal cover state (POCS) within this framework. In addition, a Bayesian game-based perturbation parallel algorithm (BGPPA) is developed and shown to converge to the ex-post POCS set, even when agents are restricted to using only estimated expected utility.

This article analyzes the performance of the downlink STAR-RIS-aided short-packet (SP)-NOMA (STAR-RIS-SP-NOMA) network under the constraint of imperfect successive interference cancellation (ipSIC) and imperfect channel state information (ipCSI) by using a Nakagami-$m$ fading environment. To characterize the system performance, first, we derive the statistical distribution of cascaded Nakagami-$m$ channels using the Laguerre polynomial series approximation. Second, the approximate closed-form expressions in terms of average block error rate (ABLER), system throughput, goodput, latency, and reliability are derived. Third, the asymptotic analysis is also done at a high signal-to-noise ratio to gain further insights. Finally, the Monte Carlo simulations are performed to verify the correctness of the theoretical results. Numerical results validate the superiority of STAR-RIS-SP-NOMA over STAR-RIS-SP-orthogonal multiple access (OMA) (STAR-RIS-SP-OMA) and the conventional cooperative communication scenarios, such as decode and forward relay-assisted half-duplex-SP-OMA and fixed-gain amplify and forward relay-assisted half-duplex-SP-OMA.

  abstract     = {Narrowband Internet of Things (NB-IoT) is a technology specifically designated by the 3 rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) to meet the explosive demand for massive machine-type communications (mMTC), and it is evolving to RedCap. Industrial companies have increasingly adopted NB-IoT as the solution for mMTC due to its lightweight design and comprehensive technical specifications released by 3GPP. This article presents a system-level simulation framework for NB-IoT networks to evaluate their performance. The system-level simulator is structured into four parts: Initialization, pregeneration, main simulation loop, and postprocessing. In addition, three essential features are investigated to enhance coverage, support massive connections, and ensure low power consumption. Simulation results demonstrate that the cumulative distribution function curves of the signal-to-interference-and-noise ratio fully comply with industrial standards. Furthermore, the throughput performance explains how NB-IoT networks realize massive connections at the cost of data rate. This work highlights its practical utility and paves the way for developing NB-IoT networks.},

The planning algorithm works in multipassages environment containing obstacles with different shapes and dimensions. The shape of the formation is determined optimally to handle nonconvex constraints like obstacle avoidance, intercollision avoidance between agents and allowable range of cable forces for minimal swing motion. The optimization algorithm also considers the response of the system dynamics and ability of controllers in tracking the optimal path and formation shape. Three types of optimization-based path planning methods are presented called simultaneously all waypoints, waypoint by waypoint (WBW), and waypoints in risk. It is shown that the WBW method presents the best performance in terms of adjustment of the formation shape for passing through narrow passages in complex environment without external or internal collision.},

  abstract     = {Effective boundary scenario generation methods are critical for dynamic target tracking when evaluating the performance of unmanned aerial vehicles. However, traditional methods primarily rely on exhaustive testing or random sampling and often assume that different contributing factors are independent. This results in the ineffective generation of boundary scenarios and a lack of realism. In this study, a novel high-dimensional dynamic characteristics-based boundary test scenario generation method is proposed using reinforcement learning (RL). Boundary test scenarios can be explored more purposive, by designing an appropriate reward function. First, an innovative scenario modeling method is developed to model the influence of environment, occlusion, and other interference. A joint distribution model of the key correlation factors, such as light intensity and clouds, is also established. This ensures scenario authenticity and test accuracy. Subsequently, a high-dimensional dynamic spatial Markov decision process (HDDS-MDP) model is constructed to facilitate the generation of boundary scenarios based on the scenario modeling. Ultimately, RL is employed to solve the HDDS-MDP model and generate boundary test scenario, thereby substantially improves the effectiveness of boundary test scenario generation. The simulation results indicate that the boundary test scenario generation effectiveness is improved by 91% over random sampling methods.},

IT2FC sets are considered for a multiarea interconnected power network, followed by the implementation of a supervisory predictive control method for the entire system. It is demonstrated that the SIT2FPC method effectively addresses the challenges within the overall system. By incorporating a predictive controller as a robust supervisory control technique, the proposed method can effectively handle unexpected problems that may arise within the IT2FC units. In order to evaluate the efficiency and validity of the proposed robust SIT2FPC technique, it is applied to address the AGC problem in a four-area interconnected power grid. Also, the IEEE 39-bus power system is considered as a case study to validate the proposed AGC method.

First, a comprehensive simulation platform for the entire AAR docking system is established to generate reliable data. Then, to address the complex nature of AAR docking signals, VMD decomposes the data into modes with distinct natural frequencies, enhancing input accuracy. SSA optimizes the LSTM parameters, improving prediction accuracy and avoiding local minima. Based on these predictions, a docking safety evaluation network is developed to assess docking safety and prevent failures or collisions.

This article introduces a novel profit-oriented attack by some greedy VPP (G-VPP) for the first time, which aims to transfer its risk of economic losses to other normal VPPs (N-VPPs) and obtain a risk-free profit. Particularly, the G-VPP launches the load-altering attack (LAA) on N-VPPs to fail their real-time (RT) generation schedule via modifying the generation instructions of the managed resources. The optimal LAA strategy considering stealthiness is proposed to avoid priori detection and the optimal bidding strategy using CVaR is proposed to quantify bidding risk and maximize profit. To defend against such profit-oriented attacks, this article constitutes the first attack traceability research. A defense scheme with attack detection and attacker identification is proposed, which is executed by VPPs and the independent system operator (ISO). VPPs employ an attack detection algorithm based on complex features, and if any, report it to the ISO. The ISO constructs a knowledge graph of electricity market transactions and embeds a rules-based identification algorithm to identify suspected attackers. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the defense scheme and Neo4j is used to visualize.},

  abstract     = {Radar and communication coexistence (RCC) aims at improving the spectral efficiency of next generation wireless systems. One of the challenges facing RCC, however, is the mutual interference between the two coexisting subsystems. A reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) can thus be used to address such a challenge by optimizing its phase shifts along with the beamforming weights at the base station (BS). In this article, we aim to maximize the communication sum rate (SR), while limiting the interference toward the radar to a certain limit. Motivated by the unexplored fact that covariance matrices of RCC signals are Hermitian positive definite (HPD) and hence, can be represented over Riemannian manifolds (i.e., curved surfaces), the RCC SR maximization problem is reformulated as minimization of a Riemannian metric, which is the geodesic distance between the covariance matrices of the radar and the RIS-relayed signals. Such geometric reformulation paves the road for a low-complexity optimization approach over Riemannian manifolds, which simultaneously optimizes the beamforming weights and phase shifts at the BS and RIS, respectively. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed solution significantly increases the communication SR, while meeting the constraint on the interference toward radar. Equally important, the proposed optimization approach over Riemannian manifolds exhibits a reduced complexity compared to state-of-the-art algorithms over Euclidean spaces.},

Then, based on the estimated parameters, a distributed adaptive containment control protocol is proposed in a distributed fashion for nonlinear and uncertain MASs over dynamic digraphs. To tackle the challenges caused by the dynamic topology, the evolution of the dynamic topology of MASs is transformed into time-varying Markov chains. By analyzing the characteristics of time-varying Markov chains, the properties of some key matrices related to the dynamic topology are derived, which benefits the convergence analysis of containment control. By applying the proposed control protocol, the reference signals can be tracked by the leaders, while the followers' states are driven into the convex hull formed by leaders.

With advancements in quantum computing, quantum neural networks (QNNs) are showing unique advantages in information representation and processing. This study is the first to explore quantum reinforcement learning (QRL) for real-time job scheduling in cloud systems. Specifically, we propose a QRL framework that utilizes variational and encoding layers to convert state information into quantum data, repeatedly embedded into a QNN to compute optimal value returns. This approach aims to enhance QoS by improving job execution success rates and reducing average response times with unpredictable job arrivals. We present the detailed design of our approach, and our simulation results demonstrate that the QRL method significantly exceeds established baselines, including those based on DRL, across a range of workload intensities and computational resource configurations. This is particularly evident under high-load conditions, where our approach can achieve 55.2% higher success rates, underscoring its significant potential in cloud job scheduling optimization.},

The basis of this scheme is to minimize the maximum transmit power of antennas for each radar while adhering to the constraint of signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio for the targets. By transforming the formulated optimization problem into a convex problem, the Lagrangian duality theory is utilized to decompose the original problem into two sub-problems. Then, a subgradient projection method and an equivalent receive beamforming optimization method are developed to tackle the two sub-problems, yielding the optimal transmit beamformers for the radars. After obtaining the transmit and receive beamformers iteratively, the game relationship among radars is then formulated as a power control game, and the paper proves the existence and uniqueness of the Nash equilibrium. Furthermore, a centralized beamforming design problem is explored for comparative analysis, where the beamformers of all radars are jointly optimized to suppress power fluctuations among transmit antennas.

Subsequently, we have developed adaptive fuzzy distributed control protocols for each follower agent. The proposed consensus protocols have been demonstrated to ensure semiglobally uniformly ultimate boundedness for all system signals. Furthermore, we extend the control gain from constant to a state-dependent gain, delving into the globally uniformly ultimate boundedness of multiagent systems. To mitigate the intricacies arising from virtual control differentiation, command filtering is integrated with backstepping techniques, thereby streamlining the control process and enhancing overall system performance.

In reality, due to the poor infrastructure conditions on the battlefield, the communication services of the combat units are usually provided by the communication units with limited communication resources. Thus, figuring out an efficient method to share the scarce communication resources among massive combat units becomes crucial. However, it is challenging to efficiently construct the connection relationship and allocate communication resources to the operational units because of the differences in communication requirements and the randomness of location movement of combat units, i.e., unable to obtain battlefield environmental information in advance. In this article, we propose an online learning (OL)-based combat communication architecture construction method, which can estimate the current state of the battlefield environment by interacting with it and dynamically construct connection relationships and allocating communication resources according to the needs and locations of operational units, so as to maximize the QoE. The evaluation results demonstrate that our proposed OL-based approach is capable of constructing the combat communication architecture in a flexible and efficient manner, surpassing existing methods in terms of efficiency and fairness by significantly enhancing the total QoE up to twice as much compared to baseline methods.},

  abstract     = {This article investigates the model-free fault-tolerant bipartite consensus of multiagent systems under directed topology. The radial basis function neural network (RBFNN)-based fault estimation technique is constructed for acquiring unknown actuator faults information directly, in which the topology structure and the information interaction among agents are adequately considered. Compared with the existing method, updating weights using RBFNN estimation is avoided. By utilizing the obtained fault estimation, a distributed model-free adaptive fault-tolerant control (FTC) strategy is developed to achieve bipartite consensus. Unlike other bipartite consensus control techniques, the constructed FTC mechanism does not require accurate system model and structure information, and uses solely the agents' input/output data. Finally, a simulation is performed to verify the proposed mechanism's efficacy.},

  abstract     = {Developing and fielding complex systems requires proof that they are reliably correct with respect to their design and operating requirements. Especially for autonomous systems, which exhibit unanticipated emergent behavior, fully enumerating the range of possible correct and incorrect behaviors is intractable. Therefore, we propose an optimization-based search technique for generating high-quality, high-variance, and nontrivial data, which captures the range of correct and incorrect responses a system could exhibit. This manifold between desired and undesired behavior provides a more detailed understanding of system reliability than traditional testing or Monte Carlo simulations. After discovering data points along the manifold, we apply machine learning techniques to quantify the decision manifold's underlying mathematical function. Such models serve as correctness properties, which can be utilized to enable both verification during development and testing, as well as continuous assurance during operation, even amidst system adaptations and dynamic operating environments. This method can be applied in combination with a simulator in order to provide evidence of dependability to system designers and users, with the ultimate aim of establishing trust in the deployment of complex systems. In this proof-of-concept, we apply our method to a software-in-the-loop evaluation of an autonomous vehicle.},

The composed IoT service is the output of multiple microservices, executed at computationally capable edge or fog nodes, which we consider as the facility nodes (FNs). However, the service composition process in IoT microservice architectures is abstracted from the users that gives freedom to the FNs to act maliciously and provide low-quality IoT services. Further, the service composition needs to be transparent so that the FNs involved in a service cannot repudiate their involvement at a later time. In this article, we propose a novel, lightweight, trustworthy, and verifiable service composition framework for IoT-based systems that adopt microservice architecture. First, we propose a dynamic programming approach to select trustworthy FNs for each user request, while considering the trust scores of the FNs and the delay requirements of the users. Next, we propose a transparent service composition framework that uses lightweight cryptography functions to generate the proof-of-involvement for the FNs in each service. With the help of a trust controller, we verify the proofs generated by the FNs and update the trust scores of the FNs. Considering the user traces from Berlin city in the simulation of urban mobility tool, we show the efficacy of the proposed framework in maximizing user trust and detecting malicious FNs involved in user services. Further, we show that the delay and communication overhead of the proposed framework are very low compared to the state-of-the-art methods.},

Considering the mainstream status of wireless communication in modern multiagent systems and the differences in the performance of interagent communication devices, we believe that it is appropriate to use directed heterogeneous networks (DHNs) to model distributed heterogeneous multiagent systems. This model not only reflects the directionality of interagent communication but also reflects the complexity of communication due to performance differences, thus providing a more accurate framework for understanding and optimizing system behavior. The study of disintegration in DHNs is vital for enhancing the decision-making agility of DHMAS. We introduce Directed heterogeneous network Attack sequence inference through graph attention MAtrix Generation Embedding and reinforcement learning (DAMAGE), an algorithm that integrates graph neural networks and reinforcement learning within an inductive reasoning framework. DAMAGE is designed to optimize the generation of disintegration strategies, improving the efficiency of network breakdown processes. Our approach includes a directed network embedding technique with a graph attention matrix generation module, which enhances the utilization of imperfect network structure information. Through ablation studies, we demonstrate that DAMAGE not only increases the effectiveness of network disintegration under perfect topological conditions but also maintains robustness in scenario with imperfect topological information.},

In particular, the physical-layer security of an ARIS-NOMA system is investigated when the system is subject to eavesdropping by a malicious user in a user pair group. To provide real-world impact, we examine the main system performance metrics, including the connection outage probability, the secrecy outage probability (SOP), and the strictly positive secrecy capacity, which are important guidelines in evaluating the system's reliability, security, and achievable secrecy rates. We evaluate the impact of distances between the ARIS, the eavesdropper, and the base station on the SOP.

The ever-evolving nature of 5G networks results in fluctuations in traffic patterns over time, leading to a phenomenon known as model drift. Consequently, accurately predicting and identifying cellular traffic patterns becomes a complex task. To tackle this challenge, this article introduces an innovative approach called TL-ConvLSTM, which combines transfer learning with convolutional long short-term memory (ConvLSTM) to effectively combat model drift and provide precise forecasting and recognition of cellular traffic within the network. To accomplish this, we initiate the training of TL-ConvLSTM by estimating its parameters from the source domain. We then employ the Kolmogorov–Smirnov method to adapt the model within the target domain, fine tuning its weights. To improve the precision of this model adaptation, we systematically explore optimal learning windows. This exploration includes adjusting window size for time-series data and feature dimensions to capture dynamic traffic patterns in a 5G environment. Furthermore, we make use of the Amarisoft 5G testbed in our lab to create a 12-day time-series dataset. This dataset includes various features related to traffic flows and their patterns. We showcase the effectiveness of our approach through a set of experiments.},

Furthermore, learned collective motion skills can be transferred from a point mass simulation onto real mobile robots using our domain transfer architecture, without loss of quality.

This is because conventional MARL algorithms usually operate under the assumption of fully cooperative behavior among all agents and focus on maximizing team rewards during training. To address this issue, we introduce the personality modeling network (PeMN), which includes a cooperation value function and personality parameters to model the varied interactions in high-interactive scenarios. The PeMN also enables the training of a background traffic flow with diverse behaviors, thereby improving the performance and generalization of the ego vehicle. Our extensive experimental studies, which incorporate different personality parameters in high-interactive driving scenarios, demonstrate that the personality parameters effectively model diverse driving styles and that policies trained with PeMN demonstrate better generalization than traditional MARL methods.},

  abstract     = {The age of information (AoI) has recently gained recognition as a critical quality-of-service (QoS) metric for quantifying the freshness of status updates, playing a crucial role in supporting massive ultrareliable and low-latency communications (mURLLCs). In mURLLC scenarios, status updates generally involve the transmission through applying finite blocklength coding (FBC) to efficiently encode small update packets while meeting stringent error-rate and latency-bounded QoS constraints. However, due to inherent system dynamics and varying environmental conditions, optimizing AoI under such multi-QoS constraints often results in nonconvex and computationally intractable problems. Motivated by the demonstrated efficacy of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) in addressing large-scale networking challenges, this work aims to apply DRL techniques to derive optimal resource allocation solutions in real time. Despite its potential, the effective integration of FBC in DRL-based AoI optimization remains underexplored, especially in addressing the challenge of simultaneously upper bounding both delay and error rate. To address these challenges, we propose a DRL-based framework for AoI-aware optimal resource allocation in mURLLC-driven multi-QoS schemes, leveraging AoI as a core metric within the finite blocklength regime. First, we design a wireless communication architecture and AoI-based modeling framework that incorporates FBC. Second, we proceed by deriving upper bounded peak AoI and delay violation probabilities using stochastic network calculus. Subsequently, we formulate an optimization problem aimed at minimizing the peak AoI violation probability through FBC. Third, we develop DRL algorithms to determine optimal resource allocation policies that meet statistical delay and error-rate requirements for mURLLC. Finally, to validate the effectiveness of the developed schemes, we have executed a series of simulations.},

The results prove that the input conditions significantly affect the optimal NoC. Comparisons are made with Monte Carlo simulation to justify the proposed application, showing that the computational time reduction provided by the clustering algorithm reaches up to ∼99% . Since the optimal NoC increases dramatically with the size of the input database, guidelines are proposed to reduce the MPPF dimensionality for more effective probabilistic procedures.},

  abstract     = {The growth of distributed renewable energy in microgrids (MGs) raises challenges in energy management and consumption. As an innovative approach, peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading offers a promising solution to address these problems. In this article, we propose a bi-layer decentralized (BLD) optimization algorithm for P2P energy trading in multimicrogrids (MMG). Compared with traditional optimization algorithms that are single-layer decentralized (i.e., decentralizing solely at inter-MG trading and typically centralizing prosumers within the MG), the proposed algorithm achieves bi-layer decentralization (i.e., decentralization extends to both inter-MG and intra-MG trading). In this way, the BLD algorithm can significantly preserve the information privacy and decision independence of prosumers. In addition, the proposed algorithm can efficiently manage power flow in a decentralized manner at both layers, whereas existing decentralized algorithms frequently neglect this critical feature. Furthermore, an accelerated BLD (ABLD) algorithm is proposed to address time-consuming issues in this nested P2P trading for MMG. Numerical simulations on various test systems demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. The results indicate that the error of the proposed algorithm is below 0.1%. In addition, BLD requires 15602.03 s to converge with 560 prosumers, while ABLD only requires 228.05 s.},

  abstract     = {The security of distance relays in zone 3 is critical for preventing catastrophic blackouts, especially during stressed conditions. However, the challenge lies in distinguishing between short-circuit faults and system disturbances, e.g., load encroachment, power swing, out-of-step condition, and voltage instability, which can mimic fault conditions and lead to improper relay operation. To address this issue, this article presents a new local protection method by employing three innovative indices: the out-of-step detection index, the positive-sequence impedance angle (PSIA) index, and the superimposed PSIA index. These indices are derived from theoretical principles and are tailored to effectively discriminate between faults and system disturbances. As a major novelty, the determination of indices threshold values is extracted based on the theoretical relationships and further validated through comprehensive static and dynamic analyses. The algorithm's effectiveness is evaluated under various stressed conditions through multiple simulations, showing its ability to distinguish between stressed conditions and short-circuit faults, even in the presence of inverter-based resources. This leads to enhanced power system reliability and security. The proposed method is also cost-effective as it is implemented in the local distance relay, eliminating the need for synchrophasor devices and communication infrastructure.},

Strengthening critical branches in a power network is crucial for mitigating the risk of blackouts resulting from cascading failures. In this article, we propose a time-efficient greedy search method to identify critical branches in a power network. We address the challenge of computational constraints by using a failure propagation graph, which accurately captures the critical failure propagation patterns based on cascading failure simulation. Our approach minimizes cascading failure risk while strategically reinforcing a limited number of branches. The failure-propagation-graph greedy-search (FPG-GS) algorithm selects candidate branches based on cascading failure simulation and iteratively identifies the most crucial branches. Our experimental results on different power systems demonstrate the superior performance and efficiency of the FPG-GS algorithm compared to existing methods. In addition, our study highlights the importance of strategic branch selection, showing that reinforcing one-fifth of the branches can achieve a mitigation rate exceeding 80%.},

Enabling caching capabilities has been regarded as a promising way to reduce the high-delay pressure of file delivery on the backhaul links. However, file delivery has different requirements on quality-of-service, and the increased densification of small base stations will consume more energy, thus it is essential to solve the problem of delay and energy in cache-enabled HetCNets. In this article, we employ a utility function with the weighted sum of energy consumption and delay cost to formulate the delay-energy tradeoff optimization problem that is a kind of multiobjective optimization problem. Considering a jointly performed mechanism comprising power control, user association, and content caching, the optimization problem is further decomposed into the primal problem and the main problem by generalized Benders decomposition method. Here, the primal problem is related to power-aware user association that dynamically associates with the base station, and the main problem is related to content caching. Furthermore, an iterative power-aware user association and content caching algorithm (PAUA-CC) is proposed.

To achieve this, a utility function is developed to evaluate the coalition structure, transmit power consumption, and tracking accuracy. Then, by formulating the cooperative interactions among radars as a coalition game, we establish an optimization model to optimize the coalition structure and power allocation for the distributed radar network. The existence of the Nash equilibrium solution for the game is proven mathematically. To address the optimization model, an iterative three-step algorithm is developed based on the sequential quadratic programming. Numerical results reveal that the presented JCFPA strategy obtains superior system performance compared to other benchmarks.},

To this end, a prescribed-time enclosing and tracking controller is proposed first, guaranteeing that multiple fixed-wing AAVs converge to the desired trajectories within a prescribed time subject to motion and visibility constraints. Then, considering the dilemma of the input saturation and prescribed-time convergence, a basis for selecting the proper prescribed time is analyzed by mathematical formulations.

Then, an optimization problem is formulated to minimize the maximum E2E DEP among all actuators by jointly designing AP working mode, UL and DL blocklengths under the E2E delay constraint. We propose the estimation of distribution algorithm-differential evolution (EDA-DE) method with low complexity to obtain a near-optimal solution, where the block coordinate descent is used to divide this problem into two parts. The first AP working mode selection is solved by EDA, and the second UL and DL blocklengths are designed by DE.

  abstract     = {Numerous mission-critical unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) operations, such as rescue and surveillance missions, are conducted in areas lacking access to external infrastructure providing precise positioning information. To enhance situational awareness in such scenarios, millimeter wave (mmWave, $\text{30}-\text{300}$ GHz) and subterahertz (sub-THz, $\text{100}-\text{300}$ GHz) range or Doppler radars promising large resolution can be employed. However, the small antenna apertures in these bands naturally call for the use of massive antenna arrays to achieve reasonable detection distances. By employing directional antenna arrays, these radars need to exhaustively scan the surroundings to ensure situational awareness of a UAV in a swarm. The aim of this article is to characterize the system-level performance of mmWave/sub-THz range and Doppler radars as a function of system parameters by accounting for the propagation specifics of the considered bands. To this aim, we combine the tools of stochastic geometry and antenna simulations to determine the optimal half-power beamwidth that minimizes the full scanning time while maximizing the detection probability of all UAVs in a swarm. Our results demonstrate that both types of radars are characterized by qualitatively similar performance. Detection performance is highly sensitive to both UAV density and coverage radius, as the increase in these parameters leads to an abrupt drop in the detection performance. At small distances, $\leq\!\text{50}$ m, antenna arrays with a smaller number of elements result in the best tradeoff between scanning time and detection probability. Specifically, both types of radars provide perfect knowledge of the surroundings (with detection probability higher than 0.99) within a 50-m radius with a scanning time of less than 1 ms. At greater distances, $\geq\! \text{100}$ m, the only option to improve performance is a drastic increase in the emitted power or receiver sensitivity.},

Therefore, this article proposes $\mathcal {H}_{\infty }$ resilient bipartite control method to address the security problem of network information interaction among agents within competitive and cooperative multiagent systems. When the communication networks among agents are subject to a replay attack, the system model integrating multisensor weight fusion with an unknown input leader is established first. Then, a detection fusion algorithm is proposed to simultaneously uncover attacker behavior and identify tampered sensors. Considering the intermittent or interrupted communication resulting from the time variability of topology switching among agents, the switching topology is modeled by a semi-Markov process within a signed graph having positive and negative interaction weights. Subsequently, a distributed observer is designed to estimate the unknown input leader, utilizing the semi-Markov interactions among agents and incorporating an adaptive update mechanism to eliminate the dependency on global topology information. Ulteriorly, by solving convex optimization problems, a distributed resilient bipartite controller relying on the observer state is formulated, and achieves the expected $\mathcal {H}_{\infty }$ performance while remaining resilient against replay attacks. Finally, the superiority of the proposed method is validated through comparative examples.},

  abstract     = {In the affine formation maneuver control for multiagent systems with a leader-follower structure, external disturbances easily cause deformation of the formation shape, thereby affecting a series of cascading reactions. Hence, robustness against disturbances in affine formation control has been a subject remaining to be determined. To address this problem, a continuous robust controller is introduced in this study, leveraging the robust integral of the sign of the error (RISE) approach, aiming to suppress external disturbances while ensuring efficient convergence speed of the system under various collective formation maneuvers determined by the leader. The controller is designed to handle two types of disturbance models: one involving general disturbances and the other considering time-delay disturbances. It consists of formation tracking terms based on stress matrices and graph theory, as well as disturbance suppression terms utilizing RISE. Sufficient conditions for the stability of affine formations under both types of disturbances are derived. By designing a Lyapunov function that integrates a class-P function, the exponential stability of the closed-loop system is rigorously demonstrated. Finally, simulation results are provided to verify the performance and effectiveness of the proposed control strategy.},

  abstract     = {This article explores the adaptive event-triggered output consensus control problem for a class of switched stochastic multiagent systems (MASs) with unmeasured states and unknown nonlinearity. First, in order to overcome the limitations facing the average dwell-time method of consensus for switched MASs proposed in the existing works, the adaptive control protocol within the framework of mode-dependent average dwell time (MDADT) is introduced to expand the scope of applications. Furthermore, through a novel gain-scheduled state observer, the fuzzy logic systems are applied to approximate the unknown nonlinear functions. The dynamic surface design method is used to remove the need for derivative calculations of the constructed virtual controls, significantly the complexity of calculations. In addition, under the framework of backstepping design, the switching threshold event-triggered control strategy is developed to effectively decrease the communication load and balance the performance of MASs. The proposed control protocol ensures that all signals within the closed-loop systems are ultimately bounded under the MDADT switching property. Finally, the simulation results are obtained to validate the proposed control mechanism.},

  abstract     = {Maintaining service reliability, achieving sustainability, and ensuring energy efficiency are crucial for green high-performance computing systems. Balancing these factors is a key challenge for modern green data centers. In this research, we propose a monitoring, visualization, and management system for green data centers (MVMS-GDC). Our comprehensive automated platform includes “monitoring system” and “rules and policy management” modules. The “monitoring system” gathers and visualizes time series data from all resources of a green data center, tracking essential metrics and measurements. It audits green energy, microgrid, climate conditions, workloads, hardware, CPU and memory usage, cluster component health, computing node activities, and network health and quality metrics. The “rules and policy management” module defines and enforces policies to balance resources, ensuring a reliable, sustainable, scalable, and efficient computing environment. We implemented, tested, and evaluated the MVMS-GDC system using green energy at the Zephyr data center located at the GLEAMM site. Our results demonstrate at least a 4.9% improvement in performance, at least a 4% increase in energy efficiency, and a reduction of at least 4% in job losses. The MVMS-GDC system also enhances scalability by employing a policy machine for each compute node, which automates power state control (on, off, or hibernation) based on monitoring observations. This automated approach ensures efficient and dynamic scaling, making MVMS-GDC suitable for large and highly distributed data centers. Overall, MVMS-GDC provides a robust solution for balancing energy availability and computational needs, optimizing performance, and maintaining energy efficiency in green data centers.},

Besides, the demand for server computational resources increasingly ascends as the volume of processing tasks grows. However, in reality, many devices have similar computing tasks and require the same computing data. Therefore, servers can effectively reduce server computing latency and bandwidth costs by caching task data. This investigation explores task security offloading and data caching optimization strategies in scenarios with multiple interfering devices. With the goal of minimizing the total energy consumption, the UAV trajectories, transmission power, task offloading scheduling strategies, and caching decisions is jointly optimized. The corresponding optimization problem, which consists of mixed integer nonlinear programming problem, is formulated. To make this problem solved, the original problem is decomposed into three tiers, and an iterative algorithm named CDSFS which is based on the coordinate descent, successive convex approximation, and flow shop scheduling is proposed. Simulation results demonstrate the stability and superiority of the proposed algorithm.},

Subsequently, to overcome the phase lag defect of the linear integrator, we propose a new PI-based protocol with a split-path nonlinear integrator. The nonlinear consensus protocol can not only ensure that the system achieves asymptotic consensus, but also enhance the transient performance with respect to overshoot.

The challenge is to accurately monitor deep parameters in real-time during synchronization, although existing digital twin technologies have made good progress in monitoring shallow parameters. This study proposes a virtual-real synchronization method for digital twins of an aeroengine gas path system (AGPS) based on deep reinforcement learning (RL). First, the parameters are divided into directly measurable parameters (DMP) and nondirectly measurable parameters (NDMP). Then, different algorithms are applied to different types of parameters. An unscented Kalman filtering algorithm is utilized to aid in the synchronization of the DMP. An RL approach is employed to train parameter inference models for the NDMP. By combining the two algorithms, synchronization between these two parameter classes is achieved. This method excels by integrating the NDMP into the virtual-real synchronization of the AGPS digital twin, concurrently reducing the inference time for this specific segment. Comparative experiments are conducted, and the results indicate an effective improvement in the accuracy of parameter inference with the proposed method. Simultaneously, it ensures real-time and robust parameter inference.},

This article explores optimal UAV positioning to maximize coverage in hybrid aerial–ground communication links. Exploiting a probabilistic line-of-sight (LOS) model, we examine coverage radius behavior in mixed urban and suburban environments to meet specific quality-of-service (QoS) targets. The analysis reveals that the coverage radius expands as the probability of LOS increases, which in turn increases with the UAV height. However, beyond a certain height, path loss becomes dominant, and further increases in altitude negatively impact the coverage radius. By studying the maximum coverage radius for minimum signal strength and spectral efficiency requirements, we numerically determine a configuration space of UAV altitudes and the corresponding maximum radius that satisfies the target QoS. The results illustrate a dual-regime behavior, where coverage increases with altitude up to a certain value, beyond which it declines, indicating the existence of an optimal altitude for reliability. In addition, the analysis of ground surface effects shows that flying over concrete surfaces significantly enhances coverage, offering a radius up to five times larger compared to rough, vegetated surfaces.},

However, the SQSM scheme attains a high spectral efficiency and good performance but suffers from a high computational complexity with mMIMO systems. In this article, we propose an efficient low-complexity detection framework for the SQSM scheme. Sparsity detection is amalgamated in this article with minimum mean-square error (MMSE) detector by decoupling the detection of the real and imaginary vector streams. Unfortunately, the MMSE-based detector has a matrix inversion which incurs a high computational complexity. Therefore, we employed several iterative methods; i.e., conjugate gradient and Gauss–Seidel, to avoid the exact matrix inversion, and hence, the computational complexity is significantly reduced. Moreover, the proposed framework can host other iterative methods such as the JA, successive over relaxation, accelerated over relaxation, Neumann series, Newton iteration, two-parameter over relaxation, and Richardson methods. The proposed detection framework attains a significant complexity reduction with a small or insignificant deterioration in the performance.},

Conventional simulation-based assessment methods are typically time-consuming because a series of scenario-specific optimization problems must be solved as a prerequisite. Thus, a spatial-temporal graph-based approach is proposed for fast resilience assessment to provide timely warning information. The key factors, including observable meteorological information, component vulnerabilities, emergency dispatch, and repair strategies, are modeled in the form of matrices that depict the spatial and temporal relationships. Based on these matrices, a spatiotemporal graph neural network is developed to fit the mapping relationship between observable states and resilience indicators, which is trained offline and enables fast assessment via forward inference. Regarding the uncertainties of various extreme scenarios, the evaluation procedure combines the whole-process simulation and single-state replay technologies, which can respectively consider the uncertainties and provide deterministic data labeling for assessment. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is verified on the benchmarks, including the IEEE 118-bus system and a realistic 2868-bus system.},
