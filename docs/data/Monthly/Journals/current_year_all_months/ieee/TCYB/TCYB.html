  abstract     = {This brief proposes an optimized time-synchronized control method based on reinforcement learning for the bipartite consensus tracking problem. The study considers multiagent system comprising leaders and followers, where followers interact through signed directed graphs. Some agents track the leader’s state, while others converge to its opposite value. The proposed method employs a time-synchronized sliding mode control framework to ensure fixed-time bipartite consensus among agents with signed interaction topology. Reinforcement learning is integrated to optimize the control process, wherein an actor–critic architecture is utilized to minimize the Bellman residual, enabling optimal control performance. Theoretical analysis proves the fixed-time convergence and Bellman optimality of the system, with the upper bound of convergence time explicitly determined by controller parameters. Simulation experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed method: all followers simultaneously achieve bipartite consensus within a fixed time, while reinforcement learning significantly and adaptively optimizes the control process.},

First, to avoid collisions with obstacles, a safe reference trajectory planning method is proposed, which dynamically projects unsafe segments of a reference trajectory onto the outer boundary of obstacle regions, enabling the agent to bypass the obstacle. Second, by using only input-output information, a distributed tracking controller incorporating two dynamical barrier functions is designed, which allows the agent to adaptively decelerate within the coverage range of the barrier function to avoid collisions. Finally, sufficient conditions are provided to ensure that the agent can successfully bypass obstacles using the proposed control strategy.

This article introduces an efficient encryption mechanism configured for securing the physical layer communication in these systems while transmitting data over optical fiber networks using orthogonal frequency division multiplexing active optical networks. The proposed scheme takes advantage of the hypersensitive chaotic properties of the Lorenz map to provide robust multidimensional encryption and confidentiality. The encryption process involves arranging bulk encoded codewords in a table structure shape, with each column representing individual codewords encoded by pipelined successive cancellation polar encoding. A Lorenz map is then utilized to generate three distinct chaotic keys, which are employed to reindex the rows and columns of the table structured codeword along with the subcarrier remapping in the constellation map. This reindexing operation provides an additional layer of security against potential brute-force attacks. Performance metrics such as computational efficiency, security robustness, and resistance to various noise and distortion sources are being evaluated. The experimental results demonstrate promising levels of security and resilience against potential threats on the physical layer of communications. The scheme’s compatibility with the technical environment ensures seamless integration into existing CCSs infrastructure, making it a resilient solution for securing critical physical layer transmissions.},

To tackle the dynamic uncertainty while maintaining safety constraints on system state, a novel hierarchical formation control framework is presented. First, a nonlinear mapping function (NMF) is introduced, which, by integrating HOFA theory, effectively transforms the original constrained system into an unconstrained HOFA tracking error model, thus removing the feasibility conditions typically required in traditional barrier Lyapunov function methods. Subsequently, distributed observers are designed in the upper layer for followers to estimate the leader’s information, while an adaptive formation controller is directly constructed for each follower in the lower layer using the fully actuated theory. Particularly, the neural network approximators are used to learn unknown nonlinear dynamics. By employing Lyapunov stability theory, the designed formation controller guarantees that the entire state stays within the specified constraint set while also ensuring the desired formation performance. Finally, the developed formation control algorithm is proven effective by applying it to a network of multiple robotic arm systems.},

This control method eliminates the model dependence and simplifies the control strategy synthesis by employing a compact form dynamic linearization data model, which is constructed from real-time output torque and input current measurements of the MRFDC. Furthermore, based on the proposed data model, the DSMC is employed based on a minimum operator sliding mode reaching law to deal with the rate-dependent hysteresis and nonlinearity of the MRFDC. Experimental studies validate that the presented control method provides satisfactory torque tracking performance in both transient and steady states.},

The negative deviation effects between the event-triggered controller and the continuous controller are eliminated by introducing two intermediate sampling deviation terms. Moreover, a performance function is introduced to achieve more flexible tracking performance. This function represents different performance behaviors and addresses the issue of redesigning controllers.

To solve this problem, the multiplicative noise Gaussian perturbation strategy and the additive noise linear fusion strategy are proposed to capture fault information beyond source domain distributions. The former is used to randomly perturb feature statistics of multisource domains to simulate the uncertainty of domain shift, while the latter is used to perform the additive noise linear operation on feature statistics of multiple source domains to ensure the authenticity of the generated feature styles. Further, the feature statistics generated by both strategies are mixed with random convex weights to obtain new feature styles, achieving the best compromise between reliability and diversity. The network can learn more fault information from features with diversified styles. Extensive experimental results on both public and real datasets verify the effectiveness of our approach.},

  abstract     = {This article investigates the adaptive resilient flexible output containment (FOC) control problem for semi-Markov jump fully heterogeneous multiagent systems (FHMASs) under random switching topologies and denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. In contrast to most existing containment control results, the proposed control strategy can address the challenges posed by the full heterogeneity of multiagent systems (MASs), particularly when multiple leaders exhibit different system dynamics. To better reflect real-world MASs and communication networks, multiple asynchronous semi-Markov chains are employed for the first time to capture system parameter variations and communication topology switching, incorporating generally uncertain transition rates (TRs). In order to deal with this problem, a novel adaptive observer-based FOC control framework is developed. First, by introducing an adaptive gain, the adaptive resilient observers can observe leaders’ states without prior knowledge of global topology information and TRs, while resisting the impacts of random switching topologies and DoS attacks. Then, a dynamic output feedback controller is designed to ensure the achievement of FOC. Notably, the containment coefficients in the controller design are no longer tied to the Laplacian matrix and can be flexibly predefined to align with specific task requirements. Furthermore, the linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) to obtain estimator gain matrices and controller gain matrices are derived for the case of generally uncertain TRs, respectively. Finally, the effectiveness of the theoretical method is demonstrated through the simulation.},

This article investigates a collaborative scheduling problem in a cascaded dual-shop production setting.

In addition, real-world production often involves a mode where main and suborders must be integrated through mating operations. This study formulates an energy-efficient cascaded dual-shop collaborative scheduling problem with the mating operation (ECDCSP-M). The focus is on developing a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model for the ECDCSP-M and designing an end-to-end graph-based deep reinforcement learning (GDRL) approach. A dual-shop heterogeneous graph is constructed to capture the real-time state of the entire system, in which “job-factory” and “operation-machine” pairs are defined as agent actions. A heterogeneous graph neural network (HGNN) is then proposed, employing a three-stage embedding mechanism to model complex relationships, including mating operations. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves strong generalization across varying problem complexities and provides robust solutions to challenging scheduling scenarios.},

  abstract     = {In wastewater treatment process (WWTP), the dissolved oxygen concentration (DOC) sensor fault provides incorrect data to the control system, affecting the blower operation. This leads to insufficient aeration and increases the risk of membrane fouling. To solve this problem, a robust model-free fault-tolerant controller (RMFFTC) is designed. First, the pseudo partial derivative (PPD) approach is utilized to transform nonlinear WWTP into a compact form dynamic linearization (CFDL) data model with residual disturbances. Then, according to the CFDL model, a robust fault detection threshold is designed by the extended state observer (ESO) to timely detect the occurrence of faults. Second, after detecting the DOC sensor fault, the fault is estimated using the fuzzy neural network (FNN) considering that the fault is unknown. Third, an improved RMFFTC is designed based on the fault estimation information. In particular, to ensure stable DOC tracking under sensor faults, the controller design considers the output tracking error variation. In addition, the bounded-input–bounded-output (BIBO) stability result is provided to theoretically guarantee the usefulness of the proposed RMFFTC for DOC control affected by the sensor fault. Finally, the effectiveness of the RMFFTC are verified through extensive simulations in the membrane bioreactor (MBR) model.},

Initially, the silicon single crystal growth systems are modeled by using the geometrical models of meniscus section, hydrodynamic and heat transfer process of silicon single crystal growth. Since numerous unmeasurable state variables exist in systems and the growth equipments are affected by external and internal disturbances, consideration is given to employing the output feedback control scheme and disturbance observer method in the construction of the anti-disturbance switching controller. Meanwhile, considering the high accuracy of linear systems at equilibrium points, the silicon single crystal growth systems are divided into multiple subsystems using switching control method, that is, multiple equilibrium points are set to enable the systems to switch between different subsystem models, thereby the precision of silicon single crystal growth systems has been improved. Then, using the multiple Lyapunov function method and linear matrix inequality technique, the exponential stability of silicon single crystal growth systems is ensured with the $\boldsymbol {H_{\infty }}$ performance. Finally, the feasibility of designed switching anti-disturbance output feedback control method is verified through actual parameters of silicon single crystal growth systems.},

Furthermore, a generalized Halanay-like inequality (GHLI) is proposed to address the effects of time scale discontinuities and DoS attacks on sampling intervals. Compared with the common Halanay inequality (CHI) used in continuous-time sampled-data systems, the GHLI accommodates TSTSs and permits some sampling intervals that exceed the constraints of the CHI.

The false injection information of the attack is generated by a stochastic inverse dynamics system satisfying the stochastic input-to-state stable condition, and the input of the system depends on the relevant output information of neighboring agents, rather than all state information. In this case, we develop a novel distributed output feedback consensus control algorithm to overcome the impact of attacks and stochastic disturbances. First, we design the distributed linear controller with a compensator for each follower based on the relevant outputs, and provide sufficient conditions for ensuring its effectiveness. Then, we construct a new candidate Lyapunov function with a power constant that is used to relax the constraints of the attack model. Subsequently, by means of the exchanging supply function approach, we strictly prove that all agents can achieve leader-following full-state bounded consensus in probability.

To address this problem, a dual event-triggered spatial model predictive control (DET-SMPC) under a data-driven framework is investigated for distributed thermal processes to achieve good global performance. The spatiotemporal model is built utilizing the time/space theorem and updated to accommodate the time-varying system dynamics. Since the controller effect will be affected when the model is switched, it is necessary to identify the preferable switching mode. Therefore, an adaptive MU approach based on an error-triggered generator is proposed. Subsequently, ET-model predictive control (MPC), the controller activation threshold derived from the Lyapunov function, is introduced. The controller will only be activated when the threshold is triggered, resulting in better performance. The availability of the dual event-triggered spatial MPC (DET-SMPC) is confirmed through both simulation studies and oven experiments.},

This assumption ensures that the subsequence of solutions sampled at impulsive moments is a Markov chain. Based on this assumption and the semi-tensor product (STP), random impulsive BCNs (RI-BCNs) can be converted into impulsive-interval driven probabilistic BCNs (ID-PBCNs), and the input-state transition probability matrix (IS-TPM) is constructed, the calculations of convergent target set in the hybrid domain and the time domain are discussed, and the necessary and sufficient conditions for asymptotic feedback set stabilizability are obtained.

  abstract     = {Communication imperfections, such as variable sampling periods and packet dropouts induced by insufficient network bandwidth, can degrade the control performance and even jeopardize the stability of networked control systems (NCSs). A stochastic communication protocol (SCP) is usually adopted to ensure that only one sensor node can transmit the output signal to the controller at each sampling instant, thus conserving network bandwidth resources. This article focuses on the output feedback synthesis problem for NCSs in the presence of the SCP, considering two-channel successive packet dropouts (SPDs) and multiple probability sampling periods (MPSPs). Among these, MPSPs mean that there are three or more different sampling rates in system. To address the output feedback synthesis problem, we first obtain the discrete-time augmented model of the closed-loop NCS with a dynamic output feedback controller. This model incorporates an equivalent sampling period representation between adjacent nonpacket-dropout instants, which plays a pivotal role in our analysis. Furthermore, a general analysis model is established by considering the effects of the SCP. Based on this model, conditions for designing the dynamic output feedback controller, represented by linear matrix inequalities (LMIs), are established using a two-step synthesis approach. In particular, the dimension of the obtained controller design conditions remains unchanged with respect to the upper bound of SPDs and the number of possible sampling periods, especially through the introduction of a matrix decomposition method, which is more general than existing results. Finally, the proposed method is demonstrated through an illustrated example.},

By adjusting the desired entanglement level, the proposed method can generate a wide range of states, including both bipartite and multipartite configurations, as well as pure and mixed states. Since the entanglement measure is scalar-valued, the resulting control law is inherently independent of the number of subsystems—an important advantage of the proposed approach. Among various entangled states, maximally entangled states (MESs) are of particular interest. Lyapunov stability of the control scheme is established, and numerical simulations confirm its effectiveness in robustly generating MESs in both bipartite and multipartite systems.},

  abstract     = {In complex and variable terrains, affine formation control, with its flexible formation adjustment ability, can achieve various formation shapes to adapt well to the environment. Notably, the existing affine formation research based on stress matrices require the variation parameters for translation, rotation, scaling, and shearing of formations to be predesigned offline. To address this, we propose a novel method for online affine parameter adjustment that enables self-reconfiguration of formations in multiobstacle environments. By adopting artificial potential field environment excitation, the proposed motion planning algorithm can dynamically adjust the affine transformation parameters online, and realize the self-reconfiguration of formation shape to avoid collision. Then, a distributed model predictive controller is proposed for multiagent systems, which actively utilizes historical control input information to flexibly adjust controller performance while avoiding algebraic loops between neighboring agent controllers. The algorithm separates stability and performance optimization within the nonlinear model predictive control framework, ensuring both the feasibility and stability of the underlying optimization. Finally, the simulation results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed controller.},

Starting with the quadratic Lyapunov function of isolated node, we construct a quadratic Lyapunov function of complex network for estimating the DOA of network. In this way, if the largest spherical estimate of the DOA for isolated node can be obtained, we can directly obtain the largest spherical estimate of the DOA for network. Then, for improving the existing estimate, we directly utilize the Laplacian matrix to ingeniously construct a new Lyapunov-like function, relaxing the constraint that the derivative of the Lyapunov function is negative definite in a neighborhood of the origin. Moreover, we iteratively compute Lyapunov-like functions to maximize the obtained estimate as far as possible. Afterward, for polynomial networks, the estimate problem of the DOA is transformed into a classical sum of squares (SOS) programming problem. Particularly, we use the properties of isolated node and network topology to significantly reduce the computational complexity of the above SOS programming problem, such that our estimate can be effectively obtained even for large-scale networks.

  abstract     = {This article investigates the sliding mode fault-tolerant secure control for cyber–physical system facing jamming attacks and multiple physical faults. An intelligent attacker is capable of emitting interference power and adjusting its strategy by observing the transmitter’s sending power, leading to packet dropouts in the controller-to-actuator channel. A Bayesian Stackelberg game is exploited to capture these competitive interactions between the two players, in which the transmitter and the intelligent attacker can only probabilistically obtain information about each other’s channel state and transmission cost. Meanwhile, the transmitter has only statistical knowledge about either the presence or absence of the attacker in the practical environment. First, optimal transmission power strategies for both sides are studied using the backward induction method and the Karush–Kuhn–Tucker condition. Second, an integrated observer is designed to simultaneously estimate the system state, actuator fault, and sensor fault. Furthermore, the reaching law is proposed so that the state trajectories can reach the preselect sliding surface during the assigned finite time interval from any initial state. Sufficient criteria are derived to guarantee stochastic finite-time boundedness during reaching and sliding motion phases of closed-loop systems using a sliding-mode fault-tolerant secure controller. Finally, simulation results validate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {Metric learning aims to learn a discriminative metric space, where samples of the same class stay close, and those of different classes far apart. Existing classical metric learning methods based on linear transformation have limited learning performance due to the low representation capability. Although deep metric learning learns nonlinear mappings, the training may come across convergence issues and be unstable. Additionally, many classical metric learning algorithms suffer from long computational time for iterative optimization especially when data dimension is high. Deep metric learning also requires high training cost. To learn a metric space more efficiently and effectively, this article proposes a novel broad metric learning (BML) model, which learns the data transformation by training a broad network. BML maps input data to a broad feature space by fast and convenient nonlinear feature mapping based on random weights, and learns a linear transformation to a discriminative output space. Intraclass distance is reduced by minimizing the distance between data and their class-specific reference points in the target space. The hard-triplet distance learning (HDL) is proposed to learn the distance of hard positive and negative sample pairs, which enhances the intraclass compactness and interclass separation. Closed-form solutions are adopted to solve the optimization problems efficiently when learning the linear transformation. Experiments are conducted on nine datasets to verify the efficiency and effectiveness of BML. BML learns fast and achieves high classification and clustering accuracies in the learned data space.},

  abstract     = {The modeling problem of converter-based multibus direct current (DC) microgrids (MGs) and the conflict between voltage regulation and current balancing in such MGs have been a hot topic of interest. Voltage regulation is essential for ensuring the stability and power quality of MGs, while current sharing is a reflection of the MGs’ ability to coordinate power and is critical to extend the lifespan of the generation units. However, due to the presence of line impedance, currents no longer have the freedom of regulation under consistent voltages across the buses. Additionally, existing models have failed to strike a good balance between accuracy and simplicity in describing DC MGs, resulting in rare research on model-based secondary control. With this in mind, this article develops a DC MG error model containing the dynamics of both the circuit and inner control loops via the fully actuated system theory. Further, a distributed optimal control is proposed based on this model. Compared to existing studies, the suggested error model captures the power characteristics of MGs while possesses a simple structure. For regulation tasks of voltage recovery and precise current allocation, this article unifies these two into a single integrated regulation error, offering a novel approach to address their conflict. Subsequently, the stability of the closed-loop MG system is given. Furthermore, this article includes a consensus analysis of current sharing and a tracking analysis of the average voltages. Finally, a laboratory-scale MG prototype equipped with photovoltaics and batteries is developed to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

Sensor data becomes vulnerable to malicious tampering when operating in a low-energy level, whereas the high-energy transmission level enables accurate data transmission. By introducing a set of Bernoulli random variables and ternary random variables, a novel measurement model is proposed to characterize scenarios involving both dual-energy transmission modes and hybrid attacks, including three statuses: safe, deception attacks, and Denial-of-Service attacks. Based on the innovation analysis approach, local secure estimators are designed to ensure that the estimation errors are minimized locally. Then, an optimal secure fusion algorithm is provided to generate the final estimated value by fusing all the local estimates.

  abstract     = {Different sampling rates are common for different variables in industrial processes because of the different electrical properties and requirements of sensors. Especially the sampling rate of quality variables is significantly lower than that of process variables. However, most soft sensors assume that industrial data is uniformly sampled, which differs significantly from actual industrial systems and may affect decision-making in the production process. An interpretable disentangled transfer learning (IDTL) quality prediction is proposed suitable for multirate industrial processes. First, a setness constructor is designed to diversify the original multirate data into multiple multirate sets to preserve information without data loss. Then, a disentangled transfer learning (TL) approach is proposed to infer domain-invariant and domain-specific representations from multiple multirate sets, thereby revealing the intrinsic properties of multirate industrial processes and improving the soft sensor performance. From the perspective of information theory, the theoretical representations for disentanglement and their connection to TL are established, laying a solid theoretical foundation for subsequent TL under complex working conditions. Our theoretical analysis shows that interpretable disentangled TL (IDTL) achieves optimal disentangled representations in equilibrium. Case studies of the debutanizer column dataset and the actual polyester esterification dataset validate the effectiveness of the proposed IDTL.

Specifically, we consider the setting where the initial position and velocity of each legitimate agent are both private, an internal or external adversary wants to identify them based on the information it obtains. To deal with this scenario, we propose a privacy preservation algorithm based on a position and velocity simultaneous perturbation technique. To be specific, our algorithm consists of a collaborative scrambling phase and a convergence phase. In the scrambling phase, each agent is required to produce two sets of edge-based perturbation signals that are, respectively, imposed on the local position and velocity signals before transmission, with the purpose of preserving privacy; in the convergence phase, each agent updates its state per a normal rule, aiming to achieving accurate consensus. Also, we establish a system-theoretic framework to analyze privacy performance by examining the indistinguishability of private values’ arbitrary variations to adversaries, and further show that, an internal adversary cannot infer the privacy of a legitimate agent provided it has at least one legitimate in-neighbor or out-neighbor, and the privacy is leaked out once that agent exclusively connects to the internal adversary in bidirectional way. As for external eavesdroppers, they can never infer any agent’s privacy if the gain parameters in the scrambling phase are not accessible to them.

Using the lemma proposed in the study (Lemma 3) and the normalized function, it is shown that under the performance constraint approach, the selection of the performance function is consistent with the control protocols. By adopting the modified admissible edge-dependent average dwell time method and the optimal controller, the boundedness of closed-loop system signals is proved, and the Zeno phenomenon does not occur.

  abstract     = {The present research addresses the issue of fixed-time (FxT) command filtered adaptive tracking control for a class of nonlinear system subject to time-varying input delay and error/state constraints. First, based on the existing FxT control theory, we present two new FxT stability lemmas, affording less conservative and more exact upper-bound estimates (UBEs) for the settling time. Second, the asymmetric constrained systems are reconstructed into novel systems devoid of constraints by introducing nonlinear transformation functions (NTFs), which remove the feasibility conditions related to the virtual controllers while satisfying the error and state constraints. Then, a novel FxT auxiliary system is established to effectively handle the input delay that is allowed to be unknown. By employing the FxT stability criterion and Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional approach, it is proved that the controlled systems are practically fixed-time stable (PFxTS) and do not violate their error/state constraints. Additionally, without the need for modifying the control framework, the control algorithm capably addresses the control issue uniformly for both constrained and unconstrained systems. In the end, a simulation example is given to check the validity of the main results.},

  abstract     = {HCMOP are widespread in practical engineering such as vehicle routing problem and shop scheduling problem etc. The problems introduced above refer to optimization problems with complex constraints which lead to small and disconnected feasible regions. The optimization performance of general evolutionary algorithms decreases due to the small and dispersed feasible regions in highly constrained optimization problems. To address this problem, a multiobjective ant colony optimization algorithm based on dynamic constraint evaluation strategy (MOACO-DCE) is proposed in this article. First, a dynamic constraint violation metric is proposed to evaluate the constraint violation degree of solutions. The population is classified into the subpopulation with evolutionary advantages and the subpopulation with high constraint violation degree by this metric. Second, an evolutionary strategy based on dynamic transfer probabilities is proposed for the subpopulation with evolutionary advantages in order to improve the evolutionary efficiency. A Gaussian variation evolutionary strategy is proposed for the subpopulation with high constraint violation degree in order to improve the population diversity. Third, a pheromone collaborative updating strategy is proposed to achieve the synergistic pheromone updating between two subpopulations. A pheromone updating strategy considering the constraint violation metric is designed to improve the utilization of constraint violation information in the whole population. In addition, compared with other constrained multiobjective optimization algorithms, MOACO-DCE can obtain more satisfactory performance for the highly constrained optimization.},

Generally, it is extremely difficult or impossible for these morphing quadrotors to develop an accurate mathematical model that describes their complex flight dynamics. This fact leads to a particularly challenging situation, as the existing mature model-based flight control theory fails to address the flight control design issue of morphing quadrotors. By resorting to a combination of model-free control techniques [e.g., deep reinforcement learning (DRL)] and convex combination (CC) technique, a convex-combined-DRL (cc-DRL) flight control algorithm is proposed for flight trajectory tracking and attitude stabilization of a class of morphing quadrotors with arm-length deformation. In the proposed cc-DRL flight control algorithm, a proximal policy optimization algorithm is utilized to offline train the corresponding optimal flight control laws for some selected representative arm length modes. Hereby, a cc-DRL flight control scheme is constructed by the CC technique. Finally, simulation results are presented to show the effectiveness and merit of the proposed DRL flight control algorithm.},

However, traditional visual servo methods often rely on precise kinematic models and camera calibration, limiting their generalizability. Considering these, this article proposes a novel uncalibrated model-free visual servo control scheme. Specifically, we introduce a Jacobian matrix and interaction matrix estimation method based on a gradient neural network (GNN), which enables online estimation by utilizing control signals and sensor outputs. Then, the estimated results are incorporated into a visual servo control framework that considers remote center of motion (RCM) constraint, joint-drift problem, and physical constraint, formulated as a quadratic programming (QP) problem. Subsequently, focusing on the joint limits and endoscope insertion depth constraint, we develop a nonpiecewise differentiable multilevel constraint handling technique. For the formulated QP problem, a predefined-time convergent error-regulating zeroing neural network (PTCER-ZNN) solver is designed, and we can derive the optimal control signals. Detailed theoretical analyses of the developed GNN estimation method and the PTCER-ZNN solver are provided. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme in image feature regulation and tracking tasks, exhibiting its advantages over existing approaches.},

First, a differential privacy mechanism is used in the fully distributed consensus-based projected pseudo-gradient algorithm to obfuscate shared messages over the communication network and quantify the algorithm’s privacy level. To achieve fast convergence, a novel relaxed inertial method is designed, consisting of two steps with independently designed parameters: 1) a relaxation step and 2) an inertia step. The adaptive inertia coefficient in the inertia step is designed based on the iteration error of the players’ estimated decisions and a decaying sequence, with the only requirement being the non-negativity of its internal parameters. Compared to existing approaches, our algorithm exhibits high flexibility in parameter selection. Furthermore, we analyze the algorithm’s convergence and differential privacy under both linearly decaying and fixed stepsizes within a unified framework, providing sufficient conditions that are independent of the number of players. Finally, numerical simulations validate the algorithm’s potential, demonstrating significant improvements in convergence rate, accuracy, and privacy level.},

However, the application of fuzzy information granularity remains a significant challenge, primarily due to the potential for substantial data distortion. To address this limitation, we propose an innovative long-term prediction model based on granularity time series, which integrates $l_{1}$ -trend filter decomposition and integrated learning. The core of our model lies in a novel modal decomposition method that utilizes $l_{1}$ -trend filters and a validity function to meticulously extract valuable insights from the original time series, thereby enhancing the precision of data analysis while preserving the integrity of the original data. Furthermore, we introduce a groundbreaking formula to measure the similarity of fuzzy information granularity, classifying time series components into three distinct categories: trend, period, and noise. By applying distinct prediction strategies to each category, we construct an integrated learning model that leverages the strengths of each component. At the heart of our model is a multilinear information granularity prediction approach, which is based on trend time windows and utilizes the newly developed similarity measure. This method not only maintains the integrity of the original time series but also offers a more accurate representation of the similarity between information grains. Empirical results from publicly available datasets validate the superior performance of our proposed prediction model, demonstrating its potential to significantly enhance long-term time series prediction accuracy.},

  abstract     = {The bipartite consensus (BC) issue for nonlinear multiagent systems (NMASs) with unknown system dynamics information is investigated in this article. Initially, the dynamics of NMASs are represented using the Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy model. Subsequently, to achieve distributed control, a minmax game policy is introduced, where each agent aims to minimize its performance index while its neighbors attempt to maximize it. Consequently, the BC problem for NMASs is reformulated as a zero-sum game, transforming the controller design into solving a set of game algebraic Riccati equations (GAREs). To solve such equations, a novel scaling off-policy iteration (PI) algorithm is proposed. The key features of the proposed learning algorithm can be outlined in three main aspects: 1) during the learning process, the reliance on system dynamics is relaxed; 2) compared with the PI method, the requirement for initial admissible control policies is eliminated; and 3) a more rapid convergence speed is achieved than traditional value iteration. Finally, the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed method are validated through a simulation example and a series of comparative experiments.},

In this way, the control input of the robotic system is relaxed by adjusting the time-varying functions through the inputs of auxiliary systems in NN-AHoCBF barrier conditions. Also, the sufficient condition for the NN-AHoCBF is provided to adaptively ensure system safety. The adaptive safety-based tracking control method is designed based on NN-AHoCBF in quadratic program (QP) framework, which can not only satisfy input-output constraints simultaneously, but also achieve good robustness and tracking performance.

  abstract     = {Existing active learning methods for object detection face challenges, such as the lack of ground truth labels for regression loss, insufficient representation of unlabeled instance samples information, and discrepancies in information quality between image-level and multiple anchor-level instances. To address these issues, we propose an active learning method for object detection with vectorized dual pseudo loss and multiple instance offset constraint. This method implements a two-stage framework. The first stage focuses on evaluating the information quality of detection images. We first pioneer a dual pseudo loss formulation that provides theoretically grounded regression loss estimation. The regression loss is calculated as the norm of the offset discrepancy loss vector between the enhanced and original base box vector, further constrained by the cosine value of the angle between the anchor box feature and regressor parameters vector. The distance entropy from the base box feature vector to each category’s feature prototype vector is used as a weighting factor for the regression and classification information quality of instance samples. Subsequently, the second stage employs diversity-driven sampling on high-information images, leveraging instance-level cosine similarity to effectively remove redundant images. The proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art active learning approaches for object detection on PASCAL VOC and MS COCO datasets.

  abstract     = {In industrial soft-sensor applications, labeled samples are often scarce and unable to fully represent the dynamic changes in industrial processes. Although semi-supervised methods offer a potential solution to this issue, existing feature-construction-based methods cannot ensure the effectiveness of the feature, and pseudo-label-based methods lack an established confidence evaluation standard. To address these challenges, this article first proposes a novel performance-driven distillation strategy, which designs an innovative siameseLSTM structure for training multiple teacher models. By assigning higher weights to high-performance teacher models and simultaneously leveraging the guidance of the soft sensing task, the student model is guided to learn more effective feature representations. Additionally, a new pseudo label confidence evaluation strategy is introduced, which aims to enhance the generalization of the base soft-sensor model by selecting samples with high-confidence pseudo labels. Finally, By combining the above two strategies, a semi-supervised soft-sensor framework is proposed for the soft sensing of industrial quality variables. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is validated through two real-world datasets from different stages of the alumina production process. Compared with some existing advanced soft sensor frameworks, the prediction results on different datasets show that the root-mean-square error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) are reduced by an average of 10.76% and 11.18%, respectively, while the correlation coefficient (R2) is averagely increased by 0.1203.},

  abstract     = {The principal innovative contribution of this study resides in the introduction of a category of fractional delayed large-scale neural networks characterized by intricate topological structures. Additionally, this article provides a comprehensive exploration of novel outcomes linked to fractional order-induced bifurcations in large-scale networks. In the initial step, the correlation of the artificial neural network and the graphical neural network is established through the Mason’s diagram method. Subsequently, the system’s characteristic equations are derived by employing the Coates’ flow graph decomposition method. Moving on, through the concept of the global element, an exhaustive investigation delves into the distribution of eigenroots. The sum of synaptic transmission delays among neurons is considered as a bifurcation parameter, with an analysis focused on the stability of the trivial equilibrium and the existence of the Hopf bifurcation. Following this, the optimal fractional order-dependent stability interval is determined using the implicit function array curve method, presenting a novel approach for critical value determination. Finally, the drawn conclusions are substantiated through multiple sets of computer simulations. It is indicated that an increase in delay precipitates the onset of Hopf bifurcation. Moreover, a reduction in the fractional order significantly improves the steady-state performance of the system. However, once the fractional order value descends below the left stability boundary, the system’s stability is compromised, leading to the emergence of periodic oscillations. The prediction algorithm proposed in this article offers valuable insights into selecting the appropriate fractional order for large-scale complex networks.},

  abstract     = {The control of a humanoid robot equipped with one arm and multiple fingers, designed primarily for grasping and manipulating various objects, is investigated. Synchronizing the movements of the fingers is a challenging task, as each joint must reach the desired angle simultaneously to ensure a firm grasp. The success of this task hinges on the synchronization of convergence times for each finger joint; otherwise, the object may slip or escape. This challenge is further intensified by uncertainties in the dynamics of the hand or the object. We present decentralized prescribed-time tracking control strategies for the dynamical system comprising the arm-finger combination. In this system, the fingers are primarily used for grasping the object while the arm is responsible for moving, tilting, or flipping it. To streamline the controller structure and simplify the stability analysis, we design a linear controller based on the maximum eigenvalue of a parameter matrix and establish a new technical lemma, which paves the way for the stability analysis of the prescribed-time tracking and the reduction of the input efforts of the actuator. We develop robust and decentralized adaptive control schemes separately for the arm and fingers, achieving better transient performance with less prior knowledge and lower computation costs. Finally, we validate the proposed controller’s performance through kinematic simulations of grasping and moving tasks in 3-D, alongside numerical simulations that demonstrate the tracking performance of our algorithm in the joint space.},

To prevent data conflicts caused by communication resource limitations, a round-robin (RR) protocol is introduced to regulate the communication transmission order among coupled nodes. To be more general and flexible against Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks, the concept of average dwelling time ratio (ADTR) is proposed to evaluate DoS attack models. In addition, a DoS-attack-aware ET mechanism is developed. Under this mechanism, a threshold parameter is dynamically adjusted according to the active and dormant time of the DoS attacks. The correlated co-design of anti-attack security control and ET mechanism is realized. Compared with the existing results, the scheme improves the control performance while reducing the controller update frequency. Then, by establishing appropriate Lyapunov function, sufficient criteria for synchronization of discrete-time FCNs are obtained, and a controllable range of the ADTR is calculated. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed DoS-attack-aware ET control scheme based on RR protocol is verified through two simulations.},

  abstract     = {human-object interaction (HOI) detection tackles the problem of joint localization and classification of HOIs. Recent HOI detection methods are mainly based on transformer networks, where the explicit priors at the object level (e.g., scene layout, object appearance, or category) are usually fed into the transformer to improve the object query ability. Though these methods have achieved remarkable results, they did not pay enough attention to the implicit action-level information, which is the fundamental element of HOI. In this work, we propose an interaction-aware transformer network (IATN) to obtain the interaction-aware query, by jointly utilizing implicit action-level priors and explicit object-level priors. Specifically, we design an action-aware module (AAM) to aggregate implicit action priors from the scene level and instance level, respectively. Then, we design an action-oriented graph (AOG), where human feature and object feature are graph nodes and action semantics represent graph edges, to aggregate priors jointly from action level and object level. Afterwards, the interaction-aware query is acquired and finally adopted to obtain the HOI predictions. Besides, we leverage knowledge distillation to enhance the action-level priors by transferring the final HOI predictions to the intermediate features. Extensive experiments on HICO-DET and V-COCO datasets verify the effectiveness of our proposed interaction-aware model.},

That is, all followers can simultaneously achieve trajectory tracking of the leader agent, even if there exist competitive interactions between the followers and the leader. To portray the cooperation and competition level among agents, a new distance-based weight function is designed, which is more flexible than the fixed weight values in existing research works. Theoretically, the sufficient conditions for achieving consensus tracking control are obtained based on the convergence analysis method of infinite products of super-stochastic matrices.

Projection-based pseudo-gradient method is proposed to seek the GNE while satisfying both the individual and the shared inequality constraints. Furthermore, the jointly strongly connected switching network, which may be disconnected at any time instant, entails resorting to the generalized Barbalat’s lemma in the convergence analysis.

However, it suffers from a slow convergence rate, which prevents suboptimal MPC from achieving better performance within a specific sample time. To address this issue, we first reformulate the conventional inner convex approximation procedure as a root-finding problem for a nonlinear equation. Then, under mild assumptions, a comprehensive functional analysis is performed on the derived nonlinear equation, focusing on its continuity, differentiability, and the invertibility of the Jacobian matrix. Building on this analysis, we propose an improved algorithm that applies Broyden’s method to accelerate the root-finding procedure of this derived nonlinear equation, thereby enhancing the convergence rate of the conventional inner convex approximation method. We also provide a detailed analysis of the proposed algorithm’s convergence properties and computational complexity, showing that it achieves a locally superlinear convergence rate without devoting much additional computational effort. Simulation experiments are performed in an obstacle avoidance scenario, and the results are compared to the conventional inner convex approximation method to assess the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed approach.},

In this article, we focus on a wheeled mobile robot (WMR) as the control object and propose a novel brain-controlled framework that combines a probabilistic brain-computer interface (BCI) and a model predictive controller (MPC). First, the probabilistic BCI is developed, featuring the sigmoid fitting-filter bank canonical correlation analysis (SF-FBCCA) algorithm, which serves as the core of the BCI system by decoding EEG signals and generating brain commands along with their associated probabilities. Second, an auxiliary MPC is integrated into the probabilistic BCI system to provide decision-making assistance while preserving the users’ primary brain control authority. The weights of the cost function are adaptively determined based on the command probabilities. Finally, simulation-based evaluations were conducted using the WMR in a path-keeping scenario. The results demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly improves control accuracy and efficiency compared to direct brain control approaches, reducing the average lateral error by 58.02% and the average yaw angle error by 60.06%. Additionally, the MPC employing adaptive weights further improves overall performance.

  abstract     = {multiple attribute group decision making (MAGDM) aims to assist a group in evaluating multiattribute alternatives for seeking the most satisfactory one(s). To improve the decision quality of MAGDM, various consensus models were suggested to deal with opinion differences among experts and achieve consensual decision outcomes. This study proposes a novel ordinal consensus framework for MAGDM with incomplete social network trust preference relations (TPRs). In this framework, incomplete linguistic preference relation are first utilized to represent experts’ social network TPRs. After that, a consistency-driven two-stage optimization approach is designed to deal with incomplete TPRs for obtaining individual trust levels and expert weight information. Then, a distance-based ordinal consensus measure is designed with the integration of the obtained expert weight information and the basic idea that the higher-ranked alternatives should have greater importance than the lower-ranked ones. When the consensus degree among experts is unacceptable, an opinion dynamic-based feedback adjustment mechanism is devised by integrating the obtained individual trust levels to provide reasonable opinion modification suggestions for accelerating the consensus reaching in MAGDM. Otherwise, the selection process is used to make a selection. A simulation experiment is designed to investigate the effect of key parameters on consensus efficiency. Next, examples of project investment and software supplier selection demonstrate the usability of the proposed consensus framework. Meanwhile, a comparison analysis and in-depth discussions are presented to justify our proposal. The main contributions of this study are twofold. First, a new perspective on managing incomplete social network TPRs is suggested for MAGDM. Second, a novel ordinal consensus process is designed to enhance the effectiveness of the consensual decision outcome. These results can offer new insights into the consensus building for practice social network MAGDM problems.},

  abstract     = {Polygonal collision avoidance (PCA) is short for the problem of collision avoidance between two polygons (i.e., polytopes in planar) that own their dynamic equations. This problem suffers the inherent difficulty in dealing with nonsmooth boundaries and recently optimization-defined metrics, such as signed distance field (SDF) and its variants, have been proposed as control barrier functions (CBFs) to tackle PCA problems. In contrast, we propose an optimization-free smooth CBF method in this article, which is computationally efficient and proved to be nonconservative. It is achieved by three main steps: a lower bound of SDF is expressed as a nested Boolean logic composition first, then its smooth approximation is established by applying the latest log-sum-exp method, after which a specified CBF-based safety filter is proposed to address this class of problems. To illustrate its wide applications, the optimization-free smooth CBF method is extended to solve distributed collision avoidance of two underactuated nonholonomic vehicles and drive an underactuated container crane to avoid a moving obstacle, respectively, for which numerical simulations are also performed.},

In this work, we propose a rapid autonomous exploration framework with a field-of-view (FOV) expansion mechanism. We present a 1-degree-of-freedom (DOF) FOV expansion mechanism, coupled with a frontier-gravitation FOV direction planning method to decouple the direction of the sensor’s FOV from the robot velocity direction. Our approach includes a rapid frontier viewpoint generation method utilizing principal component analysis (PCA). Moreover, we introduce a sliding window travelling salesman problem (TSP) for global coverage path planning, incorporating an attenuation coefficient to increase the exploration priority of independent small frontiers and reduce revisit probability. Finally, compared to state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches, our proposed mechanism and framework beneficially reduce exploration time by 30%–44% and enhance the continuity of the robot movement in both simulation and real-world scenarios.},

Additionally, novel multiple asynchronous dynamic edge-event-triggered mechanisms (DEETMs) are designed to further conserve communication resources and optimize network utilization by enabling the leader to send information intermittently and allowing each follower to transmit information asynchronously when the trigger mechanisms are satisfied. The DEETMs consider both interlayer and intergroup information interactions to improve communication efficiency.

Moreover, the transition rate matrix of the system and the conditional probability matrix of the filter are general, allowing for transition probabilities in fully known, partly known or fully unknown cases.

A novel fixed-time stability theorem under DoS attacks is presented to simplify the stability conditions and decrease the computational complexity of the settling time. Simultaneously, the deep neural networks (DNNs) structure with the projection operator are adopted in real-time to approximate the unknown system dynamics. To achieve the optimal consensus under cyber-attacks, a hierarchical control approach is presented, which includes a reference signal generation layer and a tracking control layer. Specifically, the distributed and Luenberger-based observers are designed in the reference signal generation layer to solve the fixed-time state estimation issues of leader and followers under multiple malicious attacks, respectively. Then, the optimal control strategy based on the event-triggered mechanism (ETM) is designed in the tracking control layer to track the reference signal and minimize the cost consumption. Due to the difficulty in obtaining explicit expressions of the optimal control mechanisms, a critic-only reinforcement learning (RL)-based algorithm is presented for online learning the unknown weight within a fixed time. By rigorous proof, the developed observers can achieve the fixed-time state reconstruction and the optimal control policy can track observation states after a fixed time. Finally, simulation results about platooning control of automated vehicles are given to demonstrate the efficacy of the developed technique.},

  abstract     = {Designing intelligent game strategies for autonomous air combat has suffered from the vast exploration space, lengthy decision-making process, and sparse rewards. Some existing approaches adopt the hierarchical framework to improve the exploration efficiency. However, in these methods, agents in different layers are typically trained independently and operate at fixed frequencies, which limits their performance and hampers their ability to respond to highly dynamic combat situations. In view of this, we present PJOH-TED2, a partial-joint-optimization-based hierarchical (PJOH) learning framework with a time-event dual-driven (TED2) mechanism, for one-on-one beyond-visual-range (BVR) air combat. Specifically, the PJOH learning framework embeds the partial joint optimization mechanism into hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL), thus improving the exploration efficiency dramatically while enhancing the integration across hierarchical levels. Moreover, the TED2 mechanism combines the advantages of event-driven and time-driven methods, which promote the dynamic response speed of agents as well as avoid redundant actions. In addition, we evaluated this work through a series of games against the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods in a high-fidelity air combat simulation environment. The results empirically demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms four SOTA methods with a win rate of at least 71%. Finally, this approach achieved the 1st place in learning methods in the intelligent air game algorithm challenge (IAGAC) by the Chinese Institute of Command and Control among 43 teams.},

The main goal is to attain control performance within prescribed-time (PT) limits despite the existence of mismatched disturbances. First, the mismatched disturbances are transformed into the equivalent forms. Second, for the unknown disturbance estimation, a PT extended state observer (PTESO) is developed to switch between the prescribed settling time ${\mathcal {T}}_{p}$ , the order is diminished to alleviate the occurrence of the peaking phenomenon. Furthermore, an ESO-based PT control strategy is constructed with time-varying gains. This allows real-time compensation of disturbances, and the prescribed performance is attained by virtue of a Lyapunov function employed combines both barrier and quadratic forms. Ultimately, the benefits and efficacy are illustrated via a numerical demonstration involving a wheeled mobile robot. The key features of this article include the observer capability to estimate unknown mismatching disturbances and the full effectiveness of the proposed controller for $t \in [t_{0}, \infty $ ), ensuring the convergence of tracking error to zero within any PT.

  abstract     = {Complex industrial processes exhibit typical nonstationarity due to frequently fluctuating material flows and complex control loops. This poses three challenges for trustworthy process monitoring, including data drift, coordination of old and new knowledge, and interpretability. In this study, the adaptive and interpretable process monitoring problem is formulated as an online updating strategy and the spatial topology structure representation learning process monitoring problem. An incremental variational graph attention autoencoder with probabilistic inference framework is proposed, which aims to effectively learn continuously from dynamically changing industrial data to make interpretable monitoring results. First, an incremental learning strategy based on the Bayesian regularized self-organizing map is presented, which can distinguish between real faults and time-varying changes. Once normal samples are encountered, the itself and downstream model are elegantly updated with a dynamic down-sampling replay strategy without leading to catastrophic forgetting. Subsequently, a variational graph attention autoencoder with probabilistic inference is proposed, which endows interpretable spatial structural relationships through priors and effectively captures the variability of spatial latent representations suitable for nonstationary processes. Then, an incremental variational Bayesian inference is introduced to calculate the adaptive thresholds to adapt the system. In addition, an anomaly-aware graph attention localization mechanism is provided to localize fault root causes and propagation paths. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is validated through two industrial applications. The results demonstrate that the proposed method can significantly enhance the performance of process monitoring, especially for reducing the false alarm rate (FAR) in process monitoring schemes. Moreover, it offers interpretable causal relationships among faults.},

A striking characteristic is that an integral dynamics is deftly constructed and then incorporated into the original sliding mode system to dispose of the perturbations of unknown magnitudes. On account of the new sliding mode dynamics, we explicitly introduce a systematic design protocol to dexterously design a new iHOSM controller. This is fulfilled through amending the technique of adding a power integrator. The theoretical justification has been guaranteed by the rigorous Lyapunov analysis. The investigations of two elucidative examples are provided to validate the validity and feasibility of the designed methodology.},

  abstract     = {Noncontrastive self-supervised learning methods offer an effective alternative to contrastive approaches by avoiding the need for negative samples to avoid representation collapse. Noncontrastive learning methods explicitly or implicitly optimize the representation space, yet they often require large representation dimensions, leading to dimensional inefficiency. To provide negative samples, contrastive learning methods often require large batch sizes, thus regarded as sample inefficient, while noncontrastive learning methods require large representation dimensions, thus regarded as dimension inefficient. Although we have some understanding of the noncontrastive learning method, theoretical analysis of such phenomenon still remains largely unexplored. We present a theoretical analysis of the dimensional need for noncontrastive learning. We investigate the transfer between upstream representation learning and downstream tasks’ performance, demonstrating how noncontrastive methods implicitly increase interclass distances within the representation space and how the distance affects the model performance of evaluation performance. We prove that the performance of noncontrastive methods is affected by the output dimension and the number of latent classes, and illustrate why performance degrades significantly when the output dimension is substantially smaller than the number of latent classes. We demonstrate our findings through experiments on image classification experiments, and enrich the verification in audio, graph and text modalities. We also perform empirical evaluation for image models on extensive detection and segmentation tasks beyond classification that show satisfactory correspondence to our theorem.},

An essential question is how to use the correlations between data streams to enhance the effectiveness of machine learning models. The fact that data streams are nonstationary and the correlations across data streams might change over time presents another difficulty. We suggest an ensemble chain-structured model, Evolutionary regressor chains (RCs), to track the correlations between data streams to solve these issues. We develop a heuristic order searching approach to search for the chain’s optimal order. With the ability to monitor the dynamicity of the correlations, the heuristic order searching technique can also update the chains over time. Furthermore, a way for reducing computing complexity while maintaining the ensemble’s diversity is proposed. The method’s theoretical foundation is established through a dynamic regret analysis proving optimal adaptation in the data streams.

Due to the information exchange between agents in the network, the unknown nonlinear dynamics lead to the degradation of local and all-agent control performance, which causes the strategies of all agents to deviate from the Nash equilibrium under a given goal. To address this problem, an adaptive distributed algorithm is designed to seek Nash equilibrium by combining two optimization levels. Specifically, the decision layer uses a distributed consensus algorithm to achieve benefit evaluation and a gradient algorithm to generate reference signals. Then, the control layer uses the virtual reference signal from the decision layer and the neural network estimation information to design an adaptive control algorithm. The proposed method performs real-time adaptive optimization of the strategies and control performance of the decision and control layers, ensuring the successful implementation of the distributed Nash equilibrium search. The convergence of the proposed algorithm is proved in the Lyapunov sense. Finally, simulation examples demonstrate the performance and effectiveness of the proposed method.},

They render the existing distributed high-performance control solutions infeasible. In this article, a distributed robust output-feedback prescribed performance control strategy is put forward to conquer this obstacle. First, the resulting control is off-line designed, regardless of the initial condition or the switching condition. Second, it automatically adjusts the neighborhood errors and the intermediate errors online, against the topology switching. Besides, it is inherently robust to the unknown system dynamics, without parameter identification, function approximation, disturbance estimation, or derivative calculation or estimation. It turns out that global fast accurate output synchronization is achieved by our approach in the sense that the follower outputs track the leader output with the preassigned settling time and accuracy after the topology switching.

  abstract     = {This article introduces an innovative singularity-free output feedback model reference adaptive control (MRAC) method that is adaptable to a wide range of continuous-time linear systems with relative degrees $n^{*} \geq 1$ and unknown high-frequency gains. Unlike existing solutions, such as Nussbaum and multiple-model-based methods, which manage unknown high-frequency gains through persistent switching and repeated parameter estimation, the proposed method circumvents these issues without requiring high-frequency gain information or adding design constraints. A key innovation of this method lies in transforming the estimation error equation into a linear regression form via a modified MRAC law with a piecewise constant tuning gain developed in this work. This represents a significant departure from existing MRAC systems, where the estimation error equation is typically bilinear. The linear regression form facilitates the direct estimation of all unknown parameters, thereby simplifying the adaptive control process. In the absence of any high-frequency gain information, the proposed method still maintains the boundedness of the closed-loop system signals and $\lim _{t \to \infty } (y(t)-y^{*}(t))=0$ , where $y(t)$ and $y^{*}(t)$ are the system output and any reference output, respectively. Meanwhile, this method overcomes some limitations associated with previous methods like Nussbaum and multiple-model-based methods.

The multiagent systems are nonlinearly transformed to address state constraints, without needing feasibility conditions on virtual control laws in the recursive design. The dynamic triggering variables are introduced using a prescribed-time adjustment function and distributed tracking errors. Based on the state variables of the adaptive chainlike filters, a prescribed-time distributed consensus tracking strategy is established to guarantee the prescribed-time convergence of filtering errors, disturbance observation errors, leader estimation errors, and consensus tracking errors, without requiring continuous state-feedback measurements. The shared use of neural networks across chainlike filters, disturbance observers, and controllers reduces computational complexity. The practical prescribed-time stability and satisfaction of state constraints in the closed-loop system are proven through a rigorous technical lemma.

Our approach uniquely combines spectral graph theory with adaptive consensus mechanisms to synchronize fault detection and isolation while dynamically adjusting operational parameters to preserve system stability and efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that SAC-FMA outperforms traditional fault management approaches with a 41% improvement in convergence rate, 67% enhancement in fault containment efficiency, 60% reduction in system instability, 95% maintenance of operational performance, and 40% decrease in communication overhead.

In contrast to previous research, the results of this study provide a unified framework in which global or semi-global performance can be achieved through simple parameter selection while excluding the conservativeness of the constraint thresholds owing to the artificial selection of a uniform performance function. The basic lemma based on the Nussbaum function frequently is extended to adapt to the case in which the coefficients are multiple bounded functions. By fusing a first-order differentiator, the reduplicative derivation of the virtual controller in the backstepping process is obviated. Moreover, an ET mechanism with two dynamic variables is constructed to reduce the burden of data transmission.

  abstract     = {The interpretability of quantum machine learning (QML) refers to the capability to provide clear and understandable explanations for the predictions and decision-making processes of QML models. However, most quantum convolutional layers (QCLs) utilize closed-box structures that are inherently devoid of interpretability, leading to the opacity of principles and the suboptimal mapping of classical data. This significantly undermines the reliability of QML models. In addition, most of the current QML interpretability focuses on post hoc interpretability seriously neglecting the importance of exploring intrinsic causes. To tackle these challenges, we introduce the quantum adjoint convolution operation (QACO). It is an intrinsic interpretability scheme based on quantum evolution, as its quantum mapping precisely corresponds to the position and pixel values of the image and its principle is equivalent to the Frobenius inner product (FIP). Furthermore, we extend the QACO concept into the quantum adjoint convolutional layer (QACL) by integrating the quantum phase estimation (QPE) algorithm, enabling the parallel computation of all FIPs. Experimental results on PennyLane and TensorFlow platforms demonstrate that our method achieves a 6.3%, 3.4%, and 2.9% higher average test accuracy on Fashion MNIST, MNIST, and DermaMNIST datasets compared to classical and uninterpretable quantum counterparts, respectively, while maintaining 73.3% noise-robust accuracy under Gaussian noise, showcasing its superior generalizability and resilience in practical scenarios.},

  abstract     = {This article proposes a strategy to accelerate the convergence of iterative learning control (ILC) while maintaining robustness against stochastic noise. The strategy adaptively reweights the error signals used in conventional ILC schemes, casting greater influence to larger errors during input updates, thereby accelerating the correction of noisy inputs and improving overall convergence behavior. Furthermore, to mitigate the impact of noise-dominated small errors on weight computation, a saturation mechanism is introduced. A convergence theorem is established to characterize how the saturation parameters affect the asymptotic convergence of the input deviation-induced errors. Simulation and experimental results demonstrate that incorporating this strategy consistently improves convergence speed while maintaining tracking accuracy across different ILC implementations.},

  abstract     = {The randomness of chaotic systems are crucial for their application in secure communication. Conservative systems exhibit enhanced ergodicity and randomness in comparison to dissipative chaotic systems. However, the memristor-based conservative chaotic maps remain unreported. This article presents a study of volume-preserving chaotic maps based on discrete memristor (DM). We propose and analyze a generic conservative map that incorporates DM. The conservative characteristics of the proposed iterative map are confirmed through the determinant of its Jacobian matrix. Furthermore, four distinct DM models are introduced and their memristive characteristics are verified through numerical simulations of hysteresis loops. To investigate the dynamical properties of the discrete memristive conservative map (DMCM), we incorporate the proposed DM models into the generic conservative map model using numerical methods, including phase portraits, Lyapunov exponents, and bifurcation diagrams. Additionally, the hardware implementation of the DMCM on an FPGA platform demonstrates the reliability of the model. Finally, secure communication experiments based on the DMCM show that it outperforms some classical dissipative chaotic maps in terms of bit error rate performance.},

During the control design process, the unknown system dynamics, the time-varying sensor, and the actuator faults are considered simultaneously. Based on the event-triggered mechanism, the first-order filter technique and the nonlinear impulsive dynamics approach, an adaptive neural event-triggered output feedback FTC scheme is established. More specifically, one triggering condition is established for both the measurable output and the state estimations, with the adaptive parameters being triggered at the same instants. Another triggering condition is established for the controller, eliminating the need for real-time monitoring of control information and thereby reducing the computational burden. Then, a neural state observer is designed from triggered faulty output and triggered state estimations. The first-order filter technique is introduced to handle the non-differentiability of virtual controls stemmed from the event-triggered mechanism. The nonlinear impulsive dynamics approach is employed for stability analysis of the discontinuous error dynamics. It is proved that, with the proposed scheme, all the closed-loop signals are bounded, meanwhile the system output converges to the origin asymptotically, and the Zeno behavior is excluded.

This is a special type of line optimization problem that uses different allocation techniques, resulting in wide differences in assembly times between machines. This article proposes a hyper-heuristic optimizer embedded with a multifeature fusion ensemble estimator (HHO-MFEE) for PCBALS using linear-aligned-heads surface mounters. The objective and constraints of the problem are discussed, and a min-max integer model for small-scale problems is built. At the hyper-heuristic low level, seven data- and target-driven heuristics are presented for allocating components to different machines. Strategies for duplicated conditions with component types and placement points allocation are proposed to improve the applicability of the algorithm and the quality of the solution. An ensemble assembly time estimator that incorporates the coding of multifeatures, including estimated subobjectives, is proposed for evaluating the quality of the solution. Experimental results show that: 1) the gaps between the solution from HHO-MFEE and the optimal solution of the model are 3.44%~7.28% for small-scale data; 2) the proposed time estimator has higher accuracy than regression and heuristic-based ones, with mean absolute error of 2.01% and 3.43% for training and testing data, respectively; and 3) HHO-MFEE is better than other state-of-the-art algorithms, with average improvement of 7.21%~9.47%.},

For a networked system whose topology matrix has only zero eigenvalues, delays of neither control nor transmission signals will affect the overall controllability. It is proved that an uncontrollable mode 1 of such a networked sampled-data system cannot be altered by arbitrary delays.

However, the evolutionary process uncertainty within the algorithm weakens the optimization reliability. To deal with this concern, a robust multiobjective CSO with a predictive indicator (RMOCSO-PI), is proposed. This approach can reduce aimless and inefficient searches caused by the uncertainty to enhance algorithmic robustness. First, a predictive indicator is established based on the autoregressive model, which utilizes historical swarm distribution data to predict the evolutionary trends. Then, the particles are classified into winners and losers by evaluating their evolutionary potential, whose evolution would be guided differentially. Second, a space fusion-based competitive mechanism is designed to generate precise evolution directions for loser particles. The space fusion-based adaptive adjustment method integrates the learning cost metric in decision space with the learning worth metric in objective space for proper learning weight settings. Third, a dynamic cooperative mechanism is presented to purposefully guide the diversity exploration of particles. By estimating evolutionary states, three cooperative patterns are dynamically assigned to particles for purposeful diversity exploration. To provide theoretical support for the validity and reliability of RMOCSO-PI, a convergence analysis is given. Furthermore, experimental results verify that RMOCSO-PI has more stable and excellent optimization performance.},

  abstract     = {Spatio-temporal forecasting plays a crucial role in the dynamic perception of smart cities, such as traffic flow prediction, renewable energy forecasting, and load prediction. Its objective is to understand the patterns of spatio-temporal changes under the interaction of various factors. Accurate spatio-temporal forecasting relies on sufficient high-quality data and powerful models. However, in reality, data is often sparse. In such cases, while adaptive graphs and large language models (LLMs) can maintain performance, they face issues of spatial spurious associations and hallucinations, respectively. These issues hinder the ability of the model to learn and infer cross spatio-temporal and cross-scale features effectively. To address this, we propose a novel model termed spatio-temporal causal intervention large language model (STCInterLLM). This model employs a newly designed causal intervention encoder to update spatial spurious correlations in the spatio-temporal adaptive graph. Subsequently, the novel chain-of-action prompting text is utilized to enforce the decomposition of the prediction process, thereby enhancing the causal representation of features while mitigating hallucinations in LLMs. Finally, a lightweight marker alignment module ensures the consistency between the encoder, prompting text, and LLM, enabling accurate forecasting of distinct scale spatio-temporal evolution patterns. Extensive experiments conducted on power distribution systems integrated with renewable energy sources and transportation systems encompassing diverse types of data, demonstrate that the proposed STCInterLLM consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance across significantly varied scenarios.

A fixed-time stable system with fast convergence rate is developed by using switching terms to design a newly sliding mode variable with the norm-normalized sign function. Then, on the basis of the reconstructed information from the fixed-time observer and the sliding mode variable, a robust control law is developed to realize fixed-time-synchronized stability of the EL system. It is concluded by Lyapunov stability theorem that the proposed method not only can guarantee that the boundary of convergence time is irrelevant of initial values of the system states, but also make all elements of the system tracking errors reach the origin simultaneously under the influence of actuator faults, external disturbances and uncertain dynamics.

Considering an unsafe MAS with these two issues, this article targets the resolution of a category of nonconvex optimization problems under the Polyak–Łojasiewicz (P–Ł) condition. To address this problem, we first identify and construct the unsafe MAS model. Under this kind of unfavorable MASs, we mask the local gradients with Gaussian noise and adopt a resilient aggregation method, self-centered clipping (SCC), to design a differentially private (DP) and Byzantine-resilient (BR) decentralized stochastic gradient algorithm, dubbed DP-SCC-PL, aiming to address a class of nonconvex optimization problems in the presence of both privacy leakage and Byzantine issues. The convergence analysis of DP-SCC-PL is challenging, as the convergence error arises from the coupled effects of DP and BR mechanisms, as well as the nonconvex relaxation, which is resolved via seeking the contraction relationships among the disagreement measure of reliable agents before and after the SCC aggregation, together with the optimal gap. Theoretical results not only reveal the trilemma between algorithm utility, resilience, and privacy, but also show that DP-SCC-PL can achieve consensus among all reliable agents. It has also been proven that if there are no privacy issues and Byzantine agents, then the asymptotic exact convergence can be recovered. Numerical experiments verify the utility, resilience, and privacy of DP-SCC-PL by tackling a nonconvex optimization problem satisfying the P–Ł condition under various Byzantine attacks.},

  abstract     = {While reinforcement learning (RL) has shown experimental success in a number of applications, it is known to be sensitive to noise and perturbations in the parameters of the system, leading to high variability in the total reward amongst different episodes on slightly different environments. To introduce robustness, as well as sample efficiency, risk-sensitive RL methods are being thoroughly studied. In this work, we provide a definition of robust RL policies and formulate a risk-sensitive RL problem to approximate them, by solving an optimization problem with respect to a modified objective based on exponential criteria. In particular, we study a model-free risk-sensitive variation of the widely used Monte Carlo policy gradient algorithm, and introduce a novel risk-sensitive online Actor-Critic algorithm based on solving a multiplicative Bellman equation using stochastic approximation updates. Analytical results suggest that the use of exponential criteria generalizes commonly used ad-hoc regularization approaches, improves sample efficiency, and introduces robustness with respect to perturbations in the model parameters and the environment. The implementation, performance, and robustness properties of the proposed methods are evaluated in simulated experiments.},

  abstract     = {Concept drift, characterized by changes in data distribution over time, has always been an inevitable problem in nonstationary data stream environments. Multistream scenarios are particularly complex due to the potential alteration of interstream correlations, posing significant challenges in addressing concept drift across multiple streams. Most existing adaptation methods target single-stream data, with limited research on multistream. To address these gaps, we propose a Continuous Graph Learning-based self-adaptation framework for Multistream concept drift, termed as CGLM. Our framework introduces a novel graph neural network (GNN) structure embedded with a dynamic graph generator (AGG). This generator creates an adaptive correlation graph using small-scale historical data, capturing spatio-temporal dependencies among streams without predefined graphs during the training phase. A base prediction GNN model is then initialized. When online testing starts, real-time performance is monitored to detect concept drift. Self-adaptation process is achieved by subgraph updating, with different continuous graph learning mechanisms are applied to nondrift or drift scenarios. Lightweight adjustment of subgraphs is performed under nondrift. When drift occurs, AGG generates a new dynamic graph based on newly arriving samples. Our adaptive diffusion graph attention module (ADGAT) captures local correlation changes caused by the drift in the newly generated dynamic graph. It adaptively updates the weights of the original correlation graph based on the extent of the drift. Experimental results on three large-scale real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method over all baseline methods. Additionally, when large-scale data is available for training, our proposed CGLM still surpasses baseline methods.},

This article addresses the inference conservatism issue in multitype feature tracking. We propose a target-observation constraint framework to formalize discrimination conservatism across feature map channels. A learning constraint transformation methodology is introduced to cluster similar representations while pushing dissimilar ones apart. These discriminant constraints are further fine-tuned through joint learning with correlation filters, improving the positional precision of detection responses. Additionally, we propose an updating strategy that suppresses low scores of symmetric dispersion ratio, enhancing tracking robustness.

This article proposes the improved estimation distribution algorithm-based latent feature distribution evolution (MEDA_LUDE) algorithm, an evolutionary algorithm-assisted deep distribution learning framework that optimizes latent feature distributions through a multivariate Gaussian mixture (GM) assumption and a novel four-phase training strategy. We introduce a large-margin GM (L-GM) loss to dynamically model covariances for feature learning and design a MEDA that evolves latent features via a similarity-guided fitness function, thus enhancing diversity while preserving synthesis quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate significant improvements: MEDA_LUDE achieves 95.9% accuracy on MNIST (imbalanced ratio-IR:100), surpassing state-of-the-art methods by 1.26% on CIFAR-10. For industrial fabric defect data sets, it elevates accuracy by 1.45% on DHU-FD and 0.92% on ALIYUN-FD, especially with precision and G-mean improvements of 2.5% and 1.17%, respectively, on DHU-FD.

  abstract     = {In machine fault diagnosis, conventional data-driven models trained by empirical risk minimization (ERM) often fail to generalize across domains with distinct data distributions caused by various machine operating conditions. One major reason is that ERM primarily focuses on informativeness of data labels and lacks sufficient attention on invariance of data features. To enable invariance on top of informativeness, a learning framework, learning invariant features via in-label swapping for generalizing out-of-distribution (Lifeisgood), is proposed in this study. Lifeisgood is inspired by a simple intuition that invariance can be assessed by checking changes in loss due to swapping certain entries of features with the same labels. Lifeisgood also enjoys a theoretical guarantee on improving testing domain performance under certain conditions based on a swapping 0-1 loss proposed in this work. To circumvent the training difficulties associated with the swapping 0-1 loss, a swapping cross-entropy loss is derived as a surrogate and theoretical justifications for such a relaxation are also provided. As a result, Lifeisgood can be employed conveniently to develop data-driven fault diagnosis models. In the experiments, Lifeisgood outperformed the majority of state-of-the-art methods in terms of average accuracy and exceeded the second-best by 25% in terms of the frequency of beating the generic ERM.

  abstract     = {Landscape painting is a gem of cultural and artistic heritage that showcases the splendor of nature through the deep observations and imaginations of its painters. Limited by traditional techniques, these artworks were confined to static imagery in ancient times, leaving the dynamism of landscapes and the subtleties of artistic sentiment to the viewer’s imagination. Recently, emerging text-to-video (T2V) diffusion methods have shown significant promise in video generation, providing hope for the creation of dynamic landscape paintings. However, current T2V methods focus on generating natural videos, emphasizing the capture of details and the authenticity of physical laws. In contrast, landscape painting videos emphasize the overall dynamic aesthetic. Besides, challenges, such as the lack of specific datasets, the intricacy of artistic styles, and the creation of extensive, high-quality videos pose difficulties for these models in generating landscape painting videos. In this article, we propose landscape painting videos-high definition (LPV-HD), a novel T2V dataset for landscape painting videos, and noise-aware diffusion model (NADM), a T2V model that utilizes Stable Diffusion. Specifically, we present a motion module featuring a dual attention mechanism to capture the dynamic transformations of landscape imageries, alongside a noise adapter to leverage unsupervised contrastive learning in the latent space to ensure the overall beauty of the landscape painting video. Following the generation of keyframes, we employ optical flow for frame interpolation to enhance video smoothness. Our method not only retains the essence of the landscape painting imageries but also achieves dynamic transitions, significantly advancing the field of artistic video generation.

  abstract     = {Most existing prescribed performance formation control methods impose performance requirements on the consensus error rather than directly on the relative states between agents, which limits the physical interpretability of their solutions. This article proposes a novel adaptive prescribed performance formation control strategy that ensures prescribed performance of relative errors in uncertain high-order multiagent systems under both directed and undirected graphs. Since performance constraints are considered for relative errors, the error dynamics involve a coupled nonlinear interaction term that contains global graphical information among agents, making the design of a fully distributed control strategy more challenging. By proposing a series of nonlinear mappings and utilizing the edge Laplacian along with Lyapunov stability theory, the presented formation control scheme offers several advantages over existing approaches. Different performance requirements can be accommodated in a unified manner by solely tuning the design parameters a priori, eliminating the need for control redesign and stability reanalysis under the proposed fixed control protocol. This enhances user-friendliness and reduces implementation complexity. Furthermore, the verification process for the initial constraint, which is often complex and burdensome in existing prescribed performance control methods, is entirely avoided when the performance requirements are global. Additionally, the proposed approach fully decouples nonlinear interactions and ensures the asymptotic stability of the formation manifold through an adaptive parameter estimation technique. The effectiveness of the theoretical results is demonstrated through simulations.},

Second, a class of universal barrier Lyapunov function (UBLF) is adopted to set restrictions on distance, which ensures that collisions are avoided and communication connectivity is maintained. In addition, based on a dynamic auxiliary variable, the communication resources are saved with the use of the dynamic event-triggered control scheme.

  abstract     = {It is one of the most essential processes in the industrial cyber-physical system (ICPS) that multiple edge computing nodes (ECNs) collect field sensor information and cooperate for sensing and control. The exchange of sensing information on the edge side is critical for these ECNs that serve as multiple edge estimators and one edge controller. However, the limited transmission resources and the diverse performance demands of ECNs for sensing and control make it challenging to design the edge network topology delicately. For this issue, a novel dynamic observability (DO) condition is proposed to balance sensing-control performance and transmission cost under various demand settings. Based on the quantitative analysis of the relationship between overall transmission cost and each ECN’s effective observability, DO gives the criterion for desirable network topologies with spatio-temporal dynamics. Then for the given performance demands, a dynamic observability guaranteed method (DOGM) is proposed to determine the network topology by triggering proper sensing links. In this way, the set of triggered sensing links may vary in a dynamic manner to satisfy the DO condition, and the overall performance of sensing and control is theoretically guaranteed. Finally, the comprehensive advantages of DOGM are demonstrated by the simulation study in the hot rolling laminar cooling process.},

  abstract     = {Networks objectively portray functional distributions in practical systems, streamlining optimization and information extraction from typological structures. Recent studies have intensified scrutiny of the robust competitive influence maximization (RCIM) problem, focusing on identifying the most impactful seed set for effective and robust propagation. Literature offers performance metrics and algorithms that integrate diverse groups, suggesting potential synergy among them and the value of diverse candidates for balanced group performance. However, a thorough study toward the RCIM problem is still pendent, and a well-developed paradigm for attaining the equilibrium across groups is in demand. This article addresses these challenges by introducing multitask optimization in competitive network seed determination. A multitask framework is constructed, encompassing distinct diffusion scenarios for multiple groups and the network as a whole. To tackle this problem, we develop a Multi-Factorial Evolutionary Algorithm for RCIM (MFEA-RCIM). MFEA-RCIM leverages dedicated operators to exploit task parallelism and fosters competition among diffusion groups through a transfer operation. Experimental results on synthetic and practical networks demonstrate that MFEA-RCIM outperforms existing methods, with efficiency gains attributed to the multitasking optimization strategy.},

  abstract     = {This article presents a novel event-triggered sliding-mode control (ET-SMC) strategy for impulsive nonlinear systems (INS) in the presence of matched disturbances. Most of the existing sliding mode control (SMC) strategies work well when the system continually converges toward a predefined sliding surface, but have been proven to be inapplicable for discontinuous systems subjected to impulsive disturbances. Consequently, it becomes crucial and imperative to develop SMC strategies tailored for discontinuous dynamics affected by impulsive phenomena. Leveraging the event-triggering mechanism with a time-varying threshold and incorporating piecewise Lyapunov function techniques, we propose a novel ET-SMC strategy. It is proved that the proposed control strategy can effectively avoid Zeno behavior and ensure the finite-time stability (FTS) of the considered system via finite-time control theory and innovative impulsive estimation schemes. Furthermore, our results quantitatively measure changes in convergence rate under varying impulsive conditions, which provides valuable insights for performance analysis and the design of SMC strategies in such scenarios. As a specific application, we apply the proposed ET-SMC strategy to coupled reaction-diffusion neural networks (RDNNs) in the presence of both cyber-attacks and matched disturbances. Finally, we present several simulation examples to illustrate the effectiveness and practical applicability of the analytical methods presented in this article.},

  abstract     = {Location information is crucial for efficient task assignment in spatial crowdsourcing, but sharing such information raises privacy concerns. Differential privacy (DP) offers a solution by protecting location privacy while preserving data usefulness. Existing DP-based spatial crowdsourcing frameworks have two main limitations: 1) they fail to provide personalized privacy preservation for workers and 2) they prioritize incentive mechanisms (such as utility maximization and cost minimization) while overlooking quality control. To address these limitations, we formulate the multiobjective privacy-preserving task assignment (MP-TA) problem. This problem aims to maximize both incentives and quality while meeting service rate requirements and ensuring personalized privacy protection for workers. Accordingly, we present a three-phase framework comprising worker proposal, candidate worker selection, and task assignment optimization. To generate high-quality eligible solutions for both objectives, we introduce a distributed cooperative co-evolutionary multiobjective memetic algorithm (DCC-MMA) based on sequential subproblem division and knee-driven migration operation. Matching-based crossover, matching-based mutation, and fix operations are designed to enhance search efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate DCC-MMA’s superiority in solution quality, convergence speed, and scalability compared to state-of-the-art algorithms.},

As a promising control-oriented theory, the FAS approach is a convenient and powerful tool for nonlinear control. However, the stabilization of sub-FASs, whose input matrix function is not globally invertible, is more sophisticated and challenging due to the issue of control singularity. To address the global fault-tolerant stabilization of uncertain sub-FASs, a high-order nonlinear system model with both multiplicative and additive actuator faults is considered. By introducing the concepts of linear singular set and singularity function, the entire state space is analytically divided into several regions. Then, according to the initial states of system, three different control strategies are developed to overcome singularity and achieve global stabilization, including a FAS-based stabilizing control law, a singularity-avoid tracking control strategy, as well as a singularity-free switching control strategy. The closed-loop response of the faulty system is proven to be ultimately uniformly bounded in all cases, and the effectiveness of proposed method is illustrated through a numerical example.},

First, an augmented Q-function, consisting of a quadratic utility function and an adjustable positive-definite control barrier function (CBF), is devised to ensure both the optimality and safety of the tracking controller. The quadratic utility function, associated with optimality, guarantees that the tracking controller can eliminate the ultimate tracking error, regardless of the reference trajectory. The adjustable positive-definite CBF, pertaining to safety, ensures that the tracking error converges faster toward zero while remaining within the safe set at all times. Second, an accelerated iterative learning mechanism, comprising policy evaluation (PE) and policy improvement (PI), is employed to discover the safe optimal tracking control policy. Integrating the difference between two iterative Q-functions into the current PE process can expedite the convergence rate of the SQL algorithm. A policy optimization technique based on Nesterov Momentum method is utilized to accelerate the PI process of the SQL algorithm. When faced with a large amount of offline data, the two-stage accelerated learning effectively reduces computational pressure. Furthermore, convergence of the Q-function sequence and safety of the optimal tracking policy are theoretically analyzed. Finally, by using neural networks and the action-critic structure, two simulation examples are performed to verify the availability of accelerated SQL methods.},

  abstract     = {Large-scale sparse multiobjective optimization problems (LSMOPs) are of great significance in the context of practical applications, such as critical node detection, feature selection, and pattern mining. Since many LSMOPs are pursued based on large datasets, they involve a large number of decision variables, resulting in a huge search space that is challenging to explore efficiently. To rapidly approximate sparse Pareto optimal solutions, some evolutionary algorithms have been proposed to reduce the dimensionality of LSMOPs. However, their adaptability to different LSMOPs remains limited due to their reliance on fixed dimensionality reduction schemes, which can potentially lead to local optima and inefficient utilization of function evaluations. To address this issue, a knowledge learning-based dimensionality reduction approach is proposed in this article. First, in the early stages of evolution, the impact of different dimensionality reduction schemes on the sparse distribution of the population is evaluated. Then, the multilayer perceptron is employed to learn the accumulated knowledge from the evolutionary process, thereby constructing a mapping model between the sparse features of the evolutionary process and the candidate dimensionality reduction schemes. Finally, the model recommends the best dimensionality reduction scheme in each generation, achieving a good balance between exploration and exploitation. Experimental evaluations on both benchmark and real-world LSMOPs demonstrate that an evolutionary algorithm incorporating the proposed knowledge learning-based dimensionality reduction approach outperforms most existing evolutionary algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Learning differential evolution (DE) algorithms are widely adopted to address flexible job-shop scheduling problems (FJSPs) because of the optimization ability. However, traditional learning DEs are not sufficient to develop the feature information of the problem. In this article, a feature-based learning DE algorithm (FLDE) is proposed to address FJSP considering worker health. Occupational repetitive actions index (OCRA) is an indicator that describes the degree of worker fatigue. The OCRA is utilized to ensure the feasibility of scheduling solutions generated by FLDE. A feature-based decision model (FDM) is designed to select the appropriate optimization operator for a scheduling solution. A critical operation search method is introduced to extract feature information from the scheduling solution. Experimental results reveal that FDM is critical to improving the local optimization ability of FLDE, and that FLDE outperforms the comparison algorithms on 40 problem instances.},

  abstract     = {The artificial potential function (APF) is a widely applied algorithm in collision-free formation control in multiagent systems (MASs). However, it suffers from oscillations and acceleration surges, particularly when the current formation and the desired one conflict. To address this problem and enhance collision-free formation control in MAS, this article introduces the time-derivative of APFs. This approach unifies attractive and repulsive APFs. The gradients of the APFs transform potential and kinetic energy, and the time-derivative of the APF gradients serve as damping terms to dissipate energy. This article discusses the general properties of APFs and introduces a time-variant formation tracking scheme that encompasses existing algorithms as specific instances. Then, a collision-free formation control algorithm is presented. This article gives proof of its Lyapunov stability and collision avoidance ability, followed by a maneuverability analysis from the geometry perspective. By incorporating the time-derivatives of repulsive APF gradients as damping terms, the proposed method mitigates oscillations and acceleration surges caused by conflicting attractive and repulsive effects.},

Existing label enhancement models primarily focus on increasing the distances between labels from different classes, which inadvertently expands the distance within the same category. For classification tasks, maintaining similarity within the intraclass is essential for ensuring the model’s effectiveness. To address this issue, we propose a groupwise label enhancement BLS model that ensures both intraclass similarity and interclass disparity of labels. Specifically, we develop a novel regression target that generalizes existing label enhancement targets in BLS, increasing the distances between labels of different classes while overcoming the constraints imposed by binary labels. Moreover, we design a groupwise constraint to jointly enhance the intraclass similarity and interclass disparity of labels. Additionally, we propose a novel alternating direction method of multipliers-based optimization algorithm to solve our proposed model, ensuring both computational efficiency and theoretical convergence.

  abstract     = {Anomaly detection is a cornerstone of industrial safety, enabling real-time monitoring of process operations by identifying deviations from normal conditions through statistical analysis. In real-world industrial scenarios, the nonstationary properties of multivariate time-series data present a common and substantial challenge. Existing methods for extracting stationary sources $(\mathcal {SS}s)$ mainly rely on weak stationarity (i.e., mean and variance), but their performance is limited by the long-tailed distributions common in industrial datasets. Higher-order moments, in contrast, provide a more comprehensive statistical description, capturing complex data characteristics that the mean and variance overlook. To bridge this significant gap, we propose a continuous stationary moment analysis (Co-SMA) anomaly detection framework. Its core innovation is the SMA algorithm, which introduces a novel objective function to minimize cumulative sum of the differences in multiorder moments between each epoch and the overall data, effectively fulfilling the $\mathcal {SS}$ estimation task. Furthermore, to overcome the inefficiencies of traditional model updating methods, we develop an event-triggered model updating framework based on the model bias index and first-order perturbation theory. Within this framework, we introduce a convex hull coverage metric, which enables the model to be adjusted efficiently according to the data distribution drift. The framework also incorporates iterative refinement of detection statistics and thresholds, establishing a dynamic adjustment mechanism that ensures optimal performance across diverse operating conditions. The theoretical basis of Co-SMA’s properties is rigorously established. Experimental evaluations on numerical simulations and real-world datasets from the ironmaking process demonstrate Co-SMA’s superior capabilities in $\mathcal {SS}$ estimation and anomaly detection.},

To satisfy robustness concerns, an iterative learning control (ILC) algorithm with an indirect reference update framework is designed to improve the accuracy and robustness of path following.

First, in view of band-limited communication channels in CPSs, the quantizer is used to quantize the measured output. Second, owing to the open and shared network of CPSs, the data transmission process is more susceptible to attacks. A multichannel transmission framework is constructed under the assumption that each transmitted data element is susceptible to potential attacks. The switching dynamics among various attack forms launched by the adversary on the transmission channel are governed by a semi-Markov chain. The analysis of multimode attacks with stealth characteristics is conducted within the framework of a hidden semi-Markov jump mode, which is achieved by establishing a dual-layer stochastic process comprising a multimode sequence and an observed mode sequence. Leveraging emission probability, we design an observed-mode-dependent controller capable of stabilizing the system even in the absence of direct access to the actual attack patterns and in the presence of information loss. The simulations involving a single-channel unmanned ground vehicle system and a mass-spring–damper system with two channels are provided to validate the feasibility and efficacy of our proposed methodology.},

First, to reach FxTS, two sufficient conditions are proposed to guarantee that the Kuramoto oscillator network can reach fixed-time phase agreement and frequency synchronization. Unlike finite/fixed-time controllers, the prescribed-time controller in this article includes a time-varying function term, which is essential to ensure that the system achieves the prescribed-time phase agreement and frequency synchronization. At the same time, the setting-time for PTS is independent of the system initial values or controller parameters, which expands the application prospects of the system. Then, with limited setting-time as a premise, the energy consumed during the fixed/prescribed-time control process is obtained, which helps to evaluate the working time of the system. Finally, an example of a 5-node network is used to illustrate the effectiveness of FxTS and PTS in Kuramoto-oscillator networks.},

Specifically, a fixed-time resilient distributed NE seeking algorithm is first designed to guarantee players actions to converge toward the NE against DoS attacks.

  abstract     = {Evolutionary multitasking (EMT) is an emerging approach for solving multitask optimization problems (MTOPs) and has garnered considerable research interest. The implicit EMT is a significant research branch that utilizes evolution operators to enable knowledge transfer (KT) between tasks. However, current approaches in implicit EMT face challenges in adaptability, due to the limited use of different evolution operators with different parameter settings and insufficient utilization of evolutionary states for performing KT. This results in suboptimal exploitation of implicit KT’s potential to tackle a variety of MTOPs. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel learning-to-transfer (L2T) framework to automatically discover efficient KT policies for the MTOPs at hand. Our framework conceptualizes the KT process as a learning agent’s sequence of strategic decisions within the EMT process. We propose an action formulation for deciding when and how to transfer, a state representation with informative features of evolution states, a reward formulation concerning convergence and transfer efficiency gain, and the environment for the agent to interact with MTOPs. We employ an actor-critic network structure for the agent and learn the policy via proximal policy optimization. This learned agent can be integrated with various evolutionary algorithms, enhancing their ability to address unseen MTOPs. Comprehensive empirical studies on both synthetic and real-world MTOPs, encompassing diverse intertask relationships, function classes, and task distributions are conducted to validate the proposed L2T framework. The results show a marked improvement in the adaptability and performance of implicit EMT when solving a wide spectrum of unseen MTOPs.},

Different from the results obtained by existing chaotic Lur’e systems, the time delay involved in the chaotic Lur’e system explored in this study does not require that the time delay must be differentiable and there is no limit that the time delay must be bounded, which is more in accordance with the operating situation in practical engineering. Subsequently, aiming at the inevitable cyber-attack in the communication network environment, an intermittent observer based on the loss of partial measurement information induced by cyber-attack is constructed. Especially, in the operation process of the designed intermittent estimator, it breaks through the strict requirement that the observation width must be greater than the upper limit of the delay in the existing work, which intuitively reflects the wider application range and has more exploratory significance. Moreover, a meaningful lemma is designed, which effectively overcomes the invalidity of existing Lyapunov function or Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional methods for nondifferentiable systems, and develops novel criteria for partial information loss and nondifferentiable systems, presenting an important theoretical guidance for related topics. Numerical simulations are provided to verify the effectiveness of the proposed intermittent observer mechanism and the stabilization criteria of the error system.

  abstract     = {This article proposes a novel scalable control strategy for large-scale direct current microgrids (LSDCmGs) consisting of multiple distributed generation units (DGUs). The objective is to facilitate real-time plug-and-play (PnP) functionality for DGUs, despite the presence of power transmission line coupling. In brief, the insertion or removal of DGUs does not require reconfiguration of adjacent controllers to maintain the stability of the entire LSDCmGs. To achieve this goal, a generalized free-weighting matrix technology is introduced. The strict assumptions previously made on Lyapunov matrices are ingeniously shifted to free-weighting matrices by this technology. As a result, scalable control is achieved and conservatism is reduced simultaneously. Moreover, the topological structure of LSDCmGs frequently undergoes changes due to external factors, equipment failures, and line issue. Markov chains are employed to accurately model these variations, providing a more realistic analysis of the microgrid’s operational states. Additionally, by selecting a mode-related structured Lyapunov-Krasovskii function, sufficient criteria are derived to realize tracking of a given reference voltage in the LSDCmGs under PnP operation. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed scalable strategy is validated through a case study involving the LSDCmGs with five DGUs.},

A generalized switching rule, instead of a Markov/semi-Markov process, is utilized to scrutinize the switching behavior of subsystems. This approach characterizes the dynamic nature of sojourn probabilities using single-mode-based sojourn time, aiming to decrease computational load while meeting the demands of real-world scenarios. Considering the intricacies of network environments, the unknown dead zone inputs are considered, which can be effectively implemented via the adaptive neural network-based control law. To counteract the adverse effects of unforeseen information, a saturation-based observer is developed, in which the saturation level is dynamically adjusted with the hope of providing greater flexibility. Utilizing a Lyapunov function that correlates with the detected mode and the system mode, sufficient criteria are established to ensure that the closed-loop system remains bounded in probability. Eventually, the practicality and effectiveness of the proposed control methodology are verified through two simulated examples.},

To overcome this limitation, we propose a boundary continuity-aware Gaussian encoder (BCGE). Specifically, BCGE directly predicts target Gaussian distributions for proposals and learns an oriented bounding box as an integrated 2-D matrix, effectively addressing boundary discontinuity issues. We also propose a transformation from Gaussian representation back to boxes and extend this transformation theory to the complex domain to adapt to the learning characteristics of neural networks. Furthermore, BCGE serves as a versatile plug-and-play architectural encoder, directly replacing the standard coding process in various oriented detectors with adaptability.

By formulating the cost functions for these three participants, it seeks to derive the optimal solution and the interplay between their respective optimal strategies. Meanwhile, two complicated situations are taken into account: The asynchronous behavior between the system and controller is caused by deception attacks tampering with switching signals; The open-loop operation of the system is caused by DoS attacks blocking the output of the controller. In the joint design of the two-tier multiattacker Stackelberg game approach and average dwell time technique, the system’s mean square exponential stability is guaranteed while revealing the quantitative relationship between the deception attack, DoS attack, and asynchronous switching behaviors.

  abstract     = {In practice, many mechanical systems are underactuated, such as naval vessels, cranes, and helicopters, to reduce energy consumption and enhance flexibility. However, compounded by strong nonlinearity arising from state coupling, the underactuated nature and high-order unavailable states pose great challenges to motion control (particularly for unactuated states lacking independent actuators or kinematic constraints). In this article, an adaptive controller based on fully-actuated system methods is proposed, together with a general and extensible analysis method. First, a group of high-order auxiliary variables, consisting of actuated/unactuated states, their derivatives, and proportional-differential terms, are designed to rearrange the nonlinear underactuated system as a high-order linear fully-actuated system without any linearization operations. The asymptotic convergence of auxiliary variables theoretically eliminates the steady-state errors of actuated/unactuated states together. For high-order unmeasurable variables, they are recovered by the constructed neural network observer to estimate high-order dynamics, which avoids discontinuous robust terms and improves the accuracy of compensation/positioning. Motivated by the inherent features and advantages of fully-actuated systems, this article proposes the first fully-actuated system-based continuous adaptive controller for a class of underactuated robots. Moreover, it is convenient to extend the proposed controller to handle more practical problems, such as state delay, without the need to reconduct Lyapunov-based analysis. In addition to complete theoretical frames, this article also provides several experimental validation.},

  abstract     = {Domain-adaptive object detection (DAOD) aims to generalize detectors trained in labeled source domains to unlabeled target domains by mitigating domain bias. Recent studies have confirmed that pretrained vision-language models (VLMs) are promising tools to enhance the generalizability of detectors. However, there exist paradigm discrepancies between single-domain detection in most existing works and DAOD tasks, which may hinder the fine-grained alignment of cross-domain visual-text features. In addition, some preliminary solutions to these discrepancies may potentially neglect relational reasoning in prompts and cross-modal information interactions, which are crucial for fine-grained alignment. To this end, this article explores fine-grained visual-text feature alignment in DAOD with prompt tuning and organizes a novel framework termed FGPro that contains three elaborated levels. First, at the prompt level, a learnable domain-adaptive prompt is organized and a prompt relation encoder is constructed to infer intertoken semantic relations in the prompt. At the model level, a bidirectional cross-modal attention is structured to fully interact visual and textual fine-grained information. In addition, we customize a prompt-guided cross-domain regularization strategy to inject domain-invariant and domain-specific information into prompts in a disentangled manner. The three designs effectively align the fine-grained visual-text features of the source-target domain to facilitate the capture of domain-aware information. Experiments on four cross-domain scenarios show that FGPro exhibits notable performance improvements over existing work (Cross-weather: +1.0% AP50; Simulation-to-real: +1.2% AP50; Cross-camera: +1.3% AP50; Industry: +2.8% AP50), validating the effectiveness of its fine-grained alignment.},

However, it is difficult to capture larger number of faces with fever labels, which makes learning facial temperature representation extremely difficult. To overcome this limitation, we propose a self-supervised fever screening framework (SelfFS) to learn temperature representation from infrared face images. Specifically, SelfFS employs rate reduction theory to guide the network to focus on temperature features by expanding the coding rate of faces with different temperatures and compressing the coding rate of faces with the same temperature but different appearances. Furthermore, we impose sparsity constraints on the network parameters, which facilitates the extraction of simple temperature features with a limited number of neurons while filtering complex appearance features. Experiments demonstrate that our SelfFS framework outperforms existing fever screening techniques and achieves the comparable results with the supervised methods.},

The algorithm is designed to address severe attacks on the forward controller-actuator (C-A) channel, the feedback sensor-controller (S-C) channel, and the channels between subsystems, without any prior information about the intruder available to the defender. To mitigate the negative effects of intruders, we consider a one-step time delay strategy in the local model predictive controller design. This strategy allows the generated controller data to be checked for acceptability before use. To ensure constraint satisfaction for an infinite-horizon MPC problem while accounting for the unknown duration of attacks, we develop a set of minimally conservative constraints in the open-loop control mode using a constraint tightening technique. Moreover, we obtain an equivalent finite number of constraints for the infinite-horizon problem to ensure recursive feasibility. To prevent tampered data from affecting control performance, a detector module is designed to decide whether data is used by its receiver. It is shown that the closed-loop system is uniformly ultimate boundedness (UUB) under any admissible attack scenario and disturbance realization. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is validated by a case study.},

First, a delay-interval-adjustable-based Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional (LKF) is proposed, in which the delay interval is adjusted by a tunable parameter to obtain an optimal extended dissipativity result, offering a new idea to enhance the consideration of delay information. Furthermore, to take into account more effective information, the LKF is augmented with both single and quadratic integral variables. Accordingly, the LKF derivative becomes a higher-order term of the time-varying delay. To solve this nonlinear problem, a variable-augmented-based free-weighting-matrices approach is employed to transform the nonlinear term into a linear form and provides more freedom in obtaining enhanced EDA results. Then, two novel extended dissipativity criteria of delayed MJNNs are derived. Meanwhile, to show the general applicability of the proposed methods, the derived criteria are applied to the EDA and stability analysis for delayed neural networks (NNs). Lastly, the merits and effectiveness of the proposed techniques are demonstrated through three numerical examples and a real-world application of a quadruple-tank process system.

  abstract     = {Recently, interest in flat-type projection clustering methods has grown as they improve learner’s performance by exploring multiple projection subspaces. However, solvers used in previous representative works predominantly rely on greedy search strategies, which incur high computational costs and fail to consider interdependencies between projections. Moreover, these methods do not simultaneously guarantee the effective suppression of outliers and noisy data at cluster boundaries, ultimately compromising data discrimination. To address these limitations and discover a more effective subspace for each flat, we propose robust multiple flat projections clustering (RMFPC). This method computes within- and between-cluster distances using the L2,1-norm to enhance robustness against outliers. Furthermore, we propose a truncated distance maximization constraint (TDMC) to eliminate the influence of noisy data on cluster separability. The resulting objective is presented in a ratio form, which is not trivial. We provide a novel formulation to achieve a theoretically equivalent problem. Based on this reformulation, we develop an efficient non-greedy solution algorithm. In addition, a cluster center optimization mechanism is incorporated into the solution process to accurately estimate the distribution of each cluster center. The convergence analysis and proof of the proposed algorithm are provided. Experiments on both toy and real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {Accurate recognition of human motion intention (HMI) is beneficial for exoskeleton robots to improve the wearing comfort level and achieve natural human-robot interaction. A classifier trained on labeled source subjects (domains) performs poorly on unlabeled target subject since the difference in individual motor characteristics. The unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) method has become an effective way to this problem. However, the labeled data are collected from multiple source subjects that might be different not only from the target subject but also from each other. The current UDA methods for HMI recognition ignore the difference between each source subject, which reduces the classification accuracy. Therefore, this article considers the differences between source subjects and develops a novel theory and algorithm for UDA to recognize HMI, where the margin disparity discrepancy (MDD) is extended to multisource UDA theory and a novel weight-aware-based multisource UDA algorithm (WMDD) is proposed. The source domain weight, which can be adjusted adaptively by the MDD between each source subject and target subject, is incorporated into UDA to measure the differences between source subjects. The developed multisource UDA theory is theoretical and the generalization error on target subject is guaranteed. The theory can be transformed into an optimization problem for UDA, successfully bridging the gap between theory and algorithm. Moreover, a lightweight network is employed to guarantee the real-time of classification and the adversarial learning between feature generator and ensemble classifiers is utilized to further improve the generalization ability. The extensive experiments verify theoretical analysis and show that WMDD outperforms previous UDA methods on HMI recognition tasks.},

The autonomous flight problem for quadrotor with monocular vision is investigated, which is divided into control layer and decision layer in this article. Reinforcement learning method is utilized for hierarchical optimization to ensure that quadrotor completes narrow space traversal tasks safely and efficiently. First, considering the dynamic characteristics of the quadrotor with the motor speed as the control input, a parallel policy iteration algorithm is designed for the nonaffine nonlinear system, and the proposed controller can be learned online to improve the fundamental control performance. On this basis, the autonomous decision problem with visual information as input is modeled as a Markov decision process, and a curriculum learning mechanism is introduced to overcome the difficulties caused by sparse reward. At the same time, the clipping function is optimized to improve the learning efficiency of proximal policy optimization (PPO) algorithm for autonomous flight capabilities. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed intelligent control and decision methods are verified through simulation.},

Distinct from existing stochastic switching strategies, a novel duration-time-based switching rule is proposed that integrates both sojourn probability and mode duration, significantly reducing computational complexity and aligning more closely with practical requirements. To mitigate mode-switching-induced chattering and enhance robustness against uncertainties and disturbances, an innovative fuzzy SMC law with a learning mechanism is developed. Notably, a recursive sliding-mode learning controller is introduced, replacing abrupt switching actions with iterative learning adjustments to progressively guide system states onto the sliding surface, thereby significantly improving control smoothness and reducing chattering. To effectively handle cyber-attacks disrupting mode transmission, a comprehensive mismatched model that dynamically synchronizes the modes of the system and the controller is introduced, offering improved resilience compared to traditional fixed mismatch approaches. Utilizing the proposed learning-based SMC and Lyapunov stability theory, sufficient conditions ensuring mean-square stability of the system are derived. Finally, the practical effectiveness and distinct superiority of the proposed methods are demonstrated through simulations using mass-spring–damper and tunnel diode circuit models.},

Once the condition is satisfied, there exists a stationary and deterministic scheduling policy that can stabilize all plants of the WNCS. By analyzing and representing the per-step cost function of the WNCS in terms of a finite-length countable vector state, we formulate the optimal transmission scheduling problem into a Markov decision process and develop a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based framework for solving it. To tackle the challenges of a large action space in DRL, we propose novel action space reduction and action embedding methods for the DRL framework that can be applied to various algorithms, including deep Q-network (DQN), deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG), and twin delayed DDPG (TD3).

However, achieving accurate tracking for underwater pipelines is challenging due to the complexity of UVMSs in terms of nonlinearity, strong coupling and underactuation. To solve the aforementioned problems, an underwater biomimetic vehicle-manipulator system (UBVMS) and an underwater pipeline tracking control method based on the robot vision are proposed. The UBVMS is equipped with the biomimetic undulatory fin propulsors and the biomimetic flipper propulsors, which are inspired by the median and/or paired fin propulsion mode and the body and/or caudal fin propulsion mode of fishes, respectively. The biomimetic undulatory fin propulsors provide the UBVMS with advantages of maneuverability and stability, while the biomimetic flipper propulsors enable the UBVMS to have improved acceleration ability. A tracking control algorithm with adaptive weight coefficients is designed to improve the pose stability of the UBVMS. A fuzzy rule mapping model is constructed to describe the nonlinear relationship between the biomimetic propulsors’ control parameters and the propulsive force/torque. Finally, four types of pipeline tracking experiments are conducted to verify the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed UBVMS and control algorithm.},

  abstract     = {Training neural networks (NNs) to behave as model predictive control (MPC) algorithms is an effective way to implement them in constrained embedded devices. By collecting large amounts of input-output data, where inputs represent system states and outputs are MPC-generated control actions, NNs can be trained to replicate MPC behavior at a fraction of the computational cost. However, although the composition of the training data critically influences the final NN accuracy, methods for systematically optimizing it remain underexplored. In this article, we introduce the concept of optimally-sampled datasets (OSDs) as ideal training sets and present an efficient algorithm for generating them. An OSD is a parametrized subset of all the available data that 1) preserves existing MPC information up to a certain numerical resolution; 2) avoids duplicate or near-duplicate states; and 3) becomes saturated or complete. We demonstrate the effectiveness of OSDs by training NNs to replicate the University of Virginia’s MPC algorithm for automated insulin delivery in Type-1 Diabetes, achieving a fourfold improvement in final accuracy. Notably, two OSD-trained NNs received regulatory clearance for clinical testing as the first NN-based control algorithm for direct human insulin dosing. This methodology opens new pathways for implementing advanced optimizations on resource-constrained embedded platforms, potentially revolutionizing how complex algorithms are deployed.},

Subsequently, the “cultural clash” between semantic interactions and bitstream-based system components is addressed through the application of fuzzy mathematical methods. Under such semantic-driven communication mechanism, raw data is successfully compressed. Building upon the efficient compression of data, a nonsingleton TOD scheduling scheme is presented. In comparison to the traditional TOD scheduling approaches that activate only one node per transmission, the proposed scheduling scheme facilitates the simultaneous transmission of information from multiple nodes, thereby enhancing system efficiency greatly. By data-modeling semantic disparities and designing the appropriate controller, the input-to-state stability of the studied system is guaranteed, even when confronted with certain levels of semantic discrepancies. Moreover, an algorithm is provided to optimize semantically-related parameters, so as to reduce semantic discrepancies as much as possible.

In this article, we develop a novel neuroadaptive admittance control with human motion intention (HMI) estimation and output error constraint for natural and stable interaction. First, the interaction force information of the robot is utilized to predict the HMI and the stiffness in the admittance model is dynamically updated based on surface electromyography (sEMG) signals of the human upper limb to achieve human-like compliance. Then, based on the designed error transformation mechanism, an innovative prescribed performance control (PPC) is proposed that allows the trajectory error to converge to the given constraint range within a predefined time for any bounded initial conditions, thus enabling the robot to maintain a comprehensive performance of moving in the desired direction as guided by the human. Also, an adaptive neural network (NN) is employed to compensate for the uncertainty of robotics systems to improve the tracking accuracy further. According to the Lyapunov stability analysis criterion, our approach ensures that all states of the closed-loop system remain globally uniformly ultimately bounded.

Considering the fact that existing autonomous exploration methods either focus only on maximizing the exploration of unknown areas or suffer from insufficient searches due to repeated and unnecessary exploration, this article introduces an effective object-searching strategy for UAVs in large-scale and complex environments. A novel method is proposed to empower UAVs with the capability to conduct fast, secure, and efficient searches for interested objects in large-scale and complex environments. A Kalman filter-based YOLO algorithm is first proposed to achieve robust object position estimation in cluttered and occlusion-prone scenarios, and a mode-based method is then introduced to conduct a computationally efficient viewpoint generation. A hierarchical searching method is proposed, which not only can increase computational and search efficiency but also can leverage frontier data for search-planning, including coarse global searching paths and optimizing local refined searching trajectories. Experimental results in six different environments indicate that our proposed method outperforms existing techniques in terms of both reduced searching times and computing time. Moreover, the effectiveness of the proposed method is substantiated in various real-world scenarios.},

First, with a directed graph, an adaptive boundary controller is developed under boundary measurements, which can effectively reduce the control cost with dynamic control gains and a few actuators and sensors installed at the boundary of the spatial domain. Then, through the designed adaptive boundary controller, the linear matrix inequality (LMI)-based consensus conditions are obtained to ensure the exponential stability of the consensus error systems derived by utilizing the inequality techniques and Lyapunov direct approach.

  abstract     = {The acceptance of academic papers involves a complex peer-review process that requires substantial human and material resources and is susceptible to biases. With advancements in deep learning technologies, researchers have explored automated approaches for assessing paper acceptance. Existing automated academic paper rating methods primarily rely on the full content of papers to estimate acceptance probabilities. However, these methods are often inefficient and introduce redundant or irrelevant information. Additionally, while Bert can capture general semantic representations through pretraining on large-scale corpora, its performance on the automatic academic paper rating (AAPR) task remains suboptimal due to discrepancies between its pretraining corpus and academic texts. To address these issues, this study proposes LMCBert, a model that integrates large language models (LLMs) with momentum contrastive learning (MoCo). LMCBert utilizes LLMs to extract the core semantic content of papers, reducing redundancy and improving the understanding of academic texts. Furthermore, it incorporates MoCo to optimize Bert training, enhancing the differentiation of semantic representations and improving the accuracy of paper acceptance predictions. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that LMCBert achieves effective performance on the evaluation dataset, supporting the validity of the proposed approach.

The further challenge we face is that the presence of discontinuous reference signals poses greater difficulties for control design. To tackle these issues, a mechanism for generating smooth, safe reference signals is first devised. Additionally, we propose a novel approach that utilizes improved prescribed performance functions to confine tracking errors within predetermined constant bounds in finite time, while avoiding potential singularity issues arising from abrupt changes in the reference signal. Furthermore, a decentralized adaptive learning error-constrained control strategy is proposed, employing neural networks to approximate complex uncertainties with an asymptotic dynamic surface control method. Stability analysis confirms that the proposed control scheme guarantees the asymptotic stability of the system and ensures safe tracking within conflicted irregular output constraints, even in the presence of input saturation.

In RSEQ, a novel event-based dynamic quantizer is designed to resist the negative effects of communication constraints on the algorithm. The quantizer encompasses the event generator and the dynamic encoder/decoder, which collectively adapt the frequency and size of information sharing based on real-time state. The RSEQ only requires the construction of a row-stochastic weight matrix, which leads to lower conservatism compared to algorithms based on column-stochastic matrices. Additionally, the introduction of an acceleration term enables RSEQ to linearly converge to the globally optimal solution without the deployment of the average gradient estimator. Instead, a Perron vector estimator needs to be employed to counteract the unbalancedness of the directed network. With the effect of the event generator, the Perron vector estimator can also be left inactive after a certain number of iterations, which means that the transmission of only state information between agents can linearly converge to the global optimal solution under directed networks. Finally, the effectiveness of the algorithm is demonstrated through an economic dispatch problem in smart grids.},

  abstract     = {Role-based collaboration (RBC) is an innovative collaborative approach designed to enhance collaboration. Role negotiation (RN) is a critical step in RBC, during which the role set and the number of agents required for each role, i.e., role requirements, are determined. This process establishes the foundational input for group role assignment (GRA), where roles are assigned to agents to optimize group performance. Uncertainties in RN, such as task volume fluctuations, create dynamic agent requirements. However, existing RBC models typically assume RN to be static, thus failing to adequately address the substantial challenges. Three-way decision (3WD) is a robust decision-making methodology well-suited for managing uncertainty. To address the uncertainties in role requirements, this article introduces truncated discrete distribution to quantify role requirements, and presents a novel group role three-way assignment (GR3A) model. Compared with traditional RBC, our model offers an additional variable partial substitute choice that offers agents little salary during nonengagement periods but can transition to full involvement as required according to the prior agreement. GR3A is a dual-objective nonlinear optimization problem, for which a linearization strategy is proposed to achieve the optimal resolution. Additionally, sufficient and necessary conditions for these assignment problems are put forward to enhance the efficacy of the proposed solutions. To our knowledge, this study innovatively introduces a truncated discrete distribution and 3WD into the RBC framework. Empirical validation through simulations demonstrates the effectiveness and efficacy of the proposed method within the RBC context.},

To address such actuator constraints, a gradual transition control (GTC) method is proposed, and update-free and update-weak policies are introduced to further optimize network performance. Additionally, in real-world distributed systems, the actor-critic networks deployed in each agent rely on data from neighboring agents, which necessitates addressing the issue of distributed synchronization. To address this challenge, the synchronization blocking method is designed, which designs additional control signals for each agent to handle these issues.

In this article, the data-driven model predictive control (DMPC) strategy is proposed to stabilize a class of unknown nonlinear NCSs with SSIs and successive packet dropouts (SPDs). First, an equivalent stochastic sampling model is constructed by capturing the randomness of both SSIs and SPDs, which can determine the probability information of the equivalent sampling interval between consecutive no-packet -dropout update instants. Subsequently, a multimodel predictive structure is designed based on the possible lengths of the sampling interval in the equivalent stochastic sampling model, which can provide predictive outputs for the subsequent controller design. Furthermore, to reduce the computational burden associated with the prolongation of the prediction horizon in the multimodel predictive structure, a prediction data interpolation algorithm based on the Lagrange interpolation polynomial is introduced. Additionally, to ensure the accuracy of interpolation prediction output, an adaptive mechanism for updating interpolation nodes is designed to dynamically adjust the number and position of these nodes. Finally, a cost function that relies on the expectation of the predictive output is designed and solved to achieve stable tracking control of the considered NCSs. The stability of the DMPC strategy is demonstrated in detail. Numerical examples and industrial applications for the wastewater treatment process (WWTP) demonstrate that DMPC can obtain satisfied control performance.},

Graph neural networks (GNNs) offer a promising avenue for GAD, leveraging their exceptional capacity to model complex graph structures and relationships. However, existing GNN-based models encounter challenges in addressing the GAD’s fundamental issue—anomaly camouflage, where anomalies mimic normal instances, leading to indistinguishable features. In this article, we propose a novel approach, termed correlation information enhanced GAD (CIE-GAD). Specifically, drawing on the observation that the distribution of homophilic and heterophilic edges differs between abnormal and normal samples, we construct a hypergraph to learn the co-occurrence relationships among adjacent edges. By enhancing the extraction of sample correlation information, we effectively tackle feature similarity caused by anomaly camouflage, thereby enhancing the performance of GAD. Furthermore, we develop a spectral convolution mechanism based on node-level attention fusion, enabling the capture of multifrequency signals. This module performs adaptive fusion tailored to the unique frequency information requirements of each node, mitigating the local heterophily problem. Extensive experiments on various real-world GAD datasets demonstrate that the proposed CIE-GAD outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Notably, our approach achieves AUC-PR improvements of up to 3.47%, with an average gain of 1.5%, demonstrating its effectiveness in detecting anomalies in graph data.},

However, existing work often encounters difficulties in addressing the uncertainties caused by state changes and the inconsistencies between agents’ local observations and global information, which presents significant challenges to coordinated exploration among multiple agents. To address this issue, this article proposes a novel MARL exploration method with Min-Max intrinsic motivation (E2M) that promotes the learning of joint policies of agents by introducing surprise minimization and social influence maximization. Since the agent is subject to unstable state changes in the environment, we introduce surprise minimization by computing state entropy to encourage the agents to cope with more stable and familiar situations. This method enables surprise estimation based on the low-dimensional representation of states obtained from random encoders. Furthermore, to prevent surprise minimization from leading to conservative policies, we introduce mutual information between agents’ behaviors as social influence. By maximizing social influence, the agents are encouraged to interact to facilitate the emergence of cooperative behavior. The performance of our proposed E2M is testified across a range of popular StarCraft II and Multiagent MuJoCo tasks. Comprehensive results demonstrate its effectiveness in enhancing the cooperative capability of the multiple agents.},

  abstract     = {Multiview Subspace Clustering (MvSC) has demonstrated impressive clustering performance on multiview data. Most existing methods rely on either raw features or reduced-redundancy data for subspace representation learning, followed by spectral clustering to derive the final results. However, these methods maintain a fixed feature space during subspace learning, which limits information propagation and compromises both representation quality and clustering performance. To address this issue, this article proposes an adaptive dictionary learning approach for MvSC (AMvSC), which seamlessly integrates redundancy reduction and representation learning within a unified framework to facilitate mutual information propagation. Specifically, an adaptive dictionary learning strategy is designed to automatically reduce redundancy and noise in the original feature space during the subspace representation learning process. This strategy ensures effective information exchange, thereby enhancing the quality of the learned representations. Additionally, low-rank constraints, combined with smoothness and diversity regularization, are applied to further refine the subspace representations and comprehensively capture complex correlations among samples. Finally, an alternating optimization algorithm is developed to iteratively update the unified learning model. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {The practical fixed-time resource allocation problem is investigated for multi-input-multi-output nonlinear uncertain multiagent systems with disturbed dynamics, subject to global equality and local inequality constraints. Due to the coexistence of distributed high-order dynamics system within agents and decision-making constraints, decision variables in resource allocation optimization problems cannot be directly obtained from the system. Existing strategies are insufficient to solve such complex fixed-time optimization control problems with coupled decision-making constraints. To address these challenges, a novel integrated framework is proposed, fusing symbolic-function-based fixed-time control theory with gradient consistency. The proposed algorithm is implemented through an output-feedback backstepping design process, which involves two stages. First, in the output-feedback design stage, a fixed-time high-order extended state observer estimates the uncertain dynamics and disturbances. Second, in the backstepping design stage, a time-switching controller is developed. This controller’s virtual control law has two components: the first employs the proportional-integral control method to satisfy the equality constraints, while the second uses gradient information from the $\epsilon $ -exact penalty function to address the inequality constraints. Using the Lyapunov stability criterion, the proposed algorithm can ensure that all signals remain practical fixed-time stable, and that the error between the outputs of all agents and the optimal solution is maintained within a neighborhood of the origin. Finally, simulations are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach.},

On one hand, an observer-based pseudo gradient estimation algorithm is designed under event-triggered framework for model reconfiguration with only input/output data of system rather than mathematical dynamics. On the other hand, an event-triggered constrained control strategy is developed with several modules to cope with complex scenarios. Concretely, a data-driven anti-windup compensator is designed in case of input constraint, and an improved prescribed performance-based fractional order terminal sliding mode controller is explored for enhancement of the formation tracking accuracy and robustness of the controlled MAS with rigorous stability analysis.

A desirable exoskeleton would first provide a standard gait profile by learning from human operators while requiring body weight support with active human-following to govern dynamic locomotion synchronization. To address these issues, in this article, we propose a human operator-involved dynamic locomotion synchronization control framework for the lower limb exoskeleton actively following gait training with gravity-supporting. First, we designed a human motion capture system based on a five-link model for the locomotion of a human operator. To reproduce human-level motor skills, we use whole-body teleoperation to leverage human control intelligence to command the locomotion of a robotic exoskeleton system. Specifically, using the linear inverted pendulum (LIP) model, the human operator’s divergent component of motion (DCM) is obtained by the human motion capture system. The dynamic similarity is used to generate a reference DCM for the robotic exoskeleton to synchronize the human operator’s movement. Finally, a fuzzy-based adaptive controller is designed to track the synchronous trajectory for the exoskeleton in the presence of robotic dynamics uncertainties with input saturation. Experiments on the human subject are carried out to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {Skeleton-based temporal action segmentation (TAS) decomposes untrimmed skeleton sequence into meaningful segments. The variance in temporal scale challenges the skeleton modeling network to seek a balance between over-segmentation and under-segmentation. Current methods often rely on parallel multiscale feature extractors and additional refinement modules to mitigate the multiscale issue, which brings significant computations and complexity. To address these issues, this article proposes multiscale skeleton-based TAS (MSTAS), consisting of temporal probability pyramid (TPP) and smoothed multiscale ensemble (SME). TPP represents each action as a collection of multiscale probability distributions using a U-shape hierarchical temporal pyramid. Subsequently, SME takes the average of distributions instead of deploying additional refinement stages to achieve action segmentation. Considering the over-confident issue that exists in each scale, SME incorporates a novel label smoothing phase to improve the probability distributions by dynamically calibrating the confidence of each scale. Experimental results on four public datasets show that the MSTAS achieves state-of-the-art performance with less computation overheads, such as +1.1% accuracy and +2.8% F1@0.5 on the challenging LARa dataset with 70% fewer parameters and 80% fewer GFLOPS. Benefiting from confidence calibration, the MSTAS efficiently utilizes more temporal scales while keeping better calibration for ambiguous action instances. Additionally, the U-shape pyramid demonstrates a strong compatibility with classical refinement module, enabling the efficient extraction of multiscale motion representations.},

However, NNs usually encounter with the incorrect activation of neurons because of the excessive coverage for the boundary of compound noises. To address this issue, this article proposes a robust reconstructed NN (RRNN) with spectral reshaping activation (SRA). Primarily, an SRA is designed to replace the original activation of NN, which shrinks the spectrums of the compound noises toward the cluster center through spectral subtraction. It enables RRNN to reshape a concentrated noise space for easy coverage. Then, a hierarchical gradient descent (HGD) algorithm is developed to update the parameters of RRNN. The HGD algorithm establishes a noise-contrastive degree of SRA to penalize the loss function of RRNN, which holds robust performance with different noises. Furthermore, the theoretical proof of RRNN is presented to validate its robustness. Finally, the experimental results confirm the superior robustness of RRNN for tackling noisy samples compared to other methods.},

Moreover, to eliminate extra steady-state errors caused by encoding-decoding mechanisms (EDMs), a dynamic quantization factor that can make the asymptotic upper bound tend to zero is designed.

This article proposes a strategy to achieve robust population control by analyzing the bistable switching and oscillatory behavior in a delayed paradoxical cell population control circuit. First, five distinct population outcomes are identified, along with stabilization criteria for these states, highlighting the presence of bistability. Specifically, we reveal two bistable switching mechanisms: one driven by the initial cell population density and the other by the time delay for blasticidin-induced cell death. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the time delay can destabilize the effective control state via a Hopf bifurcation, leading to periodic oscillations, which can be mitigated by adjusting the blasticidin concentration. Based on these findings, we propose a robust control strategy by regulating initial cell population density and blasticidin concentration. These insights advance the design of robust population control circuits, with broad implications for synthetic biology and cell therapy.},

Therefore, we propose an adaptive encoder-decoder framework with partial teacher forcing strategy (PTF-ED) to enable flexible multihorizon KPI forecasting. First, we employ an encoder that processes the input time series and an attention layer to generate the context vectors. Then, we divide the measured KPIs into delayed and current time series, and design a delayed decoder and a current decoder in series to make the delayed and current time series correspond to the input time series. Especially, we propose a partial teacher forcing strategy to utilize the measured KPI efficiently and tackle the challenge of exposure bias in the current time series between training and inference phases. Moreover, we introduce a weighted multihorizon forecasting constraint in the model training loss to constrain the input-output correspondence across different sample intervals. The effectiveness of the proposed model has been validated through both a numerical simulation study and a case study in a real-world zinc flotation process.},

It explores the transformation of such a system into its normal form using an LTV transformation, if it possesses a general relative degree that may not be uniform (strict). Based on the obtained normal form, the internal and external dynamics as well as the inverse system of the LTV system are investigated. Additionally, the zero dynamics can be effectively parameterized. Moreover, by employing the derived LTV normal form, the proportional-derivative output-feedback stabilization and output tracking problems are resolved. Finally, an illustrative example is presented to showcase the effectiveness of the proposed controllers.},

  abstract     = {With excellent interpretability, the fuzzy rule-based method stands as a formidable instrument for knowledge representation and learning. Nowadays, the knowledge representation problem with multidimensional input information is widespread, leading to a large rule base and making it difficult to embed expert knowledge. In addition, human knowledge is not entirely reliable, causing inaccurate reasoning results. In this article, a novel large-scale linguistic Z-number belief rule base (LSLZ-BRB) method is proposed for the above multidimensional and unreliable knowledge representation and learning. Specifically, a multidimensional knowledge mapping representation method under the probabilistic framework is proposed to generate an LSLZ-BRB. It allows experts to embed knowledge via conditional probability and prior probability. To reduce the modeling error caused by uncertainty of knowledge, an online interactive learning mechanism of uncertain knowledge is developed. This mechanism ensures that LSLZ-BRB has high real-time performance and improves the accuracy of knowledge representation. A performance evaluation case for the laser inertial measurement unit (LIMU) and experiments on some public datasets illustrate the implementation process of the proposed method and further verify its effectiveness.},

We present a multiobjective optimization approach for managing operation, maintenance, and support decisions in CPPSs under time-varying demands. Specifically, a decision-making framework is developed to enable collaborative control, incorporating reliability-based risk assessment and multiobjective optimization techniques. To facilitate continuous decision-making in response to uncertainties, a biobjective optimization model is formulated using a receding horizon control architecture, addressing conflicting objectives simultaneously. An enhanced multiobjective pigeon-inspired optimization algorithm is proposed to generate Pareto-optimal solutions by co-minimizing the production risks and costs. Experimental validations are carried out through both numerical simulations and real-world experiments on a subsea production system in the South China Sea, involving two support sites, six production sites, thirty-six machines, and 288 components.},

Despite these benefits, ensuring fixed-time stability of the closed-loop system with model uncertainty remains a significant challenge. Conventional techniques to active surge control of aero-engines often struggle with model uncertainty and suffer from long-time surge fault. To deal with these issues, this article proposes a novel fixed-time active surge control scheme for enhancing the adaptability to the model change and extending the service life of aero-engines. First, considering the model uncertainty in aero-engines, a radial basis function (RBF) neural network is established for the approximation of complex system dynamic. Second, the adaptive law is proposed to optimize the weight vectors of the neural network. Third, a fixed-time controller is designed to ensure responsiveness and stabilize the compressor dynamics by tuning the intake air flow, where the fixed-time stability property guarantees less operation time under the surge fault. Finally, applications in the turbofan aero-engine validate the superiorities of the proposed method.},

The inherent properties of NTSM mitigate the effects of parameter uncertainties, thereby enhancing system robustness. Furthermore, an adaptive law is crafted to counteract the deleterious effects of actuator faults. Through the direct Lyapunov function approach, it is demonstrated that the closed-loop system achieves semi-global practical finite-time stability. This control strategy diminishes the dependence on precise model accuracy and augments the system’s fault tolerance.

However, due to the unavoidable existence of unknown interconnections in the real nonlinear systems, it is difficult for typical AC to guarantee its stability within the bounded convergence time. Thus, to solve this issue, a predefined-time adaptive neural control (PTANC) scheme is developed for nonlinear systems with unknown interconnections in this aritcle. First, an integrated control framework, where the controlled objectives not only relate with each other but also change over time, is able to catch more characteristics of nonlinear systems than the existing works. Then, the proposed control scheme can address the impact of unknown interconnections on the system stability. Second, a predefined adaptive law mechanism is employed to estimate the unknown interconnections to assist in PTANC. Then, the proposed PTANC scheme can ensure its predefined-time stable in the occurrence of unknown interconnections. Third, a neural network-based self-regulating strategy is designed to construct the Lyapunov function to prove the stability of PTANC. Then, the comprehensive stability analysis can make PTANC scheme be successful applied in nonlinear systems. Finally, the proposed PTANC scheme is tested on the numerical simulation and BSM1 simulation platform.

  abstract     = {This article presents a high-confidence data-driven safe tracking control design for stochastic linear discrete-time systems. The high-confidence safe reference tracking for an ellipsoidal safe set is first formalized using the concept of probabilistic set-based $\lambda $ -contractivity. A data-driven controller, composed of feedback and feedforward elements, is then designed to enforce the $\lambda $ -contractivity of the safe set. The feedback control gain is learned by 1) providing a data-driven representation of the closed-loop system, which contains a decision variable that affects the control gain and 2) optimizing the decision variable to ensure the $\lambda $ -contractivity. This feedback term can be learned using a data set that is not even rich enough to identify the full system model. A feedforward gain learning algorithm and a data-driven reference governor are provided to satisfy the required conditions on equilibrium terms. It is shown that under certain conditions on the equilibrium terms, the learned tracking controller guarantees the system’s safety and stability with high probability. The reference governor dynamically manipulates the desired reference signal based on the data quality to prevent any breach of safety constraints in a probabilistic manner. It is shown that the output of the reference governor eventually converges to the desired goal states if inside the safe set and high-quality data is available. Therefore, the tracking controller guarantees convergence of the system output to its desired goal while ensuring safety with a high probability. The simulation results on a drone hovering and a test system, comparing the results with the existing literature, confirm that the presented high-confidence data-driven safe tracking control outperforms certainty-equivalent safe control methods.},

However, the specific structure of quantum measurements for characterizing a quantum state has been neglected in previous work. In this article, we explore the similarity between highly structured sentences in natural language and intrinsically structured measurements in QST. To fully leverage the intrinsic quantum characteristics involved in QST, we design a quantum-aware transformer (QAT) model to capture the complex relationship between measured frequencies and density matrices. In particular, we query quantum operators in the architecture to facilitate informative representations of quantum data and integrate the Bures distance into the loss function to evaluate quantum state fidelity, thereby enabling the reconstruction of quantum states from measured data with high fidelity. Extensive simulations and experiments (on IBM quantum computers) demonstrate the superiority of the QAT in reconstructing quantum states with favorable robustness against experimental noise.},

Integrating machine learning (ML) into AM quality control (QC) systems presents a viable solution, utilizing ML’s ability to autonomously detect patterns and extract important data, reducing the reliance on manual intervention. This study conducts an in-depth literature review to scrutinize the role of ML in augmenting QC mechanisms within extrusion-based AM processes. Our primary objective is to pinpoint ML models that excel in monitoring manufacturing activities and facilitating instantaneous defect corrections via parameter adjustments. Our analysis highlights the efficacy of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) models in defect detection, leveraging camera-based systems for an in-depth examination of printed parts. For 1-D data processing, support vector machines (SVMs) and long short-term memory (LSTM) networks have shown significant application and effectiveness. Furthermore, the study classifies various sensors and defects that can effectively benefit from ML-driven QC approaches. Our findings accentuate the essential role of ML, especially CNNs, in detecting and rectifying production flaws and also detail the synergy between different sensor technologies in creating a comprehensive monitoring framework. By integrating ML with a multisensor approach and employing real-time corrective strategies, such as dynamic parameter adjustments and the use of advanced control systems, this research underscores ML’s transformative potential in elevating AM QC. Thus, our contribution lays the groundwork for harnessing ML technologies to ensure superior quality parts production in AM, paving the way for its broader industrial adoption.},

  abstract     = {This technical correspondence examines the issue of observer-based bounded $H_{\infty }$ control for a kind of shift-varying linear repetitive process (LRP) over networks with constrained bit rates in the finite horizon. Unlike the previous researches that address (or avoid) the problem of limited network resources by designing different scheduling protocols, this study focuses on further reducing and optimizing the bandwidth utilization by introducing a bit rate constraint model. Thus, an encoding-decoding mechanism under the constrained bit rates is proposed based on the quantization method. In order to analyze the $H_{\infty }$ performance of the LRP and design an appropriate controller, the LRP is transformed into a shift-varying two-dimensional (2-D) Fornasini-Marchesini model. Sufficient conditions in recursive linear matrix inequalities are proposed to ensure that the extended system achieves a bounded $H_{\infty }$ performance over a finite horizon within the 2-D framework. Furthermore, a component-based strategy for allocating the bit rates is provided to expand the quantization region under the constraint of bit rates. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by a simulation example.},

  abstract     = {Achieving prescribed-time synchronization with output-feedback measurements in general linear multiagent systems is challenging, as it necessitates the simultaneous achievement of state synchronization and observer estimation within a prescribed time. This article focuses on general linear dynamics and aims to solve the prescribed-time bipartite synchronization (PT-BS) problem over cooperative-antagonistic networks. First, a couple of time-varying Riccati equations (TVREs) is introduced, which transforms the prescribed-time synchronization problem into a dynamic parameter design issue. By using the solutions of TVREs to design output feedback gains, a class of time-varying-gain prescribed-time observers and observer-based protocols are proposed. Then, since the proposed PT-BS observers require knowledge of some global information (i.e., the minimum eigenvalue of the topology-relevant Laplacian matrix), two adaptive strategies are presented to solve the output-feedback PT-BS problems in a fully distributed manner: an edge-based adaptive strategy and a node-based adaptive strategy. It successfully achieves state synchronization, observer estimation, and adaptive gain convergence within the prescribed settling time. Finally, a simulation example demonstrates the effectiveness of the theoretical results.},

  abstract     = {Large-scale constrained multiobjective optimization problems (LSCMOPs) exist widely in science and technology. LSCMOPs pose great challenges to algorithms due to the need to optimize multiple conflicting objectives and satisfy multiple constraints in a large search space. To better address such problems, this article proposes a dynamic subspace search-based evolutionary algorithm for solving LSCMOPs. The main idea is to initially allow the population to search in a low-dimensional subspace to increase convergence, then the searched subspace is gradually expanded to encourage the population to further search the full decision space. Specifically, the contribution of each decision variable to the evolution is first calculated using the proposed decision variable analysis method. Then, a probability-based offspring generation strategy is developed to encourage the population to preferentially search in a low-dimensional subspace composed of decision variables with high contribution degrees, thus speeding up the early convergence. With the continuous progress of evolution, the subspace is gradually expanded to ensure that the population can better explore the entire space. The performance of the proposed algorithm is evaluated on a variety of test problems with 100–1000 decision variables. Experimental results on four test suits and three real-world instances show that the proposed algorithm is efficient in solving LSCMOPs.},

To cooperatively seek the Nash equilibrium (NE), each agent aims to minimize its own cost function by interacting with its neighbors over undirected communication networks. While existing distributed NE seeking methods alleviate the computational burden, they also entail higher communication costs. To reduce communication frequency and bandwidth, we propose a class of distributed edge-based NE seeking methods by leveraging the advantages of event-triggered mechanisms and quantization techniques. In the proposed framework, a buffer is equipped on every communication channel, thereby reducing the workload of both agents at either end. It is shown that the convergence error can be made arbitrarily small by tuning a constant threshold, and it can asymptotically converge to zero by setting an exponentially decaying threshold or a dynamic threshold. Moreover, in the case of unawareness of any global information, we further provide a fully distributed event-triggered quantized algorithm, by which the convergence error is ultimately uniformly bounded.

  abstract     = {Electroencephalography (EEG) is widely utilized for train driver state detection due to its high accuracy and low latency. However, existing methods for driver status detection rarely use the rich physiological information in EEG to improve detection performance. Moreover, there is currently a lack of EEG datasets for abnormal states of train drivers. To address these gaps, we propose a novel transfer learning model based on a hybrid attention mechanism, named hybrid attention-based transfer learning network (HATNet). We first segment the EEG signals into patches and utilize the hybrid attention module to capture local and global temporal patterns. Then, a channel-wise attention module is introduced to establish spatial representations among EEG channels. Finally, during the training process, we employ a calibration-based transfer learning strategy, which allows for adaptation to the EEG data distribution of new subjects using minimal data. To validate the effectiveness of our proposed model, we conduct a multistimulus oddball experiment to establish a EEG dataset of abnormal states for train drivers. Experimental results on this dataset indicate that: 1) Compared to the state-of-the-art end-to-end models, HATNet achieves the highest classification accuracy in both subject-dependent and subject-independent tasks at 94.26% and 87.03%, respectively, and 2) The proposed hybrid attention module effectively captures the temporal semantic information of EEG data.},

Moreover, by leveraging a mixture of soft-sensing and real-measured signals, a dual-rate integral-based prescribed performance control (DRIPPC) approach is devised. The benefit lies in that the proposed control method samples the low-frequency state signal while generating a relatively high-frequency control action, ensuring rapid response of the robot manipulator while maintaining strict adherence to field-of-view (FOV) constraints.

This algorithm operates independently of system parameters, and its immediate cost formulation excludes the necessity of solving regulator equations. Consequently, it achieves a streamlined structure, facilitating direct determination of the optimal policy. Subsequently, the stability of each iteration of the algorithm is formally established, along with the derivation of a unique condition for the Q-function matrix. Additionally, to address the challenge of obtaining a stable policy when the initial policy is unstable, an innovative data-driven algorithm is introduced that effectively computes the initial stable gains, ensuring convergence to stability throughout the learning process.

Furthermore, such methods, often are not suitable for performing feature selection due to their high complexity, especially when the dimensionality of the data is high. To address the above issues, a novel method, termed as unsupervised feature selection for high-order embedding learning and sparse learning (UFSHS), is proposed to select useful features. More concretely, UFSHS first takes advantage of the high-order similarity of the original input to construct an optimal similarity graph that accurately reveals the essential geometric structure of high-dimensional data. Furthermore, it constructs a unified framework, integrating high-order embedding learning and sparse learning, to learn an appropriate projection matrix with row sparsity, which helps to select an optimal subset of features. Moreover, we design a novel alternative optimization method that provides different optimization strategies according to the relationship between the number of instances and the dimensionality, respectively, which significantly reduces the computational complexity of the model. Even more amazingly, the proposed optimization strategy is shown to be applicable to ridge regression, broad learning systems and fuzzy systems. Extensive experiments are conducted on nine public datasets to illustrate the superiority and efficiency of our UFSHS.},

  abstract     = {Many previous works on wearable soft exosuits have primarily focused on assisting human motion, while overlooking safety concerns during movement. This article introduces a novel single-motor, altering bi-directional transfer soft exosuit based on impedance optimization and adaptive neural control, which provides assistance to the lower limbs using Bowden cables. This innovative soft exosuit integrates control barrier functions into the impedance optimization, allowing multiple safety constraints to be considered simultaneously, enabling the system to adaptively learn the impedance of the human ankle joint by analyzing the measured interaction forces at the ankle joint, so that the updated reference trajectories comply with safety requirements. To effectively track the updated reference trajectories, we have introduced an adaptive neural controller based on the integral barrier Lyapunov function. This controller is designed to perform the control task under strict safety constraints. The stability of this control approach is meticulously demonstrated through extensive Lyapunov analysis. In contrast to traditional soft exosuits designed purely for assistance, the key advantage of this technology is its ability to adapt to different terrains while ensuring the safety of human movement during assistance. Through experimental testing, we obtain average tracking errors of 0.0062, 0.0062, and 0.0063 rad for flat, grass, and gravel surfaces, respectively, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed strategy.},

  abstract     = {Safety guarantee is an important topic when training real-world tasks with reinforcement learning (RL). During online environmental exploration, any constraint violation can lead to significant property damage and risks to personnel. Existing safe RL methods either exclusively address safety concerns after reaching optimality or incorporate a certain degree of tolerance for constraint violations during training. This article proposes a feasible policy iteration framework that can guarantee absolute safety during online exploration, i.e., constraint violations never happen in real-world interactions. The key to maintaining absolute safety lies in confining the environmental exploration at each step always within the feasible region of the current policy. This feasible region is described by a newly defined constraint decay function with uncertainty, ensuring the forward invariance of the feasible region under the worst case. Within the proposed framework, the feasible region maintains its monotonic expanding property and converges to its maximum extent, even though only local samples are available, i.e., the agent only has access to samples within the feasible region. Meanwhile, the trained policy also improves monotonically within its corresponding feasible region if one can use different updating rules inside and outside the feasible region. Finally, practical algorithms are designed with the actor-critic-scenery architecture, consisting of three modules: 1) safe exploration; 2) model error estimation; and 3) network update. Experimental results indicate that our algorithms achieve performance comparable to baselines while maintaining zero constraint violation throughout the entire training process. In contrast, the baseline algorithm typically requires thousands of constraint violations to achieve the same performance. These findings suggest a substantial potential for applying feasible policy iteration in real-world tasks, enabling the online evolution of intricate systems.},

Different from the existing works on NE seeking in noncooperative games, it is the first trial to consider the resilient distributed NE control problem for nonlinear MASs under DoS attacks. To overcome the challenges caused by the considered problem, a new layered NE control method is developed, which consists of a resilient distributed NE seeking algorithm, two-stage cascade filters, and a resilient adaptive controller. Specifically, the resilient distributed NE seeking algorithm is proposed to ensure that the actions in this algorithm converge to the NE even under DoS attacks. Then, the improved actions with smooth characteristics are designed by introducing novel two-stage cascade filters. By using newly designed actions and their derivatives, a resilient adaptive controller is proposed to ensure that the output of MASs converges to the NE.

Despite significant advancements in various fields, existing general foundation models face challenges in industry when dealing with the data of specialized modalities, the tasks of varying-scenario with multiple processes, and the requirements of trustworthy output, which makes industrial foundation model (IFM) a necessity. This article proposes a system architecture of termed IFMsys, including model training, model adaptation, and model application.

In model adaptation, the base model is developed into a series of task-oriented and domain-specific IFMs through fine-tuning with representative tasks and domain knowledge. In model application, an industrial agent-centric collaboration system and a comprehensive application framework of IFM are proposed to enhance the industrial product lifecycle applications. In addition, a prototype system of the IFM, namely, MetaIndux, is delivered, with application examples presented in typical industrial tasks. Finally, future research directions and open issues of IFM are prospected.

We propose a single-shot method based on the state space model (SSM) to predict the full 3-D information (pose, size, shape) of multiple 3-D objects from a single RGB-D image in an end-to-end manner. Our method first encodes long-range semantic information from RGB and depth images separately and then combines them into an integrated latent representation that is processed by a modified SSM to infer the full 3-D information in two separate task heads within a unified model. A heatmap/detection head predicts object centers, and a 3-D information head predicts a matrix detailing the pose, size and latent code of shape for each detected object. We also propose a shape autoencoder based on the SSM, which learns canonical shape codes derived from a large database of 3-D point cloud shapes. The end-to-end framework, modified SSM block and SSM-based shape autoencoder form major contributions of this work. Our design includes different scan strategies tailored to different input data representations, such as RGB-D images and point clouds.

It contains a particle-based exploration reward to make agents access far-reaching states for exploratory skill acquisition, and a novel contrastive diversity reward to promote the discriminability between different skills. Moreover, a novel dynamic weighting mechanism between the above two rewards is proposed to balance state exploration and skill diversity, which further enhances the quality of the discovered skills.

These controllers can intelligently adjust the convergence rate of the system according to practical requirements, thereby addressing the limitation of fixed convergence rate in existing results. Moreover, the proposed controllers can effectively suppress jitter and analyze the effects of different sigmoid functions on jitter suppression. Sufficient conditions are derived to ensure that the states of the NISSs reach the designed surfaces in finite time and to achieve variable convergence rate stability. The excellent performance of the proposed theoretical strategy in achieving adjustable rate convergence of the system is demonstrated through a simulation of the ball-beam system.},

However, existing electroencephalogram (EEG) decoding models, especially those based on deep learning, predominantly focus on global spatial features, neglecting valuable local information, potentially leading to suboptimal performance. Therefore, this study proposed a dynamic hierarchical convolutional attention network (DH-CAN) that comprehensively learned discriminative information from both global and local spatial domains, as well as from time-frequency domains in EEG signals. Specifically, a multiscale convolutional block was designed to dynamically capture time-frequency information. The channels of EEG signals were mapped to different brain regions based on motor imagery neural activity patterns. The spatial features, both global and local, were then hierarchically extracted to fully exploit the discriminative information. Furthermore, regional connectivity was established using a graph attention network, incorporating it into the local spatial features. Particularly, this study shared network parameters between symmetrical brain regions to better capture asymmetrical motor imagery patterns. Finally, the learned multilevel features were integrated through a high-level fusion layer. Extensive experimental results on two datasets demonstrated that the proposed model performed excellently across multiple evaluation metrics, exceeding existing benchmark methods. These findings suggested that the proposed model offered a novel perspective for EEG decoding research.},

  abstract     = {Graph contrastive learning (GCL) is emerging as a pivotal technique in graph representation learning. However, recent research indicates that GCL is vulnerable to adversarial attacks, while existing robust GCL methods against adversarial attacks are inefficient and lack scalability due to the significant computational expenses of explicit adversarial attacks on the graph structure. To address the shortcomings of existing approaches, we propose an efficient and robust GCL via multiadversarial views training framework, called ERMAV. Specifically, the ERMAV generates two adversarial views by attacking both node attributes and latent representations on randomly sampled subgraphs. The method conducts explicit adversarial attacks on node attributes by attacking node attributes and implicit adversarial attacks on the graph structure by attacking latent representations, which avoids the costly computation of explicit graph structure attacks. Moreover, two efficient attack methods are developed to construct adversarial perturbations, which can dynamically generate different adversarial views to enhance sample diversity in the training phase. Furthermore, to validate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed framework, extensive experiments of node classification on seven real-world datasets are conducted. Experimental results show that our ERMAV outperforms state-of-the-art GCL methods on the original graphs and is consistently more robust than existing robust GCL methods on a variety of attacked graphs. This demonstrates the strong robustness and great potential of our ERMAV in real-world applications.},

Unlike traditional distance-based methods, which rely on intricate distance measurements, our approach simplifies constraints using bearing information, reducing hardware and sensing requirements. It also eliminates the need to update control commands for each AAV, as formation reconfiguration can be achieved solely by adjusting the motion trajectory of formation leaders. Moreover, the strategy demonstrates enhanced robustness in addressing real-world input constraints. A continuous hyperbolic tangent saturation function and an input saturation compensation system are incorporated, ensuring system convergence and precision while addressing singularity issues. In addition, unlike conventional bearing-based strategies focusing primarily on convergence time, the proposed algorithm enables preset control over both convergence time and precision. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed approach is validated through several illustrative examples, including a 6-degree-of-freedom (6DoF) quadrotor AAV swarm, highlighting its practical applicability and performance.},

In this article, we propose an improved LIC-free synchronization-based identification method to address above issues. Specifically, a drive network consisting of isolated nodes that satisfy specific conditions is constructed, and the network containing an unknown topology is defined as the response network. Through the design of appropriate controllers and update laws, the drive network and the response network achieve synchronization, while the estimation matrix accurately identifies the unknown topology matrix. Our method is proven to be a generalized form of the existing LIC-free identification methods.

However, existing neighborhood rough set models and their feature selection methods treat each sample equally, whereas different types of samples inherently play different roles in constructing neighborhood granules and evaluating the goodness of features. In this study, the sample weight information is first introduced into neighborhood rough sets, and a novel weighted neighborhood rough set model is consequently constructed. Then, considering the lack of sample weight information in practical data, a margin-based weight optimization function is designed, based on which a gradient descent algorithm is provided to adaptively learn sample weights through maximizing sample margins. Finally, an average granule margin measure is put forward for feature selection, and a forward-adding heuristic algorithm is developed to generate an optimal feature subset. The proposed method constructs the weighted neighborhood rough sets using sample weights for the first time and is able to yield compact feature subsets with a large margin. Extensive experiments and statistical analysis on UCI datasets show that the proposed method achieves highly competitive performance in terms of feature reduction rate and classification accuracy when compared with other state-of-the-art methods.},

Existing test problems, which are often manually configured and lack scalability, can result in biased and nongeneralizable algorithm performance. In light of the above, we first introduce four concepts for characterizing STO problems (STOPs) in this study and present an important feature, namely similarity distribution, to quantitatively delineate the relationship between the optimal solutions of source and target tasks. Subsequently, we present general design guidelines for STOPs and introduce a problem generator that demonstrates strong scalability. Specifically, the similarity distribution of a problem can be easily customized through a novel inverse generation strategy, allowing for a continuous spectrum that captures the diverse similarity relationships present in real-world scenarios. Lastly, a benchmark suite comprising 12 STOPs, characterized by a range of customized similarity relationships, has been developed using the proposed generator and will serve as a platform for examining various STO algorithms. For instance, biased transferability representation, irregular mapping learning behaviors, and performance improvements unrelated to search experience are significant empirical findings that previous benchmarks failed to reveal, yet can be effectively identified through our test problems.

The strategy relies on network matrix information to choose controlled nodes and adopts the algebraic state space representation approach for designing pinning controllers. Initially, a sufficient criterion is established to verify the global stability of a given Markovian jump Boolean network (MJBN) with probability one at a specific state within finite time. To stabilize an unstable MJBN at a predetermined state, the selection of pinned nodes involves removing the minimal number of entries, ensuring that the network matrix transforms into a strictly lower (or upper) triangular form. For each pinned node, two types of state feedback controllers are developed: 1) mode-dependent and 2) mode-independent, with a focus on designing a minimally updating controller. The choice of controller type is determined by the feasibility condition of the mode-dependent pinning controller, which is articulated through the solvability of matrix equations. Finally, the theoretical results are illustrated by studying the T cell large granular lymphocyte survival signaling network consisting of 54 genes and 6 stimuli.},

To circumvent this difficulty, we propose a novel privacy-preserved rolling optimization strategy (PP-ROS) for switched systems. The main contributions are reflected in three aspects: 1) The proposed PP-ROS is used to calculate the private control input by adding Laplace noise to the prediction and control horizons, instead of the transmitted data. 2) Privacy definitions of the prediction and control horizons are presented, and a private model predictive control (P-MPC) controller design is provided based on the PP-ROS. The P-MPC controller achieves the privacy of its parameters. 3) Under PP-ROS and P-MPC, the proof and calculation methods for the privacy levels of control input and system output are given. The results indicate that when noise is added to the horizons, both control input and system output are private.

For better control in the time estimation of PS and the robustness of systems, an adaptive predefined-time robust zeroing neural dynamic controller (APTRZNDC) for the PS between PMSG systems is proposed. In the process, an adaptive parameter determined by the system error is designed with the demand for higher convergence factor in the case of large error. In addition, a nonlinear activation function contributed to the predefined-time synchronization is created, making the upper bound of synchronization time independent of system initial states and parameters, except for a single predefined parameter. Moreover, essential theorems for the predefined-time PS and robustness under the APTRZNDC are supplied and validated. And better robustness of PMSG system with the APTRZNDC is demonstrated when compared with other controllers. Furthermore, the APTRZNDC is applied in secure communication via the PS of PMSG systems, which guarantees both the timeliness of signals and the immunity of communication.},

At the core of rhythm perception lies meter anticipation, a spontaneous process in the human brain that typically occurs before actual beats. This anticipation can be framed as a time series prediction problem. From the perspective of human embodied system behavior, although many models have been developed for time series prediction, most prioritize accuracy over biological realism, contrasting with the natural imprecision of human internal clocks. Neuroscientific evidence, such as infants’ natural meter synchronization, underscores the need for biologically plausible models. Therefore, we propose a neuron oscillator-based dynamic system that simulates human behavior during meter perception. The model introduces two tunable parameters for local and global adjustments, fine-tuning the oscillation combinations to emulate human-like rhythmic behavior. The experiments are conducted under three common scenarios encountered during human-machine interaction, demonstrating that the proposed model can exhibit human-like reactions. Additionally, experiments involving human-machine and interhuman interactions show that the model successfully replicates real-world rhythmic behavior, advancing toward more natural and synchronized human-machine rhythm interaction.},

However, current works primarily align the distributions of EEG representations, overlooking the topology variability in capturing the dependencies between channels, which may limit the performance of EEG emotion recognition. To tackle this issue, this article proposes an adaptive attention-modulated graph network (AdamGraph) to enhance the subject adaptability of EEG emotion recognition against connection variability and representation variability. Specifically, an attention-modulated graph connection module is proposed to explicitly capture the individual important relationships among channels adaptively. Through modulating the attention matrix of individual functional connections using spatial connections based on prior knowledge, the attention-modulated weights can be learned to construct individual connections adaptively, thereby mitigating individual differences. Besides, a deep node-graph representation learning module is designed to extract long-range interaction characteristics among channels and alleviate the over-smoothing problem of representations. Furthermore, a graph domain co-regularized learning module is imposed to tackle the individual distribution discrepancies in connection and representations across different domains. Extensive experiments on three public EEG emotion datasets, i.e., SEED, DREAMER, and MPED, validate the superior performance of AdamGraph compared with state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract     = {This article presents novel data-driven inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) algorithms to optimally address heterogeneous formation control problems in the presence of disturbances. We propose expert-estimator-learner multiagent systems (MASs) as independent systems with similar interaction graphs. First, a model-based IRL algorithm is introduced for the estimator MAS to determine its optimal control and reward functions. Using the estimator IRL algorithm results, a robust algorithm for model-free IRL is presented to reconstruct the learner MAS’s optimal control and reward functions without knowing the learners’ dynamics. Therefore, estimator MAS aims to estimate experts’ desired formation and learner MAS wants to track the estimators’ trajectories optimally. As a final step, data-driven implementations of these proposed IRL algorithms are presented. Consequently, this research contributes to identifying unknown reward functions and optimal controls by conducting demonstrations. Our analysis shows that the stability and convergence of MASs are thoroughly ensured. The effectiveness of the given algorithms is demonstrated via simulation results.},

  abstract     = {Due to their unique structure and powerful capability to handle uncertainty and partial reliability of information, Z-numbers have achieved significant success in various fields. Zadeh previously asserted that a Z-number can be regarded as a summary of probability distributions. Researchers have proposed various methods for determining the underlying probability distributions from a given Z-number. Conversely, can a Z-number be used to summarize a set of probability distributions? This problem remains unexplored. In this article, we propose a nonlinear model, termed Maximum Expected Minimum Entropy (MEME), for generating a Z-number from a set of probability distributions. Through this model, Z-numbers can be generated directly from data without requiring expert knowledge. Additionally, we applied the MEME model to classification problems, introducing a novel if-then rule form, termed Z-valuation if-then rules. These rules replace the deterministic consequent part of a fuzzy rule with an uncertain Z-valuation, thereby further summarizing the uncertain information in the rule’s consequent. Based on the Z-valuation rules, we propose a Z-valuation rule-based (ZVRB) classification system, which aims to enhance decision-making processes in scenarios where uncertainty plays a key role. To validate the effectiveness of the ZVRB classification system, we conducted two experiments comparing it with both classic and advanced nonfuzzy classifiers as well as fuzzy classification systems. The results show that the ZVRB model is superior to the other comparative classifiers in terms of classification performance.},

To solve both linear quadratic regulation and tracking problems for continuous-time systems with unknown value functions, this article develops a discounted inverse reinforcement learning (DIRL) method that inherits the model-independent property of reinforcement learning (RL). More specifically, we first formulate a standard paradigm for solving linear quadratic control using DIRL. To recover the value function and the target control gain, an error metric is elaborately constructed, and a quasi-Newton algorithm is adopted to minimize it. Furthermore, three DIRL algorithms, including model-based, model-free off-policy, and model-free on-policy algorithms, are proposed. The latter two rely on the expert’s demonstration data or the online observed data, requiring no prior knowledge of the system dynamics and value function. The stability, convergence, and existence conditions of multiple solutions are thoroughly analyzed. Finally, numerical simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the theoretical results.},

Acquiring optimal distributed secure control policies requires solving the game-related Hamilton-Jacobi–Isaacs (HJI) equations. Based on the critic-only neural network (NN) structure, the reinforcement learning (RL) method is employed in solving coupled HJI equations. The fixed-time convergence technique is introduced to improve the convergence rate of RL, and the experience replay mechanism is utilized to relax the persistence of excitation condition. The associated NN convergence and closed-loop stability are analyzed. In the attitude loop, the optimal feedback control law is obtained by solving Hamilton-Jacobi–Bellman equations using the fixed-time convergent RL method.

Compared to previous works on output constraints, the main challenge addressed in this article is the unavailability of the true system states during the controller design process and the nondifferentiability of the sensor’s output functions. To achieve the control objectives, the following control scheme is proposed in this study. First, a novel barrier Lyapunov function is introduced, which is specifically designed to handle systems with unknown measurement drifts. This function can be uniformly applied to satisfy both scenarios of systems with or without output constraints. Second, the adding a power integrator (AAPI) technique and dynamic surface control (DSC) techniques are enhanced to effectively handle the unknown measurement drifts and avoid singularity problems in the controller design. The decentralized controller proposed in this article can realize that the outputs are strictly constrained within predefined boundaries and guarantees convergence of all system states to an arbitrarily small neighborhood. Finally, we provide two simulation examples to validate the effectiveness of our proposed control strategy.},

In order to get the best mode separation having the best performance, an optimization problem is proposed by applying an augmented Lagrangian cost function, which can ensure the existence and calculability of a locally optimal solution. Moreover, an improved hill-climbing algorithm is established to reduce computational complexity while retaining as much performance as possible, which is enhanced by applying Q-learning technique to determine an optimal attenuation coefficient.

  abstract     = {The agile Earth observation satellite scheduling problem (AEOSSP) with time-dependent transition time is a combinatorial optimization challenge. Due to its NP-hardness, problem-tailored methods are sensitive to instances and require massive computational overhead. Recently, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) models have shown promise in efficiently addressing the AEOSSP. However, these models may make decision mistakes in specific scenarios due to prioritizing maximizing average reward expectation over individual decision accuracy during DRL training, directly leading to resource wastage. To address these issues, we propose a reconstruction model (RCM), which is a DRL-based two-stage construction model (CM), including a CM and a reconstruction mechanism (RM). RCM constructs solutions initially using a DRL-trained CM, which are subsequently refined by RM. CM utilizes a more efficient network for policy representation to make decisions. RM applies two operators, “repair” and “removal,” with a “repair-removal-repair” solution reconstruction process to identify and rectify decision mistakes from CM, offering a modular component to enhance the stability and solution quality. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed RCM outperforms the state-of-the-art AEOSSP iterative search method, achieving such performance within a computational time of 0.1 s. Additionally, CM surpasses the state-of-the-art DRL policy model and RM can effectively rectify decision errors or suboptimalities, underscoring its effectiveness in enhancing DRL outcomes.},

However, since “abnormality” is inherently defined in relation to “normality” within specific categories, detecting anomalies without reference images describing the corresponding normal context remains a significant challenge. As an alternative to reference images, this study explores the use of widely available product standards to characterize normal contexts and potential abnormal states. Specifically, this study introduces AnomalyVLM, which leverages generalized pretrained vision-language models (VLMs) to interpret these standards and detect anomalies. Given the current limitations of VLMs in comprehending complex textual information, AnomalyVLM generates hybrid prompts—comprising prompts for abnormal regions, symbolic rules, and region numbers—from the standards to facilitate more effective understanding. These hybrid prompts are incorporated into various stages of the anomaly detection process within the selected VLMs, including an anomaly region generator and an anomaly region refiner. By utilizing hybrid prompts, VLMs are personalized as anomaly detectors for specific categories, offering users flexibility and control in detecting anomalies across novel categories without the need for training data. Experimental results on four public industrial anomaly detection datasets, as well as a practical automotive part inspection task, highlight the superior performance and enhanced generalization capability of AnomalyVLM, especially in texture categories.

To capture the interactions between these domains, the decision-making system is modeled as a hybrid system consisting of a controlled MDP and autonomous (uncontrolled) continuous dynamics, collectively referred to as the hybrid Markov decision process (HMDP). The design focuses on ensuring safety and optimality by accounting for both discrete and continuous state variables across different levels. With the help of the model predictive control (MPC) concept, a decision-making scheme is developed for the hybrid model, with guarantees for recursive feasibility and stability.

Initially, the system under investigation is reformulated into a new system that encompasses both the original system state and the compromised state, enabling the use of compromised states for feedback control. Subsequently, two innovative asymptotic integral barrier Lyapunov functions (IBLFs) are developed by directly imposing constraints on the compromised state, thereby eliminating the necessity to convert state constraints into error constraints as required by traditional BLFs-based methods. Furthermore, controllers designed using relative/switched threshold event-triggered strategies ensure that all signals within the entire closed-loop system remain bounded, that the constant or time-varying full-state constraints are not breached, and that asymptotic stability is attained without Zeno behavior. Ultimately, simulation results validate the efficacy of the proposed strategies through a practical example.},

  abstract     = {In this article, we focus on solving the problem of online multiplayer differential games (MDGs) of Markov jump systems (MJSs) using a reinforcement learning (RL) method. We consider MDGs of MJSs from the following two scenarios. In the first scenario, we propose a distributed minmax strategy, where each player can derive their optimal control policy from distributed game algebraic Riccati equations (DGAREs) without prior knowledge of the policies adopted by other players, distinguishing it from existing RL algorithms. We design a novel online distributed RL algorithm to approximate the solution of DGAREs without completely knowing system dynamics and initial admissible control policy. The second scenario involves applying Nash strategy to address MDGs of MJSs. Different from existing synchronous RL algorithm, we propose a novel online asynchronous RL algorithm that employs asynchronous iterative calculations for both policy evaluation and policy improvement, incorporating the latest information into the iterative process. The convergence of the designed RL algorithms is rigorously analyzed. Finally, two inverted pendulum system applications validate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.},

We study Gaussian process (GP) regression in two cases: 1) an offline learning-based control method and 2) an event-triggered online data-driven modeling method, to learn unknown system dynamics. Considering the computational complexity of GP regression in practical applications, we discuss the case of computational delays in real-time predictions. Moreover, we develop four theoretical criteria to ensure the probabilistic stability of closed-loop systems.

A key challenge in analyzing the SGFTS of such systems lies in the evolving integration methods caused by the impulses. To address this, we dynamically partition the semi-global attraction set (SGAS) and solve the corresponding differential equations within each subset. Additionally, by constructing the transition dynamics of impulse points and iteratively computing these points, we establish the conditions for SGFTS under both stabilizing and destabilizing impulses. For GFTS, the primary difficulty arises from the distinct trajectories and dynamics of points located inside and outside the SGAS. To overcome this, we introduce the concept of the maximum-minimum impulse interval and derive a sufficient condition that ensures the system can enter the SGAS from a distance under a finite number of impulses. Furthermore, we develop a criterion for GFTS under varying impulse degrees and provide convergence time estimation based on the research on SGFTS of NIS. Finally, numerical examples are presented to validate the theoretical results. Notably, in Example 3, a fixed-time impulse controller is designed based on the proposed theoretical framework to achieve global stabilization of complex systems. This example highlights the potential applications of this work in the field of control.},

Note that most existing TVF controllers can only achieve formation targets under small delays, which significantly limits their performance. The proposed TVF control method in this article demonstrates remarkable robustness by effectively accommodating larger delays and additionally mitigating the impact of disturbances on MASs. On this basis, a robust TVF controller optimization scheme of MASs combined with the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is proposed. Comparing the optimized results with those under conventional control methods, it has been proved that optimized controller has obvious improvement on the formation performance of MASs.

  abstract     = {Zeroing neural network (ZNN), as a special type of recurrent neural network (RNN), is very competitive in solving time-varying linear matrix-vector equations. Recently, various ZNNs with predefined-time convergence (PTC) capabilities have been reported. Such ZNNs with PTC capabilities can achieve the predefined convergence time via explicitly presetting multiple parameters related to the upper bounds of their convergence time. However, obtaining suitable and robust values for these parameters through reasonable adjustments is a challenging task in many engineering applications. To address this problem, we propose a novel arbitrarily predefined-time convergent RNN (APTC-RNN) with a novel nonlinear piecewise activation-function (NPAF). Unlike most existing ZNNs with PTC capabilities, the proposed APTC-RNN, due to its NPAF, can achieve arbitrarily PTC (APTC) without adjusting any upper bound parameters. Furthermore, due to the piecewise computation form of the NPAF, the proposed APTC-RNN can provide a lower computational cost compared to most existing RNNs. The stability and APTC capability of the proposed APTC-RNN are proven by rigorous theoretical analysis and mathematical derivation. Numerical simulations show that APTC-RNN has faster and more accurate PTC capability than three state-of-the-art RNNs, while having less computational time. Finally, the practicality of the APTC-RNN is verified by applying it to the UR3 robotic arm and multiagent systems.},

This area has garnered significant research interest due to its extensive applications in robotics, particularly concerning household robots. Nevertheless, the majority of task planning methodologies exhibit suboptimal performance regarding the success and efficiency of completing household tasks, primarily due to a lack of cognitive capacity of household items and home environments. To address these challenges, we propose an efficiency-driven adaptive task planning approach based on hierarchical item-environment cognition. Initially, we establish a multiple semantic attribute-based priori knowledge (MSAPK) framework to facilitate the attributive representation of household items. Utilizing MSAPK, we develop a long short-term memory (LSTM) based item cognition model that assigns relevant attributes and substitutes to specified household items, thereby enhancing the cognitive capabilities of household robots at the attribute level. Subsequently, we construct an environment cognition model that delineates the relationships between household items and room types, enabling household robots to locate target items more efficiently. Through hierarchical item-environment cognition, we introduce a strategy for adaptive task planning, empowering household robots to execute household tasks with both flexibility and efficiency. The generated plans are evaluated in both virtual and real-world experiments, with promising results affirming the effectiveness of our proposed methodology.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, with the rapid development of the Internet, multisource information fusion has become a forefront issue due to its ability to merge different information. Granular computing (GrC), as a methodology simulating human hierarchical cognition, provides a new approach for multisource information fusion. However, on one hand, the existing information fusion studies in GrC all focus on feature-level fusion and decision-level fusion based on multisource data, neglecting the basic characteristics and advantages of GrC: granulation. On the other hand, the existing methods for fusing the knowledge spaces in GrC suffer from losing the necessary information or artificially adding information. In order to address these issues, a novel information fusion mode from the perspective of GrC is proposed in this article, named knowledge-level fusion. First, by introducing a new step, that is, granulate data to construct the knowledge space, into the multisource information fusion process, the knowledge-level fusion mode is proposed. Second, the optimistic core quotient space is proposed to characterize the information consensus and information gap of multisource knowledge spaces in the static data environment. The pessimistic core quotient space is proposed to characterize the information consensus in the dynamic data environment. Related theorems are given to describe the characteristics of the core quotient spaces. Then, the knowledge-level fusion method driven jointly by the data space and the knowledge space is introduced based on the principle of extracting the core quotient space first and then allocating other objects in the candidate set. On the basis, the superiority of the proposed method over the existing methods is demonstrated through theoretical analysis. Finally, experiments on 12 UCI datasets and three UKB datasets are carried out to verify the promoting effect on classification and clustering algorithms, the effectiveness compared to feature-level and decision-level fusion modes, efficiency and statistical significance of the proposed knowledge-level fusion method and mode.},

The controlled system aims to track the optimal trajectory of a target system, despite the cost function governing the target’s behaviors being unknown. The problem is complicated by random state dropouts occurring in two crucial scenarios: 1) the reception of the target’s state and 2) feedback of the controlled system’s states. Our approach enables the controlled system to infer the target’s cost function and optimal control policy, thereby facilitating effective tracking. Specifically, we develop a model-based IRL algorithm that integrates the Smith predictor for state estimation. Then, we advance a state-dropout-aware inverse Q-learning algorithm that uses solely accessible system data, eliminating the need for system models.

  abstract     = {Determining the optimal number of clusters in cluster analysis without prior knowledge remains a critical and challenging task. Existing methods often depend on calculating clustering validity indices (CVIs), which increases complexity and may reduce efficiency. Furthermore, different CVIs frequently suggest varying optimal cluster numbers, complicating the selection process. To address these challenges, we propose a novel clustering algorithm, self-regulating possibilistic C-means (PCM) with high-density points (SR-PCM-HDP), which simplifies cluster number determination while improving clustering efficiency. First, the density-based knowledge extraction (DBKE) method is introduced to estimate an appropriate initial cluster number and identify high-density points. DBKE enhances the density peak clustering (DPC) algorithm by removing the need for a predefined density radius. Second, SR-PCM-HDP refines the clustering process by incorporating a parameter to balance the interactions between high-density points and cluster centers, reducing sensitivity to initial configurations and accelerating convergence. Third, the parameter adjustment mechanism in classical PCM is redefined to enable adaptive updates during SR-PCM-HDP iterations. This mechanism facilitates the gradual elimination of obsolete clusters and iterative cluster formation. The theoretical foundations of the SR-PCM-HDP cluster elimination mechanism are rigorously established. Experimental results validate the accuracy and effectiveness of SR-PCM-HDP in determining cluster numbers and ensuring clustering validity, particularly for datasets with overlapping or imbalanced distributions. Comparisons are conducted against 13 state-of-the-art algorithms, including fuzzy clustering, possibilistic clustering, and CVI-based cluster determination methods.},

To conserve computational resources and reduce network transmission burdens, a static event-triggered control is initially designed, followed by the development of a more flexible dynamic form. Finally, a critic neural network is designed for each player to approximate its value function and control policy. Rigorous proofs are provided for the uniform ultimate boundedness of the state and the weight estimation errors. The effectiveness of the present method is demonstrated through simulation experiments.},

  abstract     = {This brief presents an adaptive neural zeta-backstepping control strategy for a class of uncertain nonlinear systems, which allows these systems to be practically stabilized with predefined damping ratios. By introducing the zeta-backstepping technique, system damping ratios can be predetermined based on specific parameter selection rules. To reduce the impact of unknown nonlinearities, neural networks (NNs) with gradient descent training are applied to compensate such nonlinearities online. A new filter, called dynamic command filter, is used to construct the gradient of the NNs. By resorting to second-order Lyapunov stability criteria, it is proved that the closed-loop system is practically stable and has predefined damping ratio. Finally, experiments on a perturbed direct current (DC) motor system demonstrate the advantages of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {Efficient and robust data clustering remains a challenging task in data analysis. Recent efforts have explored the integration of granular-ball (GB) computing with clustering algorithms to address this challenge, yielding promising results. However, existing methods for generating GBs often rely on single indicators to measure GB quality and employ threshold-based or greedy strategies, potentially leading to GBs that do not accurately capture the underlying data distribution. To address these limitations, this article leverages the principle of justifiable granularity (POJG) to measure the quality of a GB for clustering tasks and introduces a novel GB generation method, termed GB-POJG. Specifically, a comprehensive metric integrating the coverage and specificity of a GB is introduced to assess GB quality. Utilizing this quality metric, GB-POJG incorporates a strategy of maximizing overall quality and an anomaly detection method to determine the generated GBs and identify abnormal GBs, respectively. Compared to previous GB generation methods, GB-POJG maximizes the overall quality of generated GBs while ensuring alignment with the data distribution, thereby enhancing the rationality of the generated GBs. Experimental results obtained from both synthetic and publicly available datasets underscore the effectiveness of GB-POJG, showcasing improvements in clustering accuracy and normalized mutual information.

  abstract     = {Feature selection (FS) is a significant research topic in machine learning and artificial intelligence, but it becomes complicated in the high dimensional search space due to the vast number of features. Evolutionary computation (EC) has been widely used in solving FS by modeling it as an expensive wrapper-form optimization task, where a classifier is used to obtain classification accuracy for fitness evaluation (FE). In this article, we propose that the FS problem can be also modeled as a cheap filter-form optimization task, where the FE is based on the relevance and redundancy of the selected features. The wrapper-form optimization task is beneficial for classification accuracy while the filter-form optimization task has the strength of a lighter computational cost. Therefore, different from existing multitask-based FS that uses various wrapper-form optimization tasks, this article uses a multiform optimization technique to model the FS problem as a wrapper-form optimization task and a filter-form optimization task simultaneously. An evolutionary multitask FS (EMTFS) algorithm for parallel tacking these two tasks is proposed followed by, in which a two-channel knowledge transfer strategy is proposed to transfer positive knowledge across the two tasks. Experiments on widely used public datasets show that EMTFS can select as few features as possible on the premise of superior classification accuracy than the compared state-of-the-art FS algorithms.},

Inspired by the idea of deep learning, those basic latent variable models have been extended to deep forms, based on which the quality prediction performance has been significantly improved. However, different latent variable models have their own strengths and weaknesses, a model works well under one scenario might not provide satisfactory performance under another. The motivation of this article is based on the viewpoint of information fusion and ensemble learning for heterogeneous latent variable models. Particularly, a collaborative deep learning and model fusion framework is formulated for the purpose of industrial quality prediction. In the first stage of the framework, collaborative layer-by-layer feature extractions are implemented among different latent variable models, through which different patterns of latent variables are identified in different layers of the deep model. Then, in the second stage, an ensemble regression modeling strategy is proposed to fuse the quality prediction results from different latent variable models, which is based on a well-designed data description method. Two real industrial examples are used for performance evaluation of the proposed method, based on which we can observe that information fusions in terms of both collaborative layer-by-layer feature extraction and heterogeneous model ensemble have positive effects in improving prediction accuracy and stability.},

From a centralized perspective, we first develop a controller with adaptive control gains to guide the output of a double-integrator system toward the time-varying optimal solution. By employing the modified average estimators, we extend the centralized design to a distributed implementation to address the OOSP for uncertain EL systems. Using matrix trace properties and composite Lyapunov analysis, we prove that the system outputs can asymptotically converge to the desired time-varying optimal solution.

Building on these systems, an enhanced fast nonsingular integral terminal sliding-mode (NITSM) surface and a new virtual control law are designed, respectively. Next, a novel saturated adaptive fuzzy fixed-time NITSM controller is proposed, circumventing the restrictions on uncertainties and input saturation in the existing results. The proposed controller ensures that the tracking error converges to a small neighborhood of the origin within a fixed time. Furthermore, to facilitate the adaptive fixed-time stability analysis, two new inequalities are established and rigorously proved. Using the two inequalities, the fixed-time stability of closed-loop systems is demonstrated by the Lyapunov’s theory.

  abstract     = {Discovering clusters remains challenging when dealing with complex data structures, including those with varying densities, arbitrary shapes, weak separability, or the presence of noise. In this article, we propose a novel clustering algorithm called representative point-based clustering with neighborhood information (RPC-NI), which highlights the significance of neighborhood information often overlooked by existing clustering methods. The proposed algorithm first introduces a new local centrality metric that integrates both neighborhood density and topological convergence to identify core representative points, effectively capturing the structural characteristics of the data. Subsequently, a density-adaptive distance is defined to evaluate dissimilarities between these core representative points, and such distance is used to construct a minimum spanning tree (MST) over these points. Finally, an MST-based clustering algorithm is employed to yield the desired clusters. Incorporating neighborhood information enables RPC-NI to comprehensively determine representative points, and having multiple representative points per cluster allows RPC-NI to adapt to clusters of arbitrary shapes, varying densities, and different sizes. Extensive experiments on widely used datasets demonstrate that RPC-NI outperforms baseline algorithms in terms of clustering accuracy and robustness. These results provide further evidence for the importance of incorporating neighborhood information discovering clusters with complex structures.},

Existing gaze or gesture-based interaction systems are often constrained by their dependence on continuous visual engagement, limited interaction surfaces, or cumbersome hardware. To address these challenges, we propose MetaSkin, a novel neurohaptic interface that uniquely integrates neural signals with on-skin interaction for bare-handed, eyes-free interaction by exploiting human’s natural proprioceptive capabilities. To support the interface, we developed a deep learning framework that employs multiscale temporal-spectral feature representation and selective feature attention to effectively decode neural signals generated by on-skin touch and motion gestures. In experiments with 12 participants, our method achieved offline accuracies of 81.95% for touch location discrimination, 71.00% for motion type identification, and 46.08% for 10-class touch-motion classification. In pseudo-online settings, accuracies reached 99.43% for touch onset detection, and 80.34% and 67.02% for classification of touch location and motion type, respectively. Neurophysiological analyses revealed distinct neural activation patterns in the sensorimotor cortex, underscoring the efficacy of our multiscale approach in capturing rich temporal and spectral dynamics. Future work will focus on optimizing the system for diverse user populations and dynamic environments, with a long-term goal of advancing human-centered, neuroadaptive interfaces for next-generation HMI systems. This work represents a significant step toward a paradigm shift in design of brain-computer interfaces, bridging sensory and motor paradigms for building more sophisticated systems.},

In this article, we first define fuzzy membership functions (FMFs) with single and continuous support; and consider TSK-FIS with a grid partition strategy for computing its firing strengths with product T-norm (here after denoted as TSK-FIS-product). We also define a more general joint necessary condition, whereby each constituent itself is a necessary condition for the TSK-FIS-product model. The first necessary condition indicates that the normalized firing strength must not be indeterminate (i.e., 0/0), i.e., susceptible to the tomato classification problem. The second necessary condition indicates that all restricted consequents of fuzzy if-then rules must be defined. Based on the principle of the ordered weighted averaging (OWA) operator as well as the concept of increasing orness in OWA and hyperboxes, a general joint sufficient condition for a TSK-FIS-product model to be monotone is derived. Three case studies of the developed methods for undertaking failure mode and effect analysis (FMEA) and image processing tasks are presented. The results are compared, analyzed, and discussed, demonstrating the usefulness of our developed methods.},

  abstract     = {Multiview semi-supervised learning is a popular research area in which people utilize cross-view knowledge to overcome the limitation of labeled data in semi-supervised learning. Existing methods mainly utilize deep neural network, which is relatively time-consuming due to the complex network structure and back propagation iterations. In this article, co-training broad Siamese-like network (Co-BSLN) is proposed for coupled-view semi-supervised classification. Co-BSLN learns knowledge from two-view data and can be used for multiview data with the help of feature concatenation. Different from existing deep learning methods, Co-BSLN utilizes a simple shallow network based on broad learning system (BLS) to simplify the network structure and reduce training time. It replaces back propagation iterations with a direct pseudo inverse calculation to further reduce time consumption. In Co-BSLN, different views of the same instance are considered as positive pairs due to cross-view consistency. Predictions of views in positive pairs are used to guide the training of each other through a direct logit vector mapping. Such a design is fast and effectively utilizes cross-view consistency to improve the accuracy of semi-supervised learning. Evaluation results demonstrate that Co-BSLN is able to improve accuracy and reduce training time on popular datasets.},

The formulation of optimal control problems (OCPs) is based on predictive states derived from Gaussian process (GP) regression under terminal constraints. The event-triggered condition proposed in this article is derived from the recursive feasibility, so that the OCPs are solved only when an error between the predictive and the actual states exceeds a certain threshold. This article analyzes the convergence of the closed-loop system under the event-triggered condition, demonstrating that the system’s state will enter the terminal set within a finite time, assuming small-enough uncertainty in the GP model. We validate this approach through a tracking control problem, illustrating its practical effectiveness.},

Surface Electromyography (sEMG) provides force and electrophysiological information associated with muscles, while A-mode ultrasound (AUS) reveals muscle morphological information. By leveraging these two modalities, more comprehensive muscle motor unit information relevant to gesture recognition can be obtained. In this article, we introduce the adaptive weight classification (AWC) module and its enhanced version with hierarchical classifiers, adaptive weight hierarchical soft voting (AWHSV), to integrate AUS and sEMG into a fused modality. This approach dynamically adjusts the weights of individual and fused features, compensating for lost details during fusion, leading to a richer information representation and significantly improving algorithm robustness in gesture recognition. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves recognition rates that are 0.66%, 2.36%, and 1.30% higher than those of its counterparts using sEMG, AUS, and sEMG-AUS, respectively. Moreover, the method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, confirming its effectiveness in gesture recognition across both single and multiple modalities. This work demonstrates the advantages of the proposed AWHSV method, providing broader application scenarios for gesture recognition.},

  abstract     = {A dynamic event-triggered load frequency control (LFC) is studied for interconnected multiarea power systems (IMAPSs) with stochastic semi-Markov parameters from the perspective of finite-time interval. To facilitate the sudden changes, the underlying semi-Markov process (SMP) is adopted to characterize the random behavior of IMAPSs. A dynamic event-triggered protocol (DETP) is developed to modulate the transmission frequency while maintaining predefined system performance. Owing to complicated grid environment, the hidden semi-Markov model (HSMM) is proposed to solve the asynchronization between the system mode and the controller mode, which forms a new asynchronous mechanism to better understand the behavior pattern of the system. The novelty of this article is to construct a suitable asynchronous control strategy to solve the mismatch between the system mode and the controller mode under the framework of IMAPSs. Different from static event-triggered protocol (ETP), the DETP is proposed, in which the threshold parameters can be dynamically adjusted to reduce the waste of communication resources and achieve dynamic performance in limited time. According to the stochastic system theory and the finite-time theory, by constructing a modular dependent random Lyapunov function, sufficient conditions are obtained to ensure the finite-time boundedness of the corresponding system with $H_{\infty }$ performance. Finally, the efficiency is demonstrated through three-area power systems.},

In addition, a single network ADP structure is constructed to approach the optimal consensus control policies. Subsequently, an event triggering mechanism is implemented to reduce the workload of the controller and conserve computing and communication resources. Since then, in order to further streamline the intricacies of controller design, this work is extended to self-triggered cases to alleviate the need for hardware devices to continuously monitor signals.

  abstract     = {To alleviate data distribution under different operating conditions, domain generalization (DG) has been applied in mechanical diagnosis. Still, its effectiveness is limited when unknown fault states appear in the target domain. Consequently, open set DG (OSDG) has emerged to identify unknown classes in unknown domains. However, data collection costs and safety concerns have resulted in a significant class imbalance in OSDG. This imbalance causes the decision boundary to be skewed toward abundant positive classes, ultimately leading to misclassifying unknown states and increasing security risks. Currently, there is a lack of methods to simultaneously address domain shift and class shift in an imbalanced unknown domain. To tackle this issue, this article proposes a multisource domain-class gradient coordination meta-learning (MDGCML) framework, which can learn the generalized boundaries of all tasks by coordinating gradients between interdomains and interclasses. Based on the MDGCML, a joint learning paradigm involving the sharing of parameters between open-set classifiers and closed-set classifiers is constructed to enable quick adaption of the model to unknown domains. The superior performance of the proposed framework has been verified on two datasets.},

To address this issue, a two-stage cooperation multiobjective evolutionary algorithm guided by constraint-sensitive variables (CV-TCMOEA) is proposed. In the first stage, a relatively simple auxiliary problem with only a few dominant constraints is constructed to approximate the original problem. After obtaining a set of approximate Pareto optimal solutions by dealing with the auxiliary problem, in the second stage, a constraint-sensitive variable-guided multistrategy cooperation search method is developed. In this method, decision variables are divided into two types: 1) constraint-sensitive and 2) constraint-insensitive variables, and a variable-type-guided cooperative individual update strategy is proposed to autonomously select appropriate search strategies for different types of variables. Experimental results on 28 benchmark functions and 10 engineering problems demonstrated the superiority of the CV-TCMOEA over seven state-of-the-art CMOEAs.},

  abstract     = {Subspace clustering has attracted significant interest for its capacity to partition high-dimensional data into multiple subspaces. The current approaches to subspace clustering predominantly revolve around two key aspects: 1) the construction of an effective similarity matrix and 2) the pursuit of sparsity within the projection matrix. However, assessing whether the dimensionality of the projected subspace is the true dimensionality of the data is challenging. Therefore, the clustering performance may decrease when dealing with scenarios such as subspace overlap, insufficient projected dimensions, data noise, etc., since the defined dimensionality of the projected lower-dimensional space may deviate significantly from its true value. In this research, we introduce a novel reweighting strategy, which is applied to projected coordinates for the first time and propose a reweighted subspace clustering model guided by the preservation of the both local and global structural characteristics (RWSC). The projected subspaces are reweighted to augment or suppress the importance of different coordinates, so that data with overlapping subspaces can be better distinguished and the redundant coordinates produced by the predefined number of projected dimensions can be further removed. By introducing reweighting strategies, the bias caused by imprecise dimensionalities in subspace clustering can be alleviated. Moreover, global scatter structure preservation and adaptive local structure learning are integrated into the proposed model, which helps RWSC capture more intrinsic structures and its robustness and applicability can then be improved. Through rigorous experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets, the effectiveness and superiority of RWSC are empirically verified.},

  abstract     = {In data stream (DS) learning, the system has to extract knowledge from data generated continuously, usually at high speed and in large volumes, making it impossible to store the entire set of data to be processed in batch mode. Hence, machine learning models must be built incrementally by processing the incoming examples, as data arrive, while updating the model to be compatible with the current data. In fuzzy DS clustering, the model can either absorb incoming data into existing clusters or initiate a new cluster. As the volume of data increases, there is a possibility that the clusters will overlap to the point where it is convenient to merge two or more clusters into one. Then, a cluster comparison measure (CM) should be applied, to decide whether such clusters should be combined, also in an incremental manner. This defines an incremental fusion process based on aggregation functions that can aggregate the incoming inputs without storing all the previous inputs. The objective of this article is to solve the fuzzy DS clustering problem of incrementally comparing fuzzy clusters on a formal basis. First, we formalize and operationalize incremental fusion processes of fuzzy clusters by introducing recursively extendable (RE) aggregation functions, studying construction methods and different classes of such functions. Second, we propose two approaches to compare clusters: 1) similarity and 2) overlapping between clusters, based on RE aggregation functions. Finally, we analyze the effect of those incremental CMs on the online and offline phases of the well-known fuzzy clustering algorithm d-FuzzStream, showing that our new approach outperforms the original algorithm and presents better or comparable performance to other state-of-the-art DS clustering algorithms found in the literature.},

However, fully unifying inspection and production systems to effectively address assembly-related quality issues remains a challenge. This study seeks to close these gaps by introducing collaborative optimization methods to ensure seamless operations. The research is driven by the need for precise control of key assembly parameters, such as placement height, x-offset, y-offset, rotation angle deviations, and blowing durations, all of which are major contributors to defects. To address these challenges, we propose a self-adaptive collaborative optimization (SACO) framework that prioritizes enhancements based on their impact on both quality and efficiency. The SACO framework combines customized Bayesian optimization and particle swarm optimization techniques, allowing for dynamic adjustments to process parameters, guided by real-time data from automatic optical inspection (AOI) systems. The primary goal of this study is to reduce defects and improve efficiency in the SMT assembly process through these targeted improvements. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of the proposed methods, demonstrating significant advancements in placement accuracy and overall assembly efficiency. Our findings confirm that the SACO framework provides a robust solution to persistent challenges in SMT production, addressing critical gaps in quality control and process optimization.},

Additionally, fractional differential calculus is based on differentiation and integration of arbitrary fractional order, which can more accurately describe the physical phenomenon model than the traditional integer calculus. Thus, this article proposes a novel fractional-order extended Kalman filter (FOEKF) based on the evolutionary algorithm and deep ensemble learning techniques for the state estimation problem of CPPSs from the fractional-order theory perspective. First, the power system is modeled as a fractional version to describe the physical phenomenon better according to the fractional differential calculus theory. Then, considering the difficulties in determining fractional orders in the fractional-order power system, a deep ensemble learning-based approach is used to design the fitness function and a genetic algorithm is developed to determine these parameters by optimizing the designed objective function. Furthermore, to solve the difficulties in estimating for fractional-order power system by integral extended Kalman filter (EKF), the evolutionary FOEKF (EFOEKF) is presented as the estimator for the designed fractional-order power system. Finally, to improve the performance of EFOEKF under bad datum scenarios caused by cyber-attacks or sudden loads, an enhanced EFOEKF method is developed by using an adapted exponential weighting function. The numerical simulation results show that the proposed EFOEKF is better than EKF and FOEKF on four different IEEE bus systems in terms of the mean absolute error.},

A sixth-power Lyapunov function is designed for the first time which lays the foundation to construct the effective adaptive fixed-time fault compensation mechanism. Meanwhile, in the controller design procedure, owing to the existence of the sensor fault, only the actual output can be measured, unlike existing results, an improved state observer is constructed to estimate the unmeasured states effectively. Under our developed control mechanism, all closed-loop signals are bounded within fixed-time interval, observation errors and tracking error can converge into a small domain around zero. Simulation verifies the availability of the presented approach further.},

  abstract     = {This article investigates the distributed estimation problem of an unknown high-dimensional sparse state vector for a stochastic dynamic system. The communication topology randomly switches, and the switching law is governed by a time-homogeneous Markovian chain. By means of the compressed sensing (CS) theory and a diffusion strategy, we propose a compressed distributed Kalman filter (CDKF). That is, each sensor first compresses the original high-dimensional regression data. Then, the covariance intersection fusion rule is utilized to obtain a distributed Kalman filter (DKF) estimate in the compressed low-dimensional space. Afterward, the original high-dimensional sparse state vector can be well recovered by a reconstruction technique. In terms of stability analysis, one of the main difficulties lies in analyzing the product of nonindependent and nonstationary random matrices in the context of time-varying communication topologies. Relying on the stochastic stability theory, the Markov chain theory, and the CS theory, we establish the upper bound for the estimation error under the compressed cooperative excitation condition, which is much weaker than the traditional uncompressed collective observability conditions used in the existing literature. Finally, we provide a simulation example to illustrate the performance of the proposed algorithm.},

A uniform quantizer with a finite quantization level is employed on the system measurement side, with distinct lower bounds specified for the quantizer under two encoding-decoding pairs. Zoom-out and zoom-in strategies are incorporated into the encoder and decoder, respectively, enabling adaptation of the quantizer. These two adaptive quantization mechanisms ensure convergence of the system output toward the desired reference without saturating the quantizer under any initial input. The proposed scheme relaxes the constraints on the initial input signals, simplifies the expression for the quantizer saturation bound, and concurrently reduces the magnitude of the saturation bound itself.

  abstract     = {In this article, a policy-iteration-based active disturbance rejection control (ADRC) is proposed for uncertain nonlinear systems to achieve real-time output tracking performance, regardless of the specific relative degree of the system. The approach integrates a partial control input generator with a policy-iteration-based reinforcement learning (RL) agent for degree weight adjustment. The partial control input generator includes each ith order partial control input, which is constructed following the ADRC design framework for an ith order system. The RL agent adjusts the degree weights (its actions) to enhance the dominance of the partial control input corresponding to the unknown relative degree through iterative policy refinement. The RL agent is designed to minimize the quadratic reward as the performance index function while enhancing the influence of the partial control input associated with the correct relative degree via the policy iteration procedure. All signals in the closed-loop system (including the time-varying degree weights) ensure semi-global uniformly ultimately boundness using the Lyapunov stability theorem and the affinely quadratically stable property. Consequently, the degree weight adjustments by the RL agent do not affect the closed-loop stability. The proposed method does not require system dynamics, specific relative degree, external disturbances, and other state variable sensing beyond output sensing. The performance of the proposed method was validated via simulations for two different-order uncertain nonlinear systems and experiments using a permanent magnet synchronous motor testbed.},

  abstract     = {The coordination of distributed energy resources (DERs) within virtual power plants (VPPs) is expected to generate significant economic benefits and enhance the operational stability of modern power systems. However, achieving massive coordination of heterogeneous and uncertain DERs remains a challenge in current research. To address this issue, this article proposes a novel bi-level optimization approach based on mean-field reinforcement learning (MFRL) to enable the coordination of massive DERs in VPPs. The problem is decomposed into multiple subproblems: the upper-level subproblem models power dispatch among integrated energy systems (IESs) in response to coordinated demand, while a series of lower-level subproblems determine the operational schemes of DERs within individual IESs. Considering the large decision space, an MFRL algorithm with fast Shapley credit allocation is developed to efficiently solve the upper-level optimization. Meanwhile, the lower-level subproblems are formulated as small-scale mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) problems, addressing the difficulties caused by IES heterogeneity in applying mean-field approximation. Simulation results show that the proposed approach significantly improves convergence speed and reduces the global cost of VPP operation, especially in massive-scale scenarios. In test scenarios ranging from 10 to 500 agents, the proposed bi-level optimization approach improves the objective by 4.8%–26.6%, compared to the advanced baseline method.},

This article represents the first attempt toward a unified distributed digital predictor-based control scheme for the solution of the secondary voltage restoration problem in islanded MGs, which also involves external unknown disturbances and network vulnerabilities, thus enhancing its resilience and reliability. The novel sampled-data predictive controller revises the conventional model reduction approach to reformulate it in a fully distributed digital way and involves some external disturbances information for prediction performance improvement, even though these perturbations are completely unknown. The main features of the resulting method are: 1) large delays compensation accounting for networked-induced delays and sleeping time interval due to DoS attacks occurrence and 2) unknown disturbance attenuation, usually neglected in the controllers synthesis phase in MGs field. Lyapunov-Krasovskii theory is exploited to analytically prove the exponential stability of the MG voltage, thus leading to linear matrix inequality-based sufficient stability conditions. Numerical and experimental results confirm theoretical derivations.},

  abstract     = {Owing to advancements in deep learning technology, vision transformers (ViTs) have demonstrated impressive performance in various computer vision tasks. Nonetheless, ViTs still face some challenges, such as high computational complexity and the absence of desirable inductive biases. To alleviate these issues, the potential advantages of combining eagle vision with ViTs are explored. A bi-fovea visual interaction (BFVI) structure inspired by the unique physiological and visual characteristics of eagle eyes is introduced. Based on this structural design approach, a novel bi-fovea self-attention (BFSA) mechanism and bi-fovea feedforward network (BFFN) are proposed. These components are employed to mimic the hierarchical and parallel information processing scheme of the biological visual cortex, thereby enabling networks to learn the feature representations of the targets in a coarse-to-fine manner. Furthermore, a bionic eagle vision (BEV) block is designed as the basic building unit based on the BFSA mechanism and the BFFN. By stacking the BEV blocks, a unified and efficient family of pyramid backbone networks called eagle ViTs (EViTs) is developed. Experimental results indicate that the EViTs exhibit highly competitive performance in various computer vision tasks, demonstrating their potential as backbone networks. In terms of computational efficiency and scalability, EViTs show significant advantages compared with other counterparts. The developed code is available at https://github.com/nkusyl/EViT.},

Current methods predominantly assume the existence of a single underlying task, but using a single contextual embedding may not be expressive enough to fully capture the broader distribution of task variations that an agent might encounter. Decomposing that information into different representations can allow them to capture more relevant features in context space while applying additional structure that aids downstream exploitation. In this article, we develop global-local embeddings for contextual meta-RL (GLOBEX), an off-policy contextual meta-RL algorithm that decomposes the contextual representation into separate global and local embeddings. The learning process maximizes information retained by the embeddings and utilizes a mutual information constraint to encourage decoupling. Illustrative examples show that our method effectively adapts by identifying global task dynamics and exploiting temporally local signals. In addition, GLOBEX outperforms existing state-of-the-art meta-RL algorithms on standard MuJoCo benchmarks.},

  abstract     = {The main challenge when solving constrained multiobjective optimization problems (CMOPs) with intricate constraints and high dimensionality is how to overcome a problem of irregular and variable-shaped objective search regions. Such regions can lead to problems of local optimization and uneven distribution of feasible solutions. To overcome these challenges, an efficacious search method is usually needed to improve the efficiency of searching optimal solution and utilization of data structure used to store nondominated vectors. The originality of this work comes with a creative and novel design of Kriging surrogate model-based simplex crossover operator (KSCO) and Kriging surrogate model-based local search of simplex crossover operator (KLSSCO). KSCO is used to calculate the speed update equation, as well as the coefficients of the equation. KLSSCO is employed to decide which particle is treated as third particle participating in the speed update equation. A constrained multiobjective particle swarm optimization (PSO) based on KSCO and KLSSCO is proposed to solve the CMOP with local optimization and uneven distribution problems, namely KSCO and KLSSCO-based constrained multiobjective PSO algorithm (KCMOPSO). This ensures that the algorithm can search the infeasible and feasible regions of constrained multiobjective problems accurately and accelerate the convergence of the algorithm.

  abstract     = {The goal of few-shot class incremental learning (FSCIL) is to learn new concepts from a limited number of novel samples while preserving the knowledge of previously learned classes. The mainstream FSCIL framework begins with training in the base session, after which the feature extractor is frozen to accommodate novel classes. We observed that traditional base-session training approaches often lead to overfitting on challenging samples, which can lead to reduced robustness in the decision boundaries and exacerbate the forgetting phenomenon when introducing incremental data. To address this issue, we proposed the progressive learning strategy (PGLS). First, inspired by curriculum learning, we developed a covariance noise perturbation approach based on the statistical information as a difficulty measure for assessing sample robustness. We then reweighted the samples based on their robustness, initially concentrating on enhancing model stability by prioritizing robust samples and subsequently leveraging weakly robust samples to improve generalization. Second, we predefined forward compatibility for various virtual class augmentation models. Within base class training, we employed a curriculum learning strategy that progressively introduced fewer to more virtual classes in order to mitigate any adverse effects on model performance. This strategy enhances the adaptability of base classes to novel ones and alleviates forgetting problems. Finally, extensive experiments conducted on the CUB200, CIFAR100, and miniImageNet datasets demonstrate the significant advantages of our proposed method over state-of-the-art models.},

The facilitation of communication between sensors and the remote estimator through wireless networks, which are subject to bit rate constraints, involves the use of a coding-decoding mechanism. For efficient estimation in the presence of periodic measurements, a specialized impulsive estimation method is developed, which aims to carry out impulsive corrections precisely at the instants when the measurement signal is received by the estimator. By employing the iteration analysis method under the impulsive mechanism, a sufficient condition is established that ensures the exponential boundedness of the estimation error dynamics. Furthermore, an optimization algorithm is introduced for addressing the challenges related to bit rate allocation and the design of desired estimator gains. Within the presented theoretical framework, the correlation between estimation performance and bit rate allocation is elucidated. Finally, a simulation example is provided to demonstrate the validity of the proposed estimation approach.},

In this article, we investigate the synthesis of initialization and acceleration for optimal learning control algorithms. This approach contrasts with traditional methods that concentrate solely on either the improvement of initialization or acceleration. Specifically, we establish a novel relaxed policy iteration (PI) algorithm with self-learning horizon for stochastic optimal control. Notably, by suitably utilizing self-learning horizon, we can directly evaluate inadmissible policies to reduce the initialization burden. Meanwhile, the inadmissible policy can be rapidly optimized with few learning iterations. Then, several critical conclusions of relaxed optimal control are established by discussing algorithm convergence and system stability. Furthermore, to provide the convincing application potentials, a class of unconventional problems is effectively solved by the relaxed PI algorithm, including the dynamics with external noises and nonzero equilibrium. Finally, we present a series of nonlinear benchmarks with practical applications to comprehensively evaluate the performance of relaxed PI. The experimental results obtained from these diverse benchmarks uniformly highlight the effectiveness of self-learning horizon mechanism.},

The DoS attacks considered in this article can interrupt all the communication transmissions of the attacked UAV from neighbors so that the victim is not able to receive any information from neighboring UAVs during DoS attacks. To deal with such a difficult problem, a fixed-time security constraint estimator (FTSCE) is proposed to ensure the stability and security of UAVs during the DoS attacks. Moreover, the unknown state is estimated to reduce the amount of the transferred information. Based on the proposed FTSCE, the relative position and velocity of UAV states are used to design the resilient consensus controller against the DoS attacks.

  abstract     = {This article first presents a dual flexible prescribed performance control (DFPPC) approach of input saturated high-order nonlinear systems (IS-HONSs). Compared to the existing PPC approaches of IS-HONSs, under which the performance constraint boundaries (PCBs) are usually fixed and bounded, resulting in a restriction of the initial error in the algorithm implementation; in addition, the coupling relationship between performance constraints and input saturation is usually ignored, resulting in the methods are very fragile when input saturation occurs. By designing the novel tensile model-based PCBs that depend on output and input constraints, the proposed DFPPC method provides sufficient resilience for both the initial conditions and the input saturation, so that the proposed DFPPC method can not only be suitable for multiple types of initial errors by adjusting the parameters, including $e_{1}(0)\in (\underline {\mathcal {B}}(0),\bar {\mathcal {B}}(0))$ , $e_{1}(0)\in (-\infty,\bar {\mathcal {B}}(0))$ , $e_{1}(0)\in (\underline {\mathcal {B}}(0),+\infty)$ and $e_{1}(0)\in (-\infty,\infty)$ , where $\underline {\mathcal {B}}(0)$ , and $\bar {\mathcal {B}}(0)$ denote the initial PCBs; but also can achieve a good balance between input saturation and performance constraints, i.e., when the control input reaches or exceeds the saturation threshold, the PCBs can adaptively extend to avoid the singularity, and when the control input returns to the saturation threshold range, the PCBs are then adaptively restored to the original PCBs. The results show that the proposed DFPPC algorithm guarantees semi-global boundedness for all closed-loop signals, while ensuring that the system output accurately tracks the desired signal, and it consistently maintains the tracking error within the PCBs. The developed algorithm is illustrated by means of simulation instances.},

  abstract     = {Industrial data often consist of continuous variables (CVs) and binary variables (BVs), both of which provide crucial information about process operating conditions. Due to the coupling between industrial systems or equipment, these hybrid variables are usually high-dimensional and highly correlated. However, existing methods generally model hybrid variables directly in the observation space and assume independence between the variables to overcome the curse of dimensionality. Thus, they are ineffective at capturing dependencies among hybrid variables, and the effectiveness of process monitoring will be compromised. To overcome the limitations, this study proposes to seek a unified subspace for hybrid variables using the probabilistic latent variable (LV) model. By introducing a low-dimensional continuous LV, the proposed method can avoid the curse of dimensionality while capturing the dependencies between hybrid variables. Nevertheless, the inference of LV is analytically intractable and thus time-consuming due to the heterogeneity of CVs and BVs. To accelerate offline learning and online inference procedures, this study originally derives an analytical Gaussian distribution to approximate the true posterior distribution of the LV, based on which an efficient expectation-maximization algorithm is developed for parameter estimation. The Gaussian approximation is simultaneously optimized with the latest parameters to achieve a high approximation accuracy. The LV is then estimated by the posterior mean of the Gaussian approximation. By mapping the heterogeneous variables into a unified subspace, the proposed method defines three monitoring statistics, which are physically interpretable and thoroughly evaluate the probability of hybrid variables being normal. The effectiveness of the proposed method in detecting anomalies in CVs and BVs is shown through a numerically simulated case and a real industrial case.},

  abstract     = {Neuroimaging analysis aims to reveal the information-processing mechanisms of the human brain in a noninvasive manner. In the past, graph neural networks (GNNs) have shown promise in capturing the non-Euclidean structure of brain networks. However, existing neuroimaging studies focused primarily on spatial functional connectivity, despite temporal dynamics in complex brain networks. To address this gap, we propose a spatio-temporal interactive graph representation framework (STIGR) for dynamic neuroimaging analysis that encompasses different aspects from classification and regression tasks to interpretation tasks. STIGR leverages a dynamic adaptive-neighbor graph convolution network to capture the interrelationships between spatial and temporal dynamics. To address the limited global scope in graph convolutions, a self-attention module based on Transformers is introduced to extract long-term dependencies. Contrastive learning is used to adaptively contrast similarities between adjacent scanning windows, modeling cross-temporal correlations in dynamic graphs. Extensive experiments on six public neuroimaging datasets demonstrate the competitive performance of STIGR across different platforms, achieving state-of-the-art results in classification and regression tasks. The proposed framework enables the detection of remarkable temporal association patterns between regions of interest based on sequential neuroimaging signals, offering medical professionals a versatile and interpretable tool for exploring task-specific neurological patterns.

  abstract     = {Process variables may exhibit both temporal trends and periodic responses, with their fault propagation pathways manifesting in time-domain and frequency-domain causalities, respectively. However, the differing causal perspectives of time-domain and frequency-domain methods can lead to distinct causalities, posing the causal heterogeneity challenge for root cause diagnosis (RCD). Thereupon, we reveal the mechanism of source consistency in Granger causality (GC), that is, the root cause variable provides the most significant predictive information in both time and frequency domains. Accordingly, we propose a causal source consistency analytics (CSCA) framework that achieves time-frequency synergy. First, we design a nonlinear enhancement module to extract temporal features for causal inference. Second, to extract time-domain and frequency-domain GC, we develop a parallel causality learning module, where a differentiable frequency-domain expansion operator is designed along with a temporal prediction submodule. Meanwhile, a time-frequency entropy constraint is constructed to ensure causal significance by inducing sparsity. Finally, a root cause alignment module is proposed to ensure source consistency. A predictive information quantification algorithm, formulated as an eigenvalue decomposition problem, is designed to locate the root cause. We develop an approximate exponential transformation to convert the eigenvalue decomposition into a differentiable source alignment loss. Thus, source consistency can be ensured during end-to-end inference. The validity of CSCA is illustrated through the Tennessee Eastman process and a gas turbine application. CSCA identified the root causes in both examples correctly. Furthermore, ablation studies validate that CSCA enables the time-domain and frequency-domain models to identify consistent root causes, thereby overcoming causal heterogeneity.},

These complexities render the standard backstepping recursive design scheme inapplicable, as the derivative of the virtual controller does not exist. To address the intermittent output feedback problem, we introduce a novel dynamic backstepping control method. First, we establish a dynamic gain observer using the triggered output signals to reconstruct the unmeasurable state variables. Next, the concept of dynamic gain is introduced through a coordinate transformation, with its derivative employed to offset discontinuous terms, which solves the challenges in recursive backstepping design caused by intermittent output and regulates that the state variable converges asymptotically to the origin in the global sense.

Specifically, a distributed prescribed-time observer is constructed for each agent using event-based communications to estimate the states of the exosystem. The constructed observer operates without requiring prior knowledge of the exosystem dynamics or global information, ensuring that observation errors converge to a small neighborhood around zero within a user-determined time interval. Additionally, the incorporation of the DETM guarantees a positive lower bound on the interexecution intervals, thereby alleviating the communication demands. Building on this observer, neuro-adaptive prescribed-time controllers are derived for each agent, capable of maintaining the system states within a user-defined compact set without the need for prior knowledge of the initial system states. It is demonstrated that the regulated outputs converge to a region arbitrarily tuned by the user within a prescribed time, with all signals remaining bounded and Zeno behavior eliminated.

  abstract     = {Wastewater treatment processes (WWTPs) are operated under multiple operating conditions. Designing an appropriate optimal control strategy based on the identification of operating conditions is crucial for ensuring the safe operation of WWTPs. To effectively deal with the problem of multiple operating conditions in WWTPs, a data-knowledge-driven multiobjective adaptive optimal control (DK-MAOC) strategy is proposed. First, a fuzzy neural network (FNN) is employed as the prediction model to obtain the concentrations of nitrate and total nitrogen. Then, the operating conditions of WWTPs can be determined. Second, an adaptive objective function (AOF) is proposed to dynamically adjust the weights of operating indices to meet the operational requirements of each operating condition. In particular, the AOF integrates operating requirements and tracking errors to simultaneously consider the feasibility of the controller when solving setpoints. Third, due to the differences in data distribution under each operating condition, real-time data during condition changing is insufficient to accurately predict. A data-knowledge-driven model, incorporating operational knowledge into the FNN-based predictive model, is established to predict the future dynamics of WWTPs. Finally, a collaborative gradient descent algorithm is proposed to simultaneously solve for setpoints and control laws. The effectiveness of the proposed DK-MAOC is tested on the Benchmark Simulation Model No. 1. The experimental results indicate that DK-MAOC can effectively avoid the situation of effluent nitrate nitrogen and total nitrogen exceeding the standards while reducing energy consumption of WWTPs. Therefore, the proposed DK-MAOC can guarantee optimal operation of WWTPs.},

First, a new global prescribed performance function (PPF) is designed based on a scaling function such that the tracking error evolves within the constrained bounds and the restriction related to the initial conditions is removed. Then, the finite-time command filter (FTCF) is used to avoid the direct derivations of virtual controllers and the singularity issue of the conventional backstepping technique. Moreover, the filtering errors caused by the FTCF are removed by the designed error compensation mechanism. A novel dynamic event-triggered mechanism (DETM) using the dynamic auxiliary variable is designed to save communication resources. The proposed control scheme can guarantee that all signals of the RM are globally bounded within a finite time, and the tracking error can asymptotically reach zero.

To this end, this article addresses the problem of temporal logic disturbance rejection control (TLDRC) for a class of nonlinear systems subject to disturbances. Signal temporal logic (STL) specifications are introduced for the representation of complex tasks. A control barrier function (CBF), composed of a monotonic function characterizing the temporal behavior of the system and a predicate function, is constructed to encode the STL specifications. To guarantee robustness against disturbances, generalized proportional integral observers (GPIOs) are introduced for higher-accuracy disturbance estimation. It is shown that by fully exploiting the constructed CBF and the disturbance estimate, the developed TLDRC strategy is able to ensure the STL specifications and compensate undesirable effects caused by unknown disturbances, even if they are fast-time-varying. A numerical example is presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed strategy.},

ISETM generates not only a triggering instant but also a secure triggering interval (STI) simultaneously. The STI sent to the SDN control plane is an estimation time interval generated by the Taylor expansion and model-based prediction method. During this interval, the SDN control plane programs OpenFlow switches to filter attack traffics, ensuring delayed but secure triggering transmission. Under ISETM conditions represented by two systems of inequalities, a multiarea LFC system is modeled as a delay system incorporating a triggering error based on the Taylor expansion. To achieve $H_{\infty }$ performance of the established LFC system, a criterion is derived using the Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional method. A codesign approach is provided to solve the proposed ISETM control (ISETC) gains through linear matrix inequality (LMI) techniques.

In this article, a natural modal sketching network (NMSNet) is constructed to achieve robust and credible bearing IF extraction. First, the modal response is designed as a convolutional kernel of NMSNet, and the forward propagation logic is interpreted as natural modal sketching, including modal response recovery and weighted superposition. The logic derives from the fault mechanism and brings solid credibility to NMSNet. Second, a novel correction algorithm is developed to interpret the extraction principle of NMSNet in theory and achieve noise elimination due to its filter nature. Third, NMSNet realizes adaptive modal sketching via the formulated weighted fusion strategy and training constraint. Finally, simulation and experiment have been carried out to verify the effectiveness and noise robustness of NMSNet. The fault-related interpretability analysis confirms the knowledge acquisition of NMSNet, which strengthens the credibility of IF extraction.},

The integration of surrogate-based global and local search is a prevalent hierarchical SAEA framework, which can effectively balance exploration and exploitation capabilities. However, it still faces challenges when tackling high-dimensional EOPs (HEOPs) owing to the curse of dimensionality. In this article, we propose a hierarchical surrogate-assisted differential evolution with core space localization (HSADE-CS) to solve HEOPs. Its contributions are listed as follows: 1) a top-promising sampling strategy is introduced in the global search to mitigate the challenges posed by the uncertainty in the performance of the surrogate model; 2) a core space localization (CSL) method is proposed to identify a high-potential space within the local promising region, enhancing the effectiveness of local search; and 3) a fitness-independent adaptive parameter control method based on the Minkowski distance is developed within the differential evolution (DE) optimizer to improve the performance of surrogate model-driven local search. The performance of HSADE-CS has been validated on numerous benchmark problems from the commonly used expensive optimization benchmark suite, as well as the CEC2014 and CEC2017 benchmark suites, with problem dimensions up to 500. It has also been tested on a real-world problem, i.e., circular antenna array design optimization. Experimental results demonstrate that HSADE-CS is highly competitive compared to the state-of-the-art SAEAs.},

  abstract     = {This article investigates the distributed resilient energy management (EM) strategy for the seaport microgrid under stealthy attacks. First, based on an analysis of seaport microgrid characteristics, we construct an EM model that aims at minimizing both operating cost and security defense resource (SDR) cost. Second, we present a distributed, resilient strategy by defining node security levels and establishing dynamic security intervals. We prove that the gap between the obtained feasible solution and the optimal one is bounded. The designed strategy is capable of tolerating the effect of the unlimited number of stealthy attacked nodes on the seaport microgrid. In addition, given the limited SDRs for the resilient EM of the island seaport microgrid, a distributed mechanism for searching the minimum security connected dominating set (MSCDS) is proposed to minimize the size of trusted nodes. Finally, simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed strategy. Note to Practitioners: This article addresses the vulnerability of the seaport microgrid, a critical issue that impacts EM and disrupts seaport operations. Current approaches to seaport EM do not account for potential attacks. Meanwhile, existing methods for attack resilience often overlook the costs of security resources. We propose a new approach for the distributed and resilient EM of the island seaport microgrid. Secure operation is achieved by protecting the fewest trusted nodes, thereby conserving SDRs. We then show how this algorithm (searching the MSCDS) can be efficiently designed. Preliminary simulations indicate its feasibility, though it has yet to be tested in a production environment. Future research will focus on designing trusted nodes within dynamic topologies.},

The presented HT strategy incorporates membership functions to generalize the HT threshold and weighting matrices. Then, the membership functions are embedded in quadratic and integral terms of the fuzzy Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional, leading to a more effective resilient HT mechanism that significantly reduces network bandwidth stresses and achieves better passivity performance. An asynchronous passivity fuzzy controller with enhanced feasibility is designed under imperfect premise matching, and traditional passive controllers are generalized as special cases.

  abstract     = {This article studies the problem of designing the optimal strictly stealthy attack against remote state estimation in cyber-physical systems, where the attacker possesses both the intercepted information and the side information sensed by an additional sensor. Combining the intercepted information with the side information, a novel corrupted innovation-based attack model with higher-design flexibility is proposed, and the analytical optimal attack strategy is derived. Compared with the existing results based on nominal innovation, the proposed attack model eliminates the need for an additional filter to calculate nominal innovation, which saves computational resources, and can achieve greater performance degradation of remote state estimation. Finally, in order to verify the superiority and effectiveness of the results, the numerical examples are given.},

  abstract     = {In this article, we propose a tightly coupled visual-inertial-acoustic sensor fusion method to improve the autonomous localization accuracy of underwater vehicles. To address the performance degradation encountered by existing visual or visual-inertial simultaneous localization and mapping systems when applied in underwater environments, we integrate the Doppler velocity log (DVL), an acoustic velocity sensor, to provide additional motion information. To fully leverage the complementary characteristics among visual, inertial, and acoustic sensors, we perform multimodal information fusion in both frontend tracking and backend mapping processes. Specifically, in the frontend tracking process, we first predict the vehicle’s pose using the angular velocity measurements from the gyroscope and linear velocity measurements from the DVL. Thereafter, measurements performed by the three sensors between adjacent camera frames are utilized to construct visual reprojection error, inertial error, and DVL displacement error, which are jointly minimized to obtain a more accurate pose estimation at the current frame. In the backend mapping process, we utilize gyroscope and DVL measurements to construct relative pose change residuals between keyframes, which are minimized together with visual and inertial residuals to further refine the poses of the keyframes within the local map. Experimental results on both simulated and real-world underwater datasets demonstrate that the proposed fusion method improves the localization accuracy by more than 30% compared to the current state-of-the-art ORB-SLAM3 stereo-inertial method, validating the potential of the proposed method in practical underwater applications.},

Moreover, we propose a novel prescribed performance design method, which distinguishes itself from the previous prescribed performance control schemes by integrating a quadratic characteristic capable of suppressing transient input vibrations, along with a local asymmetric characteristic that optimize both transient output overshoot and steady-state error bias. Furthermore, the proposed control scheme is implemented within a fixed-time framework to ensure that all closed-loop systems are fixed-time bounded in probability, with the tracking error consistently within the predefined performance bounds.

Specifically, the preemption algorithm relies on online state feedback from mechanical system signals, such as position and velocity, which can be implemented in hardware or software; the human decision algorithm takes inputs from electrophysiological signals or language commands. In this development, a Lagrangian density function is constructed that integrates optimal decision making with a uniformly bounded threshold. The intelligent decision-making problem in the HMS is creatively analyzed and mathematically solved leveraging variational calculus, resulting in the analytical expression of the optimal membership function associated with human decisions.

A two-stage approach is built upon the Isaac Gym and several proposed pluggable modules, which can effectively simulate dexterous grasps with multimodal sensing data, including RGB-D images of grasping scenarios, joint angles, 3-D tactile forces of soft fingertips, etc. Over 500K multimodal synthetic grasping scenarios are collected for neural network training. An adaptive dexterous grasping neural network (ADG-Net) is trained to learn dexterous grasp principles and predict grasp parameters, employing an attention mechanism and a graph convolutional neural network module to fuse multimodal information. The proposed adaptive dexterous grasping method can detect feasible grasp parameters from an RGB-D image of a grasp scene and then optimize grasp parameters based on multimodal sensing data when the dexterous hand touches a target object. Various experiments in both simulation and physical grasps indicate that our ADG-Net grasping method outperforms state-of-the-art grasping methods, achieving an average success rate of 92% for grasping isolated unseen objects and 83% for stacked objects.

This article proposes a prior knowledge-embedded dual feedback spatial-temporal graph convolutional network (DFSTGCN) for skidding assessment. Unlike existing adjacency matrix construction strategies, the correlation between multisource signals is described based on multiple prior knowledge, which includes dynamic model, structural dynamics, and expert experience. Furthermore, a DFSTGCN is designed to simultaneously focus on the spatial and temporal dependencies of time-varying skidding data.

A scenario involving encoding and decoding of the system output is explored before discussing the general scenario involving encoding and decoding of both the system output and control input. Unlike existing schemes, the two scenarios require no additional scaling parameter in the encoder and decoder. The radius of the support sphere is designed to vary over the iterations, and the learning control scheme is based on the output of the decoder.

However, the existing DNN watermarking methods are vulnerable to model extraction attacks since the watermark task and the original model task are independent. In this article, a novel collaborative DNN watermarking framework is proposed to defend against model extraction attacks by establishing cooperation between the watermark generation and embedding. Specifically, the trigger samples are not only imperceptible to ensure perceptual stealth security but also infused with target-label information to guide the following feature associations. In the process of watermark embedding, the feature representation of trigger samples is forced to be similar to that of the task distribution samples via feature coupling. Consequently, the trigger samples from our framework can be recognized in the stolen model as task distribution samples, so that the ownership of the model can be successfully verified. Extensive experiments on CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and ImageNet demonstrate the effectiveness and superior performance of the proposed watermarking framework against various model extraction attacks.},

One promising approach to improve efficiency is to perform simulation and build surrogates separately for each objective in parallel. However, how to improve the model accuracy and select promising candidates without global information are big challenges. To alleviate these problems, this article proposes an asynchronous influence-based SAEA (AIEA) based on the client-server model. Each client approximates an objective and the server takes charge for evolution. To adaptively select promising candidates, the influence degree is introduced in candidate selection, which is calculated in the objective space to judge which candidate has more beneficial influence for evolution. With the selected candidate, the most-uncertain-first strategy is devised in objective selection for asynchronous evaluations and model improvement. To handle incomplete objective values, the nearest neighbor inheritance is adopted for unevaluated objectives. Comprehensive experiments compared with five surrogate-assisted EAs demonstrate the global optimization and scalability of AIEA.},

  abstract     = {Multigranularity data analysis has recently become an active research topic in the intelligent computing and data mining fields. Feature selection via multigranularity data analysis is an effective tool for characterizing hierarchical data and enhancing the accuracy of the results. Although the multigranularity data analysis method has been widely adopted for feature selection, existing studies still present one prevalent disadvantage: multigranularity data analysis mostly focuses on information presented at a single granularity while ignoring the hierarchical structure of multigranularity data, which is contrary to the nature of multigranularity. Hence, this article proposes a multigranularity data analysis with a zentropy uncertainty measure for efficient and robust feature selection. Specifically, a consistent degree is first introduced to obtain optimal granularity combinations and establish an efficient neighborhood model for multigranularity information processing. Then, a novel and robust uncertainty measure is developed by integrating the multigranularity information, namely the zentropy-based measure. Considering its accuracy among uncertainty measures, two important measures are further designed and applied to feature selection. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve better robustness and classification performance than other state-of-the-art methods.},

Evolutionary algorithms are commonly used to solve complex bilevel problems in practical scenarios, but they face significant resource consumption challenges due to the nested structure imposed by the implicit lower-level optimality condition. This challenge becomes even more pronounced as problem dimensions increase. Although recent methods have enhanced bilevel convergence through task-level knowledge sharing, further efficiency improvements are still hindered by redundant lower-level iterations that consume excessive resources while generating unpromising solutions. To overcome this challenge, this article proposes an efficient dynamic resource allocation framework for evolutionary bilevel optimization, named DRC-BLEA. Compared to existing approaches, DRC-BLEA introduces a novel competitive quasi-parallel paradigm, in which multiple lower-level optimization tasks, derived from different upper-level individuals, compete for resources. A continuously updated selection probability is used to prioritize execution opportunities to promising tasks. Additionally, a cooperation mechanism is integrated within the competitive framework to further enhance efficiency and prevent premature convergence. Experimental results compared with chosen state-of-the-art algorithms demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Specifically, DRC-BLEA achieves competitive accuracy across diverse problem sets and real-world scenarios, while significantly reducing the number of function evaluations and overall running time.},

  abstract     = {Due to its property of not requiring prior knowledge of the environment, reinforcement learning (RL) has significant potential for solving quantum control problems. In this work, we investigate the effectiveness of continuous control policies based on deep deterministic policy gradient. To achieve good control of quantum systems with high fidelity, we propose an auxiliary task-based deep RL (AT-DRL) for quantum control. In particular, we design an auxiliary task to predict the fidelity value, sharing partial parameters with the main network (from the main RL task). The auxiliary task learns synchronously with the main task, allowing one to extract intrinsic features of the environment, thus aiding the agent to achieve the desired state with high fidelity. To further enhance the control performance, we also design a guided reward function based on the fidelity of quantum states that enables gradual fidelity improvement. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the proposed AT-DRL can provide a good solution to the exploration of quantum dynamics. It not only achieves high task fidelities but also demonstrates fast learning rates. Moreover, AT-DRL has great potential in designing control pulses that achieve effective quantum state preparation.},

  abstract     = {One challenge of learning from streaming data is that only a limited number of labeled examples are available, making semi-supervised learning (SSL) algorithms becoming an efficient tool for streaming data mining. Recently, the graph-based SSL algorithms have been proposed to improve SSL performance because the graph structure can utilize the interactivity between surrounding nodes. However, graph-based SSL algorithms have two main limitations when applied to streaming data. First, not all the labels of the data in the streaming data may be reliable, and direct classification using a graph can lead to suboptimal performance. Second, graph-based SSL algorithms assume the structure of the graph is static, but the learning environment of streaming data is dynamic. Hence, we propose a competence-aware graph neural network (CA-GNN) to deal with these two limitations. Unlike other models, CA-GNN does not directly rely on graph information that could include mislabeled nodes. Instead, a competence model is used to explore latent semantic correlations in the streaming data and capture the reliability for each data. A streaming learning strategy then evolves CA-GNN’s parameters to capture the dynamism of the graph sequences. We conducted experiments using seven real datasets and four synthetic datasets, respectively, and compared the outcomes across various methods. The results demonstrate that CA-GNN classifies streaming data more effectively than the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.},

First, the MAS dynamics are reformulated into a descriptor form, enabling an observer to simultaneously achieve state estimation and fault diagnosis. Using the estimation results, an adaptive FTC algorithm is developed to maintain the stability of MASs in the presence of concurrent faults, with control gains updated based on the observer consensus error.

This observer features practical prescribed-time convergence, and independence of prior knowledge of leader’s input. Then, an augmented system consisting of observer dynamics and follower dynamics is constructed and a cost function is formulated. Accordingly, the HiTL optimal output cluster synchronization control problem is transformed into a solution to the Hamilton-Jacobian–Bellman equation (HJBE). Subsequently, the off-policy reinforcement learning algorithm is utilized to learn the solution to HJBE without complete knowledge of the system dynamics. To alleviate computational burden, the single critic neural network (NN) is employed for the algorithm implementation, with the least square method applied for training the NN weights.

NMPC generates locally optimal control commands that adhere to vehicle dynamics constraints while following the designated trajectory. Following training on track maps with varying difficulty levels, the proposed controller successfully executes a superior policy compared to the guide policy, providing evidence of its effectiveness and scalability.

This resilient protocol against DoS attacks is fully distributed and does not require prior knowledge of network topology, making it scalable to large networks. Finally, an adaptive attack-resilient control scheme is introduced to counteract potential unbounded actuation attacks via output feedback, enabling each follower to track the positional states provided by the distributed estimators.

  abstract     = {While artificial intelligence (AI) technology has advanced in real-world applications, there is a strong motivation to develop hybrid systems where AI algorithms and humans collaborate, promoting more human-centered approaches in AI system design. This has led to the emergence of a novel human-machine computing (HMC) paradigm, which combines human cognitive abilities with machine computational power to create a collaborative computing framework that meets the demands of large-scale, complex tasks and enables human-machine symbiosis. Human processing units (HPUs) are crucial computing resources in HMC-oriented systems, and efficient HPU resource provisioning is key to boosting system performance. However, existing schemes often fail to assign tasks to the most suitable HPUs and optimize HPU utility, as they either cannot quantitatively measure skills or overlook utility concerns during task assignment and scheduling. To address these challenges, this article proposes a fine-grained HPU virtualization (FingHV) approach, which leverages virtualization techniques to improve flexibility, fairness, and utility in the provisioning process. The core idea is to use a tree-based skill model to precisely measure the levels and correlations of multiple skills within individual HPUs, and to apply a mixed time/event-based scheduling policy to maximize HPU utility. Specifically, we begin by proposing a hierarchical multiskill tree to model HPU skills and their correlations. Next, we formulate the HPU virtualization problem and present a fine-grained virtualization method, which includes a quality-driven HPU assignment process and a mixed time/event-based scheduling policy to improve resource-sharing efficiency. Finally, we evaluate FingHV on a synthetic dataset with varying task sizes and a real-world case. The results demonstrate that FingHV improves global matching quality by up to 39.7% and increases HPU utility by 11.2% compared to the baselines.},

The study employs Lagrangian coherent structure analysis to identify relative equilibrium configurations and develops an RL-based optimal control strategy for real-time formation reconfiguration.

  abstract     = {Integrating the advantage of the unbiased finite impulse response (UFIR) filter into the Kalman filter (KF) is a practical yet challenging issue, where how to effectively borrow knowledge across domains is a core issue. Existing methods often fall short in addressing performance degradation arising from noise uncertainties. In this article, we delve into a Bayesian transfer filter (BTF) that seamlessly integrates the UFIR filter into the KF through a knowledge-constrained mechanism. Specifically, the pseudo marginal measurement likelihood of the UFIR filter is reused as a constraint to refine the Bayesian posterior distribution in the KF. To optimize this process, we exploit the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence to measure and reduce discrepancies between the proposal and target distributions. This approach overcomes the limitations of traditional weight-based fusion methods and eliminates the need for error covariance. Additionally, a necessary condition based on mean square error criteria is established to prevent negative transfer. Using a moving target tracking example and a quadruple water tank experiment, we demonstrate that the proposed BTF offers superior robustness against noise uncertainties compared to existing methods.},

It should be emphasized that the utilization of triggering mechanism at the sensor side poses a challenge to the design of backstepping control, as it leads to nondifferentiable virtual control signals due to the discontinuous nature of the state/output signals received at the controller side. In contrast to existing methods, the proposed event triggering mechanism eliminates the need for computing virtual control signals at the sensor side before transmitting them to the controller side. By establishing the relationships of the corresponding variables in two communication scenarios (namely, without and with event triggering) and introducing dynamic filtering technique, the problem of nondifferentiable virtual control signals in backstepping design is solved. We present a numerical case study to validate the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed decentralized event triggered control approach.},

  abstract     = {Time-series classification (TSC) covers the supervised learning problem where input data is provided in the form of series of values observed through repeated measurements over time, and whose objective is to predict the category to which they belong. When the class values are ordinal, classifiers that take this into account can perform better than nominal classifiers. Time-series ordinal classification (TSOC) is the field bridging this gap, yet unexplored in the literature. There are a wide range of time-series problems showing an ordered label structure, and TSC techniques that ignore the order relationship discard useful information. Hence, this article presents the first benchmarking of TSOC methodologies, exploiting the ordering of the target labels to boost the performance of current TSC state of the art. Both convolutional- and deep-learning-based methodologies (among the best performing alternatives for nominal TSC) are adapted for TSOC. For the experiments, a selection of 29 ordinal problems has been made. In this way, this article contributes to the establishment of the state of the art in TSOC. The results obtained by ordinal versions are found to be significantly better than current nominal TSC techniques in terms of ordinal performance metrics, outlining the importance of considering the ordering of the labels when dealing with this kind of problems.},

  abstract     = {The 3-D point cloud has been widely used in many mobile application scenarios, including autonomous driving and 3-D sensing on mobile devices. However, existing 3-D point cloud models tend to be large and cumbersome, making them hard to deploy on edged devices due to their high memory requirements and nonreal-time latency. There has been a lack of research on how to compress 3-D point cloud models into lightweight models. In this article, we propose a method called T3DNet (tiny 3-D network with augmentation and distillation) to address this issue. We find that the tiny model after network augmentation is much easier for a teacher to distill. Instead of gradually reducing the parameters through techniques, such as pruning or quantization, we predefine a tiny model and improve its performance through auxiliary supervision from augmented networks and the original model. We evaluate our method on several public datasets, including ModelNet40, ShapeNet, and ScanObjectNN. Our method can achieve high compression rates without significant accuracy sacrifice, achieving state-of-the-art performances on three datasets against existing methods. Amazingly, our T3DNet is $58\times $ smaller and $54\times $ faster than the original model yet with only 1.4% accuracy descent on the ModelNet40 dataset.

  abstract     = {When applied to autonomous vehicle (AV) settings, action recognition can enhance an environment model’s situational awareness. This is especially prevalent in scenarios where traditional geometric descriptions and heuristics in AVs are insufficient. However, action recognition has traditionally been studied for humans, and its limited adaptability to noisy, un-clipped, un-pampered, raw RGB data has limited its application in other fields. To push for the advancement and adoption of action recognition into AVs, this work proposes a novel two-stage action recognition system, termed RALACs. RALACs formulates the problem of action recognition for road scenes, and bridges the gap between it and the established field of human action recognition. This work shows how attention layers can be useful for encoding the relations across agents, and stresses how such a scheme can be class-agnostic. Furthermore, to address the dynamic nature of agents on the road, RALACs constructs a novel approach to adapting Region of Interest (ROI) alignment to agent tracks for downstream action classification. Finally, our scheme also considers the problem of active agent detection, and utilizes a novel application of fusing optical flow maps to discern relevant agents in a road scene. We show that our proposed scheme can outperform the baseline on the ICCV2021 Road Challenge dataset (Singh et al., 2023) algorithm and by deploying it on a real vehicle platform, we provide preliminary insight to the usefulness of action recognition in decision making.

However, most existing approaches addressing this problem are applicable only to single- or double-integrator dynamics, which are often impractical in real-world scenarios. In this article, an angle rigidity-based adaptive formation control framework is introduced for nonlinear multiagent systems subject to mismatched uncertainties. The proposed control framework integrates a prescribed performance control approach with a recursive backstepping procedure, offering several key advantages: the capability to handle unmatched system uncertainties, the preservation of angle rigidity throughout the formation process, and the assurance that the triangulated formation shape is asymptotically achieved without risking collisions between neighboring agents. Furthermore, since the control input of each agent only requires local information related to its neighbors, which can be obtained locally from its own sensors, the proposed control method can be deployed in a communication-free environment. The effectiveness of the proposed control algorithms is validated by extensive numerical simulation.},

Existing single-agent multimodal fusion approaches are limited by their inability to leverage additional sensory data from nearby agents. In this article, we present the collaborative multimodal fusion network (CMMFNet) for distributed perception in multiagent systems. CMMFNet first extracts modality-specific features from LiDAR point clouds and camera images for each agent using dual-stream neural networks. To overcome the ambiguity in-depth prediction, we introduce a collaborative depth supervision module that projects dense fused point clouds onto image planes to generate more accurate depth ground truths. We then present modality-aware fusion strategies to aggregate homogeneous features across agents while preserving their distinctive properties. To align heterogeneous LiDAR and camera features, we introduce a modality consistency learning method. Finally, a transformer-based fusion module dynamically captures cross-modal correlations to produce a unified representation. Comprehensive evaluations on two extensive multiagent perception datasets, OPV2V and V2XSet, affirm the superiority of CMMFNet in detection performance, establishing a new benchmark in the field.},

  abstract     = {As a primary effector of humans, the hand plays a crucial role in many aspects of daily life. Recognizing multidegree-of-freedom hand movements from muscle activity helps infer human motion intentions. Solving this problem has direct applications in prosthetic and exoskeleton control. Here, we propose a self-supervised learning algorithm inspired by muscle synergies to achieve simultaneous estimation of wrist rotation (supination/pronation) and hand grasp (open/close) from sonomyography—the muscle deformation detected by a wearable ultrasound array. Unlike conventional methods collecting both muscle activity and hand kinematics for supervised model calibration, this algorithm only uses unlabeled forearm ultrasound signals for self-supervised wrist and hand movement estimation, where movement labels are auto-generated. The performance of the proposed algorithm was experimentally evaluated with ten participants including an amputee. Offline analysis demonstrated that the proposed algorithm can accurately estimate simultaneous wrist rotation and hand grasp movements ( $r_{\textrm {wrist}}$ and $r_{\textrm {hand}}$ were 0.98 and 0.94 for the able-bodied, and 0.98 and 0.90 for the amputee, respectively). Notably, the performance of the self-supervised learning was superior to the supervised learning for the amputee. Online experiments demonstrated that intended wrist and hand movements can be deciphered in real time, enabling accurate control of a virtual hand. This study will open up a new avenue for the sonomyographic human-machine interaction.},

  abstract     = {A primary challenge in robotic tool use is achieving precise manipulation with dexterous robotic hands to mimic human actions. It requires understanding human tool use and allocating specific functions to each robotic finger for fine control. Existing work has primarily focused on the overall grasping capabilities of robotic hands, often neglecting the functional allocation among individual fingers during object interaction. In response to this, we introduce a semantic knowledge-driven approach to distribute functions among fingers for tool manipulation. Central to this approach is the finger-to-function (F2F) knowledge graph, which captures human expertise in tool use and establishes relationships between tool attributes, tasks, and manipulation elements, including functional fingers, components, required force, and gestures. We also develop a manipulation element-oriented prediction algorithm using knowledge graph semantic embedding, enhancing the prediction of manipulation elements’ speed and accuracy. Additionally, we propose the functionality-integrated adaptive force feedback manipulation (FAFM) module, which integrates manipulation elements with adaptive force feedback to achieve precise finger-level control. Our framework does not rely on extensive annotated data for supervision but utilizes semantic constraints from F2F to guide tool manipulation. The proposed method demonstrates superior performance and generalizability in real-world scenarios, achieving an 8% higher success rate in grasping and manipulation of representative tool instances compared to the existing state-of-the-art methods. The dataset and code are available at https://github.com/yangfan293/F2F.},

First, a fully distributed asynchronous event-triggered compensator for each agent is proposed to act as a virtual reference generator without using global information. Second, based on this compensator, a distributed event-triggered controller for each heterogeneous agent is developed to reach output consensus. Specifically, to save resources and guarantee asymptotic consensus, a modified dynamic event-triggered mechanism (DETM) is proposed, in which a time-triggered mechanism (TTM) is introduced to ensure the existence of a positive minimum interevent time and a DETM is designed to further avoid redundant triggering actions. Besides, the triggering condition of the DETM does not require continuous detection, it is only detected when the timer variable in the TTM deceases from maximum value to zero. These features of the developed control scheme are presented analytically and verified numerically.},

  abstract     = {Underactuated systems are a class of systems in which the number of control inputs is less than the degrees of freedom (DoFs) to be controlled. With the increasing demand for the control performance of underactuated systems, the current research on their optimization of steady-state performance is no longer sufficient. However, owing to limited control inputs, ensuring their transient performance is often difficult. Moreover, some specific composite variables in underactuated systems should be kept within the preset ranges, which poses a significant challenge to collision avoidance safety. In addition, the sensor noises are also an issue that cannot be ignored. To this end, an extended Kalman filtering-based nonlinear model predictive control method for underactuated systems is developed in this article. The key feature of this method is that it simultaneously ensures accurate positioning, multiple constraints, and obstacle avoidance. Specifically, by adding an artificial potential field as an obstacle avoidance penalty term in the cost function and dynamically assigning weight coefficients, efficient collision avoidance control is achieved. Furthermore, it is combined with the extended Kalman filtering and jointly applied to underactuated systems with sensor noises. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first control method that simultaneously considers full-state constraints, specific composite variable constraints, control input and its increment constraints, as well as obstacle avoidance in underactuated systems. The satisfactory control performance of the proposed method is validated by implementing it on two typical underactuated systems, that is, four-DoF overhead cranes and five-DoF tower cranes.},

To reduce design costs, a joint neural network Luenberger observer (NNLO) structure is established by using neural network and input/output data of the system to identify unknown system dynamics and sensor faults online. To achieve the optimal secure tracking control, an augmented tracking system is formed by integrating the dynamics of tracking error, reference trajectory, and filter output. Then, a novel cost function is designed for the augmented tracking system, which employs the fault estimation and the discount factor. The Hamilton-Jacobi–Bellman equation is solved to obtain the CLSTC strategy through an adaptive critic structure with cooperative tuning laws. Besides, the Lyapunov stability theorem is utilized to prove that all signals of the closed-loop system converge to a small neighborhood of the equilibrium point.

This work addresses this issue through a novel fast retraining strategy that enhances applicability of the MPI-based ITL. Specifically, during each retraining epoch, a random layer freezing protocol is utilized to manage the number of layers undergoing feature refinement. Additionally, this work incorporates an MPI-based approach for refining the trainable parameters of FC layers under batch processing, contributing to expedited convergence. Extensive experiments on several ImageNet pretrained benchmark DCNNs demonstrate that the proposed ITL achieves competitive performance with excellent convergence speed compared to conventional ITL methods. For instance, the proposed strategy converges nearly 1.5 times faster than retraining the ImageNet pretrained ResNet-50 using stochastic gradient descent with momentum (SGDM).},

  abstract     = {Intelligent anomaly detection (AD) methods have achieved much successes in machinery condition monitoring. However, the underlying independent and identically distributed assumption restricts their application scopes to steady operating conditions. False and missing alarms would occur when machines operate under time-varying circumstances. In this work, a more challenging time-varying setting is studied, where the working conditions are continuously changing, such that few or no samples are available for model training at one single condition. To tackle this issue, we propose a unified flowing normality learning (UFNL) framework, which aims to capture the flowing normal conditional distribution of time-varying samples and assigns dynamic decision boundary for AD. Specifically, a manifold-based probability density estimation is utilized to guide the adversarial learning process of generative adversarial networks, where adjacent samples are aggregated to approximate the conditional distribution by a conditional generator. Then, a latent normality inversion is proposed to extract the manifold structure from the pretrained generator and to map it into the latent space via a conditional encoder. The reconstruction errors from the encoder and generator can reveal the deviation of signals to the flowing normality. Finally, a condition-aware adaptive threshold selection strategy is proposed, where different thresholds are adaptively assigned for different conditions. Experiments are carried out under two typical continuous time-varying scenarios. The results demonstrate that the proposed framework can realize accurate fault detection at any operating condition within continuously changing environments.},

  abstract     = {The widely adopted Jacobi-Fourier moment (JFM) is limited by its inability to effectively capture spatial information. Although fractional-order JFM (FOJFM) introduces spatial information through a fractional-order parameter, the control of spatial information remains inadequate. This limitation stems from the insufficient control over zeros distribution associated with the used moment’s radial kernel. To address this issue, we generalize both JFM and FOJFM into a transformed JFM. A transformed function with four parameters is designed, and adjustable JFM (AJFM) is proposed. Two parameters correlate to increasing velocities on the left and right parts of the transformed functions, enabling zeros quantities of radial kernel fall in the left and right parts of the interval. The other two parameters segment the transformed function, adjusting regions where different quantities of zeros fall in. This refined control over the radial kernel’s zero distribution enhances the versatility of feature extraction by the AJFM, governed by the introduced parameters. Experimental results demonstrate that AJFM, with properly chosen parameters, can emphasize specific regions within an image more effectively.},

This circuit, characterized by a reduced number of trainable parameters, shows increased resilience to overfitting, thereby offering a significant advantage at the parameter level for few-shot learning algorithms.

The state feedback and output feedback controllers are designed, respectively. For output feedback control, an extended state observer is designed to estimate system states. Once the HOFAS model is established, the designed controller and extended state observer can be directly implemented, facilitating the analysis and design of the control system.

Second, by using time-varying Lyapunov function techniques, sufficient conditions for exponential stability of a class of linear impulsive systems are established; subsequently, these stability results are applied for the distributed impulsive observer design. Different from the existing related works, the impulsive observer gain designed in this work is decoupled from the graph properties. As a result, once the impulsive observer gain is designed for one network topology, it can be directly used for other network topologies, as long as the graph properties and the dynamics of local agents satisfy certain conditions. Furthermore, the resilience of the designed protocol is tested under denial of service (DoS) attacks. It is shown that the protocol is robust with respect to low-frequency DoS attacks occurring in the observer communication network.

Specifically, we develop a deep contrastive subspace clustering module to enhance the learning of both self-expressive coefficients and cluster representations simultaneously. This approach enables the derivation of relatively noiseless self-expressive similarities and cluster-based similarities. To enable interaction between these two types of similarities, we propose a unique grouping belief-based affinity refinement module.

The aim of this article is to address the strong coupling disturbance problem in the AMS through precise coupling disturbance modeling and compensation. First, considering the rapid changes in the center of mass (CoM) and the moment of inertia (MoI) of the system under a highly dynamic scenario, this article delves into the generation mechanism of the coupling disturbances and models them based on the variable inertia parameters. The proposed precise coupling disturbance model (CDM) makes good use of the state information of the system, which enables one to achieve accurate estimation of the coupling disturbances without the aid of external force and torque sensors. With the proposed model, the strong coupling disturbances in the AMS are compensated in a feedforward way during the controller design process. An indoor AMS experimental platform is developed for validation purposes. The experiments and simulation are conducted in a highly dynamic scenario, involving rapid movements of the manipulator across a large range. The experimental and simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed method for suppressing the strong coupling disturbances.},

A new estimator is developed in this study to address the issue by combining EID estimators in a unique cascade form. The sensitivity reduction of a cascade EID (CEID) estimator with p levels, which is related to disturbance rejection, is p times larger than that of a standard EID estimator at low frequencies. Meanwhile, the Bode magnitude curve of the transfer function related to noise suppression is shifted up only by $20\lg p$ dB at high frequencies compared to that of a standard one. This improves disturbance-rejection performance and prevents measurement noise from being over-amplified. The design of a CEID estimator-based control system is provided and the stability criterion of the system is derived.

The dynamical analysis explores internal evolution and complexity performance concerning a single factor or double factors among the FO, system parameter, and memristor configuration by the Bifurcation diagram, sample entropy, and $C_{0}$ complexity from multiple perspectives. Subsequently, a neural-adaptive prescribed-time control scheme is proposed to transform detrimental chaotic oscillations into orderly motions, achieve the pregiven tracking precision and accommodating both actuator fault and system uncertainty. The controller design consists of three key steps: 1) a deferred constraint function is imposed on the tracking error starting from anywhere to get assignable tracking precision within a specified time, ensuring collision avoidance; 2) a type-2 fuzzy wavelet neural network (FWNN) is utilized effectively to handle parameter perturbations and system uncertainties; and 3) a second-order FO tracking differentiator (TD) is utilized to address the “explosion of complexity” of traditional backstepping under actuator fault model.

Examining the generation process in the model highlights how the motor cue, representing implicit motor information hidden within brain activities, modulates the interaction between brain and muscle systems. The proposed model employs a two-stage generation process to bridge the semantic gap in cross-modal signals. Initially, the shared movement-related information between EEG and EMG signals is extracted using a contrastive learning framework. These shared representations act as conditional vectors in the subsequent EMG generation stage based on generative adversarial networks (GANs). Experiments on a self-collected multimodal electrophysiological signal data set show the algorithm’s superiority over existing time series generative methods in cross-modal EMG generation. Further insights derived from the model’s inference process underscore the brain’s strategy for muscle control during movements.

Thereafter, the acquired mode functions are utilized to construct the multivariate fusion covariance matrix (MFCM), which retains the linkage of signals from different channels. Finally, MFCM is fed into the standard autoencoder to form the MFCMN network, which is applied to implement multichannel fault diagnosis. To assess effectiveness, the MFCMN is compared with the deep residual network (ResNet), convolutional neural network (CNN), long short-term memory (LSTM), and K-nearest neighbor (KNN) in two experimental cases with fewer training samples. The results clarify that the MFCMN offers excellent performance and high accuracy in multichannel fault diagnosis.},

  abstract     = {This article investigates the tracking control problem of heterogeneous multiagent systems (MASs) with intrinsic nonlinear dynamics in noisy and time-delayed environments. First, a stability criterion for nonlinear stochastic delay systems with multiplicative noise and time-varying delay is proposed by applying the appropriate Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional. Then, based on the proposed stability criterion, sufficient conditions are derived for mean square (m.s.) and almost sure (a.s.) tracking of heterogeneous MASs with intrinsic nonlinear dynamics. Afterward, the above sufficient conditions further degenerate to integrator heterogeneous MASs. In particular, when the time-delay vanishes, the explicit conditions are obtained for the integrator heterogeneous MASs in the form of scalar inequalities, which can intuitively reflect the relationship between noise intensity and control gains. Finally, simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed control protocol.},

  abstract     = {Broad learning system (BLS) is an effective neural network requiring no deep architecture, however it is somehow fragile to noisy data. The previous robust broad models directly map features from the raw data, which inevitably learn useless or even harmful features for data representation when the inputs are corrupted by noise and outliers. To address this concern, a discriminative and robust network named as dynamic graph regularized broad learning (DGBL) with marginal fisher representation is proposed for noisy data classification. Different from the previous works, DGBL eliminates the effect of noise before the random feature mapping by the proposed robust and dynamic marginal fisher analysis (RDMFA) algorithm. The RDMFA is able to extract more robust and informative representations for classification from the latent clean data space with dynamically generated graphs. Furthermore, the dynamic graphs learned from RDMFA are incorporated as regularization terms into the objective of DGBL to enhance the discrimination capacity of the proposed network. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments conducted on numerous benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed model compared to several state-of-the-art methods.},

In the network layer, both the defender and the attacker allocate energy over multiple channels. Considering the impact of switching characteristic in the physical layer on the network layer, a dynamic regulating factor is proposed to adjust the total energy of the defender. To optimize the signal-to-interference-noise ratio and energy consumption simultaneously at each player’s side, a multiobjective game problem is formulated. Furthermore, a nondominated sorting genetic algorithm framework is employed, incorporating the knee point selection mechanism to attain the Pareto-Nash equilibrium, based on which the optimal defense strategy can be derived to achieve resilience against DoS attacks. In the physical-layer, taking the dynamic packet loss caused by DoS attacks and external disturbance into account, an $H_{\infty }$ minimax controller containing control inputs and the switching signal is designed to guarantee the optimal performance for NSSs through the dynamic game-theoretic approach. Finally, the networked continuous stirred tank reactor system is provided to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {This article presents attractor-transition control of complex biological networks represented by Boolean networks (BNs) wherein the BN is steered from a prescribed initial attractor toward a desired one. The proposed approach leverages the similarity between attractors and Boolean algebraic properties embedded in the underlying state transition equations. To enhance the clarity of expression regarding stabilization toward the desired attractor, a simple coordinate transformation is performed on the considered BN. Based on the characteristics of transformed state equations, self-stabilizing state variables requiring no control efforts are derived in the first. Next, by applying the feedback vertex set (FVS) control scheme, control inputs stabilizing the remaining state variables are determined. The proposed control scheme exhibits versatility by accommodating both fixed-point and cyclic attractors. We validate the effectiveness of the proposed strategy through extensive numerical experiments conducted on random BNs as well as complex biological systems.

  abstract     = {The cooperative nature of drone swarms poses risks in the smooth operation of services and the security of national facilities. The control objective of the swarm is, in most cases, occluded due to the complex behaviors observed in each drone. It is paramount to understand which is the control objective of the swarm, whilst understanding better how they communicate with each other to achieve the desired task. To solve these issues, this article proposes a physics-informed multiagent inverse reinforcement learning (PI-MAIRL) that: 1) infers the control objective function or reward function from observational data and 2) uncover the network topology by exploiting a physics-informed model of the dynamics of each drone. The combined contribution enables to understand better the behavior of the swarm, whilst enabling the inference of its objective for experience inference and imitation learning. A physically uncoupled swarm scenario is considered in this study. The incorporation of the physics-informed element allows to obtain an algorithm that is computationally more efficient than model-free IRL algorithms. Convergence of the proposed approach is verified using Lyapunov recursions on a global Riccati equation. Simulation studies are carried out to show the benefits and challenges of the approach.},

First of all, fuzzy logic systems (FLSs) are utilized to approximate the unknown nonlinear functions. Then, a novel switching observer is constructed to observe the leader’s state and handle DoS attacks. With the help of the exponent-dependent barrier Lyapunov functions (BLFs), the system output can be constrained within a preset region. Based on dynamic surface control (DSC) technique, the issue of computational complexity can be effectively avoided. Combining the designed switching observer and relative thresholds, a robust fuzzy adaptive event-triggered controller is developed, which ensures that the consensus output tracking errors converge to a small neighborhood of zero, and all signals in the closed-loop system keep bounded. Moreover, Zeno behavior can be avoided. Ultimately, simulation results are given to validate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed control strategy and theory.},
