  abstract     = {Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) constitutes the foremost provider for geo-localization in a growing number of consumer-grade applications and services supporting urban mobility. Therefore, low-cost and ultra-low-cost, embedded GNSS receivers have become ubiquitous in mobile devices such as smartphones and consumer electronics to a large extent. However, limited sky visibility and multipath scattering induced in urban areas hinder positioning and navigation capabilities, thus threatening the quality of position estimates. This work leverages the availability of raw GNSS measurements in ultra-low-cost smartphone chipsets and the ubiquitous connectivity provided by modern, low-latency network infrastructures to enable a Cooperative Positioning (CP) framework. A Proof Of Concept is presented that aims at demonstrating the feasibility of a GNSS-only CP among networked smartphones embedding ultra-low-cost GNSS receivers. The test campaign presented in this study assessed the feasibility of a client-server approach over 4G/LTE network connectivity. Results demonstrated an overall service availability above 80%, and an average accuracy improvement over the 40% w.r.t. to the GNSS standalone solution.},

This paper proposes low-complexity DCMA systems by leveraging low-projection (LP) codebooks and the LP message passing algorithm (LP-MPA) detector. Specifically, high-dimensional codebooks are constructed in a scalable manner based on distinct LP constellations and pre-designed constellation permutations. In addition, the message propagation of the MPA detector for the proposed LP codebooks is analyzed, and the low-complexity LP-MPA is introduced for multi-user detection.

We further analyze the theoretical symbol error rate (SER) expressions of the proposed CSC-3DNCEC-$\bm M$-DCSK system over the additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel and the multipath Rayleigh fading channel.

  abstract     = {While deep learning (DL) has made notable progress in addressing complex radio access network control challenges, DL has shown limitations in solving constrained NP-hard problems often encountered in network optimization. Moreover, even minor changes in communication objectives demand time-consuming retraining, limiting their adaptability to dynamic environments where task objectives, constraints, environmental factors, and communication scenarios frequently change. To address these challenges, we propose a large language model for resource allocation optimizer (LLM-RAO), a novel approach that harnesses the capabilities of LLMs to address the complex resource allocation problem while adhering to QoS constraints. By employing a prompt-based tuning strategy to flexibly convey ever-changing task descriptions and requirements to the LLM, LLM-RAO demonstrates robust performance and seamless adaptability in dynamic environments without requiring extensive retraining. Simulation results reveal that LLM-RAO achieves up to a 40% performance enhancement compared to conventional DL methods and up to an 80% improvement over analytical approaches. Moreover, in scenarios with fluctuating communication objectives, LLM-RAO attains up to 2.9 times the performance of traditional DL-based networks.},

The intrusion detection system (IDS) could be implemented in vehicles to monitor malicious traffic behavior through deep packet inspections. However, the limited capacity of in-vehicle IDS makes inspecting all the incoming packets challenging. Instead, in-network IDS near the network edge could be utilized to support packet inspection during packet propagation. In this paper, we propose a traffic sampling method for packet inspection at IDS in hybrid vehicular networks, leveraging the trade-off between the probability of successful packet inspection and inspection delay. Based on the trade-off relation model, the proposed method decides the sampling rate at the software-defined networking (SDN)-enabled switches. With an appropriate adjustment of the control parameters of the proposed method, the simulation results show that the proposed method efficiently provides successful packet inspection for dynamically changing vehicular networks.},

Specifically, a wavenumber-embedding pre-processing step is designed to capture the clustered sparsity of propagating waves, forming an image-like structure by incorporating evanescent waves. To further enhance estimation accuracy, we introduce a multi-head channel attention module (MCAM) to improve noise extraction on the propagating wave components while limiting noise propagation to the evanescent wave components. Numerical results demonstrate that WDANet not only outperforms benchmark schemes but also exhibits robust generalization across diverse propagation environments.},

By incorporating scaling coefficients that bridge the gap between theoretical communication rates and actual spectral efficiency based on the modulation and coding schemes (MCS) of each user, the proposed method maximizes real communication rates by optimizing precoding vectors and estimating scaling coefficients jointly. With fixed scaling coefficients, we first design an efficient algorithm for optimal precoders, which is surprisingly almost the same as the pure WMMSE. Due to the implicitness of the scaling coefficients, we then estimate these coefficients by minimizing the error vector magnitude (EVM) of all users, which is solved by Bayesian optimization due to the black box nature of the mapping between these coefficients and EVM. Simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over existing benchmarks.},

  abstract     = {In this correspondence, we propose a graph-based distributed hybrid beamforming scheme for downlink multi-user communications in low earth orbit (LEO) multi-satellite networks. Firstly, we model a reconfigurable holographic surface (RHS)-empowered downlink multi-user satellite-terrestrial communication system, where multiple LEO satellites are collectively integrated into a space multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) transmitter to coherently transmit data streams to multiple terrestrial user terminals (UTs). Secondly, we formulate a weighted sum rate (WSR) maximization problem, subject to individual transmit power constraints. To address it, a graph-based scheme is developed for the joint optimization of analog and digital beamforming in a distributed manner. Finally, the proposed scheme is extended to support phased array systems. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme significantly outperforms conventional methods such as minimum mean square error (MMSE), zero forcing (ZF), and maximum ratio transmission (MRT), with the phased array configuration achieving a higher WSR than the RHS.},

  abstract     = {This study proposes an efficient approach for the robust covertness of hybrid active-passive simultaneously transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surface (STAR-RIS)-based rate splitting multiple access (RSMA) systems. Under Rician fading channels, we first derive the closed-form expression for the detection error probability (DEP) that an eavesdropper monitors proximate users' covert information, then establish the approximated optimal DEP for the worst-case scenario, and finally treat it as a strict constraint for system security design. Specifically, the non-convex optimization problem of determining the power allocation (PA) resource to maximize the covert rate is tackled by transforming it into two tractable sub-optimization problems. We exploit the analyses of the developed DEP to derive closed-form solutions for the PA coefficients in each sub-problem, which are solved using an iterative algorithm with relatively low computational complexity. Extending this for the general case of double covert signal transmission, we also formulate and address the problem of jointly optimizing the resource power and rate allocation to maximize the minimal transmission rates among users. Besides the efficacy of the proposed approaches, some key findings can be achieved as follows: 1) RSMA achieves a higher DEP than NOMA; 2) Optimizing the PA resource boosts the achievable covert rate up to 1.3 bits/s/Hz for all STAR-RIS modes when the transmit power is larger than 20 dBm; and 3) Using hybrid mode helps flexibly adjust the number of STAR-RIS elements to gain the best performance with active mode at high transmission power and passive mode at lower power.},

Applying ROMA to high-speed rail (HSR) wireless communications can significantly improve system performance in terms of array gain and spatial multiplexing. However, the rapidly changing channel conditions in HSR scenarios present challenges for ROMA configuration. In this correspondence, we propose an analytical framework for configuring ROMA-based extremely large-scale multiple-input-multiple-output (XL-MIMO) systems in HSR scenarios based on spatial correlation. First, we develop a localization model based on a mobility-aware near-field beam training algorithm to determine the real-time position of the train relay antennas. Next, we derive the expression for channel orthogonality and antenna spacing based on the spatial correlation matrix, and obtain the optimal antenna spacing when the transceiver arrays are aligned in parallel. Moreover, we propose an optimization algorithm for the rotation angle of the transceiver arrays, leveraging the differential evolution method, to determine the optimal angles. Finally, numerical results are provided to validate the computational results and optimization algorithm.},

The joint pattern and data detector (JPDD) design is critical for these schemes, but the current JPDD algorithm has high complexity with quadratic computational costs. To address this, we propose a low-complexity detector based on approximate message passing (AMP), which offers linear complexity, providing reduced cost and improved performance in the under-determined linear regression case. Decoding is initialized via pilot-free matrix factorization through alternating minimization, resolving phase and scalar ambiguities. Compared to existing pilot-free schemes, the proposed method achieves a 13 dB improvement and favorable trade-offs in complexity and capacity performance when compared to benchmarks.},

However, existing solutions are often computationally intensive, limiting their practicality in multi-input multi-output (MIMO) orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) ISAC deployments. This paper presents a novel low-complexity algorithm leveraging the augmented Lagrangian method (ALM) and Riemannian conjugate gradient (RCG) optimization techniques to address these challenges. The proposed algorithm achieves superior sidelobe suppression compared to state-of-the-art methods while dramatically reducing computational complexity, making it highly suitable for real-world MIMO-OFDM ISAC systems. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach not only outperforms existing benchmarks in sidelobe reduction but also accelerates convergence, ensuring efficient performance across communication and sensing tasks.},

  abstract     = {Exceptional hybrid-field channel estimation is crucial for providing accurate channel state information in extremely large-scale massive MIMO (XL-MIMO) systems, as channels are likely to involve both far- and near-field components. However, existing approaches, resorting to the use of channel sparsity, depend heavily on prior information about the proportion of far- and near-field paths in different sparse basis. To address this challenge, we propose an innovative hybrid-field channel estimation scheme based on an elaborating orthogonal least squares (OLS)-framework algorithm, which unifies the estimation into angular domain, thereby eliminating this potential dependence. Specially, a multiple block simultaneous OLS (MBSOLS) is first designed incorporating a multiple selection mechanism for reducing iterations, which can jointly utilize the simultaneously- and block-sparse channel characteristics. Meanwhile, the theoretical guarantees of MBSOLS in terms of the upper bound of reconstruction error are developed by employing mutual incoherence property (MIP). Based on these algorithmic outcomes, a fast MBSOLS (F-MBSOLS) algorithm is further elaborated via a sharp inverse matrix approximation formulation, substantiating the low-complexity feasibility of the proposed scheme. The hybrid-field channel is then efficiently estimated by F-MBSOLS in angular domain uniformly, regardless of additional prior information. Simulation results demonstrate that the elaborating scheme achieves outstanding accuracy under different hybrid-field structures, and remarkably low computational complexity to fulfill the demand of delay-sensitive vehicular communication.},

As such, the channels between multiple access points (APs) and user equipments (UEs) can be reconfigured to create more favorable channel conditions. To minimize the maximum transmit power of APs in the considered network, a non-convex problem is formulated by jointly optimizing the transmit beamforming and MA positions. Then, we propose a dynamic neighborhood pruning particle swarm optimization (DNPPSO) algorithm to solve this problem efficiently. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme with MAs can significantly reduce the transmit power consumption in cell-free networks compared to benchmarks with FPAs by exploiting the degrees of freedom (DoFs) in antenna position optimization.},

However, the multi-user detection (MUD) method for single measurement vector (SMV) models in GF-NOMA still poses challenges due to its low accuracy and high computational complexity. This paper studies the improvement space of iterative reweighted (IR) detectors and proposes two aspects of improvement, error performance optimization and runtime optimization. In terms of error performance, the convergence of regularization parameters is introduced to solve the problem of not being able to approach optimal performance when the regularization parameters are fixed. In terms of running time, firstly, based on the conjugate gradients (CG) iterative method, IR-CG improves the accuracy of IR-based MUD by replacing the fixed regularization parameters with variable ones to avoid overfitting of noise, and also accelerates the iteration convergence with conjugate gradient. Subsequently, based on the preconditioned conjugate gradient (PCG) method, IR-PCG improves the computational efficiency of IR-CG with the help of the incomplete Choleski decomposition to make the coefficient matrix with higher condition number and sparsity property. Simulation results show that the improved IR detector proposed in this paper, by combining two improvement measures, not only slightly improves the error performance, but also significantly shortens the time required for the detector to operate.},

Considering the advantage of tensor structure, the received signal is constructed as a third-order complex-valued parallel factor (PARAFAC) model. Then, a Bayesian inference scheme combining tensor rearrangement and real-valued pre-processing is proposed, which obtains directions of departure (DoDs) and directions of arrival (DoAs) by fitting an optimized tensor model.

However, existing methods designed for two-dimensional radio maps face challenges of high measurement costs and limited data availability when extended to 3D scenarios. To tackle these challenges, we first build a real-world large-scale 3D radio map dataset, covering over 4.2 million $\text{{m}}^{3}$ and over 4 thousand data points in complex urban environments. We propose a Gaussian Process Regression-based scheme for 3D radio map estimation, allowing us to realize more accurate map recovery with a lower RMSE than state-of-the-art schemes by over 2.5 dB. To further enhance data efficiency, we propose two methods for training point selection, including an offline clustering-based method and an online maximum a posterior (MAP)-based method. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed scheme not only achieves full-map recovery with only 2% of UAV measurements, but also sheds light on future studies on 3D radio maps.},

However, existing compressed sensing (CS)-based WSS methods require high sampling rates and power consumption, particularly with high-precision analog-to-digital converters (ADCs). Although 1-bit CS with low-precision ADCs can mitigate these demands, most approaches still depend on multi-user cooperation and prior sparsity information, which are often unavailable in WSS scenarios. This paper introduces a non-cooperative WSS method using multicoset sampling with 1-bit ADCs to achieve sub-Nyquist sampling. We analyze the impact of 1-bit quantization on multiband signals, then apply eigenvalue decomposition to isolate the signal subspace from noise, enabling spectrum support estimation without signal reconstruction. The proposed method can efficiently estimate the support of the occupied spectrum without the prior information on sparsity order.},

The moving interaction station (MIS) is proposed to provide the sensing-assisted and wireless charging service for the AAV. The radio knowledge map (RKM) is introduced to improve the communication and energy efficiency of the AAV-ISAC system. Then, a joint optimization problem is formulated to complete the data collection and upload task by adjusting the AAV trajectory and vehicle access. To address this problem, a deep point reinforcement learning (DPRL) algorithm is proposed, which contains an RPC network, an RKM network, and a decision-making module. Herein, the RPC and RKM networks are designed to merge and map the vehicle RPC and RKM into the action spaces. The decision-making module selects actions from the action spaces to optimize the AAV trajectory and vehicle access.

  abstract     = {Multi-antenna unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) networks can improve throughput by spatial multiplexing and UAVs dominant line-of-sight (LOS) connections, which will intensify interference and exacerbate user fluctuation. This paper proposes user-centric interference cooperation in multi-antenna UAV networks, where multi-antenna beamforming and joint transmission are performed among cooperative UAVs, and derives a semi-closed expression of the ergodic rate using stochastic geometry. Specifically, a dynamic UAV group with adjustable radius ${R}$ is organized for each user that forms a 3D conical region to guarantee seamless service, which provides spatial multiplexing freedom via cooperative multi-antenna beamforming to achieve interference mitigation. In addition, both signal power and inter-cluster interference power are approximated by Gamma distributions with appropriate parameters experiencing generic Nakagami-$m$ fading in air-to-ground (AtG) channel. Furthermore, zero-forcing (ZF) beamforming is adopted with equal power allocation among beams, which is across the distributed set of UAVs within the cluster and considering different antenna loading. Numerical results show that the average ergodic rate can achieve 86.01% gain compared to the uncoordinated single-cell multi-antenna UAV network when UAV density is ${100\mathrm{/km^{2}}}$ and UAV group radius ${R}$ is ${20\;\mathrm{m}}$. The optimal network parameters are investigated to maximize ergodic rate, thus providing guidelines for practical network configuration. For instance, when UAV density is $50\mathrm{/km^{2}}$ and loading factor is $K/M=2/16$, the optimal deployment altitude for UAVs is $ h=20\;{\rm m}$, which can achieve a rate gain of 144% compared to the case of $h=0\;\mathrm{m}$.},

This paper focuses on RSMA-based UAV networks, where the UAV serves mobile ground users (GUs). The main challenge is the random movement of GUs, which causes unpredictable changes in user locations and communication conditions. In this paper, we aim to minimize the UAV's total energy consumption while ensuring each GU meets its throughput requirement. To achieve this, we optimize the UAV's trajectory, RSMA common transmission rate, and power allocation. Due to the time-varying nature of user mobility and the non-convexity of the optimization problem, we apply Lyapunov optimization to convert it into a online weighted energy-throughput minimization problem for each time slot. By introducing virtual queues to represent throughput constraints, we balance UAV throughput and energy consumption. The online optimization problem is then decomposed into two subproblems: UAV trajectory design and RSMA common rate/power allocation, where we use successive convex approximation (SCA) to address the non-convex constraints. The simulation outcomes demonstrate that our proposed method considerably exceeds benchmark approaches, reducing the system's energy usage while fulfilling throughput requirements.},

In the mobile anchor scenario, we propose a tomography imaging method based on the W-combined (W-CB) model, which was developed through the analysis of the shift patterns in Channel Impulse Response (CIR) induced by the presence or absence of a target in the DW1000 module. This approach effectively mitigates the adverse effects of multipath interference on signal accuracy. Experimental verification in a warehouse environment demonstrates that, when applied to tomography imaging, the CIR shift-based W-CB model maintains a positioning error within 0.20 m in 99%, outperforming traditional ellipse weight models and methods that rely on the time of flight as an observation. Furthermore, it achieves higher accuracy when the distance between targets is minimal.},

  abstract     = {With the rapid development of technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI), vehicles could share their local data through the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) for better intelligent driving services. By sharing model knowledge rather than raw data, federated learning (FL) could effectively protect user data privacy. The combination of blockchain technology and FL provides a more secure sharing solution. However, the current blockchain enabled FL systems still face security threats, and have limited efficiency and scalability. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical blockchain enabled multi-region asynchronous swarm learning (HB-MASL) framework to achieve secure and efficient data sharing for IoVs. The HB-MASL divides the edge network into multiple regions to collaborate and parallelize FL-based knowledge sharing tasks to improve scalability while ensuring user privacy and data security. Empowered by the two-layer blockchain, the HB-MASL could achieve safe intra-regional and cross-regional knowledge sharing. Moreover, model compression technology and blockchain pruning technology are introduced to alleviate the communication and storage pressure of the system. In addition, we analyze the instantaneous communication rate based on vehicle mobility and derive the consensus confirmation latency of the blockchain. Based on this, a mathematical optimization problem for the total shared latency of the system is formulated, and a locally perceptual based two-step asynchronous sharing (LPTAS) algorithm is proposed to minimize the system latency. Finally, comprehensive simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithms could achieve better performance in terms of model accuracy, convergence rates, security and efficiency compared with existing algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Global navigation satellite system (GNSS) receiver clock modeling methods are extensively used to improve positioning accuracy and continuity. However, traditional receiver clock modeling-aided navigation solvers often fail to provide reliable positioning results in complex wireless environments, particularly under limited satellite visibility conditions. This limitation arises from two primary factors: the inadequate accuracy of receiver clock parameter modeling and the insufficient robustness of conventional navigation solvers in challenging operational scenarios. To address these issues, we propose a two-stage, data-driven, dual attention mechanism-enhanced temporal convolutional network (DAME-TCN) that improves the precision of receiver clock modeling. Additionally, we integrate this enhanced network into a factor graph optimization (FGO)-based navigation solver, ensuring robust and accurate positioning performance, even in highly complex wireless environments. The perceptual field size of the temporal convolution network (TCN) was adjusted according to feature lengths to improve memory capacity. Self-attention and soft-weighted attention mechanisms were used to improve the modeling capacity and prediction performance of the TCN for periodicity. Furthermore, the outcomes of the predictor are employed to impose constraints on the receiver clock state within the FGO framework. The clock prediction and positioning performance of DAME-TCN-based receivers were validated using data from the International GNSS Service, and an open-source localization dataset for urban canyon environments. The results demonstrate that the DAME-TCN can effectively predict the receiver clock and improve positioning accuracy and continuity when at least three satellites are visible.},

  abstract     = {The integration of air-ground integrated (AGI) networks and mobile edge computing (MEC) presents a promising direction to provide flexible computing services for diverse mobile terminals (MTs). However, a key challenge for AGI-MEC is how to cope with the time-varying and heterogeneous performance preferences of MTs while ensuring data security, which indicates a complex and multi-constrained multi-objective optimization problem. To address this problem, we propose an adaptive distributed multi-objective deep reinforcement learning (ADMODRL) algorithm. Firstly, an edge offloading training framework based on federated learning is developed, enabling agents to implicitly acquire global knowledge by sharing model parameters rather than local raw data. As a result, the framework ensures solving accuracy while preserving data privacy. Secondly, a locally trained continuous optimization algorithm, based on actor-critic networks, is proposed to achieve multi-objective optimization specific to local preferences. Additionally, an adaptive gradient fusion (AGF) method is introduced to limit the differences between local models and the global model through adaptive gradient aggregation, so as to alleviate the impact of heterogeneous preferences on co-training. Finally, the convergence of the ADMODRL algorithm is analyzed, and its effectiveness is verified by simulation experiments.},

We reveal a fundamental trade-off between prediction accuracy and temporal scope: Shorter-term mobility predictions enhance accuracy but increase deployment costs, while longer-term predictions reduce costs at the expense of higher service delays. Dynamic computing demands and constrained edge resources further complicate application instance allocation. To address these challenges, we propose an adaptive deployment framework leveraging multi-user multi-period predictions. This scheme simultaneously determines optimal application placement across edge nodes, deployment timing, and instance quantity. We employ a residual Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) framework for joint mobility and computing resource requirement prediction. Based on this, we develop an advanced branch-and-bound deployment algorithm to obtain near-optimal solutions and a low-complexity greedy algorithm for rapid decision-making.

  abstract     = {In multi-split computing, to achieve low inference latency and avoid significant accuracy degradation, it is advantageous to distribute sub-models to computing nodes that can exchange intermediate data through paths with a low packet drop rate (PDR). In this paper, we first formulate an optimization problem for multi-split computing to minimize inference latency while guaranteeing sufficiently high accuracy and achieving load balancing among computing nodes. To obtain the optimal solution (i.e., optimal splitting policy) of the formulated problem, we propose a congestion-robust multi-split computing system (CRMC). In CRMC, there are two phases: 1) preparation; and 2) execution. In the preparation phase, a computing node that requires the inference result of a deep neural network model (i.e., task owner) creates accuracy prediction models according to the splitting points and the PDRs. In the execution phase, the task owner collects the amount of available computing resources of the computing nodes, the expected PDRs of paths, and the transmission rate of the wired link. Then, using the prediction models, the task owner generates possible splitting policies (i.e., candidates of the optimal splitting policy) that guarantee sufficiently high accuracy and achieve load balancing among computing nodes. Subsequently, the task owner selects the optimal splitting policy that has the lowest inference latency and executes multi-split computing by following the optimal splitting policy. Evaluation results demonstrate that CRMC effectively reduces inference latency while maintaining accuracy above 80% and ensuring balanced load distribution, with each computing node operating under 110 FLOPs (70% of the total model complexity).},

Post-disaster relief, reconstruction connectivity, and communication, along with the provision of disaster information, all require the robust support of network services. Unfortunately, the damage caused by these disasters often results in the disruption of ground communication infrastructure, posing a significant challenge in maintaining service continuity. To address this, the article proposes a multi-strategy service migration approach that leverages the complementary communication advantages of UAVs and satellites to enhance the efficacy of service migration. Based on this, we design a novel Manhattan 2D user transfer model to describe network structures under special scenarios. Then, we transform the long-term optimization problem into an online optimization problem with independent time slots through Lyapunov optimization. To solve the state space explosion and the issue of “action equivalence” leading to poor algorithm convergence performance in the independent time slot optimization problems, which are modeled as Markov decision processes, we propose a bisimulation metrics partitioning method to discretize the state space and action values. Experimental results show that our proposed multi-strategy service migration approach exhibits significant advantages in terms of convergence characteristics and service quality.},

This paper develops a novel distributed hierarchical deep reinforcement learning (DHDRL) framework with a two-layer control strategy in different timescales to optimize QoE in the downlink multi-cell network including the semantic rate and accuracy. Specifically, we decompose the optimization problem into two sub-problems, beamforming and power allocation as well as semantic resource allocation, resulting in an infinite-horizon discrete and a finite-horizon continuous-time Markov decision processes. Two-layer neural networks (NNs) are proposed to solve the sub-problems. At the network level, a distributed high-level NN is proposed to mitigate the inter-cell interference and improve the network performance on a large timescale, while at the link level, another distributed low-level NN to improve the semantic compression rate and meet various semantic accuracy and rate requirements on a small timescale. Numerical results show that DHDRL achieves at least a 19.07% performance gain over the single-layer method, maintains effectiveness in high-dimensional scenarios, and exhibits strong generalization across a variety of multi-objective optimization problems.},

The algorithm refines the localization process by optimizing the communication radii of anchor nodes and implementing a hop count correction mechanism, particularly in areas with network voids and obstacles. Utilizing an adaptive weight update method based on the least squares technique and error calibration, the approach ensures the selection of optimal anchor nodes for unknown node coordinate estimation.

In particular, it can help low-income regions build 5 G networks more affordably and further bridge the digital divide. There are two main kinds of infrastructure sharing: passive sharing (i.e. site sharing) and active sharing (i.e. access sharing), which require mobile network operators (MNOs) to share their non-electronic elements or electronic elements, respectively. Because co-construction and sharing can achieve broader coverage with lower investment, through percolation theory, we investigate how different sharing strategies can deliver large-scale continuous services. First, we examine the percolation characteristics in signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) coverage graphs and the necessary conditions for percolation. Second, we propose an ‘average coverage radius’ to approximate the SINR graph with a low base station (BS) density based on the Gilbert disk model. Finally, we estimate the critical conditions of BS densities of MNOs for different sharing strategies and compare the percolation probabilities under different infrastructure sharing strategies.},

In these interactions, the Age of Information (AoI) is a key performance measure that is dependent on the DT's current network server placement. To maintain acceptable AoI performance as the system evolves, the DT location may have to be moved, which is referred to as Digital Twin migration. In this paper we consider the problem of DT migration in a vehicular system, focusing on minimizing the time-averaged AoI. In this type of system, it is difficult to maintain acceptable AoI performance due to the speed of the vehicles, which can result in frequent abrupt handoffs between different cellular domains. This makes the question of when to initiate DT migration an important one. The problem is formulated as a Markovian stopping problem and an optimal online algorithm is proposed using dynamic programming and the statistics of vehicular motion. A more computationally intensive adaptive version of this algorithm is also proposed where the dynamic programming tables are recomputed at each time step. A best-in-expectation algorithm is introduced that gives sub-optimal AoI performance but is more computationally efficient than in the optimal version. These algorithms are also compared to heuristics that do immediate migration and migration at handoff. An offline algorithm is formulated that provides a lower bound on the average AoI that is attainable. Performance results show that the proposed algorithm can significantly improve the efficiency of Digital Twin migrations compared to the other approaches while guaranteeing the minimized time-averaged AoI.},

However, IAB relies on multi-hop wireless communications, which makes the packet latency a critical metric for such systems. Latency optimization in IAB is further complicated by the half-duplex constraint forbidding IAB nodes from transmitting and receiving simultaneously over multiple antennas. As a result, active links must be dynamically scheduled to avoid conflicts and satisfy requirements of all supported traffic types in both uplink and downlink directions. In this paper, by utilizing the tools of Markov decision processes (MDP), we develop a reduced-complexity control policy for 5G self-backhauled systems simultaneously carrying latency- and throughput-sensitive traffic. The proposed policy minimizes the latency metric under low and moderate traffic conditions operating in ultra-low-complexity mode and switches to a more computationally demanding throughput-oriented regime when the offered load increases. Our results show that the core part of the policy – the proposed ultra-low-complexity tree level switching control (TLS) – minimizes the latency for high-priority latency-sensitive traffic over the whole capacity region of the system but also for dominant throughput-oriented traffic over 75–85% of the capacity region.},

  abstract     = {Vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) play a crucial role in enhancing modern transportation systems, leading to the development of various authentication schemes to meet the stringent security and privacy requirements of vehicular communications. Many existing schemes rely on tamper-proof devices (TPDs) that store extensive secret parameters for identity authentication, making them susceptible to Sybil and side-channel attacks. This paper introduces a sophisticated privacy-preserving authentication protocol, referred to as Authentication and Update (AuthUp), specifically designed to solve the problem. A trusted authority (TA) issues one-time access tokens to vehicles during the registration process. After each vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) authentication process, cryptographic key material is updated without compromising privacy. Consequently, Sybil attacks are promptly identified and thwarted, as manipulated tokens fail authentication. Additionally, adversaries are prevented from accessing sensitive data stored in TPDs via side-channel attacks because of the dynamic updating of secret keys. A formal security proof validates the robustness of AuthUp, and extensive evaluations demonstrate its superior efficiency compared to alternative schemes, highlighting its suitability for VANET deployment.},

The arrival of incoming updates is random, making it challenging to create a threshold-based algorithm that minimizes the age of the updates in the buffer while preventing resource under-utilization. We have proposed an exponentially decaying flexible threshold policy based on buffer occupancy, ensuring the freshness of information through the selective rejection of older updates in the buffer to enhance resource utilization. We highlight the favorable arrival and departure probabilities necessary for the ATP+ algorithm to function optimally within a desired buffer occupancy range. Some parameters of the algorithm are adjusted based on knowledge of the incoming age profile.

  abstract     = {Due to the convergence of new wireless technologies progress and integration with the existing radio spectrum, overlapping spectrum signals (OSS) appearing simultaneously is more frequently and randomly in time and space position. That brings more challenges for radio monitoring system on multi-parameter signal recognition and flexible target tracking. With the advantage of flexibility and mobility, uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV) assisted monitoring system is rapid advancing. In this paper, we propose a new framework for multi-parameter integrated recognition on OSS, including category and number of signals identification, position and transmitted power estimation, through UAV-assisted radio monitoring systems. Cooperative multi-layer Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) recognition (CMNR) is firstly designed to solve the problem of OSS multi-parameters integrated recognition. To further reduce the computational complexity and time identically, joint multi-layer NMF recognition (JMNR) is then developed by fully using the data correlation among different monitoring nodes and significantly improve the integrated recognition accuracy based on joint matrix optimization. The flexibility and mobility of UAV monitoring nodes inspire the design of the centroid-seeking flying strategy (CSFS) for JMNR applications. In the simulation, the signal category recognition accuracy of JMNR and CMNR both achieve at least 27.1% higher than traditional blind signal separation (BSS) methods. In the large monitoring area, the position accuracy of JMNR even obtain 11.9% higher than that using CMNR. CSFS also exhibits 20.9% and 25.3% improvement on respective position and power estimation accuracy under large monitoring area and low height of UAVs conditions.},

Compared to conventional OFDM-IM, a factorial increase of the IM patterns in MM-OFDM-IM prohibits its application in realistic communication systems due to exponentially increased modulation and demodulation complexity when the number of symbol modes is large. In this paper, we propose a novel and efficient MM-OFDM with cascade IM (MM-OFDM-CIM) scheme, which first selects partial symbol modes for multiple mode index modulation (MM-IM) of the first subblock in the cluster and then performs MM-IM based on the rest symbol modes for the second subblock. The proposed CIM method divides the IM process into two steps and achieves considerably low computational complexity in detection. Furthermore, physical layer security can be realized by adjusting the size of subblocks within the cluster due to the flexible CIM designs. Computer simulations show that the proposed MM-OFDM-CIM has potential to achieve near the same bit error rate performance with considerably low computational complexity and achieves excellent secure communication performance between the legitimate users.},

In this study, we propose a new meta free adversarial training (Meta Free AT) method through meta-parameter optimization and negative feedback mechanism, which optimizes the simultaneous constraints on the perturbation and classifier parameters in each iteration, thus reducing the proportion of incorrectly predicted samples in the model, and effectively narrowing the generalization gap between the training and test samples. This approach can be applied to complex wireless communication scenarios, particularly in vehicular communication, mobile communication, and service domains. Through the combination of meta learning and adversarial training, the model is able to maintain robustness and good generalization ability in complex environments, such as spectrum sharing, interference cancellation and channel propagation, which optimizes the command and control of the wireless communication system, and improves the overall performance of the communication system.},

  abstract     = {Advancements in 6G wireless technology have elevated the importance of beamforming, especially for attaining ultra-high data rates via millimeter-wave (mmWave) frequency deployment. Although promising, mmWave bands require substantial beam training to achieve precise beamforming. While initial deep learning models that use RGB camera images demonstrated promise in reducing beam training overhead, their performance suffers due to sensitivity to lighting and environmental variations. Due to this sensitivity, Quality of Service (QoS) fluctuates, eventually affecting the stability and dependability of networks in dynamic environments. This emphasizes a critical need for robust solutions. This paper proposes a robust beamforming technique to ensure consistent QoS under varying environmental conditions. An optimization problem has been formulated to maximize users' data rates. To solve the formulated NP-hard optimization problem, we decompose it into two subproblems: the semantic localization problem and the optimal beam selection problem. To solve the semantic localization problem, we propose a novel method that leverages the K-means clustering and YOLOv8 model. To solve the beam selection problem, we propose a novel lightweight hybrid architecture that combines a lightweight transformer with a CNN architecture through a weighted entropy mechanism. This hybrid architecture utilizes multimodal data sources to dynamically predict the optimal beams. For maintaining QoS, rapid and accurate beam predictions are needed. To quantify this, a novel metric, Accuracy-Complexity Efficiency (ACE), which combines both the model complexity and accuracy, has been proposed. Six testing scenarios have been developed to evaluate the robustness of the proposed model. Finally, the simulation result demonstrates that the proposed model outperforms several state-of-the-art baselines regarding beam prediction accuracy, received power, and ACE in the developed test scenarios.},

  abstract     = {Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) is a technology paradigm that combines sensing capabilities with communication functionalities in a single device or system. In vehicle-to-everything (V2X) sidelink, ISAC can provide enhanced safety by allowing vehicles to not only communicate with one another but also sense the surrounding environment by using sidelink signals. In ISAC-capable V2X sidelink, the random resource allocation results in an unstructured and sparse distribution of time and frequency resources in the received orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) grid, leading to degraded radar detection performance when processed using the conventional 2D-FFT method. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a high-resolution off-grid radar target detection algorithm irrespective of the OFDM grid structure. The proposed method utilizes the Newtonized orthogonal matching pursuit (NOMP) algorithm to effectively detect weak targets masked by the sidelobes of stronger ones and accurately estimates off-grid range and velocity parameters with minimal time and frequency resources through Newton refinements. Simulation results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed NOMP-based target detection algorithm compared to existing compressed sensing (CS) methods in terms of detection probability, resolution, and accuracy. Additionally, experimental validation is performed using a bistatic radar setup in a semi-anechoic chamber. The measurement results validate the simulation findings, showing that the proposed algorithm significantly enhances target detection and parameter estimation accuracy in realistic scenarios.},

To address the challenges of limited battery life and computational capacity in these devices, two promising solutions have emerged: wireless power transfer (WPT) and mobile edge computing (MEC). By receiving radio frequency (RF) energy from a hybrid access point (HAP), wireless devices (WDs) can either offload data to the HAP or process it locally. In this paper, we explore the full-duplex WPT-MEC scenario and maximize the sum computation rate (SCR) by optimizing the offloading decision and resource allocation of WDs in different access modes and energy harvest models. This problem is formulated as a mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem. To address this, we decompose the problem into two sub-problems: one focuses on optimizing offloading decisions, and the other focuses on energy power and bandwidth allocation under given the offloading decisions. We propose a deep reinforcement learning approach based on policy gradients to make offloading decisions, and we design an optimization algorithm for efficient bandwidth and energy resource allocation. Simulation results show that our proposed algorithm achieves approximately 96$\%$ of the maximum possible computation rate while maintaining low computational complexity.},

For $K$-user downlink NOMA, we formulate the problem of jointly choosing the modulation and coding schemes and powers of the users to maximize a general weighted $\alpha$-utility function subject to constraints on the block error rate (BLER) and minimum rate of each user. We account for imperfect SIC and adapt the decoding order. This approach subsumes the weighted sum rate maximization, proportional fairness, and max-min fairness approaches considered separately in the literature. Due to discrete rate adaptation, the optimization problem for any decoding order is NP-hard. We present a novel search algorithm that provably finds the optimal solution with one to five orders of magnitude lower search complexity than exhaustive search. We also propose an alternate approach that employs a smaller set of BLER constraints to reduce complexity further. We derive novel expressions for the outage probability, average sum rate, and weighted $\alpha$-utility of the optimal solution for two-user NOMA for the farthest-to-nearest decoding order. The analysis is the first to address the general weighted $\alpha$-utility function. We also extend our approach to account for imperfect channel state information.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, joint wireless communication and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imaging has received extensive attention. The realization of this concept remains a significant challenge. For communication and SAR, they have conflicting requirements on waveforms. The state-of-the-art solutions are based on the Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) techniques. However, OFDM waveforms are sensitive to the Doppler frequency. Even worse, their unavoidable Cyclic Prefix (CP) would introduce false peaks into SAR images. To be insensitive to frequency bias and free of CPs, Filter Bank Multicarrier (FBMC) waveforms with stepped frequency chirp and Offset Quadrature Amplitude Modulations (OQAM) are proposed in this paper. Particularly, stepped frequency chirps, which have been optimally weighted for SAR imaging, are interleaved into FBMC subcarriers as pilots. Meanwhile, the channel changes can be obtained from these pilots for communication equalization. Moreover, concerning the intrinsic interference of imaginary parts between pilots and OQAM symbols, compensation algorithms are introduced. With the proposed waveform schemes, the identical frequency band can be utilized for data transmission while performing high-resolution SAR imaging. Theoretical analysis and simulation results demonstrate that the proposed waveform scheme is feasible.},

  abstract     = {Communication between vehicles via the wireless channel is faced with the hidden risk of privacy leakage in the vehicular ad-hoc network(VANET). Due to the limited computing resources of the on-board unit and the characteristics of high-speed driving for vehicles, the message processing performance of existing privacy protection authentication schemes are difficult to meet the needs of applications. To address such problems, we propose an efficient lightweight and security-enhanced message authentication scheme for VANETs to protect transmitted traffic messages. In this scheme, in terms of the resource-limited application environment, $n$ message signatures from different vehicles are compressed into one signature, thus reducing signature verification and storage overhead for roadside units. And a cryptographic hash function is used to replace map-to-point function to reduce the computational cost of vehicles. Provides an effective traceability method for transportation bureaus to track traffic violations. In addition, it provides rigorous security proof that the proposed scheme meets the security requirements of VANETs. Comparison of computational cost analysis shows that our scheme improves performance by 54.26%.},

We propose an eMBB-URLLC joint resource allocation algorithm based on proactive packet dropping mechanism, maximizing the eMBB users' sum throughput while ensuring the URLLC users' delay and reliability requirements, accounting for both transmission and queueing delays. Specifically, the joint resource allocation scheme is formulated as an NP-hard problem, and is decomposed into two sub-problems. The first sub-problem refers to proactive packet dropping mechanism, we minimize the maximum URLLC required transmission power to meet QoS requirements by optimizing packet loss probabilities. The packet loss probabilities includes transmission error probability, queueing delay violation probability, and proactive packet dropping probability. The second sub-problem consists of two components: eMBB user admission problem and eMBB-URLLC user joint power control problem. We solve the former user admission problem with a dynamic programming approach, and address the later joint power control problem with an iterative algorithm. Numerical results show that our proposed algorithm outperforms the comparable resource allocation algorithm, both in terms of the sum throughput of eMBB users and the overall packet loss probability of URLLC users.},

However, a key challenge lies in addressing the dynamic and nonlinear problem of RIS phase shift design and UAV trajectory prediction. To ensure long-term fairness and enhance system performance, we propose an approach based on the double deep Q-network (DDQN), aiming to maximize the weighted sum rate across multiple users. Specifically, we employ an initial phase shift and predefined codebook to optimize the RIS phase shift at the current UAV position using DDQN. Further refinement is achieved through an extremum seeking algorithm. Then, under constraints encompassing RIS phase shift, allowable regions for UAV node, base station (BS) transmit power, and minimum user rate, we adopt DDQN to obtain predefined reward parameters jointly designed by fairness and throughput through interaction with dynamic and variable channel environment, and continuously update UAV position parameters to maximize rewards. The simulation results verify the efficacy of our joint optimization strategy, demonstrating optimal UAV location selection for UAV-RIS-empowered multiuser networks in a 2D plane.},

  abstract     = {Higher frequency bands (HFB) such as mmWave and sub-THz are important constituents of next generation wireless communication technology such as 6G, as they offer large bandwidth and capacity to support high data rates. However, due to the narrow beam width and high penetration loss, such HFB links are easily susceptible to blockage effects caused by moving objects such as humans and cars. Blockage durations are relatively long ($\sim 500$ milliseconds) while some 6G use cases require a high reliability within a much shorter delay, which makes it challenging to support them on HFB. In this paper we use linear packet-level coding, which is a spectrally-efficient low-latency proactive reliability enhancement technique above the physical (PHY) layer, to efficiently utilize the aggregated bandwidth of multiple HFB links to provide the required quality of service (QoS) of high-reliability and delay-critical traffic. To effectively combat the deleterious effects of blockage on the HFB links, we analytically characterize the reliability performance and its limit of packet-level coding in the blockage-prone multi-link environment, and based on which we design optimization algorithms to minimize the number of HFB links and the radio resource needed to achieve the required QoS. Numerical results show that our coding solution requires far less HFB links than the existing packet duplication technique defined in 5G standards, and with low complexity our optimization algorithm can significantly reduce the amount of radio resource needed. Our solution provides a feasible way of harvesting the vast bandwidth of blockage-prone HFB to provide high-reliability low-latency data services, which cannot be practically enabled by traditional techniques such as packet duplication or retransmission.},

  abstract     = {The usage of physical layer security (PLS) in the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) has become widespread. Withthe majority of vehicles requiring meticulous energy management, the enhancement of energy efficiency in the realm of PLS strategies has garnered significant attention from researchers. The conventional approach concentrates on allocating energy between confidential information and artificial noise (AN), leading to additional energy consumption for AN. In contrast, this study introduces a novel initial phase-added and reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted PLS (IPARISS) approach that optimizes the transmission phase to achieve security in a more energy-efficient manner. A phase shift is introduced at the legitimate transmitter to increase the difference between the signal received at the legitimate receiver and the eavesdropper. Furthermore, RIS is employed to enhance interference at the eavesdropper. To increase the bit error rate (BER) at the eavesdropper with low energy cost, the phases, RIS position, and power allocation strategy are jointly optimized using a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework, specifically the constraint-optimized proximal policy optimization (COPPO)-IPARISS algorithm. Simulation results indicate that the proposed phase optimization scheme improves security performance while reducing the power consumption of the transmitter under different modulation techniques. The impact of the RIS height on energy efficiency under quadrature phase shift keying (QPSK) modulation is analyzed. Finally, the robustness of proposed approach is verified through simulating the effect of different speeds of vehicles.},

However, such a problem results in mixed-integer non-convex optimization, making it difficult to identify feasible solutions efficiently. To overcome this challenge, we propose a novel iterative optimization framework that jointly solves the problem to maximize the RHS-assisted network sum-rate, efficiently managing holographic beamforming patterns, dynamically scheduling users, and ensuring the minimum QoS requirements for each scheduled user. The proposed framework relies on zero-forcing digital beamforming, gradient-ascent-based holographic beamformer optimization, and a greedy user selection principle.

  abstract     = {The unprecedented surge in wireless data traffic has spurred extensive exploration in terahertz communications (THzComs) over the past decade. Since THzComs are vulnerable to performance degradation and even link outage in mobile scenarios, the integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) are expected to resolve the challenges by extracting information from received signals. Most existing efforts toward envisioned THz sensing-assisted mobile communication (TSAMC) technique merely take into account azimuth angle estimation according to sensing signals without angular velocity measurement, making their reliability and effectiveness questionable. To this end, this work provides a novel TSAMC approach to handle above challenges. Firstly, a four-dimensioned sensing containing amplitude measurement-based angular velocity estimation scheme is proposed to adjust practical high mobility scenarios. Secondly, a Bayesian Cramér-Rao bound (BCRB)-based information fusion procedure is introduced to improve sensing accuracy by taking advantage of both sensing and communication echoes. Thirdly, estimated and integrated parameters are adopted for beam alignment, and the ergodic communication capacities in distinct cases of TSAMC are derived. Finally, the Monte Carlo simulation in mean squared error and achievable capacity, as well as performance bound evaluation in BCRB and capacity bound, are proceeded for sensing and communication individually. Numerical results verify the applicability of TSAMC framework, and validate the superiority of proposed method especially in high tangential mobility and communication-centric scenarios.},

A wideband channel model, incorporating selectivity which is usually referred to as beam squint and is particularly relevant in high frequency bands, such as millimeter waves and terahertz, is considered. To account for the UAV's limited capability to collect long training sequences, due to its single-RF reception architecture, and the beam-squint effect at both communication ends, we present a novel channel estimation approach that exploits information provided by the control module of the UAV, namely its state-space vector. The proposed approach comprises a hybrid parametric and non-parametric estimation optimization framework that is efficiently solved through an iterative algorithm using the alternating direction method of multipliers. Our extensive performance investigations, including comparisons with benchmark schemes, showcase that considerable gains can be achieved if state-space information from the UAV's control module is appropriately incorporated in the channel estimation process.},

To investigate the similarity of channels across different frequency bands, multi-frequency channel measurements at 0.7, 2.3, and 3.7 GHz in urban macro (UMa) scenarios are conducted. Besides, quantitative metrics for characterizing channel similarity at different frequency bands are given. Channel characteristics such as the delay power spectral density (PSD), angular PSD, large-scale parameters (LSPs), and clustering results at different frequency bands are compared. Results show that most multipath components (MPCs) exist across all frequency bands, while certain MPCs appear at one band and disappear at others. Based on the observation, a novel multi-frequency channel model (MFCM) considering the birth and death of clusters at different frequency bands is proposed. The proposed model is compared with two 5G standard channel models, i.e., 3GPP TR 38.901 and quasi deterministic radio channel generator (QuaDRiGa), which assume that the MPCs observed at different frequency bands are exactly the same and are inconsistent with measurements. Results indicate that the proposed model outperforms two 5G standard channel models in characterizing the similarity of channels at different frequency bands.},

For SC modulation, two capacity lower bounds are obtained using entropy power inequality and suboptimal discrete input distribution, while an asymptotical upper capacity bound is obtained by applying the dual expression of capacity. For MC modulation, the nonlinear distortion is approximated as signal attenuation plus signal-independent noise via the Bussgang theorem, thereby obtaining the MC capacity. Numerical results show that for typical vehicle-to-vehicle VLC with high signal-to-noise ratios, SC modulation can achieve a higher rate than MC modulation.},

The UAVs are divided into primary UAVs (PUs) and secondary UAVs (SUs), and the SUs operate on channels under the tolerated interference limitation (TIL) of the PUs. To coordinate spectrum usage between PUs and SUs, we establish a Stackelberg game model where the PUs adjust the TIL to minimize the overall system delay while each SU selects channel to reduce its own delay under the constraints of transmit power and outage probability. Meanwhile, we employ the blockchain technology to manage the spectrum usage of the SUs under specified TIL configurations. The SUs select their channels and power settings by using deep reinforcement learning (DRL) with the D3QN algorithm, while the advanced Ripple protocol facilitates a low-latency and accurate consensus process among the PUs. Simulation results demonstrate the performance gains of the blockchain technology and DRL algorithm in terms of transmission delay and data rate.},

The key innovation of the proposed scheme is the flexible utilization of user resolution information: LDMA is applied to users with better resolution, while NOMA is used for those users with poor resolution. For each NOMA user, the most suitable beam will be selected by optimizing the system performance and beam efficiency. A unique feature of our scheme is its effectiveness even under limited beam resources. The performance of the scheme is analyzed and the closed-form results are obtained.

  abstract     = {In this paper, we propose a secret communication method with multiple legitimate receivers and multiple eavesdroppers that integrates an Intelligent Reflecting Surface (IRS) with the multiple parameters weighted fractional Fourier transform (MP-WFRFT). We send the MP-WFRFT to the legitimate receiver, and then reconstruct the legitimate channel and eavesdropping channel to maximize the minimum-secrecy-rate by optimizing the IRS phase. However, the signals of direct link and IRS reflection link superpose with each other at the receiver, which seriously deteriorates the camouflage effect of constellation diagram. To address these issues, we propose an optimization model for camouflage constellation diagram of the IRS-assisted MP-WFRFT system, aiming to optimize the ambiguity error and rotation error of constellation diagram detected at the eavesdropper. As MP-WFRFT can camouflage the PSK signal as the square QAM signal, we can perceive the characteristics of square QAM signal in the environment to flexibly change the signal camouflage type. By jointly the control parameters of MP-WFRFT and IRS, we can minimize the error between the camouflage constellation diagram of MP-WFRFT at the eavesdropper and the existing signal constellation diagram in the environment, achieving the best camouflage effect. The experimental results showed that compared with the situation without using IRS, the proposed method can significantly improve the secret rate of the communication system, and it can also enhance the bit error rate (BER) performance at the legitimate receiver and deteriorate the BER performance at the malicious eavesdropper. Besides, the best camouflage effect of the constellation diagram was achieved.},

In this paper, we propose a heterogeneous scattering fingerprinting network (HSFNet) which amalgamates wavelet scattering and deep learning to achieve lightweight, rapid and reliable physical layer authentication by radio frequency fingerprinting (RFF) which employs the unique inherent hardware impairments within for vehicle-to everything (V2X) communications. Particularly, we first exploit a wavelet scattering network to extract RFF coefficients and eliminate redundancies within heterogeneous datasets. The establishment of a high-information-density datasets facilitates the efficient processing of extensive heterogeneous data, especially for resource-limited vehicles nodes. To improve the interpretability, we combine multi-scale coefficients of input waveform and shapley values, formulating a complete interpretable framework and completing parameters tuning. Finally, considering heterogeneous applications in practical scenarios, we design a distributed federated learning framework which not only completes distributed training but also protects privacy with the resources-constrained intelligent IoV nodes. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed scheme maintains excellent performance while utilizing only about 25.7% of original samples, significantly improving the identification accuracy. Furthermore, the identification accuracy of federated learning ultimately converges to 98.1%.},

  abstract     = {With the advances in artificial intelligence and communication technologies, vehicular edge computing (VEC), as a newly developed computing paradigm, is gaining more and more attention from both academia and industry. Complex demands and on-board applications need to be offloaded to edge servers for Quality of Experience (QoE). Nevertheless, the offloading process increases the risk of user privacy leakage, and the effectiveness of resource allocation algorithms is urgently desired in latency-sensitive tasks. To this end, we employ quantum key distribution (QKD) and blockchain to secure communication and computation, where key generation rate (KGR) associated with transmission and computation-aware is investigated for resource allocation problem. In consideration of the number of existing qubits and technical bottlenecks, we propose a tensor network preprocessing-based quantum deep reinforcement learning algorithm (TN-QDRL), which exploits amplitude encoding and the unique properties of quantum superposition and entanglement states to tackle the complex Markov decision process in a multi-dimensional state space. Additionally, we provide a search strategy for quantum state probabilistic transformations integrated with an improved Grover's algorithm. Simulation results indicate that our algorithm achieves a convergence speed that is 62.11% faster in high-dimensional real-world VEC scenarios and consumes 58.19% fewer quantum resources compared to other benchmarks.},

In this paper, we study a HAP assisted communication scheme in SAGIN, focusing on serving as many users as possible while meeting their QoS requirements. Data flows between LEO satellite and users can be directly transmitted to the user through LEO satellite or relayed to the user by HAP. We propose a joint access slot scheduling and backhaul bandwidth allocation algorithm. For access links, according to QoS requirements and rates, users with fewer transmission slots are preferentially scheduled to maximize the utilization of time slot resources. The bandwidth allocation of backhaul links is based on the user association results of access links, and the user with lower bandwidth is preferentially scheduled.

We tackle this challenge by formulating an optimization problem aimed at maximizing the uplink sum rate for vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) links. In particular, we optimize transmit precoders, phase-shift matrices, transmit power, and spectrum sharing for vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) links while ensuring that V2V links maintain a minimum signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR). To address the complex hybrid control scenarios in this context, we propose a mixed action deep reinforcement learning based algorithm. This algorithm employs two agents, delivering nearly optimal performance and effective control capabilities across various scenarios. We also compare our proposed algorithm with two conventional benchmark schemes: deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) with discrete actions (DA), a mixed action greedy policy and alternating optimization (AO) approach. Additionally, we assess the effectiveness of our algorithm under the presence of imperfect channel state information (ICSI).Simulation results demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed algorithm, showing that A-RIS significantly enhances vehicular communication quality and hence achieves high performance with low overhead.

However, the coexistence of multiple RIS-assisted networks in confined train environments poses significant theoretical and practical challenges. This study focuses on the RIS coexistence problem in HST systems, specifically investigating the impact of multipath fading induced by coexisting RIS (C-RIS) on interfered users. First, we develop a simplified mutual-coupling channel model for C-RIS-induced multipath (CR-MP), applicable to operational frequency bands above 5 GHz. Second, we evaluate the effects of CR-MP on interfered users using the multipath power ratio (MPR), defined as the ratio of the received signal power to the desired signal power. The MPR formulation is derived as a function of the user's spatial position, operational frequency, and penetration loss. Finally, we analyze the spatial and temporal characteristics of the CR-MP channel through the MPR radiation pattern and the received signal envelope, respectively. Simulation results reveal that the spatial characteristics are time-varying and strongly influenced by the frequency difference and penetration loss, while the temporal characteristics depend on the user's position. When the target user is located in specific positions, the fading effects induced by CR-MP can be negligible with a reduced frequency difference, while the received signal power gain can be significantly enhanced with an increased frequency difference. The findings of this study provide practical insights for RIS deployment in real-world systems, particularly for mitigating C-RIS-induced interference in coexisting RIS-assisted networks.},

  abstract     = {Channel knowledge map (CKM) has become a potential technique to enhance communication performance by exploiting actual radio propagation information, especially in communication between uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) and ground base stations (GBSs). However, CKM constructed by existing methods cannot obtain differentiable expressions from locations to the channel information, rendering it unsuitable for the traditional communication design. This work proposes a site-specific differentiable CKM to jointly design UAV trajectories and transmit power. First, assuming sufficient channel samples collected by a GBS, the CKM is constructed for this specific site as a differentiable back propagation neural network (BPNN). To enable CKM migration towards nearby GBSs, we adopt the transfer learning mechanism to set up new CKMs that require significantly less training samples. Next, leveraging CKM-stored channel knowledge, we investigate the multi-UAV trajectory design and power control strategy, while the UAVs are traversing the network coverage area with designated starting and destination points. Specifically, the minimal average rate between UAVs and associated GBSs is maximized along the designed trajectories, which is solved by continuous convex optimization based on the differentiable CKMs. Numerical results show that the BPNN and transfer learning can effectively construct high-accuracy CKMs, while reducing the overall training cost. It is also shown that the proposed joint trajectory and power optimization based on the CKM-assisted architecture achieves improved minimal average rate compared to the alternating optimization method based on distance-dependent path-loss models and existing CKM-based methods with fixed power configurations, since both site-specific environmental information and power optimization are exploited.},

This approach greatly enhances the functionality of the modulator by adding extra dimensions, broadens the potential for signal modulation, and notably increases the accuracy and efficiency of signal transmission. Meanwhile, on the receiver, we have implemented an innovative joint demodulation technique. This technique adeptly recovers reference index, code index, and classification combination index bits, thereby not only increasing the efficiency of the demodulation process but also simplifying system design and reducing complexity. To thoroughly evaluate the performance of the proposed JDT-M-MDCSK system, this paper presents an in-depth simulation analysis of its bit error rate (BER) performance under AWGN and multipath Rayleigh channels, confirming the precision of the BER theoretical expressions.

  abstract     = {Low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite systems with integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) technology offer a promising approach to provide network access and perform target detection and tracking, particularly for power Internet of Things (PIoT) devices in regions with limited ground station coverage. This paper investigates a partially-connected hybrid precoding design for the rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA)-enabled LEO-ISAC satellite system under electromagnetic interference (EMI) and introduces a novel dual-array ISAC architecture. Specifically, an assisting receiver (AR) is installed spatially separated from the transmitter on the LEO satellite to suppress self-interference and reduce the complexity of time synchronization. Leveraging the statistical channel state information (sCSI) of satellite channels, the target detection and tracking phases are considered for multi-target sensing, referred to as Case I and Case II, where the AR operates without and with prior knowledge of the targets, respectively. To minimize the estimated Cramér-Rao bound (CRB) in both cases, we formulate the hybrid precoding optimization problem and transform it into a tractable form using the Schur complement. A unified optimization framework based on penalty dual decomposition (PDD) is developed to address the problem in both cases, utilizing the weighted minimum mean square error (WMMSE), sequential rank-one constraint relaxation (SROCR), and convex-concave procedure (CCP) methods. Numerical results validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms and demonstrate that the RSMA scheme achieves higher sensing accuracy in multi-target sensing than the traditional schemes.},

  abstract     = {Vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) can enhance traffic conditions through real-time communication, but vehicle-to-infrastructure exchanges in open channels require higher security and privacy. Numerous conditional privacy-preserving authentication (CPPA) schemes have been designed to ensure message authenticity. However, most CPPA schemes still suffer from many shortcomings, such as redundant authentication of messages, lack of effective identity revocation mechanism, and over-reliance on the authentication center. In order to address these concerns, an efficient certificateless CPPA scheme based on message classification (MCB-CPPA) is introduced for VANETs, which aggregates authentication for the same message across different vehicles and performs batch verification for identical messages from different vehicles, thus reducing redundant message validation. Furthermore, the scheme separates the processes of identity authentication and traffic message verification relying on both roadside units and vehicles to reduce security dependence on the authentication center. Regarding the certificateless signature in the MCB-CPPA scheme, we demonstrate existential unforgeability in the random oracle model (ROM) against the adaptive chosen message attack. Upon evaluation, it is revealed that the transmission and batch authentication overheads of this proposed scheme have been reduced by approximately 47. 7% and 51. 6% compared to existing state-of-the-art solutions. As a result, the proposed scheme successfully reduces the computational overhead and communication cost while satisfying the safety requirements of VANETs, making it more adaptable to the VANETs environment.},

  abstract     = {The integration of a satellite network with a terrestrial network, supporting optimized network selection and service continuity, is essential to meet the requirements of sixth-generation (6G) wireless networks. In a typical scenario with both terrestrial and satellite services, a subset, referred to as terrestrial users (t-users), can communicate only with the terrestrial base station (BS), while dual users (d-users) can transmit information to both the BS and an available LEO satellite. Thus, we focus on an integrated satellite-terrestrial uplink network, assuming that non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) is used in the terrestrial sub-network, which is motivated by the existence of non-line-of-sight channels between the BS and the users. We also investigate the use of two communication protocols for the satellite sub-network, considering both orthogonal multiple access (OMA) and NOMA. We define a utility function based on the achievable rates of the users and formulate an optimization problem to maximize the long-term utility of the network, taking into account constraints on the maximum capacity of the BS and the LEO satellite, as well as short- and long-term power consumption. We apply Lyapunov theory to decompose it into multiple single-time slot sub-problems, and finally transform it into convex form and solve it effectively. The network selection by the d-users as well as the optimal resource allocation for all users are also investigated. The simulation results show that d-users prefer to communicate with the LEO satellite rather than the BS. The probability of this selection is strongly influenced by the chosen communication scheme and the trajectory of the LEO satellite. Furthermore, there is an improvement in utility when the LEO satellite is close to its zenith position, while users achieve higher utility when the NOMA protocol is used in the satellite sub-network compared to the OMA counterpart.},

To tackle this issue, we propose an efficient ISAC system by combining reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) and orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) technologies, which can process signals in the time-frequency-space domains. In particular, an integrated waveform is designed by adding a time slot in each frame of the OFDM signals. In this time slot, the ISAC system transmits a single-tone signal and the RIS generates a set of random patterns to sense the spatial information of the cooperative user and non- cooperative target. The perceived spatial information retrieved in the previous OFDM frame is used in the current OFDM frame to form an adaptive mechanism of beam tracking. Range and velocity detections are implemented by processing the transmitted and received OFDM symbols. Finally, a prototype of the RIS-aided ISAC system is established and is experimentally verified in terms of wireless communication, detection, and tracking.},

While promising numerous applications, the synergy between CF-mMIMO and ISAC technologies remains underexplored, particularly regarding scalability issues. This paper addresses this research gap by proposing a scalable CF-mMIMO-based ISAC framework integrating downlink (DL) payload data and sensing precoding schemes and fractional power allocation strategies. Building upon the non-scalable maximum a posteriori ratio test (MAPRT), our contributions also include the design of scalable partial MAPRT (P-MAPRT) and improved partial MAPRT (IP-MAPRT) target detectors, which consider both clutter and statistical radar cross-section information. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed scalable detection schemes achieve competitive performance metrics compared to the non-scalable MAPRT, with notable trade-offs between detection probability and spectral efficiency per user. Our findings underscore the importance of designing reliable clutter-aware scalable target detection algorithms in CF-mMIMO-based ISAC scenarios and provide insights into the process of selecting appropriate system parameters for balanced QoS metrics.},

Focusing the energy radiated to the user by directional antenna will significantly decrease co-channel interference, which hasn't been analyzed in existing IRS-assisted networks. This paper proposes a tractable directional antenna model for IRS-assisted networks where base station (BS) will generate two narrow beams toward IRS and user equipment (UE) for interference isolation, and power allocation parameter $\omega$ is designed for direct link and IRS-assisted cascade link. Specifically, realistic and mathematically tractable directional antenna pattern ${G_{M,m,\theta }}(\phi)$ is adopted that radiation gain is modeled by main lobe directivity gain, the back lobe gain, and the beamwidth of the main lobe, and the total interference with IRS random scattering is revised. In addition, the signal and interference power distribution is achieved using Gamma function and the optimal $\omega$ can be found, where the different gain of IRS perfect reflecting and random scattering is taken into account, and the tradeoff between power allocation parameter $\omega$ and channel condition can be exploited. Analytical results demonstrate that system coverage probability is maximized when $\omega=0.52$ and IRSs deployment density $\lambda _{I}=5000/{km}^{2}$ and reflecting elements $N=3000$.},

To be specific, by implementing a delicate transformation with a special funnel function, together with fusing an adaptive asymptotic funnel control approach, a funnel-based formation control strategy is constructed. In comparison to the current outcomes, this strategy demonstrates the subsequent salient characteristics: 1) enhancing the robustness of the considered system subject to such practical factors; 2) achieving the asymptotic formation control with predefined global funnel performance constraints; 3) lowering computational and structural complexity without function approximation, switching of the controller structure, and complex nonlinear terms. Ultimately, the theoretical assertions are validated via the simulation paradigm.},

Second, an attention mechanism is integrated to enhance the features extraction of relevant dynamic traffic contexts. We employ shared network trained jointly on both egocentric and top-down data, leveraging cross-perspective information producing view-specific trajectory predictions.

  abstract     = {Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) have garnered significant attention due to their expanding use in variousapplications, including electric vehicles (EVs) and smart grids. To meet the diverse requirements of these applications, LIB cells are configured in different architectures, such as multiple cell/module/pack which are arranged in series and parallel configurations. In series configurations, a state of charge (SOC) balancing system is essential to ensure uniform SOC levels across all cells. For battery electric vehicles (BEVs), which rely solely on LIBs as their energy storage system (ESS), maximizing the ESS capacity is crucial for extending the driving range. SOC balancing is a key strategy to achieve optimal utilization of ESS capacity in EVs. This paper presents a model-free cooperative multi-agent control framework designed to regulate and balance the SOC of lithium-ion battery (LIB) cells in EVs during real-time driving operations. The proposed method utilizes a series architecture comprising three LIB cells, each equipped with a buck-boost converter and a proportional-integral (PI) controller, controlled by a reinforcement learning (RL) agent. The Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm is used as the RL agent in this multi-agent framework, where each PPO agent independently manages the SOC of a corresponding battery cell based on observed data. During the training phase, all PPO agents work collaboratively to balance the SOCs of the LIB cells, thereby preventing interruptions in EV performance. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated by comparing its performance with single-agent methods such as PPO, Soft Actor-Critic (SAC), and Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3), as well as with other multi-agent methods. The results show that the proposed method performs better than the existing approaches, indicating its potential for superior performance.},

Combining supercapacitors with batteries can be a promising way to reduce battery stress, while also improving global EV performance. This paper proposes a novel multi-ensemble learning (MEL)-based method for designing energy management strategies (called MEL-EMSs) for dual-source EVs (DSEVs), i.e., EVs using a battery and a supercapacitor. A designed MEL-EMS determines in real-time a performant power distribution. Such power distribution is determined solely based on the history of the speed and traction power, without requiring any prior knowledge of the complete driving cycle. MEL-EMS is evaluated at two levels, to assess power distribution and energy consumption respectively. The real-time simulation is carried out under unknown driving cycles based on a validated numerical EV model. Our results demonstrate that MEL-EMS outperforms state-of-the-art methods by enhancing energy efficiency, reducing battery stress with a 4.8% reduction in battery root-mean-square current and a 41.7% decrease in standard deviation of battery current, while ensuring accurate and low-cost real-time power distribution.},

  abstract     = {In complex electromagnetic environment, deceptive jamming, especially those mainlobe rapidly-generated jamming signals pose a significant threat to radar systems. To address this issue, a Multi-Domain Coding (MDC) scheme with the optimized transceiver architecture is investigated in this paper to suppress mainlobe deceptive jamming signals. At the configuration stage, the Linear Frequency Modulation (LFM) waveforms are transmitted and encoded in the spatial, slow-time, and fast-time domains. At the receiver, the received signals are separated based on the modulated Doppler frequency. In this regard, in order to solve the problem of waveform misalignment caused by high-speed moving targets, an approach to determine the misalignment coefficient is proposed according to beamforming energy differences. In addition, a dual-phase compensation method is developed to distinguish the false targets through transmit spatial frequencies. Additionally, to address the problem of performance degradation due to Direction of Arrive (DOA) errors, an optimization problem aiming to maximize the output Signal-to-Interference-plus-Noise Ratio (SINR) is formulated. To solve this, an Maximum Block Improvement (MBI)-based alternating algorithm is employed to optimize the transmit parameters and receive filter.

  abstract     = {The Controller Area Network (CAN) is the de facto industry standard of In-Vehicle Network (IVN) for connecting Electronic Control Units (ECUs). In recent years, related researchers have proposed various in-vehicle network security schemes to protect CAN bus. By leveraging the physical characteristics of signals sent by ECUs, ECU identification methods are proposed to implement intrusion detection system at the physical transmission layer. Voltage-based physical fingerprint techniques have gained significant attention in this research field. Considering the resource-constrained embedded environments of IVN, various methods attempt to reduce the resource requirements of physical fingerprint-based ECU identification methods. In this paper, a lightweight voltage-based fingerprint intrusion detection system is proposed, which achieves an identification accuracy of over 99% under conditions of low sampling rates, short signal segments, and a small feature set through comprehensive experiments on both CAN prototypes and a rich dataset of ten actual vehicles.},

  abstract     = {In order to improve the transient mode switching quality from the motor driving to the hybrid driving stage of a power split hybrid electric vehicle (PS-HEV), a novel finite-time dynamic coordinated control strategy (DCCS) that combines adding a power integrator (AAPI) and fixed-time control theory is proposed. Firstly, dynamic models of the PS-HEV at different stages are established using the lever analogy. Based on the transient mode switching analysis, the AAPI controller is constructed for the engine starting and clutch slipping stage. The power integral term in AAPI can improve the controller robustness. Then, the fixed-time control theory is introduced into the design of the AAPI, and fixed-time adding a power integrator (FTAAPI) control strategy is further proposed to improve the convergence performance of the engine speed and clutch speed difference. Finally, simulation and hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) experiments are conducted. Research results show that the proposed FTAAPIC reduces the speed difference between both sides of the clutch with faster convergence rate and lower steady-state error. Compared with the traditional sliding mode control and AAPI strategy, the mode switching quality of the PS-HEV with the proposed FTAAPI strategy is greatly improved in scenarios considering external disturbances.},

  abstract     = {This paper proposes a novel approach to address the state of charge (SOC) estimation challenges of lithium-ion battery packs in electric vehicles characterized by inherent inconsistencies. The proposed method aims to achieve a delicate equilibrium between estimation accuracy and model complexity. Firstly, an inconsistency compensation model is proposed, utilizing nonzero mean virtual measurement noise to offset external discrepancies induced by battery pack inconsistency. Subsequently, a variational Bayesian unscented Kalman filter (VBUKF) is derived for simultaneous estimation of SOC and the mean and variance of virtual measurement noise. Concurrently, within the same time scale, a variational Bayesian Kalman filter (VBKF) is employed for internal resistance (R) estimation. Finally, the proposed method is validated through experiments on two battery packs with varying degrees of inconsistency under pulsed-discharge and urban dynamometer driving schedule conditions at various temperatures. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed SOC+R compensation model yields significantly more accurate SOC estimates than the big cell model and the compensation model without R estimation. In addition, it exhibits comparable accuracy to the representative cell model but without the burden of selecting representative cells, thus effectively balancing complexity and accuracy. Moreover, the proposed model is proved to be more robust through simulations in the case of random errors and abrupt disturbances.},

Directly applying traditional algorithms to address these challenges can result in an extensive solution space, making it difficult to elucidate the dynamic process of air combat confrontation. One-versus-one (1V1) beyond visual range air combat, as the foundational level of air combat research, holds significant importance for analyzing and understanding the game confrontation process in air combat scenarios. To address these challenges, this paper focuses on 1V1 two-plane beyond visual range air combat, analyzing the air combat process and constructing an air combat decision-making model. Building upon a typical hierarchical hybrid decision-making architecture for beyond visual range air combat, the paper develops a decision-making method based on rule-driven state transition behavior in air combat games. Additionally, the evolution of the two-plane confrontation game is analyzed and studied using evolutionary game theory. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed decision-making method exhibits strong autonomous decision-making capabilities and provides a competitive edge in two-plane beyond visual range air combat scenarios.

However, the inherent complexity of underwater environments poses significant challenges for point feature-based SLAM, such as reduced pose estimation accuracy due to factors like turbidity and weak texture, as well as limited semantic information conveyed by sparse point cloud maps. To address these challenges, this study introduces an innovative approach termed underwater semantic object SLAM (USO-SLAM), based on stereo camera. We propose a novel algorithm designed for reconstructing objects that naturally occur underwater, thereby substantially enhancing reconstruction success rate and object pose estimation accuracy. Furthermore, we present a comprehensive underwater semantic object SLAM algorithmic framework, incorporating a robust semantic loop closure module whereby objects are encoded within a two-layers topological graph structure. Empirical findings derived from both simulated and real-world underwater environments corroborate that our proposed method outperforms existing state-of-the-art semantic reconstruction algorithms and SLAM systems, particularly in terms of semantic object reconstruction and navigation accuracy in underwater settings.},

As a result, the cross-type capacitor-loaded fence and quarter-wavelength open-ended slots are explored to gradually improve impedance matching and enhance the port isolation, thereby realizing the first prototype. Additionally, by loading four shorting vias on patch corners, the second wideband prototype is implemented, demonstrating better isolation and reduced H-plane cross polarization, even with closer spacing. As a validation of the concept, these two prototypes are fabricated and experimentally tested, showing good consistency between simulations and measurements. More importantly, the 2×6 MIMO MPA array achieves a wide 20-dB decoupling bandwidth of 43.5%, demonstrating good isolation in both the E-plane and H-plane arrays simultaneously.

  abstract     = {We explore cooperative automotive sensing, where a pair of communicating vehicles cooperate in locating multiple targets in the surroundings. Each vehicle is equipped with a mono-static radar, while a bi-static radar, which offers a different probing angle of the environment and thus geometric diversity, can be formed by leveraging the inter-vehicle communication signal for sensing. Target localization is typically carried out using a two-step approach, which first estimates some intermediate location-dependent parameters (e.g., delays) and then converts them into location estimates via nonlinear regression. For multi-target localization, the two-step approach has to solve a combinatorial data association problem. To address this challenge, we consider a direct approach to locate targets directly from the observed signals. We first introduce the optimum joint maximum likelihood estimator (MLE), which also entails a high complexity, as a benchmark method. We then propose a sparse recovery and refinement (SRR) method, which integrates the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm with successive cancellation in an iterative way. SRR is able to benefit from the computational efficiency of ADMM without suffering its grid-mismatch problem. A joint Cramér-Rao bound (CRB) is presented as a performance assessment tool for cooperative localization. Numerical results show that geometric diversity enables cooperative sensing to surpass the conventional non-cooperative sensing in terms of accuracy and energy efficiency; among the cooperative sensing schemes, SRR yields improved estimation performance and can better resolve closely spaced targets than the two-step approach.},

  abstract     = {LiDAR Odometry (LO) has played a critical role in vehicular positioning technology for autonomous vehicle systems and undergone significant advancements. However, end-to-end deep learning-based LO techniques applied in vehicular positioning fall short of traditional approaches in performance. A novel end-to-end LO method named LAGLO is proposed, which is in accordance with the analysis of the range view of LiDAR point clouds. LAGLO comprises two key components: an Enhanced Temporal Network (ETN) with Local Feature Enhancement (LFE) and Global Motion Constraint (GMC), integrated with Motion Mode Attention (MMA). The ETN addresses the challenge of capturing temporal dependencies, thereby enabling more accurate predictions of motion. The GMC improves global vehicle localization by introducing motion-based constraints, which reduces drift in pose estimation. The MMA improves feature focus by capturing motion modes, thereby improving localization performance. LAGLO is the first method to combine traditional estimation techniques (e.g., optical flow and background segmentation) with deep learning LO using point cloud range views. In addition, LAGLO is the first deep learning-based LO method to introduce motion constraint. Furthermore, to address the limitations for applications in vehicular positioning systems, LAGLO supports both supervised and self-supervised training modes. For the self-supervised mode, a series of optimization strategies have been developed to enhance the algorithm's robustness in vehicle positioning. Experiments involving the public KITTI dataset validate the superior performance of LAGLO. LAGLO represents the latest advancement in end-to-end deep learning-based LO techniques for vehicle positioning using range views, and its training paradigm provides new insights for developing higher accuracy and reliability in automotive-grade deep learning-based LO for autonomous vehicular systems.},

The proposed ARReSVG framework incorporates an adaptive learning approach to address issues related to partial observability-based autonomous navigation effectively.

Additionally, the learned value-action policy implemented in the AAV alleviates the computational demands of real-time map-building. The ARReSVG framework leverages a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) to reduce computing complexity and accurately approximate the action-value function.

To enhance performance, we optimize cluster head selection and power allocation jointly, and devise a computationally efficient tailored-greedy algorithm that yields near-optimal performance. Additionally, a super-cluster formation protocol is proposed to further limit the overhead of successive interference cancellation (SIC). Simulation results reveal that in most of the considered scenarios, the joint uplink-donwlink NOMA scheme significantly outperforms orthogonal multiple access (OMA) in sum rate despite imperfect SIC, while reducing latency through simultaneous transmissions.

However, existing mobility models for UAV-aided communication with fixed-wing UAVs do not characterize the full UAV dynamics that needs to consider the forces manipulating the UAV as the model inputs. As a result, the planned trajectories are usually a sequence of non-smooth piece-wise line segments which are difficult to implement in practice for fixed-wing UAVs. To tackle this problem, a control-based design framework is proposed in this paper for fixed-wing UAVs by modeling their realistic dynamics in the three-dimensional (3D) space. By leveraging the state-space model, the trajectory optimization problem for fixed-wing UAV communication is formulated as a state-constrained optimal control problem, subject to the practical constraints on the UAV's flying speed, altitude and flight path angle. A solution method based on control parametrization is proposed, which converts the original infinite-dimensional optimization problem into a new finite-dimensional nonlinear program. With the proposed method, a smooth 3D UAV trajectory is obtained, which is easy to realize in practice by directly implementing the designed control variables such as thrust force and lift force. Extensive numerical examples are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed solution as compared to existing solutions.},

  abstract     = {Accurate vehicle localization relies on sensor measurements that may be prone to outliers. This results in an inherent trade-off between incorporating additional measurements to potentially achieve higher estimation accuracy at the risk of including outlier measurements. The Risk-Averse Performance Specified (RAPS) state estimation approach addresses this trade-off by optimally selecting a subset of measurements to minimize a cost related to outlier risk while achieving a target performance quantified as an information constraint. The existing literature lacks a computationally efficient method suitable for implementation in real-time applications such as transportation and does not address situations where the performance specification is infeasible. This article focuses on the Diagonal RAPS (DiagRAPS) formulation makes contributions in several directions. First, it develops DiagRAPS for both binary and non-binary measurement selection variables. Algorithms suitable for real-time applications are proposed within Linear Programming and Mixed-Integer Linear Programming optimization frameworks, achieving polynomial time-complexity. The convergence and computation costs of these algorithms are discussed. Second, a convex programming problem is derived for the binary DiagRAPS, enabling a globally optimal solution. Third, a soft constraint relaxation approach is introduced for situations where the specified performance is unfeasible. Experimental evaluations using real-world Gloabal Navigation Satellite Systems data from challenging urban environments demonstrate the efficacy of these approaches. The results reveal that the locally optimal approach achieves state estimation performance comparable to the global solution. Both binary and non-binary DiagRAPS outperform traditional methods, showing improvements in Society of Automotive Engineers requirements of at least 14% for horizontal and 22% for vertical.

  abstract     = {The usage of federated learning (FL) in Vehicular Ad hoc Networks (VANET) has garnered significant interest in research due to the advantages of reducing transmission overhead and protecting user privacy by communicating local dataset gradients instead of raw data. However, implementing FL in VANETs faces challenges, including limited communication resources, high vehicle mobility, and the statistical diversity of data distributions. In order to tackle these issues, this paper introduces a novel framework for hierarchical federated learning (HFL) over multi-hop clustering-based VANET. The proposed method utilizes a weighted combination of the average relative speed and cosine similarity of FL model parameters as a clustering metric to consider both data diversity and high vehicle mobility. This metric ensures convergence with minimum changes in cluster heads while tackling the complexities associated with non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data scenarios. Additionally, the framework includes a novel mechanism to manage seamless transitions of cluster heads (CHs), followed by transferring the most recent FL model parameter to the designated CH. Furthermore, the proposed approach considers the option of merging CHs, aiming to reduce their count and, consequently, mitigate associated overhead. Through extensive simulations, the proposed hierarchical federated learning over clustered VANET has been demonstrated to improve accuracy and convergence time significantly while maintaining an acceptable level of packet overhead compared to previously proposed clustering algorithms and non-clustered VANET.},

  abstract     = {Lane change of vehicle is considered to be one of the main factors causing traffic accidents. In the context of autonomous driving, the early prediction of cut-in movement of surrounding vehicles for autonomous vehicles is a key element to ensure a high-level of road safety. The accuracy of long-term trajectory prediction has always been a focus. Since driving intention is an important clue for vehicle trajectory prediction, a method of vehicle trajectory prediction based on intention query attention network with physical constraint is proposed this paper by using deep learning. The historical trajectory features of the target vehicle and surrounding vehicles are effectively extracted by the model based on the intention query mechanism, and the interaction between vehicles is captured by a multi-headed attention mechanism. In the end, the predicted trajectory of the target vehicle is generated by the decoder. Moreover, physical constraint losses are designed to constrain the longitudinal acceleration, lateral acceleration, longitudinal velocity, and the change in heading angle difference of the trajectory to generate trajectories that match the real world. The proposed model is trained on the NGSIM and highD dataset and compared with the state-of-the-art algorithms. In addition, Natural driving data matching Chinese road conditions are processed and ablation experiments are conducted based on this dataset to evaluate the effectiveness and robustness of our proposed approach. The experimental results show that the model proposed in this paper greatly improves the prediction effect of cut-in vehicle trajectory, which has important research significance for enhancing the safety of autonomous vehicles.},

The presence of the opportunistic-moving leader means that the leader maneuverably completes the human-assigned and real-time changing tasks (such as obstacle avoidance, target surrounding control) during the movement. To solve the above problem, we propose a hierarchical human-oriented opportunistic control (HHOOC) algorithm via using the intermittent human-computer interactions to satisfy the demands of humans for rest or reaction pauses. The presented algorithm can force the leader to complete the time-varying human-assigned tasks and control the followers to achieve the time-varying formation. In the HHOOC algorithm, the components constituting task information are known only to the humans, but not to the ASVs, which is beneficial to ensure the confidentiality and security of the task. Based on the theories of convex optimization and Lyapunov criteria, the sufficient conditions on the control gains are presented to guarantee the convergence to optimal solution. Finally, the effectiveness of the HHOOC algorithm is verified by several simulations.},

Effective human-machine collaboration and safe transition require the timely and accurate identification of the driver's takeover intentions. Given the challenges associated with the opacity of decision-making processes in standalone end-to-end models for inferring takeover intentions, this paper introduces an approach for inferring takeover intention based on driver-hand trajectory estimation, which leverages the physical and observable actions as an interpretable indicator. We first presented a comprehensive framework designed to acquire preliminary data on the driver's hand and steering wheel position. This framework utilized MediaPipe for the acquisition of hand coordinates, EfficientDet for steering wheel localization, and MiDaS for depth estimation. Then, the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) model was integrated into the Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) network (GRU-EKF) to estimate hand movements and subsequently predict takeover intention combining current-time trajectory with estimated future states. The approach was validated through simulated experiments of human-machine driving interaction. In addition, a further examination is conducted to analyze the influence of six distinct combinations of historical and estimation horizons on model performance. Results show that the GRU-EKF methodology outperforms other models in terms of overall performance metrics. Using shorter estimation horizons can lead to higher accuracy and precision, whereas increasing the estimation horizon to 3 s notably improves the model's ability to correctly classify different takeover intentions. The findings can offer valuable perspectives for the design and enhancement of takeover process functionalities of Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems.},

  abstract     = {This paper addresses the persistence and security problem of nonlinear distributed heterogeneous platoons during driving based on the discrete-time control barrier function (DCBF). Introducing a set of DCBF constraints in nonlinear distributed model predictive control (NDMPC) encodes persistent and safe behaviors as forward invariance of sets in the vehicle state space, enabling it to constrain the workshop distance and their electricity during driving simultaneously. To address the uncertainty of waiting time for vehicles at charging stations, the Markov decision process is introduced to optimize the charging strategy on the basis of ensuring the persistence, thereby reducing the time for vehicles to return to the end of the queue under speed limit conditions. By combining a set of constructed DCBFs with Markov decision processes and incorporating them into NDMPC, the dynamic behavior of heterogeneous platoon driving processes can be optimized. The vehicle will make a decision after each visit to a charging station, which can not only ensure that the vehicle reaches a charging station with shorter waiting time in queues before running out of battery but also ensure that the spacing between any two successive vehicles in the platoon is not less than the expected safe distance. The proposed improved NDMPC-DBCBF algorithm can ensure the persistence of all vehicles in the heterogeneous platoon during driving, improve the safety of vehicle following, and effectively solve the challenges brought by the uncertainty of waiting time at charging stations. Finally, an experimental simulation validates the feasibility of the suggested control algorithm.},

  abstract     = {There is a conflict between the long-term control horizon and the short-term control step due to the computational burden. In addition, the significant burden associated of controller tuning and noise rejection must be considered. According to different time scales between the translational and rotational motions of the vehicle, this paper proposes a two-time-scale control scheme to handle the conundrum. The computing load is lessened through transforming the trajectory tracking problem into two successive finite-horizon optimal control problems. In the outer-loop controller, the translational motion is regulated over an extended control horizon to generate a human-like tracking trajectory. In the inner-loop controller, the rotational motion is regulated based on a high-fidelity model to guarantee precise manipulation. Additionally, taking the side-slip angle into consideration, an MPC based output regulator (ORMPC) is proposed to improve the steering response to sharp curves. Theoretical analyses indicate that the proposed method provides a transient profile for trajectory tracking and ORMPC guarantees the convergence of yaw angle in curves. As a result, lateral jerk is reduced significantly and steering smoothness is improved. Simulation and experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method reduces the lateral jerk by an average of 50% and improves the ride comfort, parameter adaptability and noise rejection in different driving scenarios, compared with conventional methods.},

To address these challenges, we introduce a fully distributed hierarchical framework by decomposing the behavioral logic of self-organized swarm actions. The framework operates in two layers: the decision-making layer, where a dual transformation allows each UAV to compute optimal aggregation positions using only local information; and the control strategy layer, which ensures predefined-time convergence to assigned positions. This layered approach achieves efficient and scalable swarm formation without centralized optimization. Additionally, by incorporating individual velocity directions, collision avoidance is enhanced, leading to a reduced frequency of strategy activation and improved smoothness in the formation process. The control method also avoids singularities, ensuring robust, collision-free operation within user-defined timeframes. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed approach is validated through multiple simulation examples.},

  abstract     = {In intelligent transportation systems, traffic prediction constitutes the fundamental component of traffic optimization, aiming to precisely forecast traffic flow. Modeling spatio-temporal interactions is a crucial step in achieving long-term and accurate predictions. Traditional methods are mostly based on single-stream networks, which alternately extract spatio-temporal features through sequential iterations. However, time and space are inherently two different modalities. Employing a single-stream network to address multi-modal tasks is suboptimal. In this paper, we propose Spatio-Temporal Dual-Stream Graph Convolutional Networks and Transformers (STGCNFormer), a dual-stream network for traffic forecasting, decoupling spatio-temporal features in parallel through a temporal stream and a spatial stream. The core of STGCNFormer is a STGCNFormer block, comprising three components. The first component is a GCN block, which restricts the kernel of graph convolution and adopts Chebyshev polynomials of the first kind to approximate the convolutional kernel, capturing spatial interactions and achieving localized convolution. Secondly, we present a Transformer block, designed as a simplified version of vanilla Transformers, which captures temporal interactions and significantly reduces computational complexity. Thirdly, we propose a cross attention mechanism, consisting of a temporal attention mechanism and a spatial attention mechanism, which serves as a bidirectional bridge for sharing information between the dual streams. Experimental results demonstrate that STGCNFormer achieves superior prediction accuracy with reduced computational complexity compared with previous state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract     = {Positioning technologies are widely used in automotive, aviation, rail, and maritime safety-critical applications. Therefore, the computation of the probability of positioning failure for vehicles, which is the probability that the position estimator is outside a safety region, is of interest for positioning safety analyses. Since parameter estimation and statistical hypothesis testing for model misspecifications are commonly employed in positioning algorithms, the resulting position estimator is conditioned on the statistical hypothesis testing outcome. Hence, the probability density function (PDF) of the vehicle position estimator that accounts for the dependence between the two inference concepts should be used in the computations. In this contribution, we propose a method to compute the probability of positioning failure using the PDF of the vehicle position estimator, which accounts for the aforementioned dependence and is based on rare event simulation techniques, specifically Importance Sampling and the Cross-Entropy method. We apply the proposed method to a satellite-based positioning scenario, in decimeter precision, of an automated vehicle. The results show that the proposed method enables extensive positioning safety-analyses giving insights that can be used in the development of positioning algorithms and deciding whether safety targets and/or requirements are met. Finally, we discuss some limitations of the method and propose several further improvements.},

  abstract     = {Collaborative uncrewed vehicles affiliated with terrestrial or shipboard edge-stations with certain spectrums serving as a maritime relay platform have drawn more attentions. This paper focuses on the service migration orienting the costal ship broadband communication requirement supported by base stations and designs a multi-relay system. The multi-relay system is consist of multiple uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) and features content buffering and network encoding functions. Thanks to the capability of flexible storage and seamless integration with the flight control system, buffer can better facilitate the role of UAV-relay and -edge computing. And network encoding not only enhances the data-carrying capacity and reduce the forwarding rounds, but also can better slim down the data to be transmitted and alleviate the pressure on buffer. Correspondingly, a maritime communication model is proposed based on network encoding and multi-UAV-associated relay. Subsequently, a container migration algorithm based on UAV geo-position and resource information is proposed to adapt to the arbitrary velocities and navigation directions of ships. Numerous results testify the advantages of our proposed algorithm in terms of transmission rate, service migration efficiency and energy consumption.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, a model-free data-driven prescribed-time-performance (DDPTP) algorithm is developed for the underactuated autonomous surface vehicle (ASV). By defining a leader to provide the dynamic reference signal, the proposed DDPTP algorithm can achieve high-precision target tracking tasks while ensuring collision avoidance and connectivity between the leader and follower. A prescribed-time-performance function (PTPF) is designed for the ASV, featuring an adaptive shape and customizable convergence time. By using both real-time and historical data, a data-driven neural predictor (DDNP) is developed to estimate system uncertainties including unmodeled dynamics, unknown environmental disturbances and unknown input gains. An adaptive control law is employed based on the knowledge obtained from the DDNP, without relying on prior information about the motion model parameters. A switching dynamic event-triggered mechanism (SDETM) is introduced, which can switch between fixed-threshold triggering mechanism and dynamic event-triggered mechanism (DETM). Through this SDETM, not only are communication resources conserved, but frequent updates of the control signal are also mitigated. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is validated through verification simulations.},

It is not realistic in the actual practice of automatic train operation control. In this paper, a new finite-iteration constrained robust adaptive iterative learning control (FICRAILC) method is proposed. The proposed method can not only achieve finite-iteration convergence but also guarantee both overspeed protection and tailgating protection to ensure safety. Specifically, the number of iterations required for convergence can be obtained directly via calculation and can be flexibly adjusted according to the desired tracking control accuracy, adjustable controller parameters and initial system values. Moreover, a new control strategy that integrates the distance information of neighboring trains into the designed controller is constructed, which can adjust the distance with neighboring trains to always maintain a safe distance from neighboring trains. In addition, various uncertainties in the system are approximated and compensated by designing an iterative learning radial basis function neural network (RBFNN). To verify the availability of the proposed FICRAILC method further, simulations of a train operation control system similar to Chinese Railway HST is provided.},

And trajectory tracking is a key metric for assessing AUV performance and has received considerable focus. However, existing AUV trajectory tracking methods exhibit limitations in control accuracy, and demands substantial computational resources and time, thereby constraining their real-time applicability in dynamic environments. To tackle these challenges, this paper simplifies the AUV trajectory tracking problem into an inequality and equality constrained dynamic quadratic programming (IE-DQP) problem and introduces the zeroing neural network (ZNN) model to address it. Additionally, to reduce underwater noise disturbances, we propose the projection and elliptical ZNN (PEZNN) model, utilizing the Frobenius norm, and develop two projection functions that align with the physical constraints of AUVs. Collectively, we present the aforementioned approach as the AUV-TNN scheme. To assess its performance, we conduct rigorous mathematical derivations to demonstrate the convergence and robustness of the proposed scheme. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed approach is confirmed through three comprehensive simulated AUV trajectory tracking experiments.},

Initially, we propose the NWC-eco-driving strategy to optimize the trajectory of NWC-CAEVs by formulating an optimal control problem (OCP) and leveraging the Pontryagin's minimum principle (PMP) to solve it. Building on this, we develop the WC-eco-driving strategy to segmentally guide the trajectory optimization of WC-CAEVs, taking into account the availability of adequate charging. The results show that implementing the NWC-eco-driving strategy can achieve a significant reduction in energy consumption for NWC-CAEVs, up to 45% compared to the no control scenario. Moreover, the WC-eco-driving strategy outperforms the NWC-eco-driving strategy in the charging efficiency of WC-CAEVs, consequently resulting in a substantial net energy consumption reduction of up to 81.8% or more for higher market penetration rates (MPRs) of WC-CAEVs and wireless charging power. Through analyzing the space-time trajectories, the interferences between two types of CAEVs in mixed traffic flow are brought to light, further highlighting the advantages of the WC-eco-driving strategy. The performance of eco-driving strategies is also examined across various factors. The resultant findings underscore the effectiveness of the proposed eco-driving strategies in enhancing the energy efficiency of mixed traffic flow systems.},

In this paper, a robust network for super-resolution single-snapshot DOA estimation called DeepDOA is proposed. Different from other network-based DOA algorithms, DeepDOA takes the normalized real and imaginary parts of the received signal as inputs. Meanwhile, the network output is a vector instead of a spatial spectrum, and the corresponding spatial spectrum can be obtained by a simple transformation, which makes the spectrum smoother. Moreover, a sparse constraint is first introduced into the loss function, which improves the accuracy of the algorithm. Numerical simulations are conducted to verify its excellent performance.

One of the most studied vehicular applications for autonomous driving is platooning, for which all maneuvers are managed by the Platoon Leader (PL) with the aid of context information available through Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) messages. However, redundant context information from nearby vehicles in the platoon creates an additional workload for the platoon leader resulting in elevated computational costs. To overcome the challenge of redundant context information, the formation of vehicular micro-clouds can offload the platoon leader by enabling vehicles in a cluster to more effectively utilize the available context data through collective data processing and aggregation. The proposed solution, called Platoon Local Dynamic Map (P-LDM), creates a single database of context information, distributing the data aggregation load among all members of the platoon. Simulation results evaluate the collective perception enhancement and the distribution of the computational load, comparing the proposed scheme with usual Cooperative Perception mechanisms.},

  abstract     = {An important aspect of Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) is traveling in a platoon formation, which presents new technical challenges in the robust deployment of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). Vehicles taking part in the AV Platoons (AVPs) are mounted with sensors that gauge their immediate neighbors' proximity and relative speed. In a safe environment, AVP improves fuel and road capacity utilization, promoting overall traffic conditions. Nevertheless, AVPs are susceptible to a variety of cyberattacks. A deteriorated vehicle in an AVP can impair the platoon's overall stability and safety, potentially causing collisions. We propose a Sensor Attack Detection and Mitigation (SADM) mechanism in 5G-V2X networks to effectively identify and mitigate sensor attacks targeted toward such AVPs. SADM incorporates two key components: First, an Observer module that can accurately detect critical attacks from the anomaly of sensory data (e.g., LiDAR or RADAR sensors), and second, an Attack Mitigation module that prevents vehicles with compromised sensors from further disrupting the platoon or causing collisions. We benchmark our analytical formulation using extensive simulations performed on a state-of-the-art vehicular network simulator (SUMO) with customized extensions for platooning. The wireless network-specific features for simulating inter-vehicle communication are implemented using OMNet++ simulator. We demonstrate that SADM achieves 98% detection accuracy and 86% Area Under the Curve (AUC), operates with a 65% lower computational overhead, and reduces message transmission latency by 53% compared to state-of-the-art approaches.},

In this paper, a spatial-enhanced adaptive robust control strategy is proposed for CAVs to achieve integrated longitudinal and lateral merging operations. First, a spatial-dependent cooperative merging framework based on uncertain vehicle coupling dynamics is developed. The spatial dependence refers to a longitudinal and lateral safety corridor bonded to spatial locations, ensuring collision avoidance in the most critical merging conflict zone. Second, an adaptive robust control scheme for the underactuated system is designed using the Lyapunov min-max approach. Both uniform boundedness and uniform ultimate boundedness performance of the tracking errors are guaranteed, effectively attenuating the negative effects of time-varying uncertainties and collision avoidance. Finally, extensive validations are conducted to validate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed control strategy compared to baseline methods.},

However, the inherent communication delays in V2X technology can impact the speed control methods of connected and autonomous vehicle platoons. In this paper, we propose a novel speed control method for CAV platoons with time-varying delays to mitigate the effects of communication delays. First, considering the impact of communication delays on vehicle speed, we construct a linear control law for CAV platoons with time-varying delays based on a vehicle speed prediction model. Next, time-domain analysis and Lyapunov stability theory are used to prove the stability of the vehicle speed prediction model. Finally, numerical simulations are conducted under scenarios with and without time-varying delays, and the effects of the delay function form, control law form, and their parameters on the proposed speed control method are explored. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed linear control law for CAV platoons with time-varying delays effectively reduces the impact of communication delays, improving driving stability and enhancing road traffic safety.},

  abstract     = {This paper investigates the problem of target enclosing control for autonomous surface vehicles (ASVs) that a follower tracking around a moving target. Specifically, the abilities of prescribed performance control (PPC) and quantized communications are injected into the target enclosing controller. Main features of the proposed algorithm are that: First, for individual tracking level, the target enclosing radius distance and angular errors are constrained within user-defined bounds, to guarantee these errors not escape the predefined regions. Second, for coordination control level, the communications between the ASVs are quantized, which significantly reducing the communication load and saving network bandwidth. Third, only the yaw rate is needed to complete the target enclosing mission, and do not need the kinetics information, which is an advantage for practical applications. Furthermore, Lyapunov stability theory is used to prove the boundedness of the system. Both theoretical analysis and experimental test are given to demonstrate the validity of the presented target enclosing control strategy.},

  abstract     = {The advancement of Highly Automated Vehicles (HAVs) safety testing plays a crucial role in the large-scale deployment of Automated Driving Systems (ADS). Scenario-based testing has become increasingly popular due to its customizability and testing efficiency. Unfortunately, the scarcity of collected real-world scenario data constrains the construction of a high-coverage scenario library. It is of great value to make small data into Big Data by generating fresh new scenarios out of existing ones. A common approach is to use Data-driven Scenario Generation (DSG) methods. However, these methods suffer from some drawbacks, including the low quality of the generated scenarios (i.e., the scenario fidelity) and the lack of diversity and criticality compared to the original scenarios (i.e., the scenario directivity). These problems are mainly caused by the complex and dynamic nature of scenarios and the rarity of critical situations in naturalistic driving environment. To address those challenges, we propose a data-driven method named the Multi-vehicle Joint Trajectory Generator (MJTG), devised to selectively generate potentially feasible scenarios based on limited collected scenarios. The MJTG framework has demonstrated significant effectiveness in terms of fidelity and directivity. Generated scenarios exhibit over 85% compliance with functional check standards. Additionally, the framework excels in addressing directivity, resulting in a reduction of 0.66 seconds in the modified time-to-collision. Overall, the MJTG framework holds promising prospects in constructing high-coverage test-worthy scenario libraries and advancing the safety testing of HAVs.},

  abstract     = {Traditional physical layer security (PLS) schemes for multi-user visible light communication (MuVLC) are designed with multiple light sources, rendering them inapplicable to MuVLC with single light source. To address this limitation, we propose an innovative relay-aided PLS scheme based on cooperative jamming for MuVLC with single light source. First, we randomly select parts of relays for cooperative jamming, modeling their locations as a Poisson point process (PPP). Then, a jamming signal introduced through these selected relays significantly decreases the signal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratio of the randomly located eavesdroppers, thereby increasing the security capacity. By modeling the eavesdropper locations as another independent PPP, we analyze the security performance by deriving closed-form expressions for the cumulative distribution function of security capacity, security outage probability, its lower and upper bounds, and ergodic security capacity. These theoretical expressions are verified via Monte Carlo simulations. Numerical results show that our scheme achieves high-level communication security. Furthermore, increasing relay density, decreasing eavesdropper density, reducing target security capacity, or lowering relay plane height can effectively reduce security outage probability, offering valuable insights for designing secure MuVLC with single light source.},

  abstract     = {In the blockchain-aided mobile edge intelligence (B-MEI) network, base stations (BSs) each with an edge server not only execute tasks offloaded from users but also serve as blockchain nodes to ensure trustworthy data management of task execution in a decentralized manner. A challenging issue of B-MEI is that, both task execution and blockchain consensus demand significant computing resources. Insufficient resource allocation inevitably leads to resource wastage and even degrades system performance, especially in scenarios where task arrivals and wireless channels are dynamically changing. Driven by this issue, we first formulate the dynamic allocation of computing resources as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) to maximize the average transaction throughput of the B-MEI system. In particular, we find that, due to the time-consuming nature of blockchain consensus, the MDP rewards stemmed from the block generation is typically delayed and sparse. To address this issue, we propose a novel reinforcement learning algorithm, named Stable Hindsight Credit Assignment (SHCA), to effectively learn the stable credit assignment for sparse rewards across intermediate actions to optimize policy decisions. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm improves the average transaction throughput by 78% compared with the baseline algorithm.},

We first decompose the SEE into a linear function exploiting a quadratic transform. The uncertainty of the channels related to the Eve is approximated by using the S-Procedure.

This paper investigates cooperative downlink (DL) transmission from multiple LEO satellites by using distributed beamforming, considering the inevitable delay and Doppler compensation errors that impact coherent processing. Firstly, we establish the DL transmission signal model for multiple LEO satellites with delay and Doppler compensation errors. On this basis, we design the transmitters and receivers to maximize the average signal-to-leakage-plus-noise ratio. Then, we analyze the DL transmission performance via deriving lower bounds and closed-form expressions for both the user rate and the average rate gain of cooperative transmission compared to single LEO satellite transmission. We prove that as the number of receiving antennas at the UT increases, the impact of imperfect compensation on the user rate decreases, and the average rate gain improves. In addition, we prove that the UT can achieve the optimal average rate gain when its array response vectors corresponding to different LEO satellites are orthogonal. Simulations are performed and compared to the theoretical analysis, demonstrating the performance gains brought by distributed beamforming and validating our analysis.},

Recently, clustered cell-free networking has been proposed to avoid the cell-edge problem in current cellular networks and uniformize the rate performance of users. Under the practical consideration of providing rate guarantee for each single user and reducing the system complexity as much as possible, this paper investigates the clustered cell-free networking problem with the objective of maximizing the number of subnetworks under the individual rate constraints and the balance constraints of subnetworks. Such an optimization problem is NP-hard to solve with the key challenge arising from the interdependence between the number of balance constraints and the optimization objective, i.e., the solution space varies with the objective function. To address this challenge, we convert the balance constraints into a single constraint, based on which the problem is solved via relaxation and a balanced and individual-rate-guaranteed (BIRG) clustered cell-free networking algorithm is proposed. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed BIRG algorithm can provide rate guarantee for each user as well as produce balanced subnetworks, and outperform the state-of-the-art benchmarks.},

Expanding antenna element spacing is a common strategy to improve DOA resolution. However, excessively large spacing can cause signals from different directions to become indistinguishable, leading to DOA ambiguity. Traditional methods typically address DOA ambiguity through antenna array relocation or the use of multiple arrays. In multipath-based SLAM, however, the movement of the mobile agent naturally facilitates the movement of the receiver's array, allowing the use of high-resolution yet ambiguous DOA estimates. In this paper, we propose a splitting state transition model to handle DOA ambiguity and a novel amplitude measurement model to handle the high nonlinearity it introduces. Integrating these models within an existing Bayesian framework, we develop a message passing algorithm. Simulations demonstrate that the proposed method improves positioning and mapping performance, while exhibiting enhanced robustness against divergence.},

However, the dynamic wireless channel environment, random activities of ubiquitous IoT devices, and changeable distributions of packet arrivals make it hard to characterize and analyze the delay and reliability of GF access for URLLC service. In this paper, we develop a novel analytical framework to shed light on the puzzling relationship between delay and reliability of GF transmission for URLLC service from the perspective of Stochastic Network Calculus (SNC). Based on this framework, the statistical performance is characterized by a delay bound and a delay violation probability, and is achieved by exploiting SNC in the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) domain with the Mellin Transform of packet arrival and service processes.

Specifically, considering the impact of hardware impairments (HWIs), we investigate channel-aware configurations of the receive antennas at the base station (BS) and the active/passive elements at the HRIS to improve transmission reliability. To this end, we propose a penalty-based exact block coordinate descent (PEBCD) algorithm to address the mean-square-error (MSE) minimization problem for the dynamic HRIS-aided MISO system by jointly optimizing the BS receive antenna selection matrix, the reflection phase coefficients, the reflection amplitude matrix, and the mode selection matrix of the HRIS.

  abstract     = {Detecting weak targets is one of the main challenges for integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems. Sensing and communication suffer from a performance trade-off in ISAC systems. As the communication demand increases, sensing ability, especially weak target detection performance, will inevitably reduce. Traditional approaches fail to address this issue. In this paper, we develop a joint beamforming scheme and formulate it as a max-min problem to maximize the detection probability of the weakest target under the constraint of the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) of multi-user communication. An alternating optimization (AO) algorithm is developed for solving the complicated non-convex problem to obtain the joint beamformer. The proposed scheme can direct the transmit energy toward the multiple targets properly to ensure robust multi-target detection performance. Numerical results show that the proposed beamforming scheme can effectively increase the detection probability of the weakest target compared to baseline approaches while ensuring communication performance.},

In the multilateration method using wireless signals, the localization accuracy increases as the number of measurements increases. However, since UAVs have limited battery capacity, it becomes imperative to optimize the UAV's trajectory within a given search region. In this paper, we propose a circular trajectory for energy-limited UAV and provide an analysis on energy consumption and localization accuracy of the circular trajectory. Based on our analysis, optimized circular trajectory can be derived in closed-form according to the search region. The proposed method not only can achieve higher localization accuracy and energy efficiency, but also allows easier rescue planning in advance. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior localization accuracy compared to the conventional waypoint-based method, particularly when the energy capacity is limited.},

In this paper, we consider the AIRS-PIRS jointly aided wireless point-to-point communication system with two different deployment schemes in three-dimensional (3D) space. To balance the trade-off between the square-order beamforming gain of PIRS and the unique power amplification gain of AIRS, we optimize the elements allocation and beamforming design of the two IRSs under various practical constraints from a rate-maximization perspective. Moreover, we derive a series of element-related closed-form analytical expressions and compare the performance of the two schemes. Our analysis shows that in both schemes, PIRS should be allocated more elements than AIRS, and the received signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) increases asymptotically with the cube of the number of reflecting elements, when the distance between AIRS and PIRS is sufficiently large. Last, simulation results validate our analysis and indicate that both schemes can achieve superior rate performance over various benchmarks.},

Interestingly, our analysis indicates that the achievable communication covertness does not depend on the transmit power of Alice, which remains the same across the two phases for simplifying system implementation.

  abstract     = {The non-terrestrial networks (NTNs) are recognized as a key component to provide cost-effective and high-capacity ubiquitous connectivity in the future wireless communications. To improve the spectral efficiency in NTNs, rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) has attracted considerable attention. Nevertheless, the major issue of the considered system is to overcome security hurdles. In this paper, a robust secure precoding transmission scheme based on RSMA is proposed, which is the first time being used for high-altitude platform (HAP)-assisted satellite NTNs. The system features a low-Earth orbit satellite that serves multiple ground user equipments (GUEs) using a rate-splitting strategy, while a decode-and-forward HAP relay assists the satellite in establishing communication links with the GUEs. Assuming imperfect channel state information, we formulate an optimization problem to maximize the sum secrecy rate (SSR) of GUEs. The problem jointly optimizes the precoding vectors for both the satellite and the HAP relay, subject to constraints on their maximum transmit powers and the achievable secrecy rates for each GUE. Subsequently, leveraging successive convex approximation and semidefinite relaxation, we present an approach to transform the non-convex constraints into convex ones, enabling the precoding vectors to be obtained through an iterative procedure. Simulation results show that the RSMA can achieve SSR of up to 3.25 bps/Hz and 3.75 bps/Hz compared to non-orthogonal multiple access and time division multiple access, respectively.},

  abstract     = {Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-aided backscatter communication (BackCom) has recently attracted a lot of attention due to its potential to enhance energy efficiency (EE) and transmission robustness by reconstructing radio channel environments in a low-power-consumption way. However, most of the existing resource optimization approaches focused on perfect channel state information and ideal hardware conditions, so that the received signals may be distorted by channel uncertainties (e.g., channel estimation errors) and hardware impairments (HWIs) (e.g., distortion noises). To this end, we proposed a more realistic robust secure structure for a RIS-aided BackCom system with the consideration of channel uncertainties, HWIs, and one eavesdropper. Then, we formulate an EE-based maximization resource allocation problem by optimizing the transmit power of base station, the artificial noise power, the RIS's phase shift matrix, and the time slots. To tackle this non-convex problem, an iteration-based robust resource allocation algorithm is proposed by employing the worst-case approach, the variable substitution approach, and the alternating optimization approach. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm has 14.84% increase in the EE and 8.78% reduction in outage probability compared to the other algorithms.},

  abstract     = {This paper reveals the potential of movable antennas in enhancing anti-jamming communication. We consider a legitimate communication link in the presence of multiple jammers and propose deploying a movable antenna array at the receiver to combat jamming attacks. We formulate the problem as a signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio maximization, by jointly optimizing the receive beamforming and antenna element positioning. Due to the non-convexity and multi-fold difficulties from an optimization perspective, we develop a deep learning-based framework where beamforming is tackled as a Rayleigh quotient problem, while antenna positioning is addressed through multi-layer perceptron training. The neural network parameters are optimized using stochastic gradient descent to achieve effective jamming mitigation strategy, featuring offline training with marginal complexity for online inference. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves near-optimal anti-jamming performance thereby significantly improving the efficiency in strategy determination.},

The transmitted data symbols are detected using a noncoherent receiver, which utilizes the statistical knowledge of the channel states. Using the statistics of the received signal vector, an upper bound on the mutual information is obtained. A framework is provided to obtain the input probabilities that maximize the upper bound on the mutual information. From the numerical results, it is observed that at low signal-to-noise ratio values, the input probabilities are not uniform.

In particular, with fixed and dynamic power-splitting relaying (PSR) protocols, we analyze the system performance of a decode-and-forward (DF) EH relay network using a throughput metric with rate selection capability. It shows that employing a novel multi-rate scheme improves the throughput drastically over a single rate. Furthermore, we consider joint optimization of the PSR parameter denoted by $\rho$ and rate selection quality-of-service (RQ) parameter denoted by $\delta$, which determines the number of transmission rates in the feasible transmission range. In the case of statistical channel state information (CSI) availability, the joint optimization of PSR and RQ parameters is achieved through the 2D golden section search (2D-GSS) method. Closed-form expressions for the optimal $\rho$ and $\delta$ are obtained in case of instantaneous CSI availability. The numerical results demonstrate that the joint parameter optimization with instantaneous CSI provides better performance, and the obtained insights are crucial to improve quality-of-service in energy-constrained wireless networks.},

Furthermore, the UAV target can also adjust its flight route to move closer to/away from the L/U to improve/decrease the sensing performance. Due to the mobility of both the shipborne radars and UAVs, the Doppler shift effects of the RIS-ship channel need to be considered. In such a setup, the maximization of the received power at the L is formulated into an optimization problem while suppressing the received power at the U below a certain threshold by jointly designing the reflecting phase shifts of RIS and the 3D flight trajectory of UAV. The non-convex optimization problem is decomposed into two subproblems and solved via an iterative algorithm.

To address these challenges, the proposed RIS-TRMA leverages the concept of RIS phase shifter-based virtual multipath (VMP) channels. The VMP is utilized to enhance the TR effect where the number of multipath (i.e. the number of RIS elements) exceeds the number of non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) users.

However, the substantial computational demands of LAI models pose significant challenges for real-time communication scenarios. To address this, this paper proposes utilizing knowledge distillation (KD) techniques to extract and condense knowledge from LAI models, effectively reducing model complexity and computation latency. Nevertheless, the inherent complexity of LAI models leads to prolonged inference times during distillation, while their lack of channel awareness compromises the distillation performance. These limitations make standard KD methods unsuitable for task-oriented semantic communication scenarios. To address these issues, we propose a fast distillation method featuring a pre-stored compression mechanism that eliminates the need for repetitive inference, significantly improving efficiency. Furthermore, a channel adaptive module is incorporated to dynamically adjust the transmitted semantic information based on varying channel conditions, enhancing communication reliability and adaptability. In addition, an information bottleneck-based loss function is derived to guide the fast distillation process. Simulation results verify that the proposed scheme outperform baselines in term of task accuracy, model size, computation latency, and training data requirements.},

Most existing CLI mitigation schemes require sharing certain information among base stations (BSs) via backhaul links. This strategy is usually expensive and suffers high latency. Alternatively, we propose a pilot information sharing scheme based on over-the-air forwarding of the downlink pilot of the interfering BS to the interfered BS via a wireless terminal, along with a dedicated CLI channel estimation method. Simulation results demonstrate that thanks to the proposed pilot information sharing scheme the classic interference rejection combining (IRC) receiver achieves a signal detection performance highly comparable to that of the IRC detector with perfect pilot information, necessitating no information sharing among BSs via backhaul links. Furthermore, the proposed CLI channel estimation scheme reduces the impact of errors introduced by pilot forwarding, thereby improving the performance of both CLI channel estimation and signal detection.},

While centralized implementation of on-board MUD brings unaffordable complexity for a single UAV, this paper proposes to share and allocate the detection load among multiple UAVs for finest exploitation of cooperative processing power. Observing the inherent disparities among users under NOMA transmission, this paper first excavates the closed-form trade-offs between achievable sum-rate and the MUD load corresponding to the UAV-user matchings, which leads to a sum-rate maximization problem under payload constraints on processing complexity. To address the non-trivial integer matching, this paper develops a quadratic transformation to the original problem, and proves it an equivalent conversion through Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions. The problem is further simplified into a series of subproblems employing successive lower bound approximation which is proved to obtain polynomial-time complexity with good convergence. Numerical results show remarkable complexity reduction compared with centralized processing, as well as more than 10% sum-rate gain compared with other allocation methods.},

  abstract     = {Urban air mobility (UAM) is a revolutionary urban transportation paradigm that aims to transport passengers, emphasizing safety, power efficiency, and autonomous operation. Also, UAM aircraft needs to regularly transmit status and environmental conditions to the base stations (BS) to maintain updated information in the system. Hence, the age of information (AoI) can be used as a status measurement indicator to evaluate the degree to which the current status information of UAM aircraft is outdated. Optimizing each UAM aircraft's flight trajectory for both power efficiency and safety, while also minimizing the AoI for timely data transmission forms a computationally challenging NP-hard problem. In this paper, a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning based solution is proposed to address this problem by exploiting a sophisticated method to handle multidimensional decision spaces for power efficiency, safety in trajectory planning, and AoI. Simulation results demonstrate that our method produce a power efficiency improvement of 8.8% compared to the PPO method and 13.8% compare to the detour method. Furthermore, the proposed approach significantly improve the data freshness by up to 31.5%, 31.7%, and 12.9% in terms of AoI compared to the greedy, detour, and single PPO methods, respectively.},

However, the antenna position configuration inevitably increases computational complexity, presenting challenges under real-time configuration requirements, especially in vehicular communication systems characterized by rapidly time-varying channels. To address these issues, this paper investigates the classical weighted sum rate maximization problem and proposes an optimization-empowered neural network framework designed to accelerate convergence without compromising accuracy. Extensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed approach effectively mitigates the computational burdens associated with FAs, delivering superior performance in terms of convergence rate and system performance, thus paving the way for the deployment of next-generation FA-enabled communication systems.},

This network can provide support for a wide range of real-time applications where the computed results are critical.

This study investigates AoP-aware task offloading and resource allocation in a multi-UAV-assisted MEC system, optimizing the trade-off between user-experienced AoP and UAV energy consumption through joint design of user-UAV association, resource allocation, offloading ratios, and transmit power. To solve the formulated non-convex problem, we employ a cooperative Heterogeneous-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization (HAPPO) approach, utilizing a sequential policy update strategy within a centralized training, decentralized execution framework to mitigate inefficiencies from overlapping UAV coverage.

To mitigate accident and congestion risks, integrating advanced vehicular and communication technologies has facilitated the development of vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANETs). These networks enable vehicles to share real-time safety alerts with other vehicles and traffic authorities. However, open wireless links in VANETs are susceptible to security threats, making the authentication and integrity of transmitted safety alerts essential. Yan et al. addressed these needs with a hierarchical authentication scheme (IEEE Trans. on Veh. Tech., vol. 73, no. 1, 1253–1262, 2023). Unfortunately, the devised study identifies vulnerabilities in Yan et al.’s design, specifically concerning forgery and anonymity exposure attacks. In response, an improved, secure hierarchical authentication scheme is proposed. Through both formal and informal security analyses, it is demonstrated to be resilient against various practical attacks. A thorough performance evaluation further supports the design's practical suitability for deployment within VANET infrastructure, offering enhanced security for safer transportation networks.},

As a core component of vehicular metaverses, Vehicle Twins (VTs) are digital twins that cover the entire life cycle of vehicles, providing immersive virtual services for Vehicular Metaverse Users (VMUs). Vehicles with limited resources offload the computationally intensive tasks of constructing and updating VTs to edge servers and migrate VTs between these servers, ensuring seamless and immersive experiences for VMUs. However, the high mobility of vehicles, uneven deployment of edge servers, and potential security threats pose challenges to achieving efficient and reliable VT migrations. To address these issues, we propose a secure and reliable VT migration framework in vehicular metaverses. Specifically, we design a two-layer trust evaluation model to comprehensively evaluate the reputation value of edge servers in the network communication and interaction layers. Then, we model the VT migration problem as a partially observable Markov decision process and design a hybrid-Generative Diffusion Model (GDM) algorithm based on deep reinforcement learning to generate optimal migration decisions by taking hybrid actions (i.e., continuous actions and discrete actions). Numerical results demonstrate that the hybrid-GDM algorithm outperforms the baseline algorithms, showing strong adaptability in various settings and highlighting the potential of the hybrid-GDM algorithm for addressing various optimization issues in vehicular metaverses.},

Meanwhile, considering that the UAV-UGV swarm is susceptible to the propagation of incorrect neighbors' information and false input signals (called Byzantine attacks), which is effectively reinterpreted as the management of unknown variables within the control inputs, an optimal control method under the reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm is investigated to against the aggressive Byzantine attacks. Furthermore, the neural network (NN) is employed to approximate the Byzantine attacks and unknown terms arising from the leader's dynamics and Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation, and the actor and critic adaptive laws are designed in actor-critic-identifier architecture. Subsequently, an optimal tracking control scheme is proposed to ensure fully distributed collaborative tracking of the UAV-UGV formation under Byzantine attacks.

In this paper, a distributed microservice deployment strategy in satellite edge computing networks is proposed by taking into account time-varying satellite network topology and diverse satellite resources. Specifically, we formulate the deployment problem as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) to minimize the load imbalance as well as the service latency. A distributed multi-agent reinforcement learning (DMARL) scheme is proposed for learning a dynamic deployment strategy. Furthermore, to accommodate more microservices in SFC, a novel attention-based actor-critic strategy is designed to significantly accelerate the convergence of network training.

  abstract     = {The heterogeneous vehicular networks (HVNs) integrate various radio access technologies to enhance user capacity, coverage, and quality of experience. However, the rapid topology changes in HVNs make it challenging for traditional encryption methods that rely on trusted third parties (TTPs) to store, manage, and distribute keys. Physical layer security (PLS) technology emerges as a powerful complementary solution due to its capabilities in key generation and distribution without relying on TTPs. Therefore, we derive two PLS metrics for HVNs, connection outage probability (COP) and secrecy outage probability (SOP). Based on these metrics, we propose an adaptive network selection method which enhances PLS by identifying and selecting the network that is optimal secure and reliable. Specifically, to characterize the irregularity and randomness of HVNs, Poisson point processes and Poisson line processes are adopted to build a spatial model for HVNs. Then, we derive closed-form expressions for COP and SOP in HVNs, which characterize the connectivity stability and security of networks. Furthermore, we apply fuzzy logic to filter available networks, aiming at reducing computational latency. Analytic hierarchy process and entropy weight method are utilized to quantitatively analyze the diverse requirements of in-vehicle services and network metrics. Finally, the technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution is used to accurately select the optimal network from the filtered candidates, enhancing the stability and security of vehicle communication in HVNs. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed method significantly enhances the PLS of HVNs, achieving a maximum of roughly 22.29% improvement in SOP and an average increase of 29.58% in COP performance compared to conventional methods.},

  abstract     = {The Vehicular Social Network (VSN) seamlessly combines social networks with the Internet of Vehicles (IoVs), fostering social connections not only among the drivers but also among the vehicles themselves. VSN security profiling helps in comprehending and ranking VSN security risks according to a range of criteria. The existing approaches to VSN security profiling and risk quantification have notable limitations. Firstly, they often overlook the intensity of interactions between VSN devices. Secondly, these methods require re-evaluation of security scores and the likelihood of attacks whenever VSN configurations change. Additionally, most current risk quantification methods cannot concurrently assess risks across multiple networks, further limiting their utility. Given these challenges, this work focuses on VSN security profiling quantitatively based on users accounts because various types of accounts are used for security control mechanisms. To address these issues, we first propose Distributed Accounts Association Algorithms (D-AAA) for matching service accounts with malicious accounts based on Gromov-Wasserstein (GW) metric, and apply accounts matching results to sort service accounts by vulnerability and compute the average risk for multiple service VSN networks. To verify the proposed D-AAA, the performance of the proposed D-AAA is evaluated through numerical experiments, including an assessment of computational complexities, association correctness, and risk evaluations. Additionally, the D-AAA are compared with other graph matching methods in terms of association correctness and runtime with real VSN datasets.},

  abstract     = {This paper investigates the joint service placement and model partitioning problem for accelerating DNN inference in edge intelligence empowered vehicle networks, considering the vehicle mobility and the caching capability of Road Side Unit (RSU). To avoid the degradation of DNN inference performance due to the cold start during the vehicle's service node switching, we propose three different service placement solutions, including processing locally, directly selecting one RSU as server node for collaborative offloading, and selecting one RSU as relay to maintain the connection with original server node. We model the RSU network as an undirected weighted graph and formulate an optimization problem to minimize the DNN inference latency by jointly optimizing the DNN service placement and DNN model partitioning. To solve this problem, we propose a Graph Neural Network Reinforcement learning-based service Placement and model Partitioning algorithm (GRPP). Initially, we extract the feature embedding of RSU nodes and obtain the DNN service placement solution based on Graph Neural Network (GNN). Furthermore, we design a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) to generate the DNN model partitioning point. Specifically, the parameters of GNN and MLP are learned through an actor-critic based reinforcement learning structure. Finally, we generate the simulation model via traffic simulator Simulation for Urban MObility (SUMO) and give a comprehensive performance evaluation. Simulation results indicate that our proposed scheme can decrease the DNN inference latency by up to 64.51% compared with the benchmark.},

However, implementing FL in vehicular edge computing (VEC) presents various challenges, such as dropout effect, straggler effect and inefficient communication. Moreover, the dynamic and volatile nature of vehicles in VEC-enabled mobile volatile federated edge learning (VFEL) systems exacerbates these challenges. In this paper, we focus on the volatility in mobile VFEL systems, modeling the dropout problem with vehicles' local computation and communication volatility rates. We formulate the objective to optimize system reliability and learning cost, converting it into a Markov decision process considering environmental dynamics. To achieve the optimal vehicle selection and resource allocation scheme, we propose a reliability-aware twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient (RA-TD3) scheme by combining the twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient (TD3) algorithm and convex optimization. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed RA-TD3 scheme improves the success rate and reduces the learning cost while maintaining higher learning accuracy.},

  abstract     = {With the continuous development of communication industry, the demand for spectrum resources is gradually increasing. Simultaneously, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been extensively studied as a means to assist with traffic offloading by establishing wireless links between base stations (BSs) and UAVs. However, the current spectrum resources are limited and far from optimal utilization. In response to this situation, cognitive radio (CR) technology and non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) technologies have been proposed to enhance the efficient utilization of spectrum resources. In this paper, we address the challenge of using CR technology to assist UAVs in traffic offloading within specific areas. At each instance, the UAV must consider the allocation of time for data collection, traffic transmission, and UAV charging. Given the dynamic nature of spectrum resources, UAVs must make adaptive decisions based on the current conditions. Finally, we model the aforementioned issues as a quantum reinforcement learning (QRL) system to expedite the training process. In particular, we design a quantum soft actor-critic algorithm employing a variable quantum circuit (VQC) and encode the experience data into a quantum summation tree while transforming it into a quantum priority experience replay buffer. Simulation results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed framework.},

  abstract     = {In the contemporary landscape of vehicular networks, characterized by disruptive innovations such as autonomous driving, real-time traffic monitoring, and integrated infotainment services, there is a greater need for substantial computational power and precise operations. To cope with such demand, mobile edge computing (MEC) emerges as a pivotal mechanism that can boost the capacities of vehicular networks, leveraging edge servers, offering ultralow latency, and providing support for operations requiring near real-time access to rapidly growing and varying data. In this paper, we exploit deep reinforcement learning (DRL) techniques to minimize the overall service delay of the vehicle in a vehicular network using MEC. We propose a dual-stage DRL-assisted resource optimization strategy; firstly, the strategy optimizes the transmit power of the vehicle using the deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithm after the vehicle initiates computational offloading, which contributes to minimizing the propagation delay. Secondly, once the data are transferred to the roadside unit (RSU), the strategy uses the deep Q-network (DQN) algorithm to allocate an optimal number of processing cores for computational tasks, thus minimizing the computational delay. Additionally, we present the energy efficiency (EE) and spectral efficiency (SE) analysis of the vehicle to examine the trade-off between the EE and SE. We compare the performance of the proposed strategy against the benchmark schemes, including always offload, never offload, random offload, and deep neural network (DNN)–based cooperative offloading schemes. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed resource allocation strategy outperforms the benchmark schemes and improves the system performance by reducing the overall service delay.},

To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel unsupervised method, Dynamic Network Representation learning (DNR), that leverages the advances in the network field and adapts them to transportation. DNR constructs a dynamic network from the perspective of vehicle social networks using the idea of the k-nearest neighbors. A dynamic walk algorithm is proposed to sample nodes and context over time, focusing on topology changes. DNR embeds the network using Skip-Gram network representation and incremental learning to obtain two trajectory embeddings for two anomaly types. Our experiments on four real-world datasets and eight generative datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of DNR over other methods and reveal its rationality to detect deviations from typical trajectories.},

  abstract     = {Future vehicular edge computing (VEC) networks are projected to generate massive amounts of computation tasks which exhibit dynamic spatio-temporal heterogeneity. Vehicular users will greatly benefit if the VEC network provides the following information a priori: a) estimates of the delays along the paths and b) amounts of network resources that will be assigned. Existing works did not provide such prior information and only dealt with real-time computation offloading. In this paper, we propose a novel distributed computation offloading strategy in which the vehicular users independently make proactive service reservations across the road side units (RSUs) along their paths. Such reservations are based on the computation offloading delays reported by the RSUs. These delays depend on the optimal network resources assigned by the RSUs to the vehicular users over different reservation slots. In order to determine the optimal assignment of network resources, we propose a new multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) problem where the RSUs act as agents. The objective of the MADRL problem is to maximize the mean number of offloaded tasks. This objective is found as the outcome of the proactive service reservation problem solved by each vehicular user when it is injected into the VEC network. The MADRL problem is approximated using a centralized-critic-distributed-actors model. The proactive service reservation introduces time coupling in the calculation of the rewards, therefore a novel training algorithm is proposed for solving the MADRL problem. Compared to some benchmark real-time computation offloading schemes, the proposed work benefited the vehicular users significantly by providing prior estimates of the delays along their paths. Specifically, the percentage of offloaded tasks achieving the highest utility was $14-20\,\%$ higher, b) the computation offloading delays experienced by the vehicular users along the path were the lowest, and c) the utilization of network resources was lowest compared to the benchmark schemes.},

  abstract     = {Parked-assisted vehicular edge computing (PVEC) fully leverages communication and computing resources of parking vehicles, thereby significantly alleviating the pressure on edge servers. However, resource sharing and trading for vehicular task offloading in the PVEC environment usually occur between untrustworthy entities, which compromises the security of data sharing and transactions by vehicles and edge devices. To address these concerns, blockchain is introduced to provide a secure and trustworthy environment for offloading and transactions in PVEC. Nevertheless, due to the mobility of the vehicles, the processes of computing offloading and blockchain transactions are interrupted, which greatly reduces the reliability of the blockchain in edge computing process. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based PVEC (BPVEC) offloading framework to enhance the security and reliability of the task offloading and transaction. Specifically, a consensus node selection algorithm based on the connected dominating set (CDS) is designed to improve the Hotstuff consensus according to parking duration, computing capability and communication quality, which enhances blockchain reliability in computing offloading and transactions. Meanwhile, a Stackelberg game model, establishing the roadside units (RSUs) and parking vehicles (PVs) as leaders and the requesting vehicles (RVs) as follower, is utilized to optimize the offloading strategy and pricing. Subsequently, a BPVEC offloading strategy algorithm with gradient descent method is designed to maximize system revenue.

As a solution, Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC) extends computing resources to the edge of the network to reduce processing delays and improve user experience. However, in dynamically changing edge computing environments, effective decision making on whether to offload tasks to edge servers remains a core challenge. For this purpose, we propose MRLATO, an adaptive task offloading mechanism based on Meta Reinforcement Learning (MRL), which exploits a large amount of a priori knowledge of different tasks to achieve fast adaptation. The task offloading process is modelled as multiple Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) and solved using a Sequence to Sequence (Seq2Seq) neural network integrating multi-head attention and recursive task sequencing. It is shown by the experimental results that the proposed method has the lowest latency in all experimental settings and the convergence efficiency is improved by 14.06% compared to the traditional Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithm. This research fully demonstrates the significant benefits of the deep integration of MRL with the edge computing domain, providing new optimisation ideas for task offloading decisions.},

But research on performance bounds for compressive parameter estimation in CS radar systems is insufficient. This paper proposes the global bounds for compressive time delay estimation in CS radar, utilizing Shannon information theory. Specifically, we define the indicators of the time delay entropy error (TDEE) and time delay information (TDI) to evaluate the compressive time delay estimation performance. The theoretically derived TDEE and TDI provide the global lower and upper bounds for the estimation performance, respectively. Moreover, we deduce the asymptotic lower bound for TDEE and the asymptotic upper bound for TDI. The asymptotic lower bound and the derived Cramér-Rao bound are identical. The theoretical analyses show that the asymptotic lower bound is inversely proportional to the square of the compression ratio (CR), while the asymptotic upper bound is directly proportional to the logarithm of CR, reflecting the trade-off between compression level and estimation performance. Particularly, the TDEE and TDI do not depend on CR in low SNR. Simulation results illustrate the obvious advantages of TDEE over the Cramér-Rao bound on evaluating and predicting the time delay estimation performance for CS radar.},

  abstract     = {In addition to the autonomous driving technology of single vehicles, the inter-group control algorithm serving the data sharing of multi-vehicle cooperative driving has also attracted widespread attention. To ensure secure communication, many encryption schemes have been proposed to protect the interaction data between vehicles. Nevertheless, traditional public key encryption schemes hinder the sharing of encrypted data. Based on the premise of ensuring the confidentiality of encrypted information, in order to facilitate efficient data sharing, conduct data searches across extensive cloud-based datasets, and authorize access under specified conditions, we introduce Fine-Grained Access Control with Privacy-Preserving Data Retrieval (FGAC-PPDR) for the Internet of Vehicles. This scheme offers a secure, flexible, and privacy-centric approach to data sharing for groups of vehicles in the IoV. Our proposed scheme enables encrypted data to be retrieved at the group level by the cloud server, and prevents vehicles outside the group from performing equality tests on the ciphertext. Furthermore, the data owner can create an authorization token with defined conditions to specify how the data is shared. During the process of data search and sharing, intensive computing tasks are undertaken by cloud servers with abundant computational resources. We also demonstrate that our scheme is secure against chosen ciphertext attacks (CCA). Finally, we provide security and performance analyses that verify the feasibility and effectiveness of our proposal.},

  abstract     = {The collaboration of computing powers (CPs) among uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs)-mounted edge servers is essential to handle data-intensive tasks of user equipments (UEs). This paper presents a multi-UAV computing power network (CPN) that orchestrates the CP resources of edge servers to cooperatively process tasks through collaborative computing. Due to the frequent interactions among edge servers and the increased complexities for large-scale task executions, we propose a digital twin (DT)-driven multi-UAV CPN framework, where the aerial DT network is created as a digital replica of the multi-UAV network to assist collaborative computing. A joint optimization problem of the service association, offloading power control, task partitions, CP allocation, and UAV trajectory design is formulated to minimize the long-term average delay of UEs. We use the Lyapunov technique to tackle the long-term energy constraint, forming a tractable optimization problem, which is modeled as a Markov decision process to balance the UAV's deficit queue stability and the UE's task completion delay. A hybrid soft actor-critic based deep reinforcement learning algorithm is developed to optimize the joint design by sampling the hybrid action from the Gumbel and Gaussian distributions. Simulation results verify that the multi-UAV CPN contributes to significant performance gains when supported by DTs.},

By assigning positive and negative edge weights (cooperative and antagonistic interactions) to the interaction topology among agents, formation splitting can be achieved without the need to plan multiple leaders' trajectories. In addition, considering that communication attacks will inevitably cause damage to the cooperation-antagonism network, as well as the impact of multiplicative faults on control inputs, it is crucial to design a control protocol that does not rely on global topology and contains dynamic gain. Thus, based on gauge transformation and adaptive mechanism, a fully distributed secure fault-tolerant formation splitting control protocol is designed. Considering that the energy of attackers is usually limited, based on a slowly switching mechanism, the sufficient conditions to ensure the implementation of secure fault-tolerant formation splitting under different degrees of communication attacks are provided.

  abstract     = {After the natural disasters, establishing a reliable and resilient emergency communication network is crucial, particularly when conventional infrastructure, such as base stations fail. Flying Ad Hoc Networks (FANETs) that leverage multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), offer a superior alternative to single UAVs by enabling dynamic, cooperative communication (CC) that extends operational range and enhances mission capabilities in disaster zones. Cooperative transmission improves communication reliability and data rates while reducing delays by mitigating wireless channel impairments due to mobility in FANETs. Selecting the optimal relay is crucial in cooperative communication, as it can significantly enhance both communication reliability and overall system efficiency. The primary contribution of this work is the development of a cooperative MAC protocol with an optimal relay selection algorithm tailored for FANETs in disaster scenarios. This algorithm, incorporating a utility backoff process, is built on a realistic network model that accounts for SNR, distance, and mobility. The random-access approach was adopted due to the limitations of IEEE 802.11 standards in supporting cooperative communication. Consequently, new control packets were developed, and existing control formats were revised to enable effective cooperation. To evaluate the proposed protocol, an analytical Markov Chain model was developed and validated through simulation. Performance-influencing parameters were considered, and relationships between various parameters and performance metrics were analyzed, including different fading channels, bit error rates and system outage probability. The numerical results show that the protocol significantly enhances performance by increasing throughput, enhancing communication reliability through reduced packet dropping rates, and decreasing transmission delays.},

  abstract     = {Augmented reality (AR) enhances human perception by overlaying digital information in the real environment and can be applied to various fields such as education, healthcare, and industry. To relieve the computing pressure of resource-limited AR devices, edge assisted AR has attracted significant attention in recent years. It enables AR devices to offload the computation-intensive environment analysis tasks to the edge server and to download the point-based 3D virtual objects for rendering. Although this method can effectively reduce the processing latency, it may introduce a long transmission latency. To address this issue, this work proposes a semantic communication empowered edge assisted AR to reduce the quality of experience (QoE)-aware latency. To this end, the AR devices first utilize an image encoder to extract semantic features of source images. Due to the importance difference of extracted features and limited communication resources, the feature selection and bandwidth allocation are explored to improve transmission efficiency. In addition, when the edge server completes the generation of point-based 3D virtual objects, it employs a transformer-based encoder to mask a proportion of points and learn a high-level representation of unmasked points. In this way, low-complexity semantic information of 3D objects is sent to the AR devices, which can reduce the transmission overhead of 3D objects. Moreover, the mask ratio of the point encoder is further optimized to balance the reconstructed quality and transmission latency of 3D objects. Therefore, this work aims to minimize the overall QoE-aware latency of edge assisted AR by jointly optimizing the semantic feature selection, mask ratio, and bandwidth allocation. A convex-based improved Harris Hawks optimization algorithm is designed to solve the formulated problem. Experimental results demonstrate that our semantic communication empowered edge assisted AR can effectively reduce the overall latency and outperform the other baselines.},

Traditional single-satellite positioning relies on the accumulative measurement over a segment of the trajectory, resulting in a long response time. In this paper, we propose a novel single-satellite positioning scheme, achieving instant positioning through the joint use of time-frequency Doppler analysis of signals and communication beam switching. First, through wide beam reception, range and velocity information are extracted using interpolation enhanced parameter estimation to determine candidate coordinates. To eliminate ambiguity in this process, further disambiguation is achieved through the high directivity of the narrow beam. The proposed scheme is proved to reach the Cramér-Rao lower bound (CRLB) while achieving real-time positioning with the central limit theorem (CLT). Simulation results indicate that at a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 17 dB, the probability of positioning error being lower than 50 meters can reach 97.5%, demonstrating performance comparable to existing schemes.},

A comprehensive analysis of the phase errors arising from these imperfections is conducted, leading to the development of a robust analytical model that quantitatively incorporates these errors into the assessment of received power evaluations. Subsequently, we propose a methodology to selectively exclude RIS elements that are prone to errors, thereby improving the phase alignment of the received signal and enhancing overall system efficiency. While this strategy leads to a marginal decrease in received power, Bayesian Optimization (BO) is employed to optimize the RIS configuration, maintaining the desired power levels and ensuring signal integrity. The research also delves into the complexities introduced by shadowing effects combined with phase errors. To address these compounded challenges, a decision-making framework utilizing targeted BO is introduced to dynamically optimize RIS configurations, thereby enhancing system robustness and performance under adverse operational conditions. Numerical simulations validate the framework's efficacy in adaptively managing RIS elements, ensuring robust signal integrity and improved reception despite variations stemming from environmental and hardware factors.

  abstract     = {This paper investigates the sum rate maximization problem in dense small cell (DSC) networks, where multi-antenna small cell base stations (SBSs) serve single-antenna users over a shared frequency band using noncoherent joint transmission (JT). While noncoherent JT enhances capacity by enabling users to receive signals from multiple coordinated SBSs, its practical deployment is hindered by the nonconvex and NP-hard nature of the optimization problem, along with the high-dimensional continuous optimization variables. Existing optimization-based approaches, despite achieving near-optimal performance, require global channel state information (CSI) and multiple iterations, making them impractical for DSC networks. To overcome these challenges, we first prove that the optimal beamforming structure is the same for both the power minimization problem and the sum rate maximization problem, and then mathematically derive the optimal beamforming structure for both problems by solving the power minimization problem. The optimal beamforming structure can effectively reduces the variable dimensions. By exploiting the optimal beamforming structure, we propose a deep deterministic policy gradient-based distributed noncoherent JT scheme to maximize the system sum rate. In the proposed scheme, each SBS utilizes global information for training and uses local CSI to determine beamforming vectors. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme achieves comparable performance with considerably lower computational complexity and information overhead compared to centralized iterative optimization-based techniques, making it more attractive for practical deployment.},

In this paper, we propose a novel multi-user semantic communication framework based on deep over-the-air computation called SC-DAC to tackle this challenge. By integrating communication and computation through a deep over-the-air computation (AirComp) encoder, SC-DAC is able to utilize the superposition of multiple access channels, facilitating multi-user information fusion during transmission and eliminating the need for multi-user detection at the receiver. Further, to achieve the optimal task results, the semantic encoders, decoders, and AirComp encoder are jointly optimized, where stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithm and deep double-Q network (DDQN) are employed to optimize the encoder/decoder parameters. The simulation results demonstrate that as the number of users increased, the performance of the system remains relatively stable and shows potential in resource utilization. What's more, when applied to the AI-based tasks such as multi-user multi-modal action recognition and semantic segmentation, SC-DAC enhances the accuracy of action recognition by 26% compared with traditional methods and by about 30%-50% compared with other multi-user semantic communication methods under conditions of low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), while it enhances the accuracy of semantic segmentation by 0.22 to 0.32 compared to other methods.},

  abstract     = {The evolution towards 6G communication technology heightens the demand for data freshness. Consequently, Age of Information (AoI), a key metric quantifying data freshness, has raised significant attention from academia and industry. This paper investigates a Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC) network with multiple servers designed to support mission-critical, low-latency computational services. To meet stringent latency requirements, we employ finite blocklength (FBL) codes for data transmissions during the task offloading. Our focus is on minimizing the average AoI of the MEC system via system scheduling, which is particularly crucial for recently emerged applications such as health monitoring systems, automatic driving systems and intelligent factory inspection system. We characterize the transmission reliability with FBL codes in the communication phase. Using extreme value theory, we analyze the occurrence of extreme queue length violations during the computation time phase. Based on the characterizations, we develop an optimal framework incorporating server selection and scheduling strategies for minimizing the average AoI. Via numerical simulations, we validate our algorithm's effectiveness in enhancing AoI performance, demonstrate how varying parameters affect system performance, and illustrate the potential of our method for guiding future MEC system designs.},

  abstract     = {Terahertz (THz) communication technology, with its ultra-high bandwidth, high transmission rate, and low latency characteristics, has become one of the key technologies for future 6G mobile communication. However, as the frequency increases, phase noise between transceiver channels becomes more pronounced, significantly limiting the performance of THz communication systems. This paper presents a novel galaxy quadrature amplitude modulation (GQAM) design to mitigate the impact of phase noise for phase noise dominated THz communication. By adjusting the distribution of constellation points on the two-arm spiral, adaptive modulation can be achieved under different levels of phase noise. Furthermore, we designed a demodulation scheme that takes into account the impact of phase noise and developed a neighboring constellation points search algorithm to simplify the demodulation process for higher-order constellations. Simulation and experimental results indicate that the proposed constellation can effectively overcome the impact of phase noise in various noise environments, and it outperforms other constellations such as quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) and spiral quadrature amplitude modulation (SQAM).},

The realistic geometry-based stochastic channel (GBSC) models with non-Kronecker structures differ significantly from the emulated channels generated using the prefaded signal synthesis (PFS) method with Kronecker structures, making single-end spatial-correlation emulation inadequate for accurately characterizing radio links. To address this problem, we propose a joint spatial-correlation metric to assess end-to-end link characteristics, applicable for various channel reconstruction techniques, including both the classic PFS and non-Kronecker structured PFS (NKSPFS) methods. Additionally, to efficiently update time-variant probe weights and bypass time-consuming optimization in dynamic channel emulations, we propose a fast weighting method based on a closed-form solution for unknown weights, specifically tailored for the NKSPFS method. The proposed metric and probe weighting strategy are validated through simulations. The results demonstrate that our methods significantly enhance the accuracy of link emulation and reduce the computational complexity for reconstructing massive MIMO channels over mmWave frequency bands.},

In this paper, we propose a novel non-stationary vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) wideband channel model with the aid of environment construction including in-lane cars' mobility and roadside obstacles, which can emulate the dynamic evolutionary V2V environments. Regarding the in-lane cars, they are abstracted into clusters and their mobility behaviors including acceleration/deceleration car-following and lane-changing motions, are modeled based on the Krauss model and Bézier curve, respectively. Besides, the blockage of line-of-sight (LoS) links by other cars is computed by the knife-edge diffraction theory. In terms of the roadside static obstacle clusters, their spatial positions are characterized by the Poisson point process (PPP) located within the maximal radio coverage, defined by the ellipsoid region restricted by the maximal propagation delay. The roadside cluster generation/recombination process is affected by transceivers' relative speed difference and distance-related link probability. On this basis, the dynamic evolutionary non-stationary V2V channel impulse response (CIR) is obtained and the corresponding power density profiles in the space-time-frequency domains are realized by using the signal reconstructing theory. In the simulation section, the impacts of some key parameters, like vehicular speeds and obstacle intensity factor, on the channel characteristics are sufficiently explored. Furthermore, we verify our proposal based on actual measured data from the aspects of delay spread. Our proposal provides some assistance and insights into the optimization of vehicular communication systems.},

The designed antenna consists of four helical radiating arms and a feed network. The antenna unit achieves low-profile characteristics mainly by folding and bending the radiating arms. Compared with the traditional QHA, the profile of the proposed antenna is reduced by 84.4%, with a height of only 13.4 mm (0.07λ). The designed feed network provides the QHA with equal amplitude and sequential 90° phase difference in the desired operating frequency band. The antenna prototype is realized by using 3D dielectric printing and post-metallization technology. The measured results show that the proposed QHA works in 1.558-1.644 GHz, fully covering the B1 band of the BeiDou satellite navigation. Typically, at 1.575 GHz, the antenna's RHCP 3-dB beamwidth is 122°, with a 3-dB axial ratio (AR) beamwidth of 144°, providing a wide signal coverage range in the upper hemisphere. The proposed spring-shaped QHA exhibits good circularly polarized radiation performance and has the advantages of low cost and low profile, which is a promising candidate to ease the antenna integration into a compact satellite navigation platform of vehicles.},

  abstract     = {The transceiver operations in the delay-Doppler (DD) domain in Zak-OTFS modulation, including DD domain filtering at the transmitter and receiver, involve twisted convolution operation. The twisted convolution operations give rise to multiple integrals in the end-to-end DD domain input-output (I/O) relation. The I/O relation plays a crucial role in performance evaluation and algorithm development for transceiver implementation. In this paper, we derive discrete DD domain closed-form expressions for the I/O relation and noise covariance in Zak-OTFS. We derive these expressions for sinc and Gaussian pulse shaping DD filters at the transmitter (Tx). On the receiver (Rx) side, three types of DD filters are considered, viz., $(i)$ Rx filter identical to Tx filter (referred to as ‘identical filtering’), $(ii)$ Rx filter matched to the Tx filter (referred to as ‘matched filtering’), and $(iii)$ Rx filter matched to both Tx filter and channel response (referred to as ‘channel matched filtering’). For all the above cases, except for the case of sinc identical filtering, we derive exact I/O relation and noise covariance expressions in closed-form. For the sinc identical filtering case, we derive approximate closed-form expressions which are shown to be accurate. Using the derived closed-form expressions, we evaluate the bit error performance of Zak-OTFS for different Tx/Rx filter configurations. Our results using Vehicular-A (Veh-A) channel model with fractional DDs show that, while matched filtering achieves slightly better or almost same performance as identical filtering, channel matched filtering achieves the best performance among the three.},

  abstract     = {Nullifying/suppressing the jamming signals can be problematic when the correlation between transmitted jamming signals is deliberately varied over time, making the nullspace estimation of the jamming channel much more challenging. This is because the time-varying correlation between transmitted jamming signals causes an impact on the nullspace estimation similar to that caused by a time-varying jamming channel. Most existing interference nullification solutions only consider unchanged correlations or heuristically adapt to the time-varying correlation by continuously monitoring the residual jamming signals before updating the estimated (nullifying) beam-forming matrix for the data transmission phase. In this paper, we systematically formulate the optimization problem of the nullspace estimation and data transmission phases. Then, to deal with the uncertainty and incomplete information caused by the jammers that deliberately vary their jamming strategy, we reformulate the problem using a partially observable semi-Markov decision process (POSMDP). We then design a deep dueling Q-learning-based framework to optimally tune the duration of the nullspace estimation and data transmission phases. Extensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed techniques effectively deal with time-varying correlated jamming signals.},

  abstract     = {To cope with the challenges of traditional mobile edge computing (MEC), such as inflexibility and limited coverage, autonomousaerial vehicle (AAV)-MEC has been proposed as an important paradigm. However, the AAV-MEC systems are still facing the severe channel fading and obstacle blocking, which are fortunately expected to be solved by the emerging intelligent reflective surface (IRS) technique. In this paper, we propose an IRS-assisted AAV-MEC framework, where a AAV employs non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) scheme to offload partial computation tasks to multiple ground MEC servers connecting to access points (APs) with the assistance of IRS. The problem of maximizing computational capacity of the network is proposed by jointly optimizing the phase shift of IRS, transmit power and computation resource allocation of AAV, NOMA decoding order, and AAV trajectory. Due to the complex non-convexity of the problem, we decompose the original problem into three sub-problems based on the alternating optimization (AO) structure. To be specific, we first derive the IRS reflection phase shift by using the semidefinite relaxation (SDR) and concave-convex procedure (CCCP) methods. Then, we obtain the computation and communication resource allocation by using the CCCP method. Finally, we determine the optimal AAV trajectory and decoding order by using the successive convex approximation (SCA) approach and the penalty-based method. A joint optimization algorithm is proposed for the AAV-MEC-NOMA framework. Numerical results demonstrate that: 1) The proposed algorithm is efficient and superior to other benchmark schemes in terms of increasing computational capacity; 2) The application of IRS significantly enhances the computation capability of the network; 3) The NOMA scheme outperforms the orthogonal multiple access (OMA) scheme.},

Firstly, the Cramer-Rao Bounds (CRB) for estimating the 2D-DOA and polarized parameters are derived, which provides design guideline for array geometry. As suggested by the CRB, a sparse planar EMVS array is a more appealing choice compared to the popular coprime EMVS array.

  abstract     = {Industrial control scenarios impose strict requirements on wireless communication networks, especially deterministic delay. Due to limited communication resources and time-varying wireless channels, transmission delay varies randomly, resulting in high jitter. To ensure deterministic delay, we model the jitter as the variance of transmission delay and formulate delay variance minimization problems by jointly optimizing transmission power and blocklength in the finite blocklength regime. The challenge of this research is that the delay variance formula couples multiple time slots together. Two typical communication scenarios, namely, the transmit power-limited case and the transmit energy-limited case, are considered. In the power-limited scenario, we consider the maximum transmit power constraint and propose a variance recursive formula-based scheme to decouple the variance minimization problem. As for the second case, an average energy constraint is additionally considered, and a Lyapunov-based scheme is proposed. We further propose low-complexity iterative algorithms to address the above non-convex problems. Numerical results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed schemes over the state-of-the-art ones in terms of reducing jitter. Furthermore, we reveal the trade-off between the average delay and delay variance, highlighting the necessity for tailored system design and reasonable resource allocation.},

  abstract     = {Uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV) assisted industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) mainly relies on unlicensed frequency bands for communication, and its development is facing the challenge of a shortage of spectrum resources. By integrating cognitive radio (CR) technology into the UAV-assisted IIoT, unlicensed UAV users can dynamically and opportunistically access the spectrum of the primary users to transmit data. Due to the limited access time, an inevitable trade-off exists between the sensing time and achievable throughput. In UAV scenarios, spectrum sensing mainly focuses on energy detection, which has poor real-time performance and cannot meet the low latency requirements of IIoT. Therefore, we propose a distributed fast spectrum sensing method to effectively balance sensing time and throughput. In the considering cognitive UAV network (CUAVN), monitoring UAVs (MUAVs) serve as sensing nodes, responsible for collecting industrial data and opportunistically utilizing the idle spectrum resources of the terrestrial network to transmit the data to the receiving UAV (RUAV). We define a distributed sensing sphere, where the central MUAV performs grouped sequential detection, leveraging the spatial similarity of sensing results among MUAVs within the same sensing sphere to shorten the sensing time. Based on the proposed distributed fast spectrum sensing method, the formula for sensing time is derived and used to calculate the throughput. Our goal is to maximize the throughput of CUAVN by jointly optimizing the false alarm probability, MUAVs' transmit power, and RUAV's location. Simulation results show that compared with the classical sequential detection-based and energy detection-based spectrum sensing methods, the average sensing time of the proposed method is reduced by 78.53% and 88.96%, and the throughput is increased by 19.4% and 34.3%, respectively.},

  abstract     = {Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) has recently emerged as a prominent communication paradigm due to its adaptability to wireless communication environments and low hardware cost. In IRS-assisted communication systems, channel state information (CSI) is essential for achieving a high beamforming gain. However, conventional IRS channel estimations suffer from the high complexity of IRS-related channels, increasing the estimation cost due to serial processing. In this paper, we propose a novel estimation method that leverages frequency shifts to improve channel estimation efficiency, which exploits the unique characteristics of IRS-related channels, utilizing multiple reflected signals as references. We also investigate the impact of individual channels' statistical properties and the reference signal's length on channel estimation performance. Furthermore, we introduce parallel and grouping estimation schemes for progressively element-wise channel estimation and accelerate the estimation process. Based on these, we design a corresponding beamforming scheme at IRS to improve the achievable data transmission rate. Extensive numerical results validate that the proposed estimation methods can replace pilot signals while achieving comparable accuracy and enabling simultaneous transmission and channel estimation with low computational load per time slot.},

Full protocol stack emulation and accurate modeling of the propagation characteristics of the wireless channel are necessary for studying the benefits introduced by RIS technology across various spectrum bands and use-cases. In this paper, we propose, for the first time: (i) accurate PHY layer RIS-enabled channel modeling through Geometry-Based Stochastic Models (GBSMs), leveraging the QUAsi Deterministic RadIo channel GenerAtor (QuaDRiGa) open-source statistical ray-tracer; (ii) optimized resource allocation with RISs by comprehensively studying energy efficiency and power control on different portions of the spectrum through a single-leader multiple-followers Stackelberg game theoretical approach; (iii) full-stack emulation and performance evaluation of RIS-assisted channels with SCOPE/srsRAN for Enhanced Mobile Broadband (eMBB) and Ultra Reliable and Low Latency Communications (URLLC) applications in the world's largest emulator of wireless systems with hardware-in-the-loop, namely Colosseum. Our findings indicate (i) the significant power savings in terms of energy efficiency achieved with RIS-assisted topologies, especially in the millimeter wave (mmWave) band; and (ii) the benefits introduced for Sub-6 GHz band User Equipments (UEs), where the deployment of a relatively small RIS (e.g., in the order of 100 RIS elements) can result in decreased levels of latency for URLLC services in resource-constrained environments.},

Our objective is to maximize the achievable ergodic rate within the constraints of transmit power and sensing signal-to-clutter-plus-noise ratio (SCNR) by jointly designing the transmit covariance matrices at the BS and the transmission and reflection phase shift matrices for the STAR-RIS based on only statistical channel state information (CSI). Firstly, we prove that the dedicated sensing waveforms do not provide any additional gains from the SCNR perspective and derive the asymptotic sensing SCNR and the asymptotic achievable ergodic rate in large-system regime, based on which the optimization problem is reconstructed. Subsequently, the closed-form optimal covariance matrix for the communication signal is derived by using the modified water-filling algorithm, and the transmission and reflection phase shift matrices for the STAR-RIS are obtained through the projected gradient ascent algorithm. Finally, an alternating optimization framework is proposed to obtain the covariance matrix for the communication signal and the transmission and reflection phase shift matrices for the STAR-RIS.

The proposed method leverages in-phase-quadrature delay-sequency symbol vectors and integrates a hybrid agglomerative hierarchical clustering with a weighted K-nearest neighbour algorithm to effectively reduce transmission computational complexity (CC) and transmission latency (TL) and enhance spectral efficiency (SE), while simultaneously mitigating out-of-band emissions (OOB). The approach ensures that the bit error rate (BER) and error vector magnitude (EVM) performance are preserved within the 3GPP doubly dispersive high-mobility delay Doppler multipath channels. Benchmark comparisons against ten contemporary PAPR reduction schemes in both OTSM, orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) and both of their variants including the base orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS), demonstrate the superior performance of the SS-VDS-SLM technique in OTSM. Further, the proposed method offers a more effective trade-off among the PAPR, OOB, CC, TL, SE, BER, and EVM performance metrics compared to the ten considered contemporary schemes. Thus, the proposed SS-VDS-SLM technique provides a more efficient and scalable solution for reducing PAPR in high-mobility speeds of 500 km/h and 1000 km/h in real-time OTSM system applications.},

  abstract     = {Radio transmissions in millimeter wave (mmWave) bands have gained significant interest for applications demanding precise device localization and trajectory estimation. This paper explores novel neural network (NN) architectures suitable for trajectory estimation and path determination in a mmWave multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) outdoor system based on localization data from beamformed fingerprint (BFF). The NN architecture captures sequences of BFF signals from different users, and through the application of learning mechanisms, subsequently estimate their trajectories. In turn, this information is employed to find the shortest path to the target, thereby enabling more efficient navigation. Specifically, we propose a two-stage procedure for trajectory estimation and optimal path finding. In the first stage, a transformer network (TN) based on attention mechanisms is developed to predict trajectories of wireless devices using BFF sequences captured in a mmWave MIMO outdoor system. In the second stage, a novel algorithm based on Informed Rapidly-exploring Random Trees (iRRT*) is employed to determine the optimal path to target locations using trajectory estimates derived in the first stage. The effectiveness of the proposed schemes is validated through numerical experiments, using a comprehensive dataset of radio measurements, generated using ray tracing simulations to model outdoor propagation at 28 GHz. We show that our proposed TN-based trajectory estimator outperforms other methods from the recent literature and can successfully generalize to new trajectories outside the training set. Furthermore, our proposed iRRT* algorithm is able to consistently provide the shortest path to the target.},

Utilizing the common sparsity structure of different subcarriers, we design the Joint LISTA-CP network that integrates multiple sub-networks. The proposed network employs a multidimensional shrinkage thresholding operator to guarantee the common sparse property of different subcarrier channels. In addition, we rigorously demonstrate that the Joint LISTA-CP network achieves lower recovery error.

To tackle this issue, the concept of secrecy outage probability is introduced within IRS-assisted PLS. This paper formulates the total RF power minimization problem of multiple users in the uplink channel, considering scenarios where the eavesdropper's CSI is unknown. An alternating optimization scheme is proposed to address the problem via alternately optimizing the RF power of individual users, receiving beamforming vectors, and phase shift matrix, minimizing the total RF power while ensuring compliance with secrecy outage probability constraints. Innovative methodologies, such as manifold optimization, dynamic weighted quadratic transformation, and deep learning, are proposed to approximate optimal solutions and reduce complexity in phase shift optimization. Simulation results indicate that the proposed scheme markedly decreases RF power, with the DL-based approach demonstrating satisfactory performance while substantially reducing time complexity.},

  abstract     = {Recently, many sparse array configurations have been designed for direction of arrival (DOA) estimation of noncircular sources due to their capability of constructing high-performance difference-sum coarray. Nested array, coprime array, along with their improved structures are the most commonly used array configurations. Nested arrays could provide $O(R^{2})$ degrees of freedom (DOFs) with only $R$ sensors, but suffer from severe mutual coupling effect owing to closely arranged elements. Coprime arrays generally offer a lower number of DOFs than nested arrays, but are more robust to mutual coupling effect due to sparser array structure. Unfortunately, existing sparse arrays cannot possess the benefits of nested arrays and coprime arrays at the same time within the framework of difference-sum coarray. To compensate for the above shortcoming, we first analyze the nesting property for difference coarray, and generalize the nesting property to difference-sum coarray, allowing nearly half of the sensors to be removed from dense subarray. Then, a new nested configuration called thinned coprime nested array (TCNA) is proposed, whose dense subarray is a coprime structure that satisfies the aforementioned nesting property. TCNA can generate a comparable number of DOFs to nested arrays due to the nesting property between two subarrays. Meanwhile, the mutual coupling effect is greatly reduced since its dense subarray is replaced with a coprime structure, which limits the number of sensor pairs with small spacing. Therefore, TCNA is able to combine the advantages of both nested array and coprime array. Finally, simulations verify the superiority of TCNA with respect to DOF ratio, coupling leakage, and DOA estimation accuracy.},

To better adapt to real-world communication channel conditions, we propose a novel covert communication model assisted by Uncrewed Aerial Vehicles (UAV) equipped with Multi-Functional Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (MF-RIS), named UMCCM. Specifically, based on a mixed link of LoS and Non-Line-of-Sight (NLoS), UMCCM leverages MF-RIS as a flexible relay to enhance the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and effective throughput. We first derive the mixed channel model expression. Then, we transform covert constraints from incomplete gamma functions to those linked with relative entropy and accordingly optimize the UAV transmission power and block length. Finally, the optimal flying position of the UAV is obtained by analyzing the functional properties of SNR and effective throughput under these refined constraints. Extensive numerical results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed UMCCM for enhancing SNR and effective throughput over the existing works.},

  abstract     = {Compressive sensing (CS) algorithms have demonstrated superior direction-of-arrival (DoA) estimation accuracy in the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime by exploiting inherent angular sparsity. However, traditional CS-based algorithms require numerous iterations to gradually converge well, resulting in high computational complexity and limiting their applicability in practical systems. In this paper, we propose a sparse Bayesian learning (SBL) unfolding network for superior and efficient DoA estimation. Specifically, the SBL framework is unfolded into a series of cascaded SBL layers, each corresponding to a hyperparameter update. Within each SBL layer, we introduce a Convolution-Transformer based source power estimation network (CTsNet) to better capture angular sparsity and generate more efficient update rule for the signal hyperparameter. Simultaneously, a convolution-based noise variance estimation network (CnNet) is proposed for accurate noise variance estimation, which controls the sharpness of the peak spectrum and affects the iterations of the signal hyperparameter. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method not only performs better than existing methods in terms of estimation accuracy and angular resolution, but also exhibits lower computational complexity compared with other SBL-based algorithms.},

In this paper, we formulate a novel beam management problem including beam footprint design, beam scheduling, and spectrum assignment. Considering the tight coupling among them, we first develop a fast beam footprint design method for earth-fixed cells, which adapts to dynamic satellite attitudes. Then, with the reformulation of objective and constraints, the primal problem is transformed into a beam scheduling and spectrum assignment problem with much smaller solution space, and an optimum algorithm is designed by combining branch-and-bound and interior point methods. Towards practical application, a more scalable graph-based heuristic algorithm is proposed. Simulation results show that the developed beam footprint design method can significantly reduce inter-beam interference and improve network throughput, and the proposed heuristic algorithm achieves comparable throughput but reduces execution time by two orders of magnitude compared with the optimum one. Moreover, in scenarios with 120 cells, our proposal increases network throughput by over 60$\%$ compared to the baseline based on integer recovery.},

  abstract     = {As the fundamental premise of anti-interference communication, wireless interference identification (WII) has garnered extensive research and yielded substantial results, especially for deep learning (DL)-enabled WII. However, existing studies are conducted typically under the closed-set assumption. This aspect poses a challenge in identifying the unknown interference signals under the open-set assumption. To tackle this issue, this paper proposes a multi-task learning-enabled WII (MTL-WII) algorithm in antagonistic environments. Firstly, we generate the semantic feature space of known classes, calculating the semantic center vectors of each known class through multi-task learning. Secondly, we obtain the semantic feature space of the test set incorporating interference signals of known and unknown classes through the established mapping relationships. Subsequently, the signal's semantic feature vectors are classified using clustering methods to determine their category attribution. To reduce computational complexity, this paper further proposes a binarized MTL-WII algorithm (BMTL-WII). By binarizing the semantic spatial generative network in MTL-WII, both the weights and activations of the semantic spatial generative network replace the 32-bit floating-point numbers with 1-bit fixed-point numbers. Experimental results show that the MTL-WII model achieves an average identification accuracy of 95.4%, with an 89.3% accuracy for unknown interference signals. Compared to the MTL-WII algorithm, the BMTL-WII algorithm reduces the number of floating-point operations by 64.2%, and the amount of memory access is reduced by 88%, at the cost of identification accuracy decrease by only 1.8% of the binarized part of the network structure.},

  abstract     = {Effective beamforming is crucial in ultra-dense device-to-device (D2D) mmWave networks to reduce interference and optimize communication. However, current methods often struggle to balance high data rates with minimal signaling overhead, especially with imperfect channel state information (CSI). This paper introduces a machine learning-assisted beamforming design tailored for integrated sensing and communication (ISAC), combining an efficient Low-Rank Adaptation Blocked LSTM Transformer with Message Passing Graph Neural Network that is called as LoRA_BLT-MPGNN. The LoRA_BLT component provides a key advantage by efficiently capturing both temporal and spatial patterns through fixed-weight updates during training and low-rank approximation for fine-tuning, significantly reducing computational complexity without sacrificing accuracy. Using historical channel data, the method implicitly captures channel characteristics and directly predicts the beamforming matrix for the subsequent time slot, minimizing signaling overhead while maximizing the achievable sum rate. Our research and simulation results show that the proposed predictive beamforming design maintains robust sensing performance and achieves a sum rate closely approaching the upper bound achievable with perfect CSI. Additionally, the incorporation of MPGNNs enables efficient modeling and learning of complex inter-node relationships, making the approach adaptable to networks of varying sizes and densities. Simulations further demonstrate that the LoRA_BLT-MPGNN model can be generalized across different network densities and coverage areas, reducing computational complexity by approximately $32\times$ in terms of Tensor Floating Point Operations (TFLOPs) compared to conventional methods while maintaining high performance.},

  abstract     = {In New Radio Unlicensed (NR-U) networks, spectrum resources are shared to ensure quality of service. However, the proliferation of wireless devices and the near-full allocation of sub-6 GHz frequency bands have imposed significant challenges on spectrum access conflicts. Reinforcement learning (RL) offers a promising solution to address the dynamic spectrum access (DSA) issues for cognitive users in heterogeneous spectrum environments. However, existing RL algorithms typically require a large number of iterations to achieve convergence, causing spectrum resource wastage before being converged. To mitigate this issue, this paper proposes a fast-convergence, induced dynamic spectrum access method based on an accelerated Q-Learning model and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. This approach aims to ensure convergence while simultaneously reduce the number of required iterations. Firstly, an online learning model, built on LSTM, is employed to predict the probability of spectrum state by exploiting the temporal patterns inherent in spectrum usage. Then, the prediction outcomes are subsequently used as induction factors for the spectrum access process. Finally, the induction factors are integrated with a Q-Learning model to construct a novel joint Q-value strategy matrix. After fewer iterations of spectrum access, an optimal access strategy is obtained. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves faster convergence rate than existing Q-Learning and Deep Q-Network (DQN) algorithms, and reduces the number of iterations by 50% and 80%, respectively. Additionally, compared to the general Q-Learning algorithm, the proposed method demonstrates higher stability in terms of available network capacity.},

  abstract     = {AI integrated Communication is envisaged as one of the novel usage scenarios in IMT-2030, which calls for embedding AI into network edge to offer ubiquitous intelligent services. Meanwhile, federated learning (FL) is an appealing technology for edge intelligence due to its advantages on distributed training and privacy preserving. However, FL suffers from several limitations when being executed in wireless networks, such as high communication overhead, low deployment flexibility, and the lack of analytical performance characterization. To overcome such challenges, we propose a multi-autonomous aerial vehicle (AAV)-enabled over-the-air federated learning system, where devices sense data samples for local training, and exchange model-updates with AAVs employing analog transmission scheme. Under this scheme, we first conduct convergence analysis to characterize the influence of sensing sample size, downlink broadcasting distortions, and uplink aggregation errors on the FL performance with a closed-form expression. Subsequently, a joint sensing, communication, and computation (JSCC) design problem is established to boost the FL performance among different AAVs, under the constraints of training completion time and network resource budget. We then tackle the origin intractable problem by alternatively optimizing downlink power control, uplink transceiver design, AAV deployment, and sensing batch size. Experimental evaluations demonstrate the significant performance improvement of our JSCC design compared to conventional approaches, and the effectiveness of adaptively allocating network resources across different FL rounds in suppressing the model updating errors.},

This system simultaneously detects and tracks target when transmitting communication information to downlink users. However, in the presence of hostile eavesdropping devices, the communication transmission security of ISAC system cannot be guaranteed. We have considered two common deployment scenarios: deployment of eavesdropper within the main lobe (DEML) and deployment of eavesdropper within the side lobes (DESL). In DEML scenario, the sensing target is considered as eavesdropper, we introduce cooperative jamming (CJ) device to disrupt the eavesdropper and ensure the transmission security. Through a combination of traversal search and a series of semidefinite relaxation methods, we optimize the covariance matrices of the transmission signal and CJ signal, ensuring both sensing and communication performance requirements while enhancing the overall system secrecy rate. In DESL scenario, we mainly focus on the situation where the eavesdropper is located on the transmission channel between the ISAC system and the user, the intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRS) is proposed to enhance the ISAC system communication security. We employ a combined approach of alternating optimization and fractional programming to jointly solve for the covariance matrix of the transmission signal and the reflection phase shift matrix, optimizing the system's secrecy rate. The numerical results validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms under both deployment scenarios and compare the advantages and disadvantages of the two methods. The results demonstrate that the designs of both CJ and IRS under the two deployment scenarios significantly enhance the system's secure communication rate, and the IRS scheme can provide higher performance gains, which is attributed to the IRS's rational utilization of energy losses in other directions.},

  abstract     = {Due to the high maneuverability and low observability of small autonomous aerial vehicles (AAVs), monostatic radar is not robust for AAV probing in practice due to its low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) gain and low accuracy. In this case, AAV probing using netted radar has become a trend that has the advantages of increasing detection probability and tracking accuracy. However, in the traditional multistatic radar tracking algorithm, the signal processing of each station is performed independently in the data domain, and the measurement and tracking are separated, resulting in low tracking accuracy and poor SNR robustness. In this regard, a signal domain integrated accurate measurement and tracking method for a wideband netted radar is proposed. To address the issue of wideband information utilization, the algorithm constructs the motion dynamic model of netted radar space-time coupling for motion initialization. It introduces the reference signal without information loss and jointly estimates the range and azimuth errors based on a Bayesian posterior model in the signal domain. The framework of integrated accurate measurement and tracking is constructed in the signal domain to realize the information transfer and sharing of measurement and tracking, thereby improving the utilization of target information. Based on the consideration of netted radar, we derive the signal-domain collaborative tracking filter to fuse and filter the multi-source information, realizing high-precision and robust tracking. Simulated and real-measured experiments demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the traditional monostatic/multistatic tracking method regarding tracking accuracy and robustness to noise.},

The 3D Normal Distributions Transform (3D-NDT) is a competitive algorithm that performs well in noisy and dynamic environments. However, its effectiveness is limited by local feature blurring caused by voxelization. To address this issue, this paper proposes an improved 3D-NDT registration method that incorporates normal vector segmentation and refined voxelization techniques to improve registration accuracy and matching range. The process begins with plane point cloud clustering for initial voxel partitioning, followed by subdivision to ensure uniform voxel cell sizes, enabling appropriate weighting in the objective function. A dual-stage voxel division strategy is employed to first broaden the matching scope and then refine the registration precision. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method reduces the median translation error by 50% (from 1.0 × 10−3 m to 0.5 × 10−3 m) and the median rotation error by 50% (from 0.01° to 0.005°), compared to the original 3D-NDT. Additionally, it significantly improves robustness and accuracy, doubling the effective translation range (from 1.2 m to 2.4 m) and increasing the rotation range by 25.6% (from 39° to 49°).},

In this scenario, battery management systems (BMS) become crucial in EVs to ensure battery safety, reliability, and efficiency. Recently, data-driven estimation techniques have been proposed to estimate battery-related metrics, such as remaining capacity or aging condition. These techniques emerged as an answer to batteries' intrinsic variability, but they rely primarily on full charge/discharge cycles, overlooking the nuances of partial charging, which is prevalent in real-world usage. This paper presents a novel BMS architecture for EVs, leveraging digital twin technology and data-driven modeling to address these challenges. The proposed dynamic dual-model approach seamlessly integrates real-time monitoring with cloud-based analytics to continuously evaluate and predict battery capacity degradation. Key innovations include sophisticated feature engineering and segmentation strategies, which enable precise state of health (SoH) estimation across a wide range of driving conditions. Additionally, the architecture incorporates a dynamically retraining State of Charge/Energy (SoC/SoE) model that adapts to battery aging, thereby maintaining high accuracy throughout the battery's life cycle.

  abstract     = {In the proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC), both air flow and cathode pressure affect the output performance and safety. To improve the PEMFC performance, this work presents a data-driven flow-pressure coordinated control (DD-FPCC) method, where the air compressor controller and backpressure valve controller are equated as two agents. A centralized training method enables the two agents to cooperate with each other in offline training. To facilitate this method, this work combines meta-reinforcement learning with multi-agent reinforcement learning and proposes an effective exploration multi-agent deep meta deterministic policy gradient (EEMA-DMDPG) algorithm, which includes two learners. The base learner is responsible for completing the learning of the underlying task. The meta-learner identifies the most suitable exploration noise parameters for the base learner, which improves the DD-FPCC performance. A simulation validation on a 75-kw PEMFC shows that the DD-FPCC improves the control performance in terms of the output voltage, oxygen excess rate (OER) and air pressure and prevents constraint violations.},

This paper proposes a consensus-based control strategy for EV charging stations providing frequency regulation with limited communication among neighbors. The multi-layer control strategy is operated in the agent of each EV charging station. The charging power of EVs are controlled to track the frequency regulation signals depending on the capacity bid submitted to the market within the adjustable range of EV charging power. The algorithm also allocates the frequency regulation power according to the regulation capability of each EV station while satisfying the diverse charging needs of EVs. The effectiveness of the proposed control strategy is investigated on a typical power distribution network with EV charging stations scattered on several feeders. The quality of frequency regulation is assessed by the performance indicators specified by the PJM market (ISO in the United States). A high-performance score that guarantees the entire payment of frequency regulation can be achieved without violating the charging demand of EVs and the power network constraints.},

  abstract     = {As the standard communication protocol for vehicular networks, the Controller Area Network (CAN) plays a crucial role in coordinating interactions among Electronic Control Units (ECUs). However, intruders can launch malicious attacks on the CAN due to the lack of security mechanisms. Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs), as a defense component, are deployed to monitor the CAN and detect suspicious behavior resulting from an attack. Existing IDSs have high false alarms in complex attacks due to limited feature modeling capabilities. In this paper, we propose a multi-knowledge fusion-based anomaly detection system, called MKF-ADS. Specifically, the method designs a prediction-based framework that integrates a spatial-temporal correlation module with an attention mechanism (STcAM) and a patch-based sparse transformer (PatchST) module. The fine-pruned STcAM applies one-dimensional convolution (Conv1D) to extract spatial features and subsequently employs the Bidirectional Long Short Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) to capture temporal features, with an attention mechanism that focuses on important time steps. Meanwhile, the PatchST captures contextual features from independent univariate time series. Finally, the proposed model uses STcAM as a student model to learn intrinsic knowledge and cross-imitate PatchST's competencies through knowledge distillation. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that MKF-ADS is lightweight and effectively performs anomaly prediction and detection across six attack scenarios. Compared to the baseline, the proposed method is more robust, achieving a high F1-score while maintaining controllable false alarms.},

  abstract     = {This paper addresses the problem of estimating incoming signals' direction of arrival (DoA) in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) radar systems when the number of reflectors exceeds that of the sensors. Existing methods, such as co-prime and nested arrays, address this limitation by increasing the degree of freedom (DoF) using expanded antenna array geometries. However, these methods introduce practical challenges, including increased array size and added system complexity and cost due to the additional receiver (Rx) front-end modules and analog-to-digital converter (ADC) units required for each antenna element. The proposed method overcomes these limitations and enables the detection of more targets than sensors without necessitating hardware modifications by using a standard uniform linear array (ULA) and enhancing the DoF entirely at the signal processing stage. The proposed method integrates the capabilities of the 2D multiple signal classification (MUSIC) algorithm with the 2D forward-backward spatial smoothing (FBSS) technique to surpass the theoretical limit of the minimum angular resolution. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated through extensive simulations and real-world measurements. Comparative evaluations against popular DoA estimation techniques further underscore its practical advantages and robustness.},

Compared with previous methods, the proposed hierarchical two-layer discrete-time sliding surface has the capability to suppress the chattering and reduce the tracking error. Then, in order to further improve the system convergence dynamics, the improved exponential reaching law and disturbance estimator are also employed.

To meet the requirements of eMBB and URLLC, non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) technology is integrated with network slicing to create multiple logical slices while sharing the same physical resources. NOMA technology enables massive connectivity by allowing multiple users to transmit simultaneously over the same time-frequency resources. To ensure E2E latency, the deterministic network calculus theory is exploited to investigate the maximum delay boundary of V2X communication. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach ensures ultra-low latency in an Urban Macro city scenario, even in the presence of multiple user interference, while meeting eMBB bandwidth requirements.},

This paper proposes a computationally efficient Sparse Bayesian Learning (SBL)-based algorithm to counteract the coherent CEJ signals for collocated multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) radar systems with arbitrary subarray configurations. First, the intrinsic capability of SBL to resolve coherent signal sources is exploited to distinguish CEJ signals. Second, two strategies are introduced to enhance computational efficiency: A sparse uniform linear array fitting (SULAF) technique is employed to approximate a virtual uniform linear array steering vector within the mainlobe region of arbitrary subarrays, leading to a linear SBL (LSBL) method that reduces the dimensionality of the input data and constructs a Toeplitz-block-Toeplitz (TBT) covariance matrix. By leveraging the structural properties of the TBT matrix, a Gohberg-Semencul (GS)-type factorization technique is integrated to accelerate the LSBL algorithm, termed GS-LSBL, which eliminate the need for large-scale covariance matrix inversion. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed GS-LSBL algorithm effectively identifies coherent CEJ signals while significantly reducing computational complexity. Moreover, the algorithm adapts to arbitrary subarray configurations.},

This paper presents a Data-Efficient Iterative Learning-based (DEIL) method for integrated speed planning and control, specifically designed for heavy-duty vehicle platoons. The proposed approach formulates the problem as a finite-horizon constrained optimization, that incorporates both a terminal energy cost and a time-domain-guided terminal safe constraint set. Unlike conventional optimization methods that rely on a one-time pre-planned reference speed, the DEIL leverages historical vehicle states and energy consumption data from previous iterations to approximate the terminal cost and constraint set, enabling closed-loop, data-efficient iterative learning. The approximated terminal energy cost decreases monotonically and converges, facilitating the derivation of an energy-optimal control strategy within a limited number of iterations. Moreover, the method integrates trajectory planning and tracking control without requiring predefined reference profiles. To improve computational efficiency, a dynamic programming (DP) strategy is employed to generate the initial feasible trajectory. Comparative analysis validates the proposed approach, demonstrating its effectiveness in producing energy-optimal trajectories and control strategies for heavy vehicle platooning.},

This model also includes the nonlinear car-following action of CAVs. Besides this, the polytopic-type uncertainty structure is introduced in the proposed mixed platoon model to reflect uncertain vehicle parameters in real platoon systems. Then an adaptive robust gain-scheduling control strategy is developed to attenuate external disturbances. By using the Lyapunov-Krasovskii methods, sufficient conditions are derived to achieve the robust mean-square stability of the mixed platoon system in the presence of polytopic uncertainty. Furthermore, by considering different parameter values of vehicles of the same type, a mixed vehicular platoon control system that integrates both polytopic uncertainty and heterogeneity is constructed, and the corresponding robust control synthesis is also carried out. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme in stabilizing the mixed platoon, tracking the leader's state, and suppressing disturbances is validated by conducting numerical simulation experiments.},

  abstract     = {Generating an executable reference trajectory in realtime is a core of autonomous navigation for a quadrotor uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV). In the paper, a time-adjusted optimization method is proposed for UAV motion planning to achieve safe and fast flight. Firstly, based on parameterization for uniform B-spline trajectories, relationship of knot spans and UAV speeds is analyzed, and an iterative velocity restrict algorithm is introduced to tackle nonexecutable flight. Subsequently, combining start and target points in local planning, an evaluation criterion function is designed with control points of the above trajectory and directions of collision avoidance. On this basis, risk assessment is conducted according to surrounding environments, where four phases of passing obstacles is constructed by considering risk level variation. Then, the weight function in each phase is determined by relationship of obstacle and planned local trajectory. Moreover, time intervals of B-spline trajectories are adjusted to obtain nonuniform trajectories, so as to affect UAV speeds. Simulation and experiment are conducted with comparison to verify performance of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {The hard shoulder running (HSR) strategy has proven to be an effective measure to alleviate freeway traffic congestion. This paper proposes a smart HSR strategy based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL), referred to as DRL-S-HSR, designed to improve traffic efficiency in freeway merging areas within a connected environment. We propose the relevant assumptions and specific implementation rules for scenarios involving hard shoulder running in merging areas, along with the lane-changing motivations and safety conditions for connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) when temporarily using the hard shoulder. Furthermore, we also propose a vehicle collision avoidance method in merging areas based on the ECR-DQN algorithm, to avoid conflicts between vehicles on the hard shoulder and those on the on-ramp. A three-lane freeway in China is used as a case study. The study analyzes the overall traffic impact in terms of travel time, congestion patterns, carbon emissions, and driving comfort. Two key traffic conditions are also tested, including different CAV penetration rates and ramp inflows. The results show that the DRL-S-HSR strategy significantly alleviates traffic congestion on the freeway mainline under medium to high-density traffic flow conditions. In terms of carbon emissions, exhaust emissions throughout the entire traffic scenario are greatly reduced. Additionally, this strategy improves the driving comfort of merging areas. Overall, the proposed strategy demonstrates significant control effect and good applicability when the CAV penetration rate is between 10% and 20%, and the ramp inflow is less than 600 veh/h, providing a reference for future traffic management measures.},

In this paper, we investigate the secrecy capacity of the V2V-VLC system based on an empirical model of the multiple-lane V2V-VLC configuration. The study considers the variations in the received optical power at positions that emulate the trajectories of vehicles obtained from the Next Generation Simulation (NGSIM) initiative of the Federal Highway Administration in the USA. In addition, we investigate the secrecy pressure that forecasts the probability of the eavesdropper (Eve) presence at certain positions around the legitimate receiver (Bob). Closed-form expressions of the lower and upper bounds on the secrecy capacity and secrecy pressure are derived and evaluated based on the measurements. The results confirm the inherent security characteristics of dynamic V2V-VLC systems using headlights as transmitters because the channel conditions between the transmitter (Alice) and Bob which differs from the conditions between Alice and Eve. The position-dependent channel conditions result in varying secrecy capacities across different lanes and relative positions of Bob and Eve to Alice. The attained secrecy capacity can reach up to 1 nats/s/Hz, corresponding to the scenario when Bob is in the highest received power area on the middle lane at a distance of 9 m from Alice, and Eve is in the lowest received power area on the right-hand lane with a separation distance of 40 m from Alice. The secrecy pressure on the middle lane is lower than the right-hand and left-hand lanes.},

  abstract     = {3D object detection play a pivotal role in various applications, such as autonomous driving and environmental perception. However, the challenging task of detecting targets (e.g., vehicles and pedestrians) in 3D point clouds obtained from LiDAR sensors is hindered by two primary factors. Firstly, point clouds are non-Euclidean data and lack rigid data properties. Secondly, these point clouds are sparse and deficient in semantic information. In this paper, we propose a novel deep learning framework for 3D object detection. The proposed approach involves two stages. Specifically, we first present an innovative fusion technique that combines images and point clouds using transformers. This technique enhances the integration of semantic and geometric features while accurately mapping points to pixels without relying on camera extrinsic parameters. Additionally, a multi-level graph convolutional network (GCN) architecture is further introduced for object detection. This architecture effectively handles the non-Euclidean characteristics of point clouds while achieving precise object identification within them. A comprehensive series of experiments on the KITTl and nuScenes datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.},

First, fuzzy logic systems are used to approximate unknown nonlinear dynamics. Then, using an artificial potential field method, potential function with continuous partial derivative is designed and integrated into a resilient distributed formation estimator. A novel collision avoidance resilient distributed formation estimator is proposed to ensure the existence of the first-order derivative of estimator states and achieve collision-free between USVs. Meanwhile, a simple prescribed performance function is designed to ensure transient and steady-state formation performances of underactuated USVs. Subsequently, combining dynamic surface control and adaptive technology, an adaptive fault-tolerant control algorithm is proposed to deal with intermittent actuator faults. It is shown that the designed controller can steer formation tracking errors into a residual set of predefined accuracy within a preassigned settling time while avoiding collision between USVs, and ensure all signals in the closed-loop system are semi-globally uniformly ultimately bounded. Finally, a simulation example confirms the effectiveness of the presented theory and approach.},

Additionally, a velocity resampling mechanism is further designed to prevent the UGV from being trapped. Above techniques augments the navigation flexibility and safety of the UGV, thereby significantly improves the success rate of practical navigation in dynamic and challenging pedestrian environments.

However, achieving robust tracking with this minimal configuration is highly challenging, as the follower's camera often fails to detect the leader due to two key issues that are often overlooked in existing research. First, the limited field-of-view (FOV) of the camera frequently allows the leader to move out of sight. Second, visual detection faults—including obstacle occlusion, lighting variations, depth image failures, and false detections caused by similar objects—complicate reliable tracking. To address these challenges, we propose a novel visual formation tracking scheme. Our approach allows the follower robot to maintain continuous tracking of the leader within its constrained FOV in the absence of visual faults, even without access to the leader's depth or velocity. When visual faults occur, the system swiftly diagnoses the fault type and resumes tracking accordingly. Our method leverages formation kinematics to enhance efficiency and reduce computation while requiring only an onboard camera, and its effectiveness is validated through simulations and real-world experiments.},

It is worth noting that each car-following model possesses its own strengths and weaknesses depending on specific driving scenarios. Therefore, we propose EnsembleFollower, a closed-loop hierarchical planning framework for achieving human-like autonomous car-following. The EnsembleFollower framework involves a high-level Reinforcement Learning-based agent responsible for judiciously managing multiple low-level models (such as Intelligent Driver Model and Gipps model) according to the current state, either by selecting an appropriate car-following model to perform an action or by allocating different weights across all primitive models. Moreover, we propose a jerk-constrained kinematic model for more convincing microscopic traffic simulations. We evaluate the proposed method based on real-world driving data from the HighD dataset. The experimental results illustrate that EnsembleFollower yields an improved accuracy of human-like behavior and achieves effectiveness in combining hybrid models, demonstrating that our proposed framework can handle diverse driving conditions by leveraging the strengths of various car-following models.},

  abstract     = {In the field of robot navigation, grid-based maps are primarily leveraged in systems operating in complex terrain. However, the efficiency of the path search module in these maps is generally low due to the numerous conditions, e.g., climbing and tilting angles, that need to be checked among grids, hindering the real-time performance and stability. In addition, the discontinuity of grid-based maps also impedes the implementation of the path optimization module, significantly reducing the quality of the optimized path. Although the curved surface can be used to relieve the aforementioned two issues, the actual terrain surface is variable and cannot be represented by a binary function. Furthermore, the presence of vertical obstacles can intensify these challenges. To this end, we propose a stable robot navigation system in complex terrain on a hybrid map (HMRNS-CT). A hybrid map, incorporating a grid map, is utilized to extract vertical obstacles through variance analysis. And an adaptive curved surface quadtree map is further employed to fit the rest area. Therefore, in the path search module, the climbing and tilting angle can be checked once only on the fitted curved surface. And a proposed path optimization algorithm can also be adopted to further improve the smoothness and reduce the height change of the path by minimizing a cost function rather than finding the shortest path. A series of simulations and experiments in real-world environments are conducted to evaluate the efficacy of HMRNS-CT.},

Traditional methods rely on either standalone Uncrewed Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) or Uncrewed Ground Vehicles (UGVs), often suffering from limited coverage, intermittent connectivity, and inefficient energy management. Recent works have explored UAV-UGV collaboration to enhance surveillance and communication; however, they lack dynamic communication optimization and energy-efficient coordination. To address these gaps, we propose a novel cooperative framework integrating UAVs equipped with Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS) and UGVs for real-time monitoring. Unlike prior approaches, our system optimizes UAV flight paths and recharging schedules using Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) while refining UGV patrol routes with a Genetic Algorithm (GA), ensuring adaptive and continuous surveillance. Additionally, we employ Differential Evolution (DE) for RIS configuration, enhancing data transmission and mitigating urban signal degradation. UAVs further support UGVs by wirelessly recharging them via energy beamforming, reducing dependency on fixed charging stations. By leveraging AI-driven coordination, RIS-assisted communication, and real-time energy optimization, our framework ensures seamless data transmission, reduces latency, and maximizes energy efficiency. Simulation results demonstrate that our approach significantly improves communication reliability, monitoring coverage, and energy consumption compared to existing methods, making it a promising solution for next-generation urban monitoring.},

  abstract     = {Control parameter tuning is a well recognized challenge in the control field, especially in the absence of a priori knowledge on the system dynamics. Autopilots are a natural representation of this challenge, as they involve both parameter tuning of the autopilot laws and uncertainty of the vehicle dynamics. Building upon the Fictitious Reference Iterative Tuning (FRIT) idea, this work proposes an improved FRIT method and deploys it in autopilots of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). By introducing a novel data-driven cost based on mixed sensitivity design, the proposed FRIT method can handle multivariable loops with possible couplings among the various loops, which is a key aspect of autopilot architectures. The proposed FRIT does not require any a priori knowledge about the vehicle dynamics: it suffices to collect data during vehicle operation and exploit the available knowledge of autopilot control loops to perform a one-shot experiment to tune the control gains. Notably, our tests show that, even in the case that the control parameters are obtained using data collected in nominal operation, the corresponding controllers perform good also in non-nominal uncertain scenarios involving load changes or wind disturbances. The feasibility and robustness of the proposed approach is further validated via comparisons with standard FRIT methods and with a set of state-of-the-art control parameter tuning methods.},

  abstract     = {Accurate and efficient trajectory prediction of surrounding vehicles is critical for ensuring the safety of autonomous driving systems. Relying solely on historical trajectory information is insufficient to accurately predict, especially in complex traffic scenarios with interwoven roads. Therefore, predicting future trajectories requires consideration not only of the historical trajectories of vehicles but also of the interaction among various entities of the environmental context. However, existing prediction methods suffer from expensive rendering costs and entity information loss, unnecessary complexity and redundant computation, and all-to-all interaction modeling and high computational costs, facing the challenge of the trade-off of efficiency and accuracy. To this end, we propose the SGC-Informer-based deep learning framework for fast and accurate trajectory prediction, called FESIG. Specifically, a comprehensive explicit entity vectorized representation is constructed based on Feature Engineering for the agent's trajectories and High-Definition (HD) map information, avoiding expensive rendering costs and entity information loss. Then, to mitigate excess complexity, we introduce the Simple Graph Convolution (SGC) network to effectively extract the local feature of each entity, which can remove the nonlinear transformation of the information propagation. Additionally, the Informer mechanism is employed to automatically sort and select the entities in the scenario, and then capture the complex interactions between the target vehicle and these entities that significantly impact it, thereby reducing computation costs. Experiments performed on the Argoverse forecasting dataset illustrate that the FESIG achieves the trade-off between accuracy and efficiency in the vehicle trajectory prediction task compared with the existing methods.},

  abstract     = {Vehicular networks represent a new distributed system paradigm that requires robust fault tolerance to ensure reliable operation. As a burgeoning area of research, the scalability and optimization of consensus mechanisms for these networks are critical. Traditional Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) algorithms like PBFT are not inherently optimized for the localized needs of vehicular networks, suffering from scalability issues due to their global nature and high messaging complexity. In response, we introduce a two-tiered consensus framework that refines PBFT for the specific context of vehicular networks. By organizing nodes into clusters based on geographic proximity, our approach reduces messaging complexity from $O(n^{2})$ to $O(n^{1.5})$, significantly improving scalability. The framework distinguishes between local and global state transitions, adding two phases to the PBFT protocol to manage these efficiently. This tailored consensus process aligns with the localized communication patterns of vehicular networks, enhancing both efficiency and scalability. The framework addresses the critical challenges of traditional BFT algorithms in vehicular networks, offering a solution that is both scalable and resilient. It is a step toward enabling vehicular networks to fulfil their potential as a reliable component of modern distributed systems.},

  abstract     = {The trajectory prediction information of human-driven vehicles (HDVs) is imperative for the platooning of connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) in mixed traffic flow. However, due to the inherent uncertainty of HDVs, prediction errors are inevitable and time-varying, which results in inefficient control actions and even safety issues. To address the problem, we propose a virtual leader-follower platooning strategy to deal with time-varying prediction uncertainties. The controlled platoon tracks the efficient trajectory planned by the virtual leader to avoid unnecessary control inputs and improve speed smoothness. The challenges mainly lie in the modeling of time-varying prediction uncertainties and the design of control strategy for the virtual leader. First, a second-order moment based ambiguity set is employed to describe the distributional uncertainties of trajectory prediction, with parameters identified and updated by the Gaussian Mixture Model-Hidden Markov Model (GMM-HMM) to adapt to the time-varying environments. Further, a distributionally robust model predictive control (DR-MPC) method for the virtual leader is designed, where conditional value-at-risk constraint is adopted to achieve flexible tracking. By exploiting constraint tightening technology, the efficient solution of the DR-MPC problem is obtained. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed method can significantly avoid undesired control inputs and improve driving smoothness.},

  abstract     = {As an effective solution to address road congestion and improve traffic efficiency, vehicle platooning has received a lot of attention in recent years. However, vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication latency can largely impact on the performance of vehicle platooning, which has not been well investigated. Rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA), as one of the promising technologies for 6G, holds great potential for application in vehicle platooning to reduce the communication latency and thereby enhance platoon control performance. Motivated by the above considerations, platoon control and communication latency are jointly considered in this paper. We first introduce the communication latency into the vehicle dynamics model, and then derive a distributed model predictive control (DMPC)-based platoon control model. To reduce the communication latency, uplink RSMA is introduced for inter-platoon V2V communication. Since the latency minimization problem is non-convex and challenging to solve directly, we first employ a bisection method to give a latency upper bound and transform the initial problem into a non-convex feasibility problems in each iteration. Subsequently, through theoretical derivation, the bandwidth allocation factor is expressed in terms of transmission power, which reduces the number of optimization variables and transforms the problem into a convex problem. Then we can obtain the optimal solution by solving a convex problem in each iteration. Finally, the simulation results demonstrate that the proposed RSMA significantly outperforms traditional frequency division multiple access (FDMA) and non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA), and can significantly reduce communication latency, enhance platoon control safety, improve driving comfort, and lower the performance requirement on vehicle maximum torque.},

  abstract     = {Cooperative path planning is gaining its importance due to the increasing demand on using multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for complex missions. This work addresses the problem by introducing a new algorithm named MultiRRT that extends the rapidly exploring random tree (RRT) to generate paths for a group of UAVs to reach multiple goal locations at the same time. We first derive the dynamics constraint of the UAV and include it in the problem formulation. MultiRRT is then developed, taking into account the cooperative requirements and safe constraints during its path-searching process. The algorithm features two new mechanisms, node reduction and Bezier interpolation, to ensure the feasibility and optimality of the paths generated. Importantly, the interpolated paths are proven to meet the safety and dynamics constraints imposed by obstacles and the UAVs. A number of simulations, comparisons, and experiments have been conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed approach. The results show that MultiRRT can generate collision-free paths for multiple UAVs to reach their goals with better scores in path length and smoothness metrics than state-of-the-art RRT variants including Theta-RRT, FN-RRT, RRT*, and RRT*-Smart. The generated paths are also tested in practical flights with real UAVs to evaluate their validity for cooperative tasks.},

  abstract     = {The combination of Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) and Inertial Navigation System (INS) is widely applied for many ground transportation applications thanks to its accurate and continuous navigation service. However, with the advent of the multipath effect and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) signals caused by obstacles in urban environments, the quality of raw GNSS measurements is heavily degraded, leading to unexpected integration solutions. For this, an improved voting-based robust estimator (VBRE) algorithm assisted by the INS-derived measurement redundancy, is proposed for reasonable evaluation of satellite observation information, ensuring reliable integrated GNSS/INS solutions. The introduction of the generalized observation model allows the direct involvement of the short-term accurate INS-derived resolution in monitoring faulty GNSS measurements. Inspired by the voting theory, a residual-based collective decision framework is developed, where a group of INS-associated voters evaluates traversally each satellite observation candidate by the distance measure calculation and the agreement indicator mapping. Based on this, to determine the final GNSS measurement contribution, the detailed voter implementation is formulated with key steps including rejecting abnormal indicators, median voting, and multiple voting cycles. The above behaviors facilitate the rationality and fairness of each GNSS measurement weight allocation for integrated navigation. The proposed algorithm has been validated on two challenging open-source vehicular integration datasets in hybrid urban areas of Tokyo, Japan. The resultant 3D accuracy regarding position and velocity of Dataset I is around 60% higher than that of the Kalman filter and outperforms other existing methods. Similar performances are also achieved on more challenging Dataset II, with improvement reaching 80%.Meanwhile, this proposed algorithm presents remarkable flexibility against the various abrupt GNSS faults caused by different harsh urban areas.},

  abstract     = {Understanding the vulnerabilities of vehicular networks from an attacker's perspective is crucial for identifying stealthy false data injection (FDI) attacks and developing robust defense methods. This paper investigates stealthy FDI attacks in multi-channel vehicular communication systems. We construct a multi-source state estimation system using a sequential Kalman filter to integrate and estimate redundant state information transmitted by preceding vehicles across multiple channels. To enhance the system's resilience against FDI attacks, we incorporate a Sage-Husa adaptive filter and a chi-squared detector, which dynamically estimate and detect channel noise based on estimation errors. Within this framework, we utilize real-time state information and channel transmission residual to determine the probability of an attack window occurring. The attack process is divided into three phases, during which critical noise disturbances are introduced to create attack windows, allowing the attack to progressively align with the target state. Based on this analysis, we develop an optimization model for attack generation with complete channel information (AG-with-CCI) to facilitate a white-box attack. Additionally, acknowledging that attackers may not have access to real-time information from all channels, we analyze the iterative equations of state estimation errors and residuals to establish the conditions under which stealthy FDI attacks can be successfully executed, enabling the attack generation with attacked channel information (AG-with-ACI) to achieve a gray-box attack. Numerical simulations demonstrate that both attack methods can evade current detection mechanisms and achieve their intended objectives.},

To reduce bandwidth, storage and processing cost, we propose an edge-assisted camera selection system that selects only necessary camera images for sharing. The selection process is based on camera metadata which describes each cameras' coverage in terms of locations, orientations, and fields of view. Different from existing work, our metadata-based approach can detect and locate occlusions by leveraging depth sensors, and then precisely and quickly calculate the actual camera coverage and identify the coverage overlap. Based on camera metadata, we study a camera selection problem that aims to select a limited number cameras to maximize total coverage, and solve it with an efficient algorithm. To further reduce bandwidth consumption, we first introduce similarity-based redundancy suppression and sector-based selection techniques. We then propose a Redundancy-Aware Sector Selection algorithm, which incorporates image redundancy into the sector selection process to improve bandwidth efficiency.

Offline reinforcement learning offers a promising approach, capable of directly extracting driving strategies from diverse real-world datasets, particularly in critical vehicle safety systems, where it provides advantages in interpretability and transferability. We propose a personalized car-following strategy framework based on a one-dimensional convolutional variational autoencoder (conVAE) and mildly conservative Q-learning (MCQ). The conVAE extracts subtle feature differences among drivers, classifying their driving styles as the foundation for strategy imitation. Additionally, an uncertainty prediction model for the preceding vehicle's behavior is established. By integrating the conVAE model, a personalized reward function is designed, accounting for both safety and comfort and considering the long-term impact of the preceding vehicle's behavior to imitate human-like driving strategies. Finally, the MCQ method optimizes the personalized conVAE strategy, allowing for appropriate exploration beyond the dataset, improving model generalization, and surpassing human performance. Tests on the HighD dataset demonstrate the proposed strategy's superiority in imitating human driver behavior in gap selection, speed variation, and acceleration adjustments. Validation on real-world datasets further confirms its generalization ability and performance, comparable to or better than human drivers.},

Therefore, this paper addresses the problem of map-free multi-agent trajectory prediction and proposes a Query-based Spatial and Temporal Interaction (QSTI) model. QSTI initially encodes the historical information of agents as queries. To make the model aware of both spatial and temporal information, spatial queries are learned by our proposed progressive cross-attention encoder, and temporal queries are learned by our proposed flatten self-attention encoder. Spatial queries and temporal queries are then fed into a graph convolution network and transformer network to learn the spatial-temporal interactions among agents, obtaining the interacted queries to perform multi-agent trajectory prediction. Experiments on the Argoverse 1, Argoverse 2, highD and rounD datasets show that QSTI achieves the highest performance compared to SOTA (State-Of-The-Art) map-free methods, and even outperforms some map-based methods on Argoverse 1 and Argoverse 2 benchmark datasets.

Based on sliding mode theory, a solution to heterogeneous FTC problems with asymmetric velocity constraints only using the relative position and orientation of leader (tracking target) is given, without requiring the leader's linear and angular velocities. It is noteworthy that by collaborative selection of parameters in control protocols proposed in this paper, the upper and lower bounds of the linear and angular velocities associated with fixed-wing UAVs and nonholonomic UGVs can be made nearly identical to those of the leader. Consequently, the feasibility set of leader's motion can be greatly expanded. Unlike existing linearization methods related to heterogeneous formation, the solution proposed in this paper does not suffer from singularity issues. The closed-loop stability of fixed-wing UAVs and nonholonomic UGVs under the proposed control protocols is proven by Lyapunov theory.

  abstract     = {Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) can manipulate the electromagnetic (EM) waves in wireless channels and thus is promising for the sixth generation wireless communication systems. However, there exists little research on RIS channel measurements, which are important for the communication system design. In this paper, channel measurements are carried out in anechoic chamber, outdoor, and indoor environments. For anechoic chamber measurements, the insertion loss, EM response reciprocity, and received power are analyzed. It is found that RIS can fulfill EM response reciprocity. It is also found that the performance of RIS beamforming in the coplane configuration is better than that in the non-coplane configuration. In outdoor measurements, the cumulative distribution functions of large-scale parameters (LSPs) are obtained to explore the relationship between LSPs and heights. Results show that the RIS-user equipment channel is more sensitive to the height variation than the base station-RIS channel. For indoor measurements, the angular power spectral density, spatial cross-correlation function, and channel capacity are investigated. It is found that RIS with near-field coding and a larger size can bring a higher gain than RIS with far-field coding and a smaller size. The normalized power and code differences between near-field and far-field coding are defined to verify the RIS Rayleigh distance. It can be found that the value of the theoretical RIS Rayleigh distance is almost the same as the distance where the defined normalized differences become zero.},

  abstract     = {Adaptive cooperative compressive spectrum sensing (ACCSS) is crucial for improving the spectrum detection accuracy by leveraging the cooperative efforts of multiple secondary users (SUs) and periodic perception. The existing ACCSS schemes primarily focused on reconstructing the wideband signals as accurately as possible, often overlooking the costs associated with the sensing stage. In contrast, the main goal of this paper is to ensure the confidence degree of sensing results while reducing sensing overhead. Firstly, we calculate the prior knowledge of the spectrum signals by $\ell _{2,1}$-norm minimization. Secondly, a novel signal reconstruction algorithm combining the prior knowledge and the $\ell _{2,1}$-norm of spectrum matrix is proposed to improve the accuracy of signal reconstruction. Finally, we design a deterministic stopping criteria for periodic perception. In each time interval, the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of reconstructed errors is derived, which is set as a stopping criteria for ACCSS. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can reduce the number of compressed measurements while ensuring the determinacy of the sensing results.},

In this paper, we propose a novel SC framework based on the concept of deep compression (DC) of DNN considering the strictly limited memory footprint of a mobile device, namely, DeCo-MeSC. In our proposed DeCo-MeSC framework, an initial part of a target DNN (up to so-called the split layer) for the mobile device is compressed with the DC technique to satisfy the memory constraint, while the remaining part of the target DNN (after the split layer) for a cloud server is uncompressed, yet fine-tuned to compensate for the performance loss due to the compression of the initial part. Furthermore, the jointly optimal pair of the split layer and data rate is determined efficiently to maximize the end-to-end inference accuracy under both the end-to-end inference latency and memory constraints. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed scheme performs markedly better than the existing schemes.},

  abstract     = {Transfer learning (TL) is effective for addressing distribution discrepancies in fingerprint positioning. However, existing TL frameworks cannot react well to the heterogeneous feature dimensions of fingerprints caused by the topology variations of base stations (BSs) in evolving long-term environments. To address this issue, we propose a spatial feature topology-based heterogeneous knowledge transfer framework tailored for long-term fingerprint positioning (SFTP). Firstly, we partition the heterogeneous features into common and domain-specific (including source and target-specific) features from static and dynamic environmental components perspectives, respectively. Notably, we observe that the features captured from BSs with significant spatial distances differ across all samples, while those from BSs with close spatial distances show higher similarity. Based on these observations, we approximate the cross-domain mapping for each domain-specific feature by integrating the mappings of similar common features, which are easy to achieve using deep neural networks (DNNs). Subsequently, the heterogeneous feature spaces are effectively transformed into homogeneous counterparts, and a deep adaptation network (DAN) is utilized to further predict the positions for testing samples. Hence, SFTP is capable of capturing evolutionary environmental information for long-term positioning. Finally, real-world experimental results demonstrate the superiority and robustness of the proposed framework.},

Existing MAC protocols are ill-suited for FANETs, which require spatial reuse and real-time adaptation. To address this, we propose the directional physical carrier sensing space division multiple access (DPCS-SDMA) protocol, integrating MIMO-based ISAC with backscatter communication for real-time UAV tracking, directional sensing, and efficient spatial reuse. By eliminating RTS/CTS control frames, our protocol reduces delay, improves throughput, and resolves hidden/exposed terminal issues with multi-directional carrier sensing. Simulations confirm its superior performance in throughput and access delay, making it ideal for large-scale FANETs demanding energy efficiency, low latency, and high adaptability.},

Considering the attributes of ${\mathcal {O}}({N^{2}})$ reflecting beamforming gain and reconstructing line-of-sight (LOS) links, intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) could significantly improve the vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) channel capacity, while system-level analysis via stochastic geometry has not been analyzed. This paper proposes line process model for IRS-assisted vehicular networks and analyzes system performance via stochastic geometry, where base stations (BSs), IRSs and obstacles are distributed according to one-dimensional (1D) Poisson point process (PPP) and IRS will provide virtual LOS link when V2I link is blocked by obstacles. Specifically, the difference between IRS perfect reflecting gain and random scattering is taken into account, where the signal from the serving BS is reflecting beamformed by IRS while the interference from the neighboring BSs is randomly scattered. In addition, the blockage effect is modeled by Bernoulli variable and the trade-off between IRS deployment and obstacle density can be exploited. Theoretical results show that, system coverage probability is significantly improved by 81$\%$ with the optimal deployment density of IRS compared with no IRS scenario.},

  abstract     = {As spectrum utilization becomes increasingly scarce due to the exponential growth of intelligent connected devices in the Internet of Things (IoT), developing efficient communication protocols with simultaneous improvements in energy and spectrum usage is critical in response to the demands of cost-effective IoT devices. In this work, we propose a hybrid orthogonal and non-orthogonal multiple-access protocol in coordinated direct uplink/downlink and relay transmission for low-cost IoT paradigms, where a source node engages in direct transmission with proximate IoT users and relies on a relay node for distant connections. This protocol offers a successive interference cancellation–free approach and does not require any channel disparity for power allocation. Exact and asymptotic analytical expressions for the outage probability (OP) and ergodic capacity (EC) are derived. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed protocol significantly improves OP–by 8 folds for the respective proximate users while maintaining the same OP for distant users over classical coordinated non-orthogonal multiple access–and delivers superior EC performance for proximate IoT users at low to moderate signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) and distant users at most SNR. Moreover, critical tasks for minimizing the maximal OP and maximizing the ergodic sum capacity have been undertaken to achieve outage fairness and enhance the overall system's capacity. These non-convex problems are efficiently addressed by applying the analytical asymptotic-inspired alternative optimization.},

First, we present the FMCW radar signal model, and show the limitation of grids in signal recovery. Next, we describe the proposed joint range-azimuth (JRA) algorithm, and discuss the convergence guarantee. Moreover, considering real-time processing in automotive radar, an acceleration module (AM) is designed to reduce the running time of JRA. AM utilizes swarm information to simultaneously recover multiple scattering points.

The receivers are designed to provide reliable soft bit estimates under two coexisting transmitter impairments, namely, power amplifier nonlinear distortion and oscillator phase noise. Considering data modulations up to 256-QAM, realistic 5G NR uplink evaluations at 28 GHz demonstrate large performance gains compared to reference receivers, especially when the ML receiver has trainable layers both before and after the inverse DFT. Furthermore, compared to a baseline linear receiver, we show an uplink coverage increase of over 20% with the proposed fully learned receiver.},

In this paper, we aim to address this objective by developing a downlink non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) system with untrusted user. However, there exist two key problems: The confidential/private message for the far user will be exposed to the untrusted near user with successful SIC; The restrictive trade-off among reliability, security and latency poses a great challenge in achieving secured xURLLC. In order to solve these issues, we introduce simultaneous transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surface (STAR-RIS), which provides additional degree of freedom to enable a secure and fair decoding order and achieve a desired trade-off among reliability, security and latency. To fully reveal the trade-off among reliability, security and latency, we characterize the reliability and security via decoding error probabilities. A leakage probability minimization problem is modeled to optimize the passive beamforming, power allocation and blocklength subject to secure successive interference cancellation (SIC) order, reliability and latency constraints. To solve this complex problem, we explore its intrinsic properties and propose an algorithm based on majorization minimization (MM) and alternative optimization (AO). Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed scheme can concurrently fulfill the stringent reliability and latency requirements while significantly enhancing security.},

Firstly, we construct transmitted signals with multiple pulse repetition frequencies (multi-PRF) by changing the number of communication symbols across multiple coherent processing intervals (CPIs). This approach is based on the full-duplex ISAC nodes, which sequentially transmit sensing signals and communication symbols within each pulse repetition interval (PRI). Then, we formulate the power allocation problem in the proposed system by maximizing the sensing signal-to-interference ratio (SSINR) under communication rate constraints and provide a closed-form optimal solution. After equalizing the power of sensing and communication signals, the target can be detected at each PRF. Finally, we use the target's observed delay at each PRF for range ambiguity resolution. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed system has a larger unambiguous area and is more effective in facilitating the detection of a long-range target in comparison to the existing ISAC systems.},

However, in single base station (BS) scenarios, BA may fail when the line-of-sight (LoS) path is obstructed. Multi-BS cooperation can effectively address this issue by leveraging the LoS paths from other BSs. However, applying traditional single-BS BA schemes to multi-BS cooperation scenarios leads to a substantial training overhead. To address this, we propose a sensing-aided simultaneous multi-BS BA (SSMBA) strategy in this paper. In the first phase, compressed sensing (CS) is utilized to enable simultaneous multi-beam training across multiple BSs, significantly reducing training overhead. In the second phase, leveraging integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) capabilities, a sensing-aided beam refinement technique is introduced to further increase BA accuracy and beamforming gain. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed SSMBA strategy has advantages in both reducing the training overhead and increasing beamforming gain.},

In order to fill this gap, a unified semantic security metric, the cross-layer semantic secure rate (CLSSR), is defined to estimate cross-layer security requirements at both the physical layer and the application layer. Then, we formulate the maximization problem of the CLSSR with the mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP). We propose a hierarchical AI-native semantic secure communication network with a reinforcement learning (RL)-based semantic resource allocation scheme, aiming to ensure the cross-layer semantic security (CL-SS). Finally, we prove the convergence of our proposed intelligent resource allocation, and the simulation results demonstrate that our proposed CLSS method outperforms the traditional physical layer semantic security (PL-SS) method in terms of both task reliability and CLSSR.},

The multiple aerial radio units mounted on HAPs and LAPs are managed by the central unit (CU) via constrained fronthaul links. The limitation of fronthaul capacity can be addressed through quantization, employing the network multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) architecture. For spectral efficiency, we adopt the rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA), leveraging the advantages of both space-division multiple access (SDMA) and non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA). To achieve this, we jointly optimize multiple-antenna rate-splitting transmission, fronthaul quantization design and UAV placement using an alternating optimization (AO) approach coupled with successive convex approximation (SCA) and the weighted minimum mean square error (WMMSE) method. Numerical results validate the superior performance of the proposed method compared to benchmark schemes, including partial optimizations or those without the assistance of LAPs.},

Specifically, the inherent clustered sparsity of HMIMO S-CSI is characterized by von Mises–Fisher (vMF) distribution, given arbitrary number, position and angular spread of scatterers. The number of parameters to be estimated can be compressed to the order of scatterers' quantities from the order of degrees of freedom (DoFs) of the array. Then, a novel wavenumber-domain expectation-maximization (WD-EM) algorithm is proposed to implement cluster-by-cluster variational inference, which significantly reduces the computational complexity.

This paper aims to fill the gap in the theoretical analysis of the optimal pair-wise SDoF of multiple full-duplex node systems from an information theory perspective when the channel state information remains unknown to each node at the beginning of the coherence interval. To this end, we first derive an upper bound of the achievable SDoF of the system using the optimal signal structure of the pair-wise secrecy rate. Then, by demonstrating that the upper bound is achievable using Gaussian signals, the optimal SDoF of the system is derived. The numerical results verify that the obtained optimal pair-wise SDoF extends the existing research with two legitimate nodes and increases the optimal SDoF by adjusting the number of out-of-pair transmit antennas appropriately.},

To tackle this issue, this paper introduces a low-complexity Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) based Zero Forcing (FTZF) detector for m-MIMO systems. By using FFT, the need to compute and invert the Gram matrix directly is eliminated. Simulation results show the proposed detector achieving near-ZF Bit Error Rate (BER) compared to other iterative detectors with comparatively lesser complexity.

To address this issue and enhance the spectral efficiency, this paper proposes a joint space shift keying (SSK) technique, which is achieved by jointly utilizing the mirror array grouping and LED activation procedures in indoor VLC systems. By doing so, the SSK scheme utilizes the activation status of mirror array blocks to transmit information and can avoid excessive utilization of mirror resources while achieving efficient and reliable communication. The fairness of the considered system is improved by introducing a mirror array grouping technique that relies on the channel gains. Concurrently, a novel joint SSK modulation scheme is proposed, whereby the mirror array block is activated in conjunction with the LED. This scheme employs a information bit-based activation technique to enhance spectral efficiency. Additionally, the low complexity orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) detection and the optimal maximum likelihood (ML) detection algorithms are employed.

The IRAC scheme thus helps to reduce the hardware size and improve the resource efficiency of the UAV. To quickly estimate the target's radial velocity, we propose to use the auto-correlation function implemented at the radar receiver of the UAV. Nevertheless, the use of the auto-correlation function requires the UAV to generate two identical sequences. For this, the UAV copies a part of the original data sequence and adds it to the beginning of the sequence as the two training sequences. Increasing the copied part reduces the radial velocity estimation error. However, this results in longer transmission time, and the stringent latency requirement of the URLLC may not be satisfied. We investigate an optimization problem that optimizes the location of the UAV and the copied part to minimize the radial velocity estimation error while satisfying the latency requirement of the URLLC transmission. To solve the problem, we develop two algorithms, i.e., namely parametric algorithm and a generalized alternating minimization algorithm.

We aim to address the challenge of minimizing energy consumption over the long-term by modeling it as a non-convex optimization problem. To simplify the resolution of this complex issue, we introduce a decomposition approach using a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (DRL) technique. Specifically, we decompose the problem into the sub-problems of computational resource and power allocation, and phase shifting, amplitude coefficient, offloading ratio, and time optimization. Based on theoretical derivations, we determine the optimal computational resource and power allocation for the given phase shifting, amplitude coefficient, offloading ratio, and time. Then, we propose a multi-agent twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient (TD3) algorithm to jointly optimize phase shifting, amplitude coefficient, offloading ratio, and time for each time slot. Simulation outcomes demonstrate that the decomposition-based multi-agent TD3 (DB-MATD3) algorithm achieves faster convergence compared to conventional centralized DRL approaches. Compared with other existing methods, the proposed task offloading strategy, which employs the ES-based STAR-RIS, achieves energy savings of 28.7% to 40.8%.},

  abstract     = {As a promising technology, reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) can customize the wireless channel through the adjustmentof its phase, and strengthen the localization performance and anti-jamming capability of multiple input multiple output (MIMO) radar. Thus, it is imperative to investigate a jamming strategy against the RIS-aided MIMO radar localization system. In this paper, we consider a jamming power allocation problem for RIS-aided MIMO radar based on cramér-rao bound (CRB) criteria. To this end, we first derive the CRB regarding target location estimation of RIS-aided MIMO radar in the presence of jammers. Subsequently, we formulate the jamming power allocation problem to maximize the minimum of the average CRB of RIS-aided MIMO radar via jointly optimizing the jamming power and RIS phase under the power budget and peak power constraints. Due to the variable coupling and high non-convexity of CRB, the optimization problem is extremely challenging to tackle. To solve the non-convex problem, we develop an alternating iterative algorithm with respect to the jamming power allocation and RIS phase design optimization subproblems. Specifically, we first transform the jamming power allocation subproblem into the form of linear programming for solution. Then, the RIS phase design subproblem is relaxed by the arithmetic-harmonic mean inequality to circumvent the complex matrix inversion, and converted into a fractional programming problem that can be solved through quadratic transformation approach. Owing to a degeneration of the solution induced by the inequality relaxation, we further propose a tightening-relaxation strategy to improve the solution quality, and re-optimize the RIS phase based on the previously derived solution. The ultimate solution can be achieved by alternately optimizing the jamming power and the re-optimized RIS phase. Simulation results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.},

  abstract     = {Centralized open radio access networks (O-RANs) aggregate computing resources of multiple cells to improve resource utilization and achieve statistical multiplexing gain (SMG), i.e., the ratio of the number of deployed resources (DepR) for distributed radio access network (D-RAN) to that for O-RAN. SMG of O-RAN has been investigated with infinite number of cells with homogeneous bursty-temporal traffic features. However, in practice, the number of cells is limited, and in the era of Internet of Things (IoT), cells with heterogeneous bursty-temporal traffics (het-traffics), should be considered. This paper analyzes the SMG of O-RAN with limited het-traffic cells. First of all, given traffic models of het-traffic cells following different bursty lognormal distribution and periodic time-varying features, required resources (ReqR) for D-RAN can be derived. Then, to obtain the distribution of ReqR for O-RAN with limited het-traffic cells, a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) based resource distribution approximation (GMM-RDA) is proposed. Thus SMG can be obtained for any given service rate. In simulations, the effectiveness of GMM-RDA is verified by Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) test, and the accuracy of achieved SMG can be up to 99.7%, which is about 33% higher than that obtained by the law of large numbers (LLN) for infinite cells. Moreover, het-traffic cells resulting from service diversification can enhance SMG in O-RAN by 34.7%.},

However, their complex dynamics and reliance on cyber-physical systems make them highly vulnerable to adversities such as uncertain dynamics, time-varying input disturbances, false data injection (FDI), and physical attacks. This paper proposes a hierarchical framework consisting of a game layer and an execution layer to enhance the resilience of a noncooperative game involving distributed AAVs. In the game layer, a novel FDI observer mitigates communication and computational FDI attacks, facilitating convergence to infinitesimal ranges around the Nash equilibrium (NE) point. The execution layer addresses uncertain dynamics and physical attacks, ensuring that AAVs can track a narrow neighborhood of the NE even in the presence of actuator failures. Extensive simulations validate the algorithm's effectiveness and robustness against mixed attack scenarios, underscoring its potential for real-world AAV applications.},

Therefore, this paper proposes an end-to-end deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approach to maximize total task profits within dynamic DRSN environments. A continuous-time Markov decision process model is formulated to effectively represent the problem, significantly reducing the length of the solution sequence without degrading scheduling quality. Additionally, an interactive training framework comprising two phases—pre-training and intensive training—is proposed to enhance the model's performance and generalization capability. In both phases, populations are employed instead of single-shot inference, providing a more efficient approach to dynamic environment exploration. Once trained, the policy network can solve problems of varying sizes in static and dynamic benchmark tests. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method, with its strong generalization capability across different problem sizes, outperforms state-of-the-art DRL and heuristic methods regarding total task profits, running time and completion rate.},

The Cramer-Rao Lower Bound (CRLB) for the Three-dimensional (3D) cooperative localization network is derived, with particular attention given to practical scenarios involving non-uniform spatial distribution of anchor nodes. Challenges of mobility are then addressed with Mobility Adaptive Gradient Descent (MAGD). In the context of system security, we derive the CRLB of localization under the influence of falsified information. The methods and strategies of injecting such information and their impact on system performance are studied. To assure robust performance under falsified data, we propose a mitigation solution named Time-evolving Anomaly Detection (TAD). Furthermore, we model the system performance regarding the density and magnitude of falsified information, focusing on realistic scenarios where the adversary is resource-constrained. With the vulnerability of cooperative localization understood, we apply TAD and formulate an optimization problem from the adversary's perspective. Next, we discuss the design principles of an anomaly-detector, with emphasis of the trade-off of reducing such optimum and system performance. Additionally, we also deploy a Reputation Propagation (RP) mechanism to fully utilize the anomaly detection and further optimize the TAD. Our proposed approaches are demonstrated through numerical simulations.},

Compared with traditional parking, smart parking alleviates users from finding available parking slots, through notifying users of available slot locations in advance. However, existing schemes on non-reservation smart parking may cause parking competition, because users will compete for the common known available slots. Although the reservation-based smart parking alleviates parking competition through reserving at slot for users in advance, it may cause parking difficulty when there are no available slots for reserving. A comprehensive parking service is urgently needed, to reduce parking competition under non-reservation smart parking and parking difficulty under reservation-based smart parking. Hence, we propose the CRPark, to manage both the reservation and competition smart parking services. Through the Gaussian Mixture model and heuristic algorithm, we determine the optimal parking lot reservation management strategy, to reduce both parking competition and parking difficulty. Besides, the parking competition analysis helps to estimate the parking cost accurately, so that parking cost can be reduced. Through simulation experiments, our scheme outperforms other schemes on reducing parking cost and balancing parking demand.},

  abstract     = {Existing studies analyzing electromagnetic field exposure (EMFE) in wireless networks have primarily considered downlink communications. In the uplink, the EMFE caused by the UE is usually the only considered source of radiation, thereby ignoring contributions caused by other active neighboring devices. In addition, the network coverage and EMFE are typically analyzed independently for both the uplink and downlink, while a joint analysis would be necessary to fully understand the network performance and answer various questions related to optimal network deployment. This paper bridges these gaps by presenting an enhanced stochastic geometry framework that includes the above aspects. The proposed topology features base stations modeled via a homogeneous Poisson point process. The users active during a same time slot are distributed according to a mixture of a Matérn cluster process and a Gauss-Poisson process, featuring groups of users possibly carrying several equipments. In this paper, we derive the marginal and meta distributions of the downlink and uplink EMFE and we characterize the uplink to downlink EMFE ratio. Moreover, we derive joint probability metrics considering the uplink and downlink coverage and EMFE. These metrics are evaluated in two scenarios considering BS and cluster densification. Our numerical results highlight the existence of optimal node densities maximizing these joint probabilities.},

Fortunately, platoon driving can reduce fuel consumption and emissions on roads while improving intersection throughput. However, due to the complexity of intersections, the application of platoon driving still faces significant challenges. Existing studies often encounter reduced traffic efficiency when multiple platoons wait simultaneously. In this paper, we propose an adaptive platoon control scheme named APC for intersection scenarios to reduce travel time and fuel consumption during the passage through intersections. APC includes two main components: speed trajectory planning and optimal length planning. The speed trajectory planning minimizes delay and fuel consumption at intersections, and the optimal length planning ensures correct platoon maneuvers before intersection passage. Simulation experiments on the open-source platform VENTOS show that APC reduces travel time and fuel consumption by 20.30% and 13.99%, respectively, compared to similar methods. Particularly in high-density traffic, APC reduces travel time and fuel consumption by 23.08% and 19.58%, respectively.},

  abstract     = {The complexity and suddenness of secondary geological disasters make it difficult to predict the risks in advance. Therefore, implementing rapid and sustainable monitoring of these hazards is crucial. However, due to the variability of geological disasters across regions and their evolution over time, ensuring timely data collection and the ability to respond flexibly to disaster conditions presents a significant challenge. This paper designs a heterogeneous unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV)-assisted Internet of Things (IoT) system architecture for secondary disaster monitoring scenarios, including the follower UAV (FUAV) and the collector UAV (CUAV). Based on this architecture, a reinforcement learning-based low-delay data collection scheme (RLDC) is introduced. The scheme prioritizes the data collection from sensor nodes (SNs) with higher importance and dynamically plans the paths of UAVs to adapt to environmental changes. First, to address the challenge of data delay caused by the inability to precisely locate SNs, a path search algorithm based on fuzzy SN location is proposed. Second, to reduce data transmission delay between the FUAV and the CUAV, a load status update algorithm for FUAV is presented. Lastly, considering the dynamic changes in the importance of SNs, a bidirectional long short-term memory network multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient path planning algorithm (BMADDPG) is proposed. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the scheme can adapt to dynamic secondary geological disaster monitoring scenarios and achieve low-delay data collection from SNs.},

  abstract     = {Intelligent vehicles, often parked for long periods, are ideally suited to serve as computational nodes to expand the Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) infrastructure, with containerization significantly enhancing the system's load balancing, self-healing, resource isolation, and security. However, fluctuations in task demand and frequent container image downloads during peak hours create high loads on containerized nodes, as multiple mobile devices offload tasks simultaneously, leading to significant processing delays. Many existing studies make the simplified assumption of predefined patterns of task arrivals, which overlooks this issue and makes suboptimal decisions. In this paper, we consider a Parked Vehicles (PVs)-extended MEC scenario, where multiple devices request services on PVs functioning as edge servers, all controlled by a central base station. Task arrivals follow observed patterns based on long-term trends, such as peak and off-peak periods, resembling realistic arrival patterns rather than predefined ones. To optimize task offloading by identifying these patterns, we propose the Sequence-Aware Task Scheduling (SATS) algorithm, which is a policy gradient-based deep reinforcement learning approach that integrates Transformer and LSTM architectures to capture patterns in time-series task arrivals and relationships between nodes in a collaborative and containerized environment, thereby enhancing the efficiency of online task scheduling. The primary objective of SATS is to optimize the task offloading policy and minimize delay and energy consumption for all devices and PVs. Extensive numerical comparisons against baselines demonstrate the effectiveness and advantages of our algorithm.},

Specifically, we formulate a joint task chain, power, and UAV trajectory optimization problem to maximize the sum of detection, tracking, and communication performance under the constraints of task, UAV, resource, and task web. To address the proposed NP-hard problem, we decompose it into three sub-problems, i.e., the task chain optimization problem, the power optimization problem, and the UAV trajectory optimization problem. We then propose a task chain selection algorithm to more efficiently address the task chain optimization problem by transforming invalid solutions into valid ones. The other two sub-problems are both solved by the successive convex approximation (SCA) algorithm. Based on these three algorithms, an inner-outer iterative optimization (IOIO) algorithm is proposed to iteratively solve the original problem with polynomial time complexity. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves better performance compared to other baseline schemes.},

  abstract     = {The GNSS-RTK and MEMS-IMU integrated navigation system is a commonly used high-precision, low-cost solution for outdoor positioning. However, the significant measurement error of MEMS-IMU can rapidly lead to divergence in navigation state predictions based on inertial error propagation models. To overcome this limitation and enhance accuracy, maintaining the continuity of RTK measurement information is crucial. Nevertheless, due to the instability of wireless transmission links and communication equipment, or disruptions in base station observations, differential corrections often experience outages, resulting in a decline in measurement information quality and affecting the accuracy of integrated navigation. Therefore, this paper proposes a stable RTK/MEMS-IMU tightly coupled algorithm. During outages of differential corrections, the proposed algorithm utilizes historical differential corrections from the base station along with real-time rover station information to construct a stable double-difference carrier phase vector. This approach ensures the stability of measurement information and enhances positioning accuracy. Simulation results have verified the effectiveness of this method, and land tests have demonstrated that, compared to the traditional RTK/MEMS-IMU tightly coupled algorithm, the position and velocity accuracy of this algorithm during outages of differential corrections have been improved by 29.5% and 18.4%, respectively.},

  abstract     = {Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been widely applied as aerial relays for satellite-to-terrestrial transmission so that data packets can be delivered either directly from satellites to user equipments (UEs) or relayed via UAVs. To exploit the advantages of such space-aerial cooperative transmission, data transmission, and resource allocation should be jointly optimized under constrained resources in dynamic space-air-ground integrated networks (SAGINs). However, the tight coupling between discrete transmission strategies and continuous resource allocation among users leads to a challenging long-term, large-scale, and non-convex optimization problem. While existing multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) techniques have exhibited potential in addressing such problems, their limitations in handling discrete-continuous decisions and ensuring robust multi-agent cooperation often result in significant performance deterioration. In this paper, we propose a new MARL-based Cooperative Transmission Strategy (MCTS) to overcome these limitations. In MCTS, each agent employs a hybrid Actor-Critic (H-AC) algorithm, where the optimal discrete transmission strategy with its associated resource allocation is modeled as parameterized actions and determined by an improved AC structure. To enhance cooperation among agents, a multi-agent cooperation framework is designed based on QMIX, employing a centralized Critic to efficiently guide convergence toward optimal solutions while reducing computational complexity. Simulation results demonstrate the superiority of MCTS over a number of benchmark algorithms and efficiency under various environments, in terms of overall transmitted data and resource utilization.},

  abstract     = {As the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) evolves, integrating Location-Based Services (LBS) into in-vehicle software has become increasingly common. Consequently, protecting users' location privacy has emerged as a critical concern. Vehicles face the challenge of sending query requests to untrusted Location Service Providers (LSP) through untrusted Roadside Units (RSU) to obtain relevant results. This situation presents two primary risks: 1) the involvement of untrusted RSU increases the likelihood of monitoring vehicle communications with the LSP, and 2) repeated queries to the untrusted LSP increase the risk of privacy breaches during interactions. This paper proposes an innovative location privacy protection scheme for continuous LBS in the IoV, called LPPS-IKHC, which combines improved $k$-anonymity with hybrid cache. The scheme utilizes anonymous techniques and hybrid cache to mitigate the risk of exposing sensitive information to untrusted entities. To protect against adversaries, LPPS-IKHC generates specific anonymous sets in the presence of untrusted RSU. Additionally, an anonymous algorithm incorporating trajectory similarity is introduced to protect trajectory privacy, further enhancing user location privacy. Furthermore, by reducing the number of interactions between vehicles and untrusted LSP, hybrid caching helps diminish the risk of privacy disclosure. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the LPPS-IKHC method provides superior privacy protection and lower system overhead compared to existing schemes.},

  abstract     = {This paper tackles the growing issue of excessive data transmission in networks. With increasing traffic, backhaul links and core networks are under significant traffic, leading to the investigation of caching solutions at edge routers. Many existing studies utilize Markov Decision Processes (MDP) to tackle caching problems, often assuming decision points at fixed intervals; however, real-world environments are characterized by random request arrivals. Additionally, critical file attributes such as lifetime, size, and importance significantly impact the effectiveness of caching policies, yet existing research fails to integrate all these attributes in policy design. In this work, we model the caching problem using a Semi-Markov Decision Process (SMDP) to capture the continuous-time nature of real-world applications better, enabling caching decisions to be triggered by random file requests. We then introduce a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)-based caching strategy that fully considers file attributes like lifetime, size, and priority. Simulations show that our method outperforms a recent Deep Reinforcement Learning-based technique. To further advance our research, we improved the convergence rate of PPO by prioritizing transitions within the replay buffer through an attention mechanism. This mechanism evaluates the similarity between the current state and all stored transitions, assigning higher priorities to transitions that exhibit greater similarity.},

  abstract     = {Device-free localization (DFL) represents an emerging technology in autonomous driving assistance systems, sensing targets around a vehicle without requiring them carrying any devices. Current machine learning methodologies for DFL struggle with adaptively extracting discriminative features, resulting in weak robustness. Although dictionary learning techniques have shown potentiality in robust feature extraction for images and signals, their direct application to improving the robustness of DFL presents significant challenges. Specifically, the unsupervised mechanism of dictionary learning complicates the calibration of target location bases. The complex optimization processes also lead to inefficient parameter updating. To address these issues, we propose a deep-supervised dictionary learning (DSDL) approach for enhancing the robustness of DFL. The proposed DSDL method synergizes the advantages of sparse representation and deep learning, incorporating the robustness and interpretability of dictionary learning with the efficient parameter updating characteristic of deep learning. The supervised mechanism enables collaborative labeling of the learned signal bases. Experimental results, derived from an established DFL system, demonstrate that our DSDL outperforms existing techniques in both robustness and accuracy. DSDL maintains strong robustness and achieves high localization accuracy, surpassing 99% on clean data and sustaining over 97% accuracy under 30 dB signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions. This work highlights the potential of existing WiFi infrastructure to provide cost-efficiency solutions for target localization, paving the way for future applications of wireless sensing.},

However, some malicious attacks utilize diffusion models to generate fake traffic signs, confusing the vehicle's perception system, and leading to accidents. At the same time, some malicious vehicles send forged motion information, attempting to deceive other CAVs, which poses a severe threat to traffic safety. To address these malicious attacks, we design a Large Language Model (LLM)-selectable misbehavior detection architecture to assess the authenticity of traffic signs and motion information of vehicles. Specifically, we first design a fine-tuning approach that integrates the adapter and LoRA through a gating mechanism for LLMs with fewer than 100 billion parameters and a fine-tuning method that combines local knowledge bases and prompt tuning for LLMs with more than 100 billion parameters. Then, we design detection schemes for false traffic signs and forged motion information, respectively. The former uses distance as the trigger condition, while the latter relies on the results of plausibility analysis. Finally, simulation results show that fine-tuned LLMs outperform traditional methods in misbehavior detection.},

  abstract     = {Enhanced by onboard computing resources and inter-satellite links (ISLs), large-scale satellite networks (SNs) can supplement terrestrial networks, facilitating real-time edge computing and transmission in remote areas at low latency. This capability benefits applications such as real-time remote object tracking, vehicular edge computing, and environmental monitoring. However, different from terrestrial vehicular networks, satellite mobility and the intermittent nature of ISLs often render many computing satellites inaccessible, necessitating efficient scheduling scheme for joint computing and communication resource allocation. To meet this requirement, we investigate joint computing and transmission strategy for real-time computing applications over SNs to reduce end-to-end delays. We formulate the real-time computing and transmission problem over time-varying SNs as an integer linear programming problem. The mathematical optimization method has an exponential time complexity of ${O}(2|\mathcal {L}^{\tau }| \cdot (4 |\mathcal {V}^{\tau }| + 4 |\mathcal {L}^{\tau }|)^{2|\mathcal {L}^{\tau }|})$ in the worst case, which grows rapidly with the growth of network sizes. Here, $|\mathcal {V}^{\tau }|$ and $|\mathcal {L}^{\tau }|$ denote the number of nodes and links, respectively, within the time window ${\tau }$. Resorting to the designed $k$-shortest path-based method yields a worst-case complexity of $O(|\mathcal {V}^{\tau }|! \cdot |\mathcal {V}^{\tau }|^{3})$. While efficient under common scenarios, its running time is still relatively unstable and may become tens of times longer when computing resources become scarce. To enhance efficiency, we further design a graph-based algorithm that leverages the solution space's unique structure, thereby achieving optimal solutions with polynomial time complexity ${O}(3|\mathcal {L}^{\tau }| + (2\log {|\mathcal {V}^{\tau }|}+1) |\mathcal {V}^{\tau }|)$. Extensive evaluations conducted on the world's largest Starlink system validate the efficacy of the designed methods and highlight their potential synergy.},

We first approximate the SINR meta distribution for the uplink transmission using the distances between the serving base station (BS) and each of the user of interest and the dominant interfering user, which is the interferer that provides the strongest average received power at the tagged BS. We then analyze the spatio-temporal correlation coefficient of the conditional success probability by studying the correlation between the aforementioned two distances. Finally, we choose PAoI as a performance metric to showcase how spatio-temporal correlation or user velocity affect system performance. Our results reveal that ground users exhibit higher spatio-temporal correlations compared to aerial users, resulting in a more pronounced impact of velocity on system performance, such as joint probability of the conditional success probability and distribution of PAoI. Furthermore, our work demonstrates that the dominant interferer-based approximation for the SINR meta distribution delivers good matching performance in complex scenarios, such as Nakagami-m fading model, and it can also be effectively utilized in computing spatio-temporal correlation, as this approximation is derived from the distances to the serving BS and the dominant interferer.},

The existing general-purpose routing protocols for ad hoc networks often oversimplify mobility patterns and disregard the unequal importance of nodes, resulting in suboptimal routing decisions that are unsuitable for task-oriented FANETs. To break the bottleneck, in this paper we propose a betweenness centrality based dynamic source routing (BC-DSR) protocol for a flying ad hoc network (FANET) in marching formation. Firstly, we introduce a Gauss-Markov group (GMG) mobility model based on the leader-follower pattern, which accurately captures the temporal and spatial correlations of node movements in the realistic marching formation. Besides, we exploit the concept of BC defined in graph theory to measure the structural unequal importance of relay nodes, i.e., to determine link weights, in the particular marching formation topology. The path of least cost is calculated relying on a weighted directed graph constructed. The ns-3 based simulation results demonstrate that our BC-DSR protocol achieves higher packet-delivery ratio and lower average end-to-end latency and routing overhead ratio than representative benchmark protocols used in FANETs, while maintaining a reasonably small network jitter.},

Given that effective decisions rely on timely sensed data, the Age of Information (AoI) serves as a metric that precisely reflects the timeliness and effectiveness of the sensing and communication (S&C) process. However, recent research has paid little attention to AoI minimization in AG-ISAC networks, particularly in the presence of malicious attackers attempting to interfere S&C operations. To address this research gap, this paper considers AG-ISAC networks with S&C jamming attacks, a mission ISAC UAV senses tasks and transmits the sensed data to the BS, while a mobile UAV attacker sends jamming signals to degrade S&C performance and increase AoI. To solve this, we jointly design the trajectory and S&C transmit power of the mission UAV to mitigate S&C performance degradation to minimize the AoI. Nonetheless, the NP-hard and dynamic long-term nature of the formulated problem poses significant challenges. To tackle this troublesome problem, we develop an efficient solution using the deep reinforcement learning (DRL) technique. Specifically, we propose a twin-delayed deep deterministic policy gradient (TD3)-based trajectory design and power control algorithm (TD3-TP). In addition to this, we incorporate a reward-shaping mechanism to speed up the convergence of the algorithm. Simulation results demonstrate our algorithm achieves the fastest training speed and minimum AoI under attacks relative to four benchmark methods.},

In this work, by employing a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS), we propose an RSS fingerprint localization scheme with only one AP. First, we show that the variances of the measurement errors of RSSs in decibel (dB) are nonidentical (in contrast to the assumption of identical error variances in the literature), which needs to be considered in developing the localization scheme. Then, we optimize the phases of the RIS by minimizing the Cramér-Rao Lower Bound (CRLB) of localization with a particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. To deal with the nonidentical measurement error variances, we develop a factor graph-based message passing localization algorithm by employing an approximate linear relationship between the target coordinates and the corresponding RSS. Numerical results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. We show that the proposed method outperforms existing schemes, and the optimization of RIS phases can significantly improve the localization performance.},

However, in complex Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) channels, radar targets and communication scatterers may overlap, leading to similar sparse distributions of the sensing and communication channels in both the angle and delay domains. Additionally, the increasing use of compressed sensing (CS) for estimating communication parameters has given rise to numerous CS algorithms based on the expectation maximization (EM) method. However, due to the unique characteristics of the channel in specific scenarios, designing the channel sparse structure has become a crucial aspect of EM-base algorithm. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop an appropriate channel sparse structure and design a CS algorithm specifically for the ISAC scenario. In this paper, we address the problem of channel estimation in a time-division duplex multi-input multi-output ISAC system using a bi-static model. We introduce a Joint Angle-Delay Sparse Structure (JADSS) to capture the sparsity characteristics of the ISAC channel in both the angle and delay domains. Furthermore, we design a message passing estimator within the framework of an EM-based double-loop algorithm to estimate the ISAC channel. Through simulations, we demonstrate that the proposed CS algorithm utilizing JADSS achieves competitive error performance.},

  abstract     = {When the radar system and communication system share the same frequency band, it will inevitably cause relatively serious interference. In this paper, a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) radar and MIMO communication co-existence system is considered, which comprises a communication base station (BS), a user, a radar BS, and a radar target. The objective is to improve the communication performance with statistical channel state information by jointly designing the communication beamforming matrix and radar beampattern matrix, where the waveform similarity constraint is considered to ensure the detection performance of radar beampattern. We first derive the asymptotic approximation of the achievable ergodic rate by utilizing large random matrix theory. Based on this result, we obtain the closed-form expressions for the communication beamforming matrix and radar beampattern matrix by employing the water-filling algorithm and removing the rank-one constraint, respectively. Then, the solution for optimizing radar beampattern matrix that satisfies rank-one constraint can be recovered through the Gaussian randomization algorithm. Finally, the simulation results verify the accuracy of the asymptotic approximation and demonstrate the existence of trade-off between communication quality and radar performance.},

However, the conventional single-feed approach often leads to a radiation efficiency local minimum, degrading performance. This paper proposes a novel parallel feed with two different feeding phases for the IFA&PB structure to eliminate this issue. A high-efficiency mid-high band (MHB, 1.71–2.69 GHz) antenna with this approach is demonstrated, effectively removing the radiation efficiency local minimum. The design is further extended by integrating a low-band (LB, 0.704–0.96 GHz) antenna, resulting in an octa-band mobile antenna. A prototype achieved measured −6 dB impedance bandwidths of 270 MHz (0.69–0.96 GHz) and 1750 MHz (1.35–3.10 GHz), covering LB and MHB bands. The measured average efficiencies were −7.7 dB (17%) and −4.3 dB (37%), respectively.

The objective is to alleviate the problem of massive collision due to the limited number of orthogonal preambles of an access scheme in which user activity detection is performed. We propose a user activity detection with delay-calibration (UAD-DC) algorithm and investigate the benefits of oversampling for the estimation of continuous time delays at the receiver. The proposed algorithm iteratively estimates time delays and detects active users by noting that the collided users can be identified through accurate estimation of time delays. Due to the sporadic user activity patterns, the user activity detection problem can be formulated as a compressive sensing (CS) problem. It is solved by a modified Turbo-CS algorithm under the consideration of correlated noise samples resulting from oversampling. A sliding window technique is applied in the proposed algorithm to reduce the overall computational complexity. Moreover, we propose a new design for the pulse shaping filter by minimizing the Bayesian Cramér-Rao bound of the detection problem under the constraint of limited spectral bandwidth. Numerical results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed algorithm in terms of the normalized mean squared error of the estimated channel, the probability of misdetection, and the successful detection ratio.},

However, its performance degrades significantly under Non-Line-of-Sight (NLoS) conditions due to its high-frequency band, which compromises ranging accuracy. Additionally, accurate motion models are vital for precise vehicular indoor positioning.To address these challenges, this work proposes an advanced Indoor Positioning System (IPS) leveraging the Adaptive Kalman Filter with Improved Gain Adjustment (AKF-IGA) for NLoS error mitigation, and a Strong Tracking Cubature Kalman Filter with State Transfer Matrix Self-Adaptation (STCKF-STMSA) for adaptive vehicular motion modeling. The AKF-IGA dynamically adjusts measurement variance to optimize gain under NLoS conditions, while the STCKF-STMSA enables seamless transitions across motion models in various driving scenarios.The performance of the proposed system is rigorously assessed via simulations and real-world experiments, which demonstrates a marked improvement in positioning accuracy. Notably, in NLoS scenario 1, the system maintained an average x-axis error of 0.14 m and y-axis error of 0.08 m, while in NLoS scenario 2, the system maintained an average x-axis error of 0.16 m and y-axis error of 0.11 m.These results highlight the system's proficiency in improving indoor positioning accuracy and reliability, marking a noteworthy contribution to vehicular technology research.},

  abstract     = {Novel reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) architectures, known as beyond diagonal RISs (BD-RISs), have been proposed to enhance reflection efficiency and expand RIS capabilities. However, their passive nature, non-diagonal reflection matrix, and the large number of coupled reflecting elements complicate the channel state information (CSI) estimation process. The challenge further escalates in scenarios with fast-varying channels. In this paper, we address this challenge by proposing novel joint channel estimation and prediction strategies with low overhead and high accuracy for two different RIS architectures in a BD-RIS-assisted multiple-input multiple-output system under correlated fast-fading environments with channel aging. The channel estimation procedure utilizes the Tucker2 decomposition with bilinear alternative least squares, which is exploited to decompose the cascade channels of the BD-RIS-assisted system into effective channels of reduced dimension. The channel prediction framework is based on a convolutional neural network combined with an autoregressive predictor. The estimated/predicted CSI is then utilized to optimize the RIS phase shifts aiming at the maximization of the downlink sum rate. Insightful simulation results demonstrate that our proposed approach is robust to channel aging, and exhibits a high estimation accuracy. Moreover, our scheme can deliver a high average downlink sum rate, outperforming other state-of-the-art channel estimation methods. The results also reveal a remarkable reduction in pilot overhead of up to 98% compared to baseline schemes, all imposing low computational complexity.},

  abstract     = {Channel parameter recovery is critical for the next-generation reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-empowered communications and sensing. Tensor-based mechanisms are particularly effective, inherently capturing the multi-dimensional nature of wireless channels. However, existing studies assume either a line-of-sight (LOS) scenario or a blocked TX-RX channel. This paper solves a novel problem: tensor-based channel parameter estimation for active RIS-aided multiple-antenna broadband connections in fully multipath environments with the TX-RX link. System settings are customized to construct a fifth-order canonical polyadic (CP) signal tensor that matches the five-dimensional channel. Four tensor factors contain redundant columns, rendering the classical Kruskal's condition for decomposition uniqueness unsatisfied. The fifth-order Vandermonde structured CP decomposition (VSCPD) is developed to address this challenge, making the tensor factorization problem solvable using only linear algebra and offering a relaxed general uniqueness condition. With VSCPD as a perfect decoupling scheme, a sequential triple-stage channel estimation algorithm is proposed based on one-dimensional parameter estimation. The first stage enables multipath identification and algebraic coarse estimation. The following two stages offer optional successive refinements at the cost of increased complexity. The closed-form Cramér-Rao lower bound (CRLB) is derived to assess the estimation performance. Herein, the noise covariance matrix depends on multipath parameters in our active-RIS scenario. Numerical results are provided to verify the effectiveness of proposed algorithms under various evaluation metrics. Our results also show that active RIS can significantly improve channel estimation performance compared to passive RIS.},

However, channel estimation (CE) in RIS-assisted wireless communication systems faces many challenges due to the limited signal processing capability of the RIS. Existing methods often fail to fully capture the non-uniform sparsity of mmWave channels. To address this limitation, we propose an adaptive sparse CE scheme involving two progressive algorithms, i.e., normalized least mean squares–log sum (NLMS-LOG) and normalized least mean squares–normalized least mean fourth–log sum (NLMS-NLMF-LOG), for RIS-assisted mmWave massive MIMO systems. The proposed scheme selectively adjusts the channel coefficients to improve the accuracy of the estimation, enabling more efficient exploitation of the inherent non-uniform sparsity in mmWave channels. The NLMS-LOG algorithm innovatively incorporates a log-sum penalty term into the cost function of the NLMS algorithm, thereby increasing the convergence rate. Building upon NLMS-LOG, the NLMS-NLMF-LOG algorithm employs a mixed error function to achieve superior performance across different SNR conditions. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme outperforms existing methods, such as the NLMS, sparse exponential forgetting window least mean square, and sparse hybrid adaptive filtering algorithms, in terms of CE accuracy and convergence speed.},

  abstract     = {Direction of arrival (DOA) estimation using sensor arrays is a challenging task in noisy environments, especially when rapid convergence and efficient utilization of array elements are required. Addressing these challenges, we propose an adaptive filtering framework for DOA estimation that effectively tackles convergence speed, sparsity promotion, and array thinning. Typically, the complex Least Mean Square (LMS) algorithm is employed for error minimization of the adaptive process. In this work, we propose a sparsity constrained complex normalized LMS (NLMS) method for DOA estimation, which introduces faster convergence compared to the conventional complex LMS and NLMS adaptive methods. The sparsity constrained formulation of the proposed method is converted into an unconstrained problem by using a variable penalty factor (VPF). The update rules of the DOA filter weight and the VPF of the proposed complex VPF NLMS algorithm are derived. Further, we introduce a complex convex VPF NLMS algorithm that uses a convex combination of two complex VPF NLMS filters to further enhance the DOA estimation performance. We also present a theoretical derivation of the condition for mean square convergence of the proposed complex VPF NLMS adaptive algorithm. The performances of the proposed algorithms have been assessed through different simulations that highlight their effectiveness. Since the proposed algorithm promotes sparsity in the DOA weight vector, we also examine its performance in scenarios of array thinning, where not all sensors are utilized for DOA estimation.},

  abstract     = {A low-complexity robust cooperative hybrid beamformer is designed for both the downlink and uplink of cell-free millimeter wave (mmWave) multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) networks, while considering realistic imperfect channel state information (CSI). To begin with, a second-order cone program (SOCP)-based robust fully-digital beamformer (FDBF) is designed for minimizing the worst-case interference for the downlink of multiple-input-single-output (MISO) systems. Subsequently, we develop a Bayesian learning (BL) framework for determining both the analog and digital components of the hybrid transmit precoder (TPC) from the FDBF. The above designs are subsequently extended to employing eigenvector perturbation theory for constructing the robust TPC for the cell-free mmWave MIMO downlink, where the users have multiple receive antennas (RAs). Furthermore, the multi-dimensional covariance fitting (MCF) framework is harnessed for designing the robust TPC of the corresponding uplink. Finally, the efficiency of the proposed TPC designs is evaluated by simulation results both in terms of their ability to mitigate the multi-user interference (MUI), and improving the spectral efficiency achieved. Additionally, the proposed designs are shown to be computationally efficient and equivalent to a minimum variance hybrid beamformer.},

This paper studies a heterogeneous SAGIN with satellite, multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and high-altitude platforms (HAPs) serve as aerial base stations (ABSs) in a scenario where ground base stations (GBSs) are overloaded. To optimize the number of ABSs within the system's power limit and maximize the system's downlink throughput, we optimize the 3D deployment of ABSs and user association in the millimeter wave (mmWave) frequency band. We formulate an optimization problem to satisfy the access quality of service (QoS) requirements. This problem is a mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem. Therefore, we divide it into two subproblems: the heterogeneous network ABS deployment problem and the user association problem. We propose a Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (BFGS) formula based sequential quadratic programming (SQP) algorithm for the ABS deployment problem and a coalition game algorithm for the user association problem. Finally, we employ a block coordinate descent (BCD) algorithm to iteratively solve the two subproblems until convergence. Extensive simulations with various parameters and user deployments demonstrate that our algorithm outperforms other selected schemes.},

The multi-user multiple-input multiple output (MU-MIMO) communication and the sensing task of multi-target directions of arrival (MT-DOA) estimation are performed simultaneously within the system. Specifically, we formulate the joint beamforming as a min-max problem, aiming to minimize the maximum Cramér-Rao bound (CRB) for the MT-DOA estimations while ensuring a threshold of the MU-MIMO communication rates. Existing methods have not been successful in the beamforming design for such systems, and we propose a product Riemannian manifold optimization (PRMO) framework for solving the problem. Within the PRMO, a product Riemannian manifold space (PRMS) is constructed as the solution space, where the constraints of the precoding matrix and IRS phase shifts are naturally satisfied. The problem is transformed via the penalty method, and the parallel Riemannian Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno (P-RBFGS) algorithm and the Riemannian exact penalty (REP) method are exploited to find a feasible solution over the PRMS. Simulation results demonstrate the performance gain brought by the optimized IRS and verify the effectiveness of the proposed PRMO compared with other schemes for the CRB minimization problem with communication rate constraints.},

  abstract     = {To facilitate fast data aggregation in Internet of Robotic Things, over-the-air computation (AirComp) is a communication-efficient enabler by virtue of its high spectrum efficiency and low transmission latency. In this paper, we introduce the multi-functional reconfigurable intelligent surface (MF-RIS) as a means to mitigate aggregation mean square error (MSE) by enhancing signals across the entire space for robots. However, imperfect channel state information (CSI), stemming from inaccurate channel estimation and robot mobility-induced channel aging, can degrade transmission accuracy. This challenge is further exacerbated when future dynamic CSI is unavailable. We aim to minimize long-term MSE through transceiver beamforming and MF-RIS coefficient design. To confront system dynamics without prior knowledge, we propose a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based double-agent algorithm. Our DRL-based algorithm comprises an MF-RIS mode-guided strategy and an asynchronous agent collaboration framework. Specifically, one agent designs MF-RIS modes, guiding the second agent in configuring transceiver and MF-RIS beamforming, and then an asynchronous network update framework is proposed to enhance agent interaction. Numerical results corroborate the performance gain brought by the MF-RIS, as well as the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed algorithm in suppressing long-term MSE under imperfect CSI.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a promising solution to enhance the reliability and data rate of Internet-of-Vehicles (IoV) visible light communication (VLC) systems using optical reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs). The study focuses on an infrastructure-to-vehicle (I2V) scenario where streetlights act as internet access points. The IoV-VLC system is modeled using a non-sequential ray-tracing approach. A novel closed-form channel model is proposed, incorporating transceiver, RIS, and infrastructure parameters. This model is then validated against broadband ray-tracing simulations under various system configurations, including receiver size, streetlight pole height, spacing between poles, and RIS height. Based on the derived channel model, the error rate and data rate performances of the system are analyzed. Furthermore, it derives the required number of RIS elements per vehicle location to meet specific error rate and data rate targets. The impact of transceiver, RIS, and infrastructure parameters on system performance is thoroughly examined. The obtained results show that the proposed IoV-VLC system with optimal RIS deployment effectively mitigates systems outage and meet reliability and data speed requirements regardless of the vehicles location. Specifically, system performance is found to be highly sensitive to receiver aperture size, inter-pole spacing, and transmit power budget. For instance, with a fixed power budget and target error rate, the number of RIS elements needed increases with spacing distancesfrom 132 at 20 m to 244 at 22 m and to 428 at 24 m. In contrast, pole height has a minimal effect as long as pole spacing is kept constant and adheres to standard regulations.},

In this paper, we investigate a downlink STAR-IOS-assisted NOMA network with EMI, and derive closed-form expressions for the outage probability of paired NOMA devices based on three STAR-IOS protocols, namely, the energy splitting protocol, the time switching protocol, and the mode switching protocol. Moreover, to further enhance performance, we employ a gradient projection method to mitigate the impact of EMI. The numerical results show that the EMI negatively impacts the outage performance of devices, especially for the near device in the NOMA pair. In addition, the gradient projection method improves outage performance by adjusting the phase of STAR-IOS based on EMI statistics.},

The proposed detector exploits the characteristics of NTN line-of-sight (LoS) channels, where the path gain of the LoS channel is much stronger than that of the non-LoS (NLoS) channel. Specifically, we adopt multiple detection thresholds to capture PA collisions, allowing the satellite to recognize and notify the PA collision, thereby facilitating fast random access retrials. Also, we leverage multiple root Zadoff-chu (ZC) sequences while suppressing interference, so that the probability of PA collision is significantly reduced. Moreover, we mathematically analyze the performance of the proposed detector in terms of the probability of successful PA collision detection, the probability of false collision alarm, average random access delay, and average random access-success nodes under typical NTN LoS channel conditions. Simulation results verify that the proposed multiple threshold-based early PA collision detector (MT-eCD) achieves significantly improved performance over the conventional early PA collision detection schemes in terms of random access delay, number of random access-success nodes, and resource efficiency, while satisfying the random access requirement.},

Meanwhile, the similarity constraint is introduced for information-bearing transmit waveform. We develop a decoupled majorization minimization (DMM) algorithm to solve the proposed multi-constrained optimization problem. In contrast to the existing approaches, the proposed algorithm transforms the difficult optimization problem involving two variables into two parallel sub-problems with one variable, thus significantly speeding up the convergence rate. Furthermore, fast Fourier transform (FFT) is introduced to compute the closed-form solution of each sub-problem, giving rise to a greatly reduced computation complexity.

To address this issue, we introduce a low-cost and high-gain reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) into downlink UCN, where passive RISs are deployed to assist the downlink transmission from APs to users. To achieve the energy efficient communication in proposed RIS-assisted downlink UCN, a global energy efficiency optimization problem is formulated with respect to user association, phase shift and downlink power allocation. Due to the non-convexity of the formulated problem, we first deal with the user association problem through linear conic relaxation method. Then the phase shift as well as power allocation are optimized alternately, where phase shift is optimized through fractional programming method and power allocation is tackled by constructing a surrogate function. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed algorithm could bring about 375% gain on energy efficiency comparing to the “No RIS” benchmark algorithm, which also corresponds to about 165% spectral efficiency gain.},

By reconfiguring line-of-sight (LoS) Links through passive reflections, intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) has the potential to address this issue. Due to the lack of introducing blocking effects, existing HO analyses cannot capture excessive HOs or exploit enhancements via IRSs. This paper proposes an LoS state transition model enabling analysis of mobility enhancement achieved by IRS-reconfigured LoS links, where LoS link blocking and reconfiguration utilizing IRS during user movement are explicitly modeled as stochastic processes. Specifically, the condition for blocking LoS links is characterized as a set of possible blockage locations, the distribution of available IRSs is thinned by the criteria for reconfiguring LoS links. In addition, neighboring BSs are categorized by probabilities of LoS states to enable HO decision analysis. By projecting distinct gains of LoS states onto a uniform equivalent distance criterion, mobility enhanced by IRS is quantified through the compact expression of HO probability. Results show the probability of dropping into non-LoS due to movement decreases by 70% when deploying IRSs with the density of $\rm { 93/km^{2}}$, and HOs decrease by 57% under the optimal IRS distributed deployment parameter.},

However, the GJC matrix suffers from severe beam splitting problems when one beam approaches or overlaps with another, due to anti-phases among elements caused by its inherent structure. In this paper, the beam splitting issue of the GJC matrix is investigated. Reconfigurable directional couplers are adopted and configured with two different sets of values depending on whether there is beam overlapping. A joint scanning multibeam optimization (JSMO) method is developed to eliminate the beam splitting for the Blass-like GJC matrix by optimizing the coupler coefficients using the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm. It allows for simultaneous consideration of multiple potential beam overlapping scenarios in the optimization. Moreover, for the Nolen-like GJC matrix, an improved JSMO (IJSMO) method is developed by incorporating an alternating coupler and phase optimization (ACPO) strategy into the JSMO method. Representative examples are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the JSMO and IJSMO methods in addressing the beam splitting issue. For the first time, continuous multibeam scanning has been enabled for GJC matrices without beam splitting, making them well-suited for JCAS.},

  abstract     = {A Terahertz (THz) Full-Duplex (FD) Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) system is investigated in this paper, where an array-of-subarray (AoSA) architecture, with each radio-frequency (RF) chain dedicated to an individual subarray, is adopted. In the temporal domain, a frame is systematically divided into distinct segments for sensing and communication. Notably, this architecture allows for differentiated power allocations between these two functional segments, satisfying the corresponding performance requirements. Then, simultaneous time and power optimization problems with the objective of enhancing sensing and communication subject to the maximum transmitted power and sensing or rate constraints are formulated Subsequently, the maximum sensing range is determined under these dual constraints. A critical threshold of the sensing range is identified, enabling the optimal use of maximum power and a single time slot for sensing to achieve superior communication rate performance while guaranteeing the sensing requirements. In order to address these optimization challenges, the optimization algorithm is designed, namely the Gradient Descent (GD)-based algorithm. Numerical results are provided to justify the theoretical characterizations and the performance improvements of the proposed algorithm. Jointly optimizing the power and time allocation results in significant improvements in system performance and an expanded sensing range, on the basis of lower algorithm complexity. Also, a frequency dependent sensing range is identified in the THz band. Overall, the impact of operation frequency and joint power and time allocation design on the THz FD ISAC system is characterized.},

  abstract     = {Millimeter wave (MmWave) and sub-THz communications, foreseen for sixth generation (6G), suffer from high propagation losses which affect the network coverage. Another challenge raised by the adoption of high frequency bands is the use of large bandwidths. In order to deal with this last challenge, a common configuration is to divide a large frequency band into multiple smaller subbands. In this context, we consider a mobile network where signaling related to measurements used for radio resource management is transmitted in one subband centered at frequency $f_{c}$ and data transmission is performed at a different frequency $f_{c} + \Delta f$ based on the measurements taken at $f_{c}$. Here, a challenge is that the array radiation pattern can be frequency dependent and, therefore, lead to beam misalignment, called beam squinting. Thus, in this work, we characterize beam squinting in the context of subband operation and propose a solution where the beam patterns to be employed at a given subband can be adjusted/compensated to mitigate beam squinting. For performance evaluation, we present a case study where our compensation method is employed in a network-controlled repeaters (NCRs)-assisted scenario. NCR, which have been standardized in third generation partnership project Release 18, are considered as cost-efficient solutions for coverage extension in the context of millimeter wave (mmWave). Specifically, NCRs are radio frequency repeaters with beamforming capability controlled by the network through side control information. Our results show that, without compensation, the perceived signal to interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) and so the throughput can be substantially decreased due to beam squinting. However, with our proposed compensation method, the system is able to support NCR subband signaling operation with similar performance as if signaling and data were transmitted at the same frequency.},

  abstract     = {Space-air-ground integrated network (SAGIN) is a viable solution to serve users in such areas lacking ground base stations, in which case autonomous aerial vehicles (AAVs) provide massive access and satellites provide backhaul transmission. To improve spectrum utilization and throughput, non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) is used to reuse channels. However, different trajectories of AAVs and computing task assignment may lead to various communication delay and energy consumption. Additionally, regarding the high dynamic nature of SAGIN, it often falls into the dilemma of information uncertainty and curse of dimensionality. To overcome the above challenges, a hierarchical network model is designed, where AAVs and satellites collaborate to process users' offloaded computing tasks. Then, a joint AAV trajectory design, task offloading, task assignment and computing resource allocation problem for minimizing system cost is then proposed. Due to the coupling between queue delay constraints and decision-making, Lyapunov optimization is applied to split the issue into three subproblems. Firstly, a AAV trajectory design and task offloading algorithm based on multi-agent twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient (MATD3) is designed to deal with the curse of dimension issue. Then, the problem of joint task assignment and AAV computing resource allocation is solved via CVX due to that it is convex. Finally, a low-complexity Greedy-based Satellite Computing Resource Allocation (GSCRA) algorithm is proposed to obtain the minimum system cost. Simulations show the superior performance of our algorithm compared with benchmarks in reducing the system cost.},

In this paper, we consider a multi-user (MU) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)-OTFS downlink communication scenario, where an intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) is deployed to enhance the performance. Specifically, the delay-Doppler (DD) domain input-output relationship of such a system is first derived, based on which, the joint optimization of the precoding matrices and IRS reflection phase is studied to maximize the weighted sum rate (WSR) considering user fairness. Note that the corresponding optimization problem is non-convex. To tackle this challenge, we first reformulate the problem into a more traceable equivalent form by the weighted mean minimum square error (WMMSE) approach. Utilizing the characteristics of the DD domain signal relationship, we then decouple the reformulated problem and further transform it into two subproblems, which are solved by the Lagrangian function method and the project-descent-retracting (PDR) algorithm, respectively. The precoding matrices and reflection phase are jointly optimized by alternative optimization to maximize WSR. Simulation results demonstrate that, compared with benchmark schemes, the proposed WMMSE-ALT can improve the rate more than 85% in IRS-assisted MU-MIMO-OTFS systems.},

  abstract     = {The vehicular digital twin (VDT) networks are an emerging network paradigm that are facilitating connected and autonomous vehicles. However, autonomous vehicles transmit real-time sensing privacy data to their corresponding digital twin representations through public communication channels within VDT intra-twin communication, thus exposing this communication to various threats of attack and potential data tampering. On this basis, a reliable and efficient data transmission scheme is urgently needed to ensure secure fine-grained data access control. In this context, this article introduced a new authenticated key agreement scheme, termed RSAKA-VDT, to authenticate user identity and enable confidential service data access. In particular, only vehicle users with proper access permissions are allowed to calculate the shared session key. The associated VDTs are deployed on the network edge in the suggested RSAKA-VDT. Identity authentication and session key negotiation are carried out between an autonomous vehicle user and the affiliated edge server. Subsequently, the generated session key encrypts real-time privacy data, ensuring secure data exchange for VDT intra-twin communication. Furthermore, we validated the security features of RSAKA-VDT using the random oracle model, heuristic security analysis, and the “automated validation of Internet security protocols and applications” (AVISPA) software tool. Finally, we conducted a comparative analysis of RSAKA-VDT against six closely related user authentication schemes, evaluating security functionality attributes, computational costs, and communication overheads. Comparative performance results show that RSAKA-VDT meets all 18 security evaluation criteria while maintaining a better balance between practical usability and requirements for security functionality.},

We propose an easy-to-implement, novel spatial domain self-interference cancellation (SIC) method, where an additional radio-frequency (RF) chain is implemented on the transmitter side of the FD transceiver to perform SIC only. The main idea is to transmit a specific SIC signal through the additional RF chain to the receiver of the FD system to mitigate the self-interference (SI). Based on this approach, we demonstrate that conventional MIMO precoders, such as zero-forcing (ZF) and regularized zero-forcing (RZF), can gain SIC capability within our system model, enabling FD operation of the transceiver system. In particular, we show that the ZF precoder outperforms the RZF precoder in terms of SIC. Furthermore, we assess our proposed SIC strategy in terms of energy efficiency (EE) and show through theory and simulation that our method is more energy-efficient than other existing methods for a weakly correlated communication channel. Additionally, our simulation results highlight the influence of the number of antennas dedicated to transmitting the SIC signal in our approach, providing a practical and clear understanding of the SIC performance and EE for both the ZF and RZF precoders.},

To overcome these challenges, this paper presents an optimized decoding and puncturing scheme. By leveraging equalization results to estimate and classify distortion levels in received symbols, our scheme allows for targeted adjustments to the decoding tree structure. In instances of decoding failure, the scheme selectively includes varying lengths of auxiliary information in the feedback, assisting the sender in making puncturing decisions.

The framework of federated learning is adopted to save the limited communication bandwidth and improve data security. LSTM with attention mechanism is put forward, which can assign the weight of the learned features and reduce data redundancy. The federated averaging (FedAvg) algorithm is used for optimization. According to the characteristics of the modulated radio signals, the joint augmentation policy (JAP) combining rotation and flipping is drawn to improve the classification accuracy in FL-MoLSTM. Lastly, in FL-MoLSTM, the bandwidth shortage problem is addressed while protecting data privacy without causing severe performance loss. Our results show that the classification accuracy of FL-MoLSTM reaches more than 90% in AMC.},

The cloud radio access networks (CRAN) structured 5G downlink signal is proposed for MCI with much enhanced resolution. We first conduct MCI to obtain 3D images of the environment including users and obstacles, based on which we calculate the optimal position of the STAR by the proposed algorithm. We further combine with channel estimation and propose a semi-passive structure of the STAR and ambiguity elimination scheme for separated channel estimation. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme increases the system performance dramatically compared to the benchmark and the case when the STAR operates with random phases. Furthermore, the proposed scheme improves the system performance on average by 14.26%, 18.35% and 60.60% for three different configurations compared to that at the 10% deviation from the optimal position of the STAR even with perfect channel state information (CSI).},

In this paper, we consider a beam-focusing design for localizing multiple sources in the radiating near-field. Our formulation accommodates various expected types of implementations of large antenna arrays, including hybrid analog/digital architectures and dynamic metasurface antennas (DMAs). We consider a direct localization estimation method exploiting curvature-of-arrival of impinging spherical wavefront to obtain user positions. In this regard, we adopt a two-stage approach configuring the array to optimize near-field positioning. In the first step, we focus only on adjusting the array coefficients, assuming actual user positions have been known, to minimize the estimation error. We obtain a closed-form approximate solution based on projection and a better one based on the Riemann gradient algorithm. We then extend this approach to localize and focus the beams simultaneously via a sub-optimal iterative approach that does not rely on such pre knowledge of positions. The simulation results show that near-field localization accuracy based on a hybrid array or DMA can achieve performance close to that of fully digital arrays at a lower cost, and DMAs can attain better performance than hybrid solutions with the same aperture.},

  abstract     = {The surge in wireless devices and data traffic volume necessitates more efficient transmission methods. Multicasting has garnered consistent attention as a means to fulfill the increasing demand for more efficient data transmission methods. Nevertheless, leveraging multicast wireless networks for spatio-temporally asynchronous data requests poses challenges. In this context, this paper introduces a new multicast mechanism called set-up based merged multicast (SMMC) to minimize the delivery time of the requested file in wireless networks by considering the uncertainties inherent in wireless channels. The proposed mechanism comprises two phases. The first phase involves gathering asynchronous requests for a file from users experiencing diverse channel conditions. During this phase, packets of the requested file are transmitted individually in unicast mode within a specified set-up time. Following this, the second phase initiates multicast transmission, which sequentially handles the remaining packets of the file in multicast mode. In the proposed mechanism, we optimize the set-up time and transmission rates of both unicast and multicast modes to minimize the expected file delivery time by jointly taking into account the statistical characteristics of wireless channels, users' locations, and file popularity. Additionally, we also delve into a fine-tuned SMMC (FT-SMMC) by utilizing posterior information on the multicast group size and further improve the performance. Extensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed multicast transmission achieves substantial reductions in delivery time, and this performance gain is further enhanced by optimizing set-up time and transmission rates in diverse wireless network scenarios},

  abstract     = {In the past decade, design of sparse planar arrays has increasingly become a focal point, driven by its superior performance in terms of degrees of freedom (DOFs) and anti-mutual-coupling effects compared to other uniform distributed planar arrays. In this paper, an innovative sparse planar array geometry is introduced for two-dimensional (2-D) direction of arrival (DOA) estimation, leveraging the difference co-array (DCA) technique to generate a virtual array with large consecutive co-arrays. At first, we propose an array structure referred to as shift-based symmetric coprime planar array (SSCPA). This design acts as a springboard, utilizing shifted coprime arrays to provide a higher uniform DOFs (uDOFs) than existing structures. To address the inherent contradiction between the high uDOFs and the low mutual coupling effect of SSCPA's parameter selection, we propose an enhanced version named improved shift-based symmetric coprime planar array (ISSCPA), holding smaller weight functions for near separated sensors. This improved design maintains the same uDOFs as offered by SSCPA while improving robustness against mutual coupling. Compared with existing array structures, simulation results confirm that our proposed structure performs better in terms of resolution and accuracy for 2-D DOA estimation.},

  abstract     = {LEO satellite communication is essential to provide aviation terminal (AT) services. However, due to the relative motion between LEO satellites and ATs, ATs are required to frequently report their current positions to the satellite to guarantee continuous service, which may lead to significant signaling overhead. To overcome this issue, we propose a predictive beamforming approach based on location sensing, whose core idea is to leverage a unified beampattern to enable sensing and data transmission simultaneously. Specifically, Cramér-Rao lower bound (CRLB) is adopted to characterize position tracking accuracy under the extended Kalman filtering framework. Then, the concerned problem is formulated to optimize spectral efficiency under transmission power and tracking accuracy constraints. To deal with the problem, we first prove the monotonic relationship between tracking accuracy and the perceived signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio at the satellite to reformulate the problem, and then it is solved optimally by combining branch-and-reduce-and-bound approach with second-order cone programming. Towards practical application, the primal problem is equivalently reformulated with quadratic transform, and then semidefinite relaxation is adopted for low-complexity beamformer design. Simulation results verify the superior tracking and communication performance of our low-complexity design, and it is shown that it achieves comparable transmission rate and tracking accuracy relative to optimum. Moreover, the average spectral efficiency and tracking accuracy can be improved by up to 60% and 30% relative to other baselines.},

However, inevitable timing inconsistencies across participating transceivers lead to signal asynchrony, diminishing the effectiveness of this paradigm. This paper presents a novel coordinated sensing and communication scheme designed to mitigate asynchronous challenges. Specifically, asynchronous errors are jointly estimated alongside target locations, then enabling synchronization corrections for improved coordinated communication. To quantify performance bounds, closed-form expressions of the Cramer-Rao bound and asymptotic communication capacity under given asynchronous levels are derived. On this basis, a two-stage optimization framework is developed to explicitly optimize the coordinated sensing waveform and communication beamforming, further enhancing the resistance to asynchrony. The framework leverages the Schur complement-based semi-definite relaxation to address the non-linear and non-convex challenges in the sensing design. For the communication stage, a conjugate gradient method with penalty terms is proposed to address the high complexity of the multi-variable non-convex problem. These efforts enhance coordinated sensing and communication in asynchronous scenarios, with simulation results provided to verify their effectiveness.},

Using PositionNet+, SSRnet is able to recover the sparse signal precisely, outperforming conventional methods, including least-squares (LS) estimation with perfectly known support, by virtue of its denoising behavior, while offering substantially reduced computation. The network is then utilized to perform channel estimation of high-mobility massive multiple-input multiple-output orthogonal time frequency space (MIMO-OTFS) wireless systems which is cast as a sparse signal recovery problem. In OTFS, data is modulated in the delay-Doppler domain to transform a fast time-varying and frequency-selective fading channel into a quasi-static and sparse channel. To maximize performance, OTFS systems require accurate channel estimation and low pilot signaling which are provided by SSRnet. Simulation and computational comparisons demonstrate that the proposed approach enhances performance in terms of bit error rate (BER) and normalized mean squared error (NMSE), reduces pilot symbol overhead, as well as lowers computational complexity.},

We consider a scenario where a multi-antenna, dual-function base station (BS) performs secure beamforming for a multi-antenna legitimate receiver while simultaneously detecting potential targets. Our objective is to maximize the communication secrecy gap by jointly optimizing the analog and digital beamformers, IRS reflection coefficients, and radar scaling factor, subject to constraints on beampattern similarity, total transmit power budget, and the constant modulus of both the analog beamformer and IRS reflection coefficients. This secrecy gap maximization problem is generally non-convex. To address this, we incorporate the exterior penalty method by adding the radar constraint as a penalty term in the objective function. We then propose an efficient approach based on the penalty dual decomposition (PDD) framework to solve the reformulated problem, featuring closed-form solutions at each step and guaranteeing convergence to a stationary point. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm and demonstrate the superiority of the IRS-ISAC system with HB architecture in balancing performance and hardware costs.},

Unlike the existing Flag sequence designs that are limited to prime lengths and periodic auto-AFs, we aim to design Flag sequence sets of arbitrary lengths with low (nontrivial) periodic/aperiodic auto- and cross-AFs. Since every Flag sequence consists of a Curtain sequence and a Peak sequence, we first investigate the algebraic design of Curtain sequence sets of arbitrary lengths. Our proposed design gives rise to novel Curtain sequence sets with ideal curtain auto-AFs and zero/near-zero cross-AFs within the delay-Doppler zone of operation. Leveraging these Curtain sequence sets, two optimization problems are formulated to minimize the weighted integrated masked sidelobe level (WImSL) of the Flag sequence set. Accelerated parallel partially majorization-minimization algorithms are proposed to jointly optimize the transmit Flag sequences and symmetric/asymmetric reference sequences stored in the receiver. Simulations demonstrate that our proposed Flag sequences lead to improved WImSL and peak-to-max-masked-sidelobe ratio compared with the existing Flag sequences. Additionally, our Flag sequences under the Flag method exhibit Mean Squared Errors that approach the Cramér-Rao lower bound and the sampling bound at high signal-to-noise power ratios.},

The methodology averages the demand current over a time window to determine battery current, combined with rules to maintain the ultracapacitor's state of charge above 50%. However, the battery current is significantly affected by the averaging time window. A small window causes fluctuations, while a large one imposes unwanted currents to control the ultracapacitor's state of charge. As so, by optimizing the averaging window, this strategy minimizes battery current stress and power loss. Simulations under an urban driving cycle compare the proposed strategy with a sole-battery configuration, dynamic programming (benchmark), and rule-based approaches (original strategy). The simulation results indicate that the proposed strategy smooths battery currents, achieves over 75% of dynamic programming's effectiveness in extending battery life, and reduces computational burden and memory usage by over 85%. The strategy's low computational burden, and causal nature enable real-time control, which is demonstrated practically on an experimental setup.},

Considering this case, the FDA-MIMO radar employing the large frequency offset and inter-pulse coding modulation scheme, which is named the enhanced FDA-MIMO radar in this paper, is explored to resolve range ambiguity and estimate target parameters. Large frequency offset causes the signals of different antennas to occupy different frequency bands. Besides, the orthogonal polyphase codes among pulses are utilized to distinguish range ambiguous targets. Therefore, the proposed framework is advantageous in separating range ambiguity echo and realizing high resolution of target. To further resolve the targets within a range cell, a two-stage estimation method for angle and the principal range difference with the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) is proposed. Finally, we firstly study the Ziv-Zakai bound (ZZB) and the Cramér-Rao bound (CRB) for the enhanced FDA-MIMO radar, which are performed to assess the estimation performance of the proposed method.

This article explores Control Allocation (CA) and Model Predictive Control (MPC) concepts to meet the requirements for both conventional and electrified powertrains such as parallel hybrid electric transmissions. The CA and MPC strategies, previously proposed for the upshift inertia phase, are extended in this article to torque phase to obtain integrated optimal shift control strategies. These strategies optimally coordinate oncoming and off-going clutch torque with engine torque to balance the conflicting shift quality criteria reflecting shift comfort, duration, and efficiency. The designer sets the shift quality requirements through torque and inertia phase durations, reference and constraint profiles, and cost function weights, which facilitates calibration of the control strategy performance. To further improve the performance, the CA strategy is extended with a virtual torque sensor system during the torque phase. Two variants of MPC strategy are proposed and compared: (i) separate MPCs for torque and inertia phase and (ii) integrated MPC whose prediction model in torque phase spreads to the inertia phase. The CA and MPC strategies are realized in the form of constrained quadratic programs and efficiently solved on-line by an interior-point solver. Their performance is demonstrated and compared via nonlinear powertrain model simulations for 1-3 shift, including a system robustness analysis with respect to actuation parameter uncertainties.},

  abstract     = {Battery thermal management (BTM) is crucial for maximizing the battery performance and maintaining the battery health. Model Predictive Control (MPC) stands as a promising technique for achieving this objective. However, conventional MPC approaches employing fixed parameters often restrict the control performance. This paper aims to adaptively tune the MPC parameters for an optimal BTM system using reinforcement learning. To achieve this, the nonlinear MPC controller is linearized at nominal operating points and transformed into an adaptive MPC controller. Leveraging a soft actor-critic reinforcement learning agent, the MPC decisive parameters, including weights of the cost function, lengths of the prediction horizon and control horizon, are regulated online. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme achieves a 5.8% reduction in energy consumption for BTM, an 18.8% decrease in constraints violation, and a substantial 59% reduction in MPC execution time compared to an MPC controller with fixed parameters. Additionally, the feasibility of the proposed reinforcement learning-driven adaptive MPC has been verified on a dSPACE machine. These outcomes underscore the significant potential of MPC optimization for enhancing battery management systems.},

  abstract     = {Vehicular networks face significant challenges in achieving high energy efficiency (EE) while guaranteeing diverse quality of service (QoS) requirements of users, especially under limited bandwidth and power budgets in highly dynamic and dense topologies. To address these challenges, this study formulates a joint resource optimization problem to maximize the average EE of cellular users (CUs) and vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) users by jointly optimizing subchannel assignment, frequency reuse patterns, and power allocation while ensuring the required QoS of both users. To solve the non-convex optimization problem, we propose a semi-persistent scheduling (SPS)-based energy-efficient resource allocation scheme that integrates non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) with network slicing (NS). Specifically, during the frequency reservation phase of SPS periods, CUs are assigned to network slices using the proposed NS grouping strategy, and V2V users are clustered into V2V NOMA clusters using the proposed clustering optimization algorithm. Frequency reuse patterns are then determined for network slices and V2V NOMA clusters. In the subsequent data transmission phase, a centralized energy-efficient iterative power control algorithm is introduced to enhance the average CU EE, and a distributed heuristic power control method is leveraged to improve the average V2V EE. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme outperforms the baseline methods in improving EE and satisfying the required QoS of both CUs and V2V users while avoiding over-allocation of frequency resources.},

With the increasing number of new energy vehicles, handling massive amounts of electricity transaction data has become an urgent problem in need of resolution. Ensuring the security of the vast quantities of electricity transaction data has emerged as a significant challenge. Therefore, two data aggregation schemes are proposed in this paper, both supporting batch verification and privacy protection in centralized and distributed scenarios, respectively. Firstly, an improved Paillier cryptosystem is utilized to achieve lightweight encryption in the proposed schemes. In addition, a novel distributed data aggregation structure that combines a large number of geographically distributed fog nodes with centralized cloud servers is introduced. This structure not only meets the requirements of lightweight encryption and resistance against single point failures but also reduces the communication complexity of distributed data aggregation to $O(n)$. According to the security proofs and experimental analysis, it can be demonstrated that both proposed schemes are effective and secure, meeting the lightweight requirements of modern smart grid systems.},

Despite this progress, the specific challenges faced by electric taxis (ETs) as a vital component of sustainable urban transport have received limited attention. This study formulates a joint optimization problem to determine optimal pricing for charging stations (CSs) while guiding plug-in pure electric taxi (PPET) drivers toward the most profitable charging options. The proposed model aims to maximize the overall utility of CSs under cooperative relationships and provide the optimal charging strategy for ETs. To guarantee that the behaviors of both CS and ET drivers do not interfere with the smooth operation of the system, we incorporate a credit mechanism. We propose an algorithm to simultaneously optimize charging prices at each CS and charging selections for ET drivers. Additionally, we present a comprehensive framework for the credit system, detailing its reward and penalty effect. To validate the efficacy of our pricing optimization system and credit mechanisms, comparative experiments are conducted. The results demonstrate the system's advantages and confirm the credit mechanisms' crucial role in maintaining system integrity and promoting good behavior. As a further testament to our approach's practicality, we conducted a case study in Singapore, verifying the system's performance in a real-world context.},

  abstract     = {This article investigates the problem of transmit waveform design in a Frequency Diverse Array (FDA)-Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) radar for moving target detection against Doppler frequency shift and range ambiguity. In our system design, the FDA-MIMO radar is developed by transmitting designed phase-coded waveforms with a frequency increment between transmit antenna elements, which provides extra Degrees-Of-Freedom (DOFs) in the range-angle domains for target detection. In specific, for high-speed moving targets, an optimization problem is formulated to devise the phase-coded waveforms with low correlation properties under a constant modulus constraint as well as a similarity constraint involving a known radar waveform with good Doppler tolerance. To tackle such a non-convex optimization problem, the Majorization Minimization-Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers projection (MM-ADMM-projection) algorithm is developed in an iterative way, where an MM method is employed by constructing a series of surrogate functions to approximate the optimal solution. Furthermore, by introducing the ADMM method, each surrogate function is separated into linear and quadratic functions, where the constant modulus and similarity constraints are only imposed on the former. Then, a projection method is proposed to remove the non-convex constraints in the feasible region. In particular, the Conjugate Gradient (CG) method is implemented to reduce the computational burden, and the local convergence of the proposed method is proved. Numerical results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the designed waveform in detecting moving target considering the range ambiguity.},

To address these issues, this paper proposes a frozen watermarking-based federated learning (FL) framework that protects both model integrity and privacy. The proposed approach integrates frozen watermarking into the global model, ensuring intellectual property security without degrading model accuracy in a continual learning setting. Additionally, we design an incentive mechanism based on a Stackelberg game between the CEC and mobile vehicles (MVs) to encourage participation in FLEVS while maintaining system efficiency. This mechanism derives the optimal information security strategy and determines the closed-form solution for the optimal reward function and local iteration requirements.

  abstract     = {For four-wheel-independent-drive electric vehicles (4WID-EVs), the increasing number of actuators and electronic components raises the risk of actuator failure for the vehicle, potentially threatening driving safety. When actuator faults occur, the faulty actuator introduces disturbances to the vehicle system, making the coordinated control of actuators under fault conditions more difficult. To solve this problem, a capability-based hierarchical fault-tolerant control (FTC) scheme is proposed for 4WID-EVs. Firstly, the vehicle dynamics model under fault conditions is established. Secondly, in the upper layer of the control scheme, a nonsingular fast terminal sliding mode controller with nonlinear disturbance observer (NDOB) is designed to track the reference vehicle states under the impact of disturbances. In the lower layer, the driving capability and steering capability of faulty vehicles are assessed. Subsequently, a capability-based fault-tolerant coordinated distribution approach using fuzzy logic is introduced to dynamically distribute control commands to actuators. Finally, comparative works are conducted through both simulation and experiment. The results demonstrate that, compared with the sliding mode FTC scheme, the proposed scheme reduces RMSE, reflecting an improvement in tracking accuracy by 75% in simulation and 18.6% in experiment. The proposed scheme may serve as a theoretical reference for fault-tolerant control in 4WID-EVs.},

  abstract     = {Connected Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) are being tested globally, but their performance in complex scenarios remains suboptimal. While cooperative driving improves CAV performance by leveraging vehicle collaboration, its lack of interaction and continuous learning limits current applications to single scenarios and specific Cooperative Driving Automation (CDA). To address these issues, this paper proposes CoDrivingLLM, an interactive and learnable LLM-driven cooperative driving framework for all-scenario and all-CDA applications. First, an environment module updates vehicle positions based on semantic decisions, mitigating errors from LLM-controlled positioning. Second, leveraging the four CDA levels defined in SAE J3216, a centralized-distributed coupled architecture reasoning module is developed to ensure safe and efficient cooperation through centralized negotiation and distributed decision. Finally, by introducing a memory module that employs Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), CAVs are endowed with the ability to learn from their past experiences to avoid repeating mistakes. Through ablation studies and comparisons with other cooperative driving methods, the results demonstrate that the proposed CoDrivingLLM significantly enhances safety, efficiency, and adaptability across various scenarios.},

In dynamic environments, non-stationary objects can cause performance degradation of visual SLAM systems. The inaccurate pose and lack of semanticinformation in feature points can lead to incorrect differentiation between static and dynamic points, resulting in a degradation of the visual SLAM system's performance. In this paper, we propose a novel visual SLAM system based on multi-task deep neural networks to address this issue. Specifically, we apply multi-task deep neural networks to extract higher quality and more robust oriented local features and perceive dynamic semantic regions, which are used to better remove dynamic points spatially and potential dynamic points semantically in the SLAM system. We evaluate our method on public datasets, and the results show that our method outperforms existing visual SLAM systems.},

  abstract     = {To satisfy the low delay, low jitter, and high success rate requirements for in-vehicle networks, IEEE 802.1 Task Group proposed Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN), which has aroused increasing attention in managing time-critical services in networks. This paper resolves the following issue: how to minimize the worst-case response time (WCRT) of frame forwarding in TSN under no-wait scenarios to guarantee low-latency transmission, stability, and high success rate for in-vehicle TSN networks? Currently, some work resolves this problem by leveraging integer linear programming, and others apply heuristic methods to avoid the time complexity problem, but the success rate is affected since they are prone to get trapped in local optima. To reach a balance between time-complexity and success rate, a scheme named Frame Dynamic Priority Scheduling Mechanism (FDPSM) is proposed, where the frame dynamic priority levels are set up and frames are scheduled accordingly. The target is to maximize the success rate and minimize the WCRT for in-vehicle networks. We evaluate the proposed mechanism from aspects such as traffic forwarding time, size of windows, number of hops, and the network load, together with success rate and the simulation results demonstrate the advantages of the FDPSM for in-vehicle TSN networks.},

  abstract     = {The prediction of surrounding vehicles' lane-changing intentions and trajectories is critical to the decision-making of autonomous vehicles. However, the precise trajectory prediction is challenging because of uncertainties in human intentions and complexities in vehicle interaction. To address these challenges, a new framework for joint prediction of vehicle intention and trajectory is proposed in this paper. The Interactive Dynamic Bayesian Network (IDBN) and the Transformer are used to establish the connections among vehicle interaction, lane-changing intentions and trajectories. Initially, the intentions of the surrounding vehicle and subject vehicle are modeled as nodes within the IDBN. The IDBN simulates the interaction of intentions and predicts the lane-changing intention of the surrounding vehicle. Subsequently, the lane-changing intention probabilities are fused by the Transformer to predict the future trajectories of surrounding vehicle. Validation of the proposed algorithm is performed using the NGSIM dataset. The results demonstrate that the average intention prediction accuracy of the IDBN is improved by 4.22% over the Non-Interactive Dynamic Bayesian Network. Among four existing models, the IDBN exhibits the best performance. Compared to the Transformer without intention fusion, the root mean square error of the intention fusion Transformer decreases by 5.61%–10.8%. The study significantly advances the prediction and decision-making in automated driving, and therefore greatly promotes the transportation safety and automobile intelligence.},

  abstract     = {Although intelligent vehicles have been widely used, the assurance of their safety remains challenging, as evidenced by the high rate of disengagement and traffic accidents. Before the deployment of intelligent vehicles, comprehensive testing and validation are indispensable to ensure the safety of passengers and pedestrians, as well as to drive technological advancements. Existing studies have developed numerous artificial intelligent methods for the testing and validation. However, these methods encounter the challenges regarding the time-consuming expenditure and interpretability of the complex network structures they adopted. Moreover, it is difficult for these methods to design sampling functions that are tailored to different testing objectives. Therefore, this study proposes a new testing method by using the gradient of the logarithmic function of the evaluation distribution as a direction field to generate testing scenarios while making the sampling of testing scenarios towards critical regions. First, the operational design domain (ODD) is segmented into distinct subintervals to decrease the complexity of modeling. In these subintervals, the available traffic states are modeled as numerous high-dimensional Gaussian distribution functions, and the overlapping regions are represented as a Gaussian mixture model, i.e., a linear combination of adjacent Gaussian models. Then, the distribution of evaluation metrics within each interval is assumed differentiable. Taylor expansion is performed to derivate the sampling direction of critical scenarios conditioned on quantitative indexes. And the direction field is approximated using a simple neural network. Afterwards, model parameters within each subinterval are estimated using naturalistic driving data, and critical testing scenarios are generated. Finally, the proposed testing method is verified through an extensive variety of experiments. Results demonstrate that the proposed direction field – guided testing method efficiently uncovers more critical scenarios efficiently and boosts the testing efficiency.},

The agility-and-resilience of UAVs allow them to be rapidly assigned in accordance with mobile user status and charging strategies that require energy-efficient scheduling without compromising the current quality of service. However, as the limited coverage radius and endurance, efficiently scheduling multi-UAVs to adaptively charge, considering service fairness, and minimizing the replacement consumption of UAVs is difficult. Therefore, a multi-objective charging coverage problem is designed to address these factors, which involves the constrained Pareto dominance principle. Subsequently, an assisted deep reinforcement learning model based on the survival incentive (ADRL-SI) is proposed to adaptively charge UAVs while taking into account user fairness and energy-efficient deployment. ADRL-SI adopts a multi-objective particle swarm optimisation approach to assist different agents in learning. The survival incentive mechanism is responsible for securing the UAVs with minimum residual energy. Finally, simulation results display that the proposed ADRL-SI is more advantage than current DRL-based methods in the matter of user service level, UAV energy efficiency, adaptive charging security, and system convergence.},

To tackle the intractability while preserving the feasible region, we introduce trajectory planning with cumulative key constraints (TPCKC), with which we won first prize in the trajectory planning competition of automated parking (TPCAP). In the proposed method, only the violated vertex-to-polytope constraints are treated as key constraints and added to a collision avoidance constraint set. Iteratively, an optimization problem with the constraint set is solved, and its solution is checked for new collisions. The cumulation of constraints ends when the solution, restricted by key constraints only, is collision-free. The proposed method is compared with three optimization-based representatives on the TPCAP benchmarks. Practical real-time performance in all tested cases, together with the highest success rate and trajectory quality, is achieved with the proposed method. Besides simulation, TPCKC is also validated in a real-world experiment on an electric chassis platform under environmental changes.},

In this process, the acceleration of GSA is used as a new component for velocity update in the enhanced PSO, thereby strengthening the optimization ability of the algorithm and effectively balancing the capabilities of exploitation and exploration. In addition, this study employs cubic spline interpolation to fit the flight path, making the path smoother and more in line with the flight characteristics of UAVs. The experiments are simulated in a three-dimensional environment, compared with algorithms such as the PSO, GSA, spherical vector particle swarm optimization (SPSO), and differential evolution cylindrical vector particle swarm optimization (DEPSO), and the results show that the GEPSO algorithm can plan paths with higher stability and better quality in complex three-dimensional environments.},

Image matching algorithms have higher matching accuracy and information utilization than single point matching and sequence matching. However, the spatial domain image feature matching ability is weak in areas with insignificant feature changes due to the uneven feature distribution in the gravity gradient reference map. To break through this limitation and solve the problem of insufficient spatial domain image feature matching ability, we propose a gravity gradient image matching network (GGIMN) with adaptive adjoint smoothing for AUV navigation and positioning. First, a training set for GGIMN with equal numbers of positive and negative samples is constructed by preparing the gravity gradient reference map and fitting the gravity gradient measured map. Then, the feature extraction part of MatchNet is expanded to construct a deep learning network with five gravity gradient twin towers in parallel. Subsequently, an adaptive adjoint smoothing method that combines the idea of sequence matching is proposed to solve the problem of unsmooth matching trajectory and further improve the matching accuracy. Finally, the GGIMN is trained offline, and the gravity gradient map is matched and positioned online. The results of marine experiments show that the GGIMN has higher matching and positioning accuracy, and the average positioning error is reduced beyond 70% compared with one-dimensional matching algorithms such as single-point iteration and sequence matching.},

Conventional sensing schemes expose trains on railroads to danger because trains must pass the rail to know its condition. The proposed sensing scheme gets rid of the danger and reduces the complexity of sensing processes and train systems because trains do not have to communicate directly with sensors. In this sensing scheme, the RFEHS receives dual polarization (DP) signal, which is all of the base station's polarizations so that the sensor operation gets more frequent. The harvesting capability of DP and linear polarization (LP) from a real base station is compared. To prove the feasibility of the proposed sensing scheme, the RF energy harvesting was conducted from a base station on the rail track. As a result, rail temperature data were obtained using DP-RFEHS in the proposed sensing scheme, which has low-complexity and is a safer solution for autonomous trains.},

However, current research focuses more on fully connected or homogeneous energy consumption scenarios in eco-driving, ignoring the impact of human-driven vehicles and electric vehicles (EVs) with high energy efficiency and regenerative braking capabilities. This study proposes a cooperative eco-driving framework for mixed vehicle platoons with heterogeneous energy at a signalized intersection. A Mixed Space-Time-State Network is developed to optimize the trajectory of connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs), while predicting and describing the trajectories of human-driven vehicles. Then, a modified dynamic programming algorithm is formulated, which converts the highly nonlinear optimization problem into a state-space search problem. The solving efficiency is further improved by 85% with a feasible state space reduction algorithm, which can meet the real-time computational requirements. The result indicates that cooperation within the mixed platoon can smooth out the trajectory while considering the composition of energy consumption. In addition, the energy efficiency can be improved by 20.39% with a low CAV penetration rate.},

A distributed direct adaptive control law, resemble to the MIT rule, is employed to control the vehicles' longitudinal motion, globally asymptotically stabilizing the operating point, specified by the speed limit. More importantly, a passivity approach is adopted to analyze the disturbance string stability associated with the platoon of adaptive closed-loop vehicle control systems. It is shown that the distributed direct adaptive control law achieves the string stability in the presence of model nonlinearities and parameter uncertainties against the worst-case energy bounded disturbances without known bounds. Further analysis shows that the vehicle platoon under the distributed direct adaptive control law is capable of synchronizing all velocities while maintaining the required safe inter-vehicle distances.

First, we model the cloud-based vehicle path following control system from a networked stochastic control system perspective. Unlike the conventional periodical sampling approach, a self-triggered mechanism (STM) with adaptive prediction horizon is developed to determine the next sampling time instant and inter-sampling control inputs at each sampling time instant. This mechanism can efficiently reduce the data transmission frequency in the vehicle-cloud communication network, leading to a lower communication load and thus improving the reliability of the system. The STM comprises a set of optimization problems with an adaptive prediction horizon. The optimization problems and threshold design explicitly take the vehicle-cloud communication load into account. Furthermore, a stochastic model predictive control problem with modified constraint tightening and terminal constraint is defined by considering the influence of STM. We develop sufficient conditions to guarantee the closed-loop chance constraints satisfaction in the presence of both adaptive STM and additive disturbances. Then, the recursive feasibility of the optimal control problem and closed-loop stability of the system are investigated. Finally, we illustrate the benefits and effectiveness of the proposed method through numerical examples in vehicle path following control problem.},

  abstract     = {Navigating complex urban intersections remains a significant challenge for autonomous vehicles due to highly dynamic and dense traffic environments. This paper presents a novel trajectory planning framework designed to address these challenges by integrating a dual-layer probabilistic rad-lane intention prediction model with an efficient sampling-based trajectory planner. The proposed dual-layer model comprises three components: short-term vehicle kinematic prediction-based road-level intention inference, Interactive Multiple Model (IMM)-based lane-level intention inference, and target-lane-based trajectory generation. This architecture broadens the application scope and validates the effectiveness of the IMM-based multi-model probabilistic fusion framework in urban intersection scenarios. By incorporating both road-level and lane-level contextual information, the proposed trajectory prediction method significantly enhances prediction accuracy. Additionally, a longitudinal sampling strategy based on predefined maneuver modes is employed to improve the probabilistic completeness of existing parametric curve-based sampling techniques, facilitating rapid and effective obstacle avoidance. A notable advantage of the proposed sampling strategy is its ability to efficiently and probabilistically generate safe and feasible trajectories in challenging intersection scenarios. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms existing methods in terms of both efficiency and safety in urban intersection vehicle conflict scenarios.},

Exploiting the near-field beamfocusing capability, a far-to-near successive interference cancellation (SIC) operation is employed to facilitate the secure NOMA communications. Based on this, the trade-off between security and fairness is characterized by maximizing the weighted sum of security capacity and minimum capacity. An alternating optimization based algorithm is developed to solve this highly coupled problem, where RIS beamforming and power allocation are optimized using semidefinite relaxation and successive convex approximation methods, respectively. Numerical results demonstrate: (1) The secure communication for the far user can be achieved in the near field but is impossible in the far field; (2) As the distance between two users increases, the security capacity initially increases and then decreases, while the minimum capacity continuously declines.},

They offer advantages such as high-throughput data transfer and reduced size, weight, and power requirements compared to traditional radio frequency transmission. However, the channel model and communication performance for long-distance inter-satellite laser transmission still require in-depth study. In this paper, we first develop a channel model for OISL communication within non-terrestrial networks (NTN) by accounting for pointing errors caused by satellite jitter and tracking noise. We derive the distributions of the channel state arising from these pointing errors and calculate their average value. Additionally, we determine the average achievable data rate for OISL communication in NTN and design a cooperative OISL system, highlighting a trade-off between concentrating beam energy and balancing misalignment. We calculate the minimum number of satellites required in cooperative OISLs to achieve a targeted data transmission size while adhering to latency constraints. This involves exploring the balance between the increased data rate of each link and the cumulative latency across all links. Finally, simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed analytical model and provide insights into the optimal number of satellites needed for cooperative OISLs and the optimal laser frequency to use.},

To analyze the performance of this system, an admission control problem is formulated that aims to maximize the number of served sensing targets. Due to tight coupling and its non-convex nature, the problem is transformed to a Markov decision process (MDP) form, based on which a recurrent deep deterministic policy gradient (RDPG) agent is trained to jointly optimize the UAV flight trajectory, STAR-RIS coefficients, as well as the transmit and receive beamforming at the transceivers. Concerning the frequent displacement of the UAV and thus the considerable dynamism of the system, we further enrich the trained RDPG model for better adapting to the system variations by integrating a meta-learning technique. Numerical results exhibit at least 30% enhancement in average admission rate of sensing targets with the assistance of STAR-RIS. Additionally, the proposed adaptive resource allocation scheme brings about 25% superiority in average, over the existing soft actor-critic (SAC) counterpart available in the literature.},

To avoid high-cost channel estimation, the phase shifting of the RIS is designed only based on the channel state information of the cascaded backscatter channel which is easy to obtain. Outage probabilities of the backscatter device (BD) and the ambient transmission, both in parasitic and commensal modes, are derived based on Lyapunov’s theorem and Hermite-Gauss quadrature. Simulation results illustrate that the BD outage performance is highly sensitive to the number of RIS reflection elements ($N$) both in parasitic and commensal modes. When $N$ is sufficiently large, its further increment has little impact on the outage probability of the ambient system, although the phase shift is designed merely to enhance the BD transmission. It also offers a guideline in coordinating $N$ with the ambient transmit power to balance between the outage performance of the ambient system and that of the backscatter system.},

The selection procedure typically requires each BS to perform a handshake with user equipment (UE), which becomes increasingly complex as the number of BSs and UEs grows, leading to significant communication overhead. Our article investigates the selection of BS for autonomous vehicles (AV) using deep learning (DL) with light detection and ranging (LiDAR). Two federated learning (FL) approaches are implemented to reduce the communication overhead, where the BS broadcasts its parameters to all connected nodes. A comprehensive comparison of these FL variants is presented. Additionally, the article describes the generation of datasets by ray-tracing approaches and LiDAR data. To evaluate the robustness and generalizability of the proposed model, transfer learning (TL) is employed across different scenarios, such as varying the number of training samples, the city used for simulation, and the number of BSs involved. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed approach outperforms traditional received signal strength indicator (RSSI)-based BS selection by a factor of 1.9 in accuracy while achieving a remarkable 96.38% reduction in data size with FL-based BS selection. Our proposal significantly minimizes communication overhead, validating the efficiency.},

The severity of line-of-sight (LoS) and non-LoS conditions on outage probability, deployed as a performance indicator, is examined in this work. Because of the proposed consideration of LoS conditions, mathematically-unavoidable infinite summations are deployed and shown to converge for a finite number of terms, which shows their practicality.

In this correspondence, we examine the performance characteristics of the XL-MIMO-OFDM HSR system, focusing on uniform planar array (UPA) and uniform linear array (ULA) configurations. Considering the multipath spherical wave channel model, we develop a system model that accounts for the Doppler frequency offset (DFO) caused by train movement. Our analysis includes the performance of effective degrees of freedom (EDoF), deriving closed-form expressions for both UPA- and ULA-based systems. Additionally, we investigate the integration of XL-MIMO with orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM), which enhances the signal-to-interference plus noise ratio (SINR) and spectral efficiency (SE) of individual base stations. Simulation results demonstrate the superior EDoF performance of UPA- and ULA-based XL-MIMO-OFDM systems. Moreover, the intercarrier interference resulting from train movement increases with speed, and the degradation in signal quality caused by this interference can be mitigated by configuring the XL-MIMO-OFDM system. Notably, the adoption of XL-MIMO technology with a near-field channel model significantly improves coverage reliability compared to traditional MIMO configurations using a far-field channel model.},

Our approach involves optimizing transmission scheduling parameters, transmission powers, and UAVs' trajectories jointly. Specifically, we aim to maximize the minimum average throughput rate of GUs, an important metric for evaluating the system's performance. To address the non-convex problem, we use a combination of the Branch-and-Bound framework and the Successive Convex Approximation technique to solve the joint optimization problem. We then propose an iterative algorithm that employs the block coordinate descent method for the optimization problem.

By exploiting the amplifying capability of active RISs, noticeable performance improvement can be expected when precise channel state information (CSI) is available. Since obtaining perfect CSI related to an RIS is difficult in practice, a robust transmission design is proposed in this paper to tackle the channel uncertainty issue, which will be more severe for active RIS-aided systems. To account for the worst-case scenario, the minimum achievable rate of each user is derived under a statistical CSI error model. Subsequently, an optimization problem is formulated to maximize the sum of the minimum achievable rate. Since the objective function is non-concave, the formulated problem is transformed into a tractable lower bound maximization problem, which is solved using an alternating optimization method. Numerical results show that the proposed robust design outperforms a baseline scheme that only exploits estimated CSI.},

However, it is challenging to acquire an actual angle of arrival (AoA) due to the Doppler frequency offset (DFO) caused by the mobility of UAV in high-speed. To deal with this challenge, we propose the two stage beam management consisting of beam training and beam tracking. In first phase, DFT beam training is proposed, especially with a phase rotation matrix to extract the actual AoA information by eliminating the DFO term. In second phase, Kalman filter (KF) beam tracking is proposed with monopulse signal to reduce the linearization loss. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed scheme accurately estimates the actual AoA during beam training phase and is well tracking the AoA in high-speed scenarios.},

The state-of-the-art (SOTA) study in this field devised a constrained weighted least squares (CWLS) formulation and its associated semidefinite programming (SDP) solution. After thorough examination, we pinpoint two avenues for enhancing this benchmark. Firstly, while the SOTA research relies solely on numerical confirmation, we conduct a theoretical mean square error analysis, demonstrating analytically that the CWLS framework indeed allows for estimation accuracy close to the Cramér–Rao bound under moderate noise conditions. Secondly, the CWLS-SDP estimator has two key shortcomings: the high complexity of implementing SDP, and the potential bias introduced due to its approximations and transformations. To tackle these drawbacks, which could be problematic in location-based vehicular applications, we develop a more computationally efficient block majorization–minimization algorithm to directly solve the maximum likelihood estimation problem. This represents our second contribution, and simulations validate its superiority over the SOTA method.},

This paper proposes a high spectrum efficiency security scheme using generalized spatial modulation (GSM) and space-time block coding (STBC) for scenarios with imperfect channel state information (CSI). In this scheme, GSM uses RIS block indices as unique identifiers, ideal for secure scenarios. It operates by activating different RIS blocks over two time slots to reflect unmodulated carrier signals, while STBC is designed based on the phase shifts of the RIS. To ensure secure communication, a low-complexity continuous artificial noise (CAN) is transmitted with STBC signals to interfere with eavesdroppers and prevent them from decoding the signals. The ergodic secrecy rate is deduced, and the bit error rate (BER) is validated through experiments. The simulation results indicate that the proposed solution can remarkably improves the security performance of the RIS-assisted wireless communication systems.},

  abstract     = {Recently, the distributed multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems have been widely investigated, where several physically separated access points (APs) connect to a central processing unit (CPU) via fronthaul links to realize joint signal processing. Although appreciable spatial degrees of freedom can be exploited, the huge interaction overhead between APs and CPU is inevitable and prevents this architecture from being practically implemented. To achieve high signal detection accuracy while reducing interaction overhead, we propose a distributed signal detection scheme with multi-shot weighted combining, where the detected signals are iteratively refined via AP detections and subsequent CPU combining. Specifically, the regularized detection is carried out at the APs by penalizing any discrepancies between the local least-square detected signals at the AP and the weighted combined signals fed back from the CPU. The regularized detections are then collected and combined at the CPU for a refined joint detection. Using the operator-valued free probability theory, the combining weights at the CPU only depend on the statistical channel state information between APs and UEs, which alleviates the interaction overhead of fronthaul links. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed distributed detection with multi-shot combining scheme rapidly converges and achieves improved detection accuracy compared to the detection schemes with one-shot combining.},

  abstract     = {Non-Terrestrial Networks (NTNs) are crucial for guaranteeing emergency communication services. However, providing voice services over narrowband NTNs remains challenging due to their extremely limited data rate. Therefore, this article presents a novel Voice over NTN (VoNTN) mechanism that combines a parametric voice codec and an artificial intelligence (AI) reconstruction model, achieving remarkably low data rate requirements of sub-1 Kbps. The parametric voice codec operates by first compressing and encoding vocal acoustic features at an ultra-low bitrate of 450 bps. These compressed features then enable real-time streaming inference through the AI reconstruction model, which synthesizes high-quality audio waveforms. The reconstruction model has a three-layer neural network specifically engineered for resource-constrained satellite equipment, achieving low inference latency with lightweight computational load. We implement and evaluate VoNTN in our testbed using an actual narrowband satellite. Experimental results show that VoNTN can provide a low-latency and high-fidelity voice service without high-performance computing hardware.},

The spatial beams configured to meet the communication rate requirements of NF users are simultaneously leveraged to sense an additional NF target. A key innovation lies in its flexibility to select a subset of users for decoding the common stream, enhancing interference management and system performance. The system is designed by minimizing the Cramér-Rao bound (CRB) for joint distance and angle estimation through optimized power allocation, common rate allocation, and user selection. This leads to a discrete, non-convex optimization problem. Remarkably, we demonstrate that the preconfigured beams are sufficient for target sensing, eliminating the need for additional probing signals. To solve the optimization problem, an iterative algorithm is proposed combining the quadratic transform and simulated annealing. Simulation results indicate that the proposed scheme significantly outperforms conventional RSMA and space division multiple access (SDMA), reducing distance and angle estimation errors by approximately 100% and 20%, respectively.},

We show that the computing speed and the computational energy-efficiency of the proposed detector circuit are 43 times faster and 110 times higher, respectively, than those of a traditional 8-core digital signal processor (DSP), and also advantageous over the benchmark high-performance field programmable gate array (FPGA) and graphics processing unit (GPU).},

  abstract     = {In the coming sixth-generation era, space-air–ground-sea integrated (SAGSI) communication networks will be rapidly developed, with broader coverage, connectivity, security, and so on. The various communication requirements call for a decoding algorithm with lower complexity and higher coding gain for the channel code. Inspired by this point and based on the fifth-generation networks standard, this paper proposes a high-performance and low-complexity Low-Density Parity-Check (LDPC) decoding strategy for SAGSI communication networks. Based on a two-dimensional self-corrected min-sum algorithm (2D-SCMSA), the message reliability can be improved by the proposed Enhanced 2D-SCMSA (E-2D-SCMSA) while considering the erasure range of the variable node message. For given LDPC codes, the simulation results show that the proposed E-2D-SCMSA can achieve a performance gain of approximately 0.1 dB at bit error rate (BER) of $10^{-4}$ compared to 2D-SCMSA with a negligible increase in computational complexity. Moreover, the performance gap between the proposed E-2D-SCMSA and likelihood ratio belief-propagation algorithm is less than 0.1 dB at BER of $10^{-4}$ .},

The input to the model is a two-dimensional (2D) array, which includes envelope-dependent terms and the in-phase and quadrature (I/Q) components of both current and past signals. Additionally, this model splits the 2D array into multiple one-dimensional (1D) array. We utilize 1D and 2D convolution processes on these arrays to capture local and global patterns. Long short-term memory (LSTM) is then applied to process sequential data, enabling accurate and effective extraction of temporal correlations. The experimental evaluation of PA nonlinear behavioral modeling demonstrates that the proposed method outperforms other comparative methods in normalized mean square error (NMSE) and adjacent channel error power ratio (ACEPR).},

We validate the proposed path loss model through extensive non-sequential ray tracing simulations and explore how various system and channel parameters influence path loss. Our findings show that while lateral shifts mainly impact path loss at shorter distances, vertical displacement has a substantial effect over both short and long ranges. Moreover, the results indicate that angular rotation significantly affects path loss, especially for angles greater than $5^{\circ }$, which commonly occur during lane changes and turns.},

However, developing models for such tasks requires significant amount of order data, which can pose privacy concerns for users. Federated learning (FL) has addressed privacy concerns related to TDF. However, previous works only consider the data of a single factor to train the model, resulting in a less precise assessment of the demand for on-demand ride services. Moreover, non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data across clients also brings a challenge in personalizing models for TDF tasks when applying FL directly. In this work, a privacy-preserving short-term TDF scheme for non-IID data is proposed to deal with these problems. Our approach analyzes the correlation between various potential influencing factors and travel demand and summarizes the input variables of the FL model to achieve accurate TDF prediction with privacy preservation. Additionally, we provide each client with a personalized model trained on independent and identically distributed (IID) data to compensate for local model weight divergence. Finally, experiments are conducted on the 2022 Shanghai data of the Didi platform as a use case, and the results demonstrate that our scheme effectively improves the model's performance.},

This interference significantly impacts the Quality of Service (QoS) experienced by vehicles. Moreover, the QoS requirements for vehicles vary widely across different application scenarios, further complicating the design and optimization of resource allocation strategies. To this end, we propose a robust resource allocation method for differentiated QoS in mIoV, leveraging ellipsoid learning and joint interference management. First, a weighted interference hypergraph model is developed to effectively mitigate ACI and CCI experienced by vehicles, while simultaneously addressing the diverse QoS requirements across different vehicle applications. Then, a robust optimization model for vehicle-to-vehicle pair (VP) communications is proposed, and underlying spectrum sharing is adopted to improve spectrum utilization. Furthermore, an ellipsoid-based learning robust algorithm (ELRA) strategy is proposed to address dynamic uncertainties arising from imperfect channel state information (CSI), thereby enhancing the reliability and transmission rate of the communication link. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves superior network throughput and spectral efficiency performance in densely deployed mIoV.},

In this framework, a server can aggregate the IoV data from clusters without inferring the raw data, real identity and trajectories of vehicles. Notably, we avoid incorporating the widely-accepted techniques such as homomorphic encryption and digital pseudonym to avoid introducing high computation cost to vehicles. We propose a novel concept, data approval, based on the Schnorr signature scheme. With the approval, the fake data injection attack carried out by a cluster head can be defended against. The separation of liability is achieved as well. The evaluation shows that the framework is secure and lightweight for vehicles in terms of the computation and communication costs.},

  abstract     = {Advanced vehicular communication systems extensively employ random access protocols to facilitate massive machine-type communications (MTC) with burst transmissions. Recent investigations have significantly reduced the decoding error rates in MTC. However, for random access, before a receiver decodes a packet, it has to first detect its arrival, since the presence of the packet at a particular point in time is not known beforehand. Packet detection, as opposed to packet decoding, could become a significant bottleneck, especially when considering that the widely used Schmidl-and-Cox (S&C) detection algorithm dates back several decades. This paper re-evaluates the S&C algorithm and presents several key improvements. First, we introduce a new “compensated autocorrelation” packet-detection metric that enables precise analytical expressions of false alarm and missed-detection probabilities, enhancing the rigor of performance assessment. Second, we establish a Pareto comparison principle that allows for a comprehensive and fair evaluation of packet detection algorithms by simultaneously accounting for both false alarms and missed detections. Third, we show that the performance of S&C can be significantly improved by considering only the real component of the autocorrelation, giving rise to a new real-part S&C (RP-S&C) scheme. Fourth, and perhaps most importantly, we leverage the newly introduced compensated autocorrelation to extend the single-antenna S&C algorithm for application in the multi-antenna setting. Two optimization problems, minimizing false-alarm and missed detection probabilities respectively, are formulated and addressed with rigorous solutions. Overall, this study holds considerable implications for the design and deployment of packet-detection schemes in vehicular random-access networks.},

However, the intra-platoon communication is challenged by packet collisions due to hidden nodes and merging collisions due to vehicle mobility. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a packet collision avoidance resource selection (PCA-RS) scheme to enhance the standardized SPS scheme. The proposed PCA-RS scheme introduces three enhancement mechanisms, which aims to alleviate merging collisions and hidden-node collisions in intra-platoon message delivery. A resource partition mechanism is introduced to divide frequency-time resources in a selection window into two sets in order for vehicles (both platoon and non-platoon vehicles) moving in opposite directions to select different frequency-time resources and thus avoid potential merging collisions; an intra-platoon cooperative mechanism is introduced to enable the leader of a platoon to know the resource occupation status on the hidden nodes of the platoon according to the messages received from the last platoon member of the same platoon and thus avoid potential hidden-node collisions; and a merging collision detection mechanism is introduced to enable a non-platoon vehicle to detect the status of the frequency-time resources it currently occupies after the non-platoon vehicle changes a lane and thus avoids potential merging collisions among non-platoon vehicles due to lane-change maneuvers. Simulation results demonstrate that compared with the standardized SPS scheme, the proposed PCA-RS scheme can improve the reliability of intra-platoon message delivery in terms of the intra-platoon packet delivery ratio.},

  abstract     = {The concept of vehicular edge computing (VEC) has recently been envisioned as a promising paradigm to satisfy the quality of service (QoS) requirement of delay-sensitive intelligent applications in future networks. However, the limited radio frequency communication range necessitates the dense deployment of communication infrastructures to accommodate the increasing number of connected vehicles and data traffic. This could lead to growing equipment and energy costs, hindering the full realization of the VEC system. To address such limitations, we introduce a double roadside reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) assisted VEC network in this paper, where RISs are deployed inside the coverage gaps between two RSUs to extend the service range. The research goal is to maximize the sum offloading efficiency by jointly optimizing offloading decisions, computation resource allocation, and phase shift vectors of RISs. Since the original problem is a challenging mixed-integer non-linear problem (MINLP), we decompose it into a top-problem for optimizing offloading destinations and phase shift vectors, and a sub-problem for optimizing offloading ratios and computation resources. We propose a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based algorithm for quickly obtaining near-optimal offloading decisions and phase shift vectors, alongside a Dinkelbach-based method for obtaining optimal offloading ratios and computation resource allocation. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed algorithm achieves near-optimal performance compared to other benchmarks and enables real-time decision-making.},

  abstract     = {To satisfy the growing demand for supporting intelligent Internet of Things (IoT) applications in remote areas, satellite mobile edge computing (SMEC) systems are expected to be widely deployed. Meanwhile, as IoT applications are increasingly diversified, the tasks received by SMEC systems present heterogeneous demands for various resources and quality of service (QoS) metrics, necessitating customized design to accommodate such heterogeneity. In this paper, we investigate the problem of joint task offloading and resource allocation in SMEC systems with heterogeneous task demands. We first propose a customized task utility model that captures the diversified demands, which is an extension of traditional unified task utility models. Based on the model, we then formulate a mixed integer non-linear programming (MINLP) problem for joint optimization of task offloading, computing resource allocation, transmission power control, and user association, aiming to maximize the sum utility of all tasks. To solve the MINLP, a multi-layer iterative framework is proposed that decomposes the original problem into two subproblems, which are solved by successive convex approximation (SCA) and deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms, respectively. Simulation results show that, by applying the proposed task utility model, the average utility performance of UEs can be improved by 50% and 100% compared to applying a single metric-based utility model and a typical classification-based utility model, respectively; the proposed task offloading and resource allocation scheme achieves a $30\%\hbox{--}80\%$ performance gain compared to benchmark schemes.},

As the foundation of blockchain technology, the consensus protocol determines system performance and security. However, the high mobility and limited resources of UAVs render traditional consensus protocols, which require substantial resources, unsuitable for UAV networks. The dynamic nature of UAVs results in topology changes, further exacerbating the network environment's complexity. Therefore, we propose an adaptive chained byzantine fault tolerance (ACBFT) protocol tailored specifically for UAV network environments. This protocol utilizes the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm to optimize the chain consensus process, enhancing robustness and reducing communication overhead. In addition, we propose several sub-protocols to assist ACBFT in handling unexpected situations, including the rechaining protocol for managing malicious nodes, joining and exiting protocols for dynamic nodes, and strategies for handling accident situations such as UAV loss. Our security analysis and performance evaluations demonstrate that ACBFT not only increases throughput and reduces communication overhead, but also ensures security and efficiency.},

  abstract     = {Digital twin (DT) is a promising technology for mixed-traffic scenarios with connected automated vehicles (CAVs) and human vehicles (HVs). Utilizing the DT's virtualization capability gets the virtual vehicle state and risk analysis for mixed-traffic scenarios to accurately predict vehicle trajectory and driving safety. However, even if a vehicular DT system is perfectly derived, the vehicular DT system might still fail to accurately predict the trajectory and assess driving risk due to its complexity. Under the complexity of the vehicular DT system, small initial state deviations lead to trajectories diverging increasingly from the true trajectory and unpredictably over time. Meanwhile, performing crash risk evaluation services of the vehicular DT system leads to false alarms. This impact is called the butterfly effect of complexity on the trajectory in the vehicular DT system. In this paper, we focus on the effect of complexity on trajectory and risk assessment in the vehicular DT system for mixed-traffic scenarios. Firstly, we consider the communication delay of CAVs and HVs to implement the vehicle model in the vehicular DT system. Then, we verify the existence of complexity in the vehicular DT system. Finally, we evaluate the effect of the complexity on trajectory and risk assessment under initial state deviation in the vehicular DT system. Theoretical and experimental results indicate that the control gain of the CAV's controller is less than (0.075,0.1) by analyzing the butterfly effect of complexity on trajectory prediction and risk assessment in the vehicular DT system. This control gain range avoids the butterfly effect's impact on vehicle trajectories and risks. This provides an effective decision range to realize the trajectory prediction of high fidelity and driving safety in the vehicular DT system.},

  abstract     = {As the next-generation air traffic surveillance technology, the Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) system plays a critical role in broadcast communication for intelligent vehicles such as autonomous aerial vehicles and aircraft. However, the unauthenticated channels expose the ADS-B system to a high risk of attacks. Besides, the centralization of intelligent vehicles management center is susceptible to single point failures and performance bottlenecks. In this paper, we propose a robust and distributed intelligent vehicles management architecture leveraging blockchain technology to resolve security and performance issues lying in the registration, update, and revocation of intelligent vehicles' identity public keys. Then, we leverage certificate-less short signature (CLSS) to achieve the dynamic identity verification of ADS-B system participants while ensuring message integrity, non-repudiation, and compatibility with low-data-bit message packets. Furthermore, to enhance intelligent vehicles transaction process efficiency within the proposed architecture, we develop an Verifiable Random Function-based Byzantine Fault Tolerance protocol (VRBFT) combining threshold signatures. Finally, through a comprehensive security analysis and feasibility assessment, the results indicate that authentication requires less than 30 ms, block generation occurs within 200 ms, and the system exhibits high throughput and low latency. These findings demonstrate that our solution significantly enhances the security of the ADS-B system and offers a practical and promising approach for real-time, large-scale intelligent vehicle management.},

  abstract     = {As one of the typical applications of 6G, the metaverse, with its superior immersion and diversified services, has garnered widespread attention from both the global industry and academia. Simultaneously, the emergence of AI-generated content (AIGC), exemplified by ChatGPT, has revolutionized the means of content creation in the metaverse. Providing metaverse users with diversified AIGC services anytime and anywhere to meet the demand for immersive and blended virtual-real experiences in the physical world has become a major challenge in the development of the metaverse. Considering the flexibility and mobility of uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs), we innovatively incorporate multiple UAVs as one of the AIGC service providers and construct a multi-UAV assisted edge-enabled metaverse system in the context of AIGC-as-a-Service (AaaS) scenario. To solve the complex resource management and allocation problem in the aforementioned system, we formulate it as a Markov decision process (MDP) and propose utilizing the generative capabilities of the diffusion model in combination with the robust decision-making abilities of reinforcement learning to tackle these issues. In order to substantiate the efficacy of the proposed diffusion-based reinforcement learning framework, we propose a novel diffusion-based soft actor-critic algorithm for metaverse (Meta-DSAC). Subsequently, a series of experiments are executed and the simulation results empirically validate the proposed algorithm's comparative advantages of the ability to provide stable and substantial long-term rewards, as well as the enhanced capacity to model complex environments.},

  abstract     = {Recently, Federated Learning (FL) has been advanced for Vehicular Crowdsensing (VCS), termed F-VCS, to enable collaborative learning without sharing private data, thus promoting privacy. However, the mobility of Intelligent Connected Vehicles (ICVs) leads to dynamic changes among FL participants, becoming one of the main challenges limiting F-VCS performance, as these dynamics can affect model training stability and accuracy. Current research primarily addresses these dynamics through ICV selection and resource optimization mechanisms. However, due to the lack of an effective method for characterizing ICV mobility, these approaches often rely on making binary judgments based on certain constraints (e.g., learning delay) rather than comparing the ICVs' mobility characteristics. As a result, they may not yield the most efficient outcomes for adapting to vehicular network dynamics, affecting overall system performance. This paper introduces a Grid-Assisted FL framework for VCS, named VCS_GAFL, which measures ICV mobility using a grid-cell model. Unlike traditional binary selection methods, our approach utilizes participation probabilities to capture the mobility differences among individual ICVs, guiding more precise and effective ICV selection and enhancing the VCS system's overall performance and adaptability. Specifically, we introduce an MMP-V model to predict ICV participation probabilities in F-VCS tasks. We then derive expressions for the impact of ICV participation probabilities on expected FL loss and ineffective energy consumption and formulate an optimization problem to jointly optimize ICV participation probabilities, wireless resource allocation, and ICV selection to minimize these impacts. By solving this problem, we derive a closed-form solution for wireless resource allocation and propose a probability-guided ICV selection strategy. Experimental results demonstrate that VCS_GAFL significantly enhances global accuracy, highlighting its potential and value in improving F-VCS services.},

  abstract     = {Mobile edge computing assisting vehicular networks to achieve collaborative computing is a significant research area, as it can effectively expand the on-board computational resources, thereby improving the responsiveness of vehicular applications and reducing energy consumption. However, the existing task offloading schemes still have various gaps and face challenges that should be addressed because task offloading problems are usually multi-objective optimization problems (MOOP) and NP-hard problems. In this respect, we formulate a new multi-objective model for vehicle-centered task offloading tacking into account the queuing and computing processes of tasks. The minimization of the average delay time, average energy consumption, and average payment cost for each vehicle is defined as a MOOP. We propose an efficient collaborative offloading approach based on task triage strategy and multi-objective optimization to address the model. Specifically, this approach can be decomposed into two stages. First, a task triage strategy is developed based on a comprehensive analysis of task urgency and task criticality to make offloading decisions for triaged tasks with extreme characteristics. Then, we propose a novel multi-objective optimization framework for the MOOP. Finally, we develop a multi-objective hybrid genetic algorithm that integrates the associative learning immediate memory strategy and genetic operations to solve the MOOP. Extensive experiments and performance evaluations based on real-world traces of taxis demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The results indicate that the approach outperforms six other well-known multi-objective algorithms in solving the MOOP.},

However, due to the mobility and heterogeneity of the components such as satellites and unmanned aerial vehicles in multi-layer SAGIN, the challenges of inefficient resource allocation and management complexity are aggregated. To this end, the network function virtualization technology is introduced and can be implemented via service function chains (SFCs) deployment. However, urgent unexpected tasks may bring conflicts and resource competition during SFC deployment, and how to schedule the SFCs of multiple tasks in SAGIN is a key issue. In this paper, we address the dynamic and complexity of SAGIN by presenting a reconfigurable time extension graph and further propose the dynamic SFC scheduling model. Then, we formulate the SFC scheduling problem to maximize the number of successful deployed SFCs within limited resources and time horizons. Since the problem is in the form of integer linear programming and intractable to solve, we propose the algorithm by incorporating deep reinforcement learning. Finally, simulation results show that the proposed algorithm has better convergence and performance compared to other benchmark algorithms.},

In some cases, users may not be well-served by RSUs due to congestion, attenuation, or interference. In these cases, vehicular relays associated with RSUs can be used to serve those users. This paper uses stochastic geometry to model and analyze a spatially correlated heterogeneous vehicular network where both RSUs and vehicular relays serve network users such as pedestrians or other vehicles. We present an analytical model where the spatial correlation between roads, RSUs, relays, and users is systematically modeled via Cox point processes. Assuming users are associated with either RSUs or relays, we derive the association probability and the coverage probability of the typical user. Then, we derive the user throughput by considering interactions of links unique to the proposed network. This paper gives practical insights into designing spatially correlated vehicular networks assisted by vehicle relays. For instance, we express network performance such as user association, signal-to-interference (SIR) coverage probability, and network throughput as the functions of network key geometric parameters. In practice, this helps one to optimize the network so as to achieve ultra reliability or maximum user throughput of the vehicular networks by varying key aspects such as the relay density or the bandwidth for relays.},

For example, the signcryption sender's identity can be revealed if needed (e.g., investigation).

For a UAV mounted with directional antennas, its tilting effect has a crucial impact on the communication performance, which is however ignored in the related studies. In this paper, we first characterize the relationship between the tilting effect of the UAV and its flight status based on force analysis. Then, we investigate a UAV-enabled downlink communication system, where the UAV, equipped with a directional antenna, provides communication services to ground users (GUs). We formulate an energy efficiency (EE) maximization problem that optimizes the UAV trajectory under the consideration of the tilting effect. The formulated problem is challenging to solve due to the complicated expressions of the directional antenna radiation pattern and the adopted propulsion energy consumption model of the UAV. To tackle this, by utilizing the successive convex approximation technique, we propose an approximate antenna radiation pattern that serves as a convex lower bound of the original antenna gain, and develop an efficient algorithm to obtain a suboptimal solution. Simulation results show that the negative impact of the tilting effect on the EE can be efficiently mitigated and the UAV flight can be made more steady under the tilting effect. In addition, the proposed algorithm allows the UAV to achieve a substantially higher EE compared to the benchmark schemes.},

  abstract     = {Cognitive radio (CR)-empowered 6G networks are deemed a key candidate technology to achieve ultra-reliable low latency communication (URLLC) with enhanced spectrum utilization efficiency. However, there are several challenges to address in achieving this objective. In particular, the sequential and random sensing performed by secondary users (SUs) to find idle channels within a given band in a CR network (CRN) leads to time and energy consumption, and processing overheads, which consequently cause early depletion of the device's energy, underutilization of the available spectrum, and prolonged delays in communication. To circumvent this problem, in this paper, a spectrum efficient scheme is proposed based on idle spectrum inference and ranking, which takes into account the devices' heterogeneity as well as their priorities in resource allocation. Based on the probabilistic approach, the scheme uses multiple parameters in a channel's evaluation and suitability assessment before selection for transmission. Markov chain modeling is leveraged to deal with the users' arrival and departure uncertainties and to derive expressions for core performance metrics, including service capacity and retainability, spectrum utilization efficiency, reliability, network unserviceable and handoff probabilities, channel availability, and communication latency. The scheme is analyzed under various patterns of users' arrivals. The acquired analytical and simulation results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed scheme compared to the state-of-the-art to realize URLLC applications.},

Massive multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) can provide spatial degrees of freedom, which can be utilized for RA resource extension. In this paper, we propose a novel beamspace RA scheme, which achieves fully spatial preamble reuse. Specifically, the cell is divided into several beam zones via directional beams, and preambles are fully reused per beam. To mitigate preamble collision and side-lobe interference, we combine the access class barring (ACB) method with preamble reuse, which efficiently improves RA throughput. Meanwhile, an efficient algorithm is proposed to determine these multiple ACB factors. The proposed scheme is applicable to both grant-based and grant-free RA procedures. Through detailed analysis and simulation results, the proposed scheme can significantly improve the RA performance in bursty traffic model.},

  abstract     = {This paper evaluates the network performance of a cellular system operating at 100 GHz with bandwidth of around 3 GHz under a dynamic transmission and reception point (TRP)-side discontinuous transmission (DTX) regime. The use of sub-terahertz (THz) bands is envisioned as a means to achieve higher data rates in sixth-generation (6G) systems. However, in this network setup, the power consumption at TRPs' radio components packed with several antenna elements significantly increases due to the very high processing burden in such a wide bandwidth. A TRP-side DTX method is proposed to avoid overheating issues, which controls the amount of downlink slot transmissions while guaranteeing cell-specific reference signaling. Simulation results considering different DTX settings and traffic loads are presented and discussed. Results show that the considered sub-THz system with the proposed DTX method can provide higher data rates and close to the same spectral efficiency compared to a typical baseline millimeter wave (mmWave) system operating at 28 GHz with 400 MHz bandwidth. It was possible to reach close to 7 times higher data rates in the simulated system utilizing the dynamic DTX method, compared to a theoretical data rate increase of 7.6 times based solely on bandwidth comparison.},

When the maximum channel power gain from the transmitter in the main network to the users in adjacent networks is smaller than the threshold, the transmitter sends the NOMA signals to the users with the assistance of STAR-RIS. Moreover, channel estimation errors and imperfect successive interference cancellation (SIC) are considered in the system analysis. To characterize the covert performance, the detection error probability (DEP) and the average minimum detection error probability (AMDEP) are first derived. Then, the closed-form solutions of the outage probability (OP) for the users are obtained. Finally, the maximum effective covert rate (ECR) subject to the covertness constraint and non-interruption constraint is studied. The numerical simulation results show that: 1) the detection performance of Willie (warden) deteriorates as the channel estimation errors increase; 2) when the transmitter power exceeds the threshold, communication in the main network is interrupted; 3) under a certain transmit power, the maximum ECR increases with the increasing of the number of STAR-RIS reflection elements.},

  abstract     = {Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) is emerging as a critical enabling technology for 6G communication systems, with increasing attention on dual-functional waveform design to facilitate various applications. Recently developed symbol-level precoding (SLP) demonstrates significant potential for ISAC waveform design due to its superior capacity to enhance both communication and radar sensing capabilities by simultaneously leveraging temporal and spatial degrees of freedom (DoFs). To address the high complexity challenges associated with SLP designs, this paper proposes two efficient deep learning algorithms to tackle the complex SLP-based ISAC waveform design problem. The first algorithm employs a supervised data-driven training strategy that reformulates the original problem as a solvable linear regression issue, while the second algorithm utilizes a gradient-based procedure to fine-tune the trained network, enhancing communication and radar sensing performance. Additionally, we introduce a lightweight SLP-Inception-Net to mitigate computational complexity at the network structural level, incorporating a phase-based activation function to ensure the satisfaction of equality constraints. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that our proposed deep learning algorithms achieve comparable communication and sensing performance to optimization-based approaches, while delivering a remarkable 1000-fold reduction in computational complexity in terms of average execution time. Furthermore, they outperform classical learning-based schemes at the same level of floating point operations per second (FLOPs).},

  abstract     = {With the increasing number of satellites, the downlink interference between non-geostationary orbit (NGSO) constellation systems is becoming more prominent. Interference-to-noise ratio (I/N) is an important evaluation index to measure the level of mutual interference, and its probability distribution is usually obtained by extrapolating the satellite orbit position and counting the time proportion of different I/N values. However, the traditional propagation method has the problems of long simulation time and low calculation efficiency. This paper proposes a new method to calculate the I/N of large-scale non-geostationary orbit constellation. By modeling large-scale constellation as uniformly distributed in space, Fibonacci grid method is used to calculate satellite position coordinate. In addition, equivalent number of satellites is defined to take into account the number of visible satellites at different latitudes. The expression of I/N is derived, and the probability distribution of I/N is obtained. On this basis, the effect of parameters of the constellations and the latitude of Earth Station on the I/N distribution is analyzed. The numerical results of the proposed method and the orbit propagation method is similar, and the calculation speed of the former is obviously faster than that of the latter.},

The highlights of $U^{2} Net$ are to design an inner U-net for local features and another outer U-net to fuse local features for global feature patterns. The DOA problem is designed as a multi-label classification task with on-grid patterns, and train data set is generated at low SNR regimes by specifying sample covariance matrix as input features and source direction as labels. Simulation results demonstrate that the $U^{2} Net$ achieves excellent and robust performances in multiple-target DOA estimation tasks, especially under challenging conditions with high noise levels, small snapshots and coherent sources. Moreover, the $U^{2} Net$ has a potential to resolve source angles within grid resolution.

Based on the degree of the use for the channel state information (CSI), five RS schemes with different user ordering and power allocation (PA) strategies are proposed, in which different tradeoffs between the performance and system overhead or complexity are considered. To evaluate the performance, we derive the closed-form expressions of the outage probability along with the diversity orders for all these RS schemes. The analytical results show that non-zero diversity orders can be harvested if the instantaneous CSI is employed when designing the user ordering or PA strategies. Furthermore, the provided simulation results demonstrate that better outage performance gain can be obtained if the collected CSI is used more fully when designing the RS schemes. Also, the improvement due to the use of dynamic PA strategies is more prominent in contrast to the situation where only user ordering strategies are enhanced, since lower outage probability can be always observed and there is no extra constraint for the PA coefficients.},

  abstract     = {An appropriate hybrid beamforming scheme is essential for millimeter wave (mmWave) multi-user massive Multiple-Input-Multiple-Output (MU-mMIMO) communication architectures, as it ensures both the advantages of digital processing and the efficacy of analog technology. To further explore the channel spectrum on the polarization domain, polarization selectivity is introduced in this work to improve the performance of the beamforming design in mmWave MU-mMIMO systems. By introducing single-port polarization reconfigurable antenna units to the mMIMO antenna arrays, we propose a novel hybrid polarized beamforming structure that can flexibly adjust the polarization distribution of the array. Based on the structure, this paper models the polarization distribution of the subarrays as selection of mask matrices and proposes several optimization schemes to enhance the hybrid polarized beamforming performance, including random combining, conventional genetic algorithm (GA), and optimal perturbation genetic algorithm (OP-GA). In this paper, we enable the Saleh-Velenzuela (S-V) millimeter wave channel model to be applied to the analysis by extending the multipath component (MPC) polarization distribution following the 3GPP and WINNER channel models. Performance analysis on the system sum rate shows that the proposed design significantly outperforms the fixed-polarized system under the same channel distributions. This paper underscores the importance of polarization optimization and provides a reference for enhancing the performance of mmWave MU-mMIMO systems.},

To perform online control effectively, a novel online prediction model is proposed, which models the trajectory of UEs as a stochastic Gauss-Markov mobility model and the trajectory of eavesdroppers as a worst-case model based on the current imperfect location information. The online control problem is formulated as a new multi-stage optimization framework, in which we perform online control by solving per-slot prediction problems and a resource allocation problem for the initial point. In the per-slot prediction problem, we jointly optimize the predictive trajectory and transmit power for the upcoming time slot (TS) by maximizing the minimum achievable secrecy rate (ASR) among all UEs. For resource allocation at the initial TS, we optimize transmit power by maximizing the minimum ASR among all UEs. The per-slot prediction problem and the resourceallocation problem are all non-convex problems hence they are intractable in terms of computational complexity. To address them, we propose an efficient inner-approximation methods, by applying successive convex approximation (SCA) methodand S-procedure as well as Bernstein-type inequality. Numerical results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed online control scheme over the conventional benchmark schemes which include existing offline schemes and online scheme without outage based prediction as well as shortest-path navigation scheme.},

In this paper, THz channel measurement, simulation, and modeling for the generalized L-shaped intersection scenario are conducted. First, a dual-band angular-resolvable wideband channel measurement in an L-shaped hallway is presented and THz channel characteristics at 306-321 GHz and 356-371 GHz are analyzed. Then, a generic L-shaped intersection scenario model is developed, by adapting the ray-tracing (RT)-statistical hybrid channel modeling method THz channel characteristics in the L-shaped scenario. Especially, the spatial consistency of reflected multi-path components (MPCs) in the non-line-of-sight (NLoS) region is analyzed, and the continuous change of dominant MPCs is statistically modeled, in terms of their power, delay and angles of arrival. As a result, the proposed hybrid approach reduces the computational cost by reducing the determination of dominant MPCs in the NLoS region of the L-shaped scenario. Besides, as conventional close-in and alpha-beta path loss models cannot take good care of large-scale fading in the NLoS case, a modified alpha-beta (M-AB) path loss model for the NLoS region of L-shaped scenarios is proposed and verified 80% more accurate for L-shaped scenarios at different frequency bands.},

However, achieving low complexity and low overhead V2X ISAC remains challenging in time-varying channel conditions.

In this system, the first sub-block of each coherence time block encompasses location sensing, beamforming and ISAC, along with a location prediction phase. At the same time, subsequent sub-blocks focus on the latter two phases. During the initial phase, two-dimensional multiple signal classification-based adaptive location sensing is performed by sensor elements in the distributed HRISs to obtain location information without requiring channel estimation. This information is then used to design optimal beams for enhanced ISAC performance in the subsequent phase. Finally, an extended Kalman filter-based location prediction method generates optimal beams for the following sub-blocks. Simulation results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed scheme, demonstrating its superiority over existing methods in terms of ISAC performance, computational complexity, overhead, and angle estimation accuracy.},

Moreover, we develop an algorithm to solve the upper layer problem, obtaining a stable coalition formation.

  abstract     = {The synchronization of digital twins (DT) serves as the cornerstone for effective operation of the DT framework. However, the limitations of channel capacity can greatly affect the data transmission efficiency of wireless communication. Unlike traditional communication methods, semantic communication transmits the intended meanings of physical objects instead of raw data, effectively saving bandwidth resource and reducing DT synchronization latency. Hence, we are committed to integrating semantic communication into the DT synchronization framework within the mobile edge computing system, aiming to enhance the DT synchronization efficiency of user devices (UDs). Our goal is to minimize the average DT synchronization latency of all UDs by jointly optimizing the synchronization strategy, transmission power of UDs, and computational resource allocation for both UDs and base station. The formulated problem involves sequential decision-making across multiple coherent time slots. Furthermore, the mobility of UDs introduces uncertainties into the decision-making process. To solve this challenging optimization problem efficiently, we propose a soft actor-critic-based deep reinforcement learning algorithm to optimize synchronization strategy and resource allocation. Numerical results demonstrate that our proposed algorithm can reduce synchronization latency by up to 13.2% and improve synchronization efficiency compared to other benchmark schemes.},

However, the increasing number of users and growing model sizes of FL cause considerable communication overhead. To reduce this communication overhead and improve the efficiency of FL, we design a hierarchical blockchain-based FL architecture, which divides a network into edge and center layers and further divides the edge layer into different shards. In addition, due to the massive scales of 6G networks, a main-shard blockchain architecture with IOTA and the practical byzantine fault tolerance (PBFT) consensus algorithm are used to ensure the safe sharing of the model and improve the transactions per second (TPS) of the system. Moreover, comprehensively considering the node computing resources, number of training samples, blockchain consensus delay, network communication delay, and FL training delay, we also establish a learning efficiency optimization model for FL and deduce the training round delay for the main and shard chains. Furthermore, the influences of different numbers of shards on the learning efficiency levels of different FL models are analyzed. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithm greatly improves the learning efficiency, increases the system TPS and reduces the communication overhead by more than 30%.},

However, improving the cooperative sensing capabilities of multiple ISAC user equipments (ISAC-UEs) in complex interference environment presents a significant research challenge. This paper focuses on the multi-user cooperative sensing in uplink orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) ISAC system. By utilizing the stochastic geometry, we model the distribution of communication UEs (COM-UEs) as a one-dimensional Matern hard-core point process (1-D MHCP), and derive a closed-form expression for interference power. To further enhance cooperative sensing accuracy while maintaining quality of service (QoS) in communication, we perform waveform optimization by jointly optimizing the weighted range-velocity Cramer–Rao lower bound (CRLB) subject to communication data rate (CDR) and subcarrier power ratio (SPR) constraints. This approach involves selecting the optimal subcarriers for sensing and allocating the corresponding power on each subcarrier for communication and sensing subsystems. By employing the convex relaxation and the cyclic minimization algorithm (CMA), we decompose the complex optimization problem into three sub-problems, simplifying the original NP-hard problem into a solvable one via a cyclic optimization framework. The simulation results validate the effectiveness of our optimization strategy, and evaluate the influence of CDR and SPR constraints using the CRLB and root mean square error (RMSE).},

However, existing standard channel models including the 3GPP TR 38.901 channel model lack the capability to characterize DMCs in these indoor scenarios. In this paper, an improved algorithm for estimating delay-angular parameters of DMC clusters is proposed for processing channel measurement data in indoor office and IIoT scenarios. Statistical properties of SMCs and measured DMCs are analyzed. Then, a novel time-domain non-stationary sixth generation (6G) standard channel model is proposed based on the extension of the 3GPP TR 38.901 channel model by including DMCs for indoor scenarios. In the proposed 6G model, DMCs are incorporated by sharing the same cluster centers with SMCs but exhibiting different intra-cluster parameters, e.g., larger numbers of rays and larger values of intra-cluster delay spread. To accurately describe the cluster birth-death process, a squared sine function is introduced to model power changes of SMCs and DMCs with different rates. Moreover, simulation results of the proposed model are compared with those of the 3GPP TR 38.901 channel model, 6G pervasive channel model, and measurement data. The proposed model shows the closest agreement with measurement results.},

Considering the repulsion characteristics between AAVs' positions and terrestrial base stations (BSs), AAVs are deployed in non-hole areas outside the BSs. The positions of AAVs are modeled by Poisson hole process (PHP). Due to the difficulty of directly solving the user association problem under PHP, the nearest neighbor hole approximation method is introduced. Due to the complex interference caused by multiple communication links in the dual-layer heterogeneous network, we adopt the conditional Laplace transform method to represent interference, deriving expressions for coverage probability and area spectral efficiency (ASE). Considering the energy constraints of the AAV network, this paper defines the system-level network energy efficiency (EE) as the ratio of the ASE to the average energy consumption per unit area. Utilizing this framework, we jointly optimize the AAV network density and the RSMA power allocation coefficients to maximize EE. The numerical results ultimately validated the accuracy of the theoretical analysis. Through simulation analysis, this paper explores the impact of network deployment parameters on system performance and provided the AAV network density and RSMA power allocation scheme that maximizes EE.},

The existing literature has introduced several MR methods for single-user scenarios but few papers have studied multi-user MR. This work proposes an MR method that employs a clustering analysis of super-constellation in a completely overlapped MU scenario. A super-constellation refers to the mapping of superposed symbols in the I/Q plane. A blind MR for stealthy decoding conversation between two users is considered with parameters like user gain, noise variance etc. being unknown in practical impairments such as carrier frequency offset, timing and phase offsets. The proposed algorithm utilizes agglomerative hierarchical clustering along with various cluster validation techniques to determine the optimal number of clusters and their respective centroids within the super-constellation. Subsequently, amplitude and phase-based features are extracted from these centroids to enable accurate MR. The simulation results demonstrate that the classification accuracy of the proposed method is i) significantly better than the features-based methods like cumulants and higher-order statistics; and ii) comparable with the deep learning-based methods that crucially rely on the availability of training data. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that the proposed method has significantly lower complexity than the existing techniques.},

However, finite blocklength coding (FBC) in URLLC makes it challenging to achieve optimal performance in the NOMA-aided CFmMIMO system. In this paper, we investigate the performance of the NOMA-aided CFmMIMO system with FBC in terms of achievable sum rate (ASR). Firstly, we derive a lower bound on the ergodic data rate. Then, we formulate an ASR maximization problem by jointly considering power allocation and user equipment (UE) clustering. To tackle such an intractable problem, we decompose it into two sub-problems, i.e., the power allocation problem and the UE clustering problem. A successive convex approximation algorithm is proposed to solve the power allocation problem by transforming it into a series of geometric programming problems. Meanwhile, two algorithms based on graph theory are proposed to solve the UE clustering problem by identifying negative loops. Finally, alternative optimization is performed to find the maximum ASR of the NOMA-aided CFmMIMO system with FBC. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithms significantly outperform the benchmarks in terms of ASR under various scenarios.},

When the preference changes, the trained model may not perform well and needs to be retrained. To address this issue, we propose a neural combinatorial optimization method that combines an encoder-decoder model with reinforcement learning. The encoder captures task relationships, while the decoder, equipped with a preference-conditioned attention mechanism, determines offloading decisions for various preferences. Additionally, reinforcement learning is employed to train the encoder-decoder model. Since the proposed method can infer the offloading decision for each preference, it eliminates the need to retrain the model when the preference changes, thus improving real-time performance.

To address these problems, we propose a closed-loop control scheme based on integrated sensing, communication and control (ISCC). First, to accurately model the closed-loop control process of automated guided vehicle (AGV) in automobile assembly workshops, we establish a novel ISCC system. Then, to reduce communication overhead while ensuring the system stability, we propose a networked multi-node control method with coordinated active-passive control. Through sensing workshop environment, AGVs flexibly perform different control instructions between active local decision-making and passive reception of base station (BS) decision-making. AGVs can respond quickly to the environment and achieve high-speed movement without the requirement for frequent communication with the BS. Furthermore, we design a novel communication scheme with adaptive closed-loop interaction cycle, by deriving stability conditions for the multi-node control method and upper bound for the closed-loop interaction cycle. Through dynamically adjusting the AGVs closed-loop interaction cycle based on real-time closed-loop control status, it significantly reduces the frequency of AGV accessing BS and communication overhead, extending the controllable AGV quantity, and enhancing production capacity. Simulation results reveal that the proposed scheme improved production capacity by a minimum of 62.6% compared to conventional schemes, significantly improving communication and control performance.},

However, IoV is vulnerable to tamper and forgery attacks without secure authentication. Identity-based aggregate signature (IBAS) is crucial in guaranteeing identity authentication and information integrity, thereby building secure authentications. With signature compression and batch verification, IBAS improves the efficiency of signatures transmission and verification, thereby reducing computing and storage demands on machines. Unfortunately, Snowden revealed that powerful adversaries replaced pure cryptographic algorithms with subverted ones to corrupt machines and undermine their security. To address this issue, we propose a fully and universal identity-based aggregate signature with reverse firewalls (FU-IBAS-RF), vehicles and the private key generator (PKG) are equipped with RFs to sanitize information transmitted throughout the entire process. Additionally, we propose an identity-based aggregate signature with reverse firewalls (IBAS-RF), RFs are deployed for each vehicle to sanitize information generated during the signing phase. Moreover, we prove that both FU-IBAS-RF and IBAS-RF not only inherit the security and functional property of IBAS but also are subversion-resistant. Finally, we conduct experiments and indicate that RFs accounts for approximately 18% of computation costs across three distinct security levels in both schemes. Therefore, both FU-IBAS-RF and IBAS-RF achieve stronger security with efficiency compared with existing IBAS.},

The objective is to maximize the minimum signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR), which is equivalent to maximizing the data rates for all users based on fairness. To support multiple users, a two-user pairing scheme is considered. Next, we propose a sub-optimal optimization (SO) approach to jointly optimize the phase shifts and power allocation coefficients. Further, we compare the data rate performance of different IRS configurations and user pairing schemes under various transmit signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions. We propose a novel hybrid IRS configuration that selects diagonal or non-diagonal mode dynamically. Additionally, we compare our results with the optimal greedy search method. Our results demonstrate significant improvements in data rates using the hybrid IRS configuration with the SO approach (SO-hybrid) compared to traditional orthogonal multiple access (OMA) schemes for higher IRS elements ($M&gt;64$). For instance, with two users, at an SNR of 20 dB and $M=225$, the SO-hybrid method achieves data rates up to 6.3 bps/Hz, compared to 5.3 bps/Hz and 5.4 bps/Hz for OMA with diagonal and non-diagonal IRS configurations, respectively. At 10 dB SNR, SO-hybrid reaches 4.3 bps/Hz, outperforming OMA-ND at 3.7 bps/Hz. Simulations further reveal the robustness of the hybrid NOMA scheme under imperfect successive interference cancellation and channel state information, proving its potential for enhancing wireless communication systems.},

  abstract     = {Space–air–ground integrated networks (SAGIN) have attracted considerable attention owing to their capability extending telecommunication coverage via satellite communication. They enhance the capacity and coverage of satellite communication systems using amplifying relays deployed in high-altitude platform stations (HAPS) in the air. Free-space optical (FSO) communication, which offers larger capacity compared to conventional radiofrequency (RF) communication, can enhance the capacity of SAGIN to meet the requirements of sixth-generation (6G) systems. This study assumes a hybrid FSO/RF SAGIN, where high-capacity but atmospherically unstable FSO communications and low-capacity but atmospherically stable RF communications are used in a complementary manner in the satellite-HAPS-ground link. For the SAGIN coverage area to expand, the transmission capacity of the system needs to be further improved. Therefore, efficient use of the limited RF link frequency bandwidth is crucial, and the satellite and HAPS must cooperate to share and meet ground traffic requirements by controlling the areas they each cover. In addition, HAPS placement significantly impacts the spectral efficiency of the system because the positional relationship between the satellite and HAPS affects the transmission capacity. Therefore, this study proposes a combined control method for optimizing HAPS placement and coverage area of the satellite and HAPS. Furthermore, a solution space reduction method is incorporated into the proposed method for efficient exploration of the optimal control parameters.

  abstract     = {Aerial hybrid reconfigurable intelligent surface (AHRIS) -assisted integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) has recently emerged as a promising candidate for practical deployment in the sixth generation (6G) wireless networks. System design and gain rely heavily on accurately modeling of the underlying channel characteristics, which is challenging due to the high mobility of AHRIS and the unique properties of ISAC. This letter aims to propose a novel three-dimensional (3D) non-stationary geometry-based stochastic model (GBSM) for AHRIS-assisted ISAC systems. Firstly, a novel GBSM considering the non-stationarity caused by the unavoidable jitter of AHRIS and the correlations between sensing and communication channels is proposed. For the former, both the random jitter vector and the jitter factor are introduced to model the impacts of the jitter of AHRIS on its velocity vector. For the latter, the channel characteristics of sensing, including forward scattering and backward scattering, are introduced into the communication channel model, in which the non-line-of-sight (NLoS) transmission are divided into single-clusters scattering and twin-clusters scattering. Then, in order to create a favorable propagation environment and make full use of the channel information sensed by the AHRIS, two AHRIS phase-shift design methods based on sensing channels are proposed. Finally, the impacts of several factors, e.g., the AHRIS speed and jittery, AHRIS phase-shift design methods, AHRIS non-ideality and clusters distribution, on the statistical properties of the proposed channel model are studied, which include the spatial-temporal correlation function (STCF), Doppler power spectral density (PSD) and spectral efficiency. Numerical simulation results demonstrate that the proposed model can accurately capture the channel characteristics, thus providing valuable insights for the future deployment of AHRIS-assisted ISAC systems.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) are widely used in transportation and daily life. Because the driving information of a vehicle is transmitted via the public channels of VANETs, the driving information is vulnerable to eavesdropping and tampering. Therefore, ensuring the security of VANETs is particularly important. However, most works assume that the environment of roadside units and on-board units is completely safe, which is an unreasonable stance to take as VANETs are evidently vulnerable to privileged user attack and malware attack. In order to solve this weakness and improve the practicability of VANETs, we adopted Confidential Computing technology and proposed a secure authentication scheme. Our scheme adopted decentralized network architecture and achieved dynamic authentication credentials. In addition, we not only proposed a lightweight vehicle-to-infrastructure authentication scheme, but also proposed the vehicle-to-vehicle authentication scheme. We adopted ROR, AVISPA tools and rigorously informal security analysis to prove the security of the proposed scheme. In addition, we analyzed the detailed overheads and adopted NS-3 to conduct the performance analysis. Finally, the results of the security analysis, performance analysis, and comparison analysis proved the effectiveness of our proposed scheme to provide security and protection.},

  abstract     = {Constrained by weak signal strength and significant inter-cell interference, users located at the cell edge in a cellular network suffer from inferior service quality. Recently, cell-free massive MIMO (CFmMIMO) has gained considerable attention due to its capability to offer uniform quality of service, alleviating the cell-edge problem. In contrast to previous studies focused on narrow-band CFmMIMO systems, this paper studies wideband CFmMIMO communications against channel frequency selectivity. By exploiting the frequency-domain flexibility offered by orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM), and leveraging a particular spatial characteristic in the cell-free structure – namely, the near-far effect among distributed access points (APs) – we propose an opportunistic approach to boost spectral efficiency. The core concept lies in opportunistically activating nearby APs for certain users across their assigned OFDM subcarriers while deactivating distant APs to prevent power wastage and lower inter-user interference. Furthermore, this approach enables the use of downlink pilots by reducing the number of active APs per subcarrier to a small subset, thereby substantially improving downlink performance through coherent detection at the user receiver. Verified by numerical results, our proposed approach demonstrates considerable performance improvement compared to the two benchmark approaches.},

  abstract     = {During the evolution from 5G to 6G, integrated space-air-ground communication has become a hotspot for research. Among them, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communication and millimeter-wave (mmW) technology play important roles. UAV communication requires high-gain, wide-angle coverage, and flexible beam-steering antenna arrays. In this paper, we propose a compact antenna array with wide coverage and beam steering capability for mmW applications. The array is composed of three layers and fed through substrate integrated waveguide (SIW) with three ports. The antenna features a simple, horizontally symmetrical structure. By independently exciting each of the three ports, and combinations where port 2 is excited simultaneously with port 1 or port 3, the antenna generates currents that complement equivalent magnetic currents to produce beams pointing in different directions. The wide beams of the antenna can steer and cover a total range from −$60^{\circ }$ to 240$^{\circ }$ across five states. Based on this design, a four-element array is fabricated and tested. Measurement results demonstrate the gains of 10.03, 10.8, and 10.5 dBi within the operational frequency range (23.7–28 GHz), with a radiation efficiency of 87.3${\%}$. The proposed antenna features a low-profile and compact structure, achieving a coverage range of approximately 300 degrees. It is highly suitable for UAVs, and small mobile devices when integrated with an integrated chip circuit. Additionally, if matched with a phase shifter, the antenna can achieve two-dimensional scanning capability.},

Specifically, with the moment generating function in stochastic network calculus (SNC), the approximate closed-form expression for the upper bound of secrecy age outage probability (SAOP) under statistical channel state information (CSI) is derived. Besides, the effects of blocklength and decoding error probability on SAOP are analyzed. The average blocklength and decoding error probability satisfying minimum SAOP are derived. Furthermore, a SAOP minimization problem is proposed by considering reliability, security and RIS unit modulus constraints. For the non-convex problem with coupling variables, we decompose it into blocklength and RIS phase shift optimization subproblem through the alternating optimization algorithm. In particular, for the stochastic RIS phase shift optimization, a momentum stochastic successive convex approximation (M-SSCA) algorithm is proposed to obtain the optimal solution, which introduces a momentum disturbance factor to accelerate convergence. In simulation results, the effects of main system parameters on SAOP are given. Compared with the traditional convex optimization schemes, the algorithm proposed in this paper reduces SAOP more effectively and has better convergence performance according to simulation results.},

Specifically, the uplink cascaded channel of the system can be represented as a low-rank sparse channel tensor in the angle-delay domain due to the limited scattering paths. Leveraging such representation, the scheme contains two steps. First, the scheme designs the sensing matrices, i.e., the base station combining matrix and the RIS reflection matrix, to meet the proposed uniqueness condition that guarantees the one-to-one correspondence between the high-dimensional channel tensor and lower-dimensional channel observation. The sensing matrices design is formulated as a power/constant module-constrained matrix optimization problem. Second, the scheme reconstructs the channel tensor from the channel observation, which is formulated as a low-rank constrained tensor optimization problem. The above problems are solved using manifold optimization techniques, which convert the original problem with non-convex constraints into an unconstrained optimization problem on manifolds, eliminating the need for relaxation of the non-convex constraints and achieving higher accuracy. Simulation results demonstrate superior performance in terms of channel estimation accuracy.},

This paper presents an integrated sensing and communication (ISAC)-based CKM prototype system, demonstrating the mutualistic relationship between ISAC and CKM. The system consists of an ISAC base station (BS), a user equipment (UE), and a server. By using a shared orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) waveform over the millimeter wave (mmWave) band, the ISAC BS is able to communicate with the UE while simultaneously sensing the environment and acquiring the UE's location. The prototype showcases the complete process of the construction and application of the ISAC-based CKM. For CKM construction phase, the BS stores the UE's channel feedback information in a database indexed by the UE's location, including beam indices and channel gain. For CKM application phase, the BS looks up the best beam index from the CKM based on the UE's location to achieve training-free mmWave beam alignment. The experimental results show that ISAC can be used to construct or update CKM while communicating with UEs, and the pre-learned CKM can assist ISAC for training-free beam alignment.},

  abstract     = {The urgent need for higher sensing accuracy and transmission reliability in the Internet of Vehicles (IoV), along with the limited availability of spectrum resources, integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) tends to operate in higher frequency bands. This shift, however, introduces severe sensing-communication coupling interference. Due to the openness nature of the wireless medium, ISAC enabled IoV faces more significant security concerns. Centered at the communication interference, traditional physical layer security (PLS) schemes aim to maximize the channel quality difference between legitimate and eavesdropping channels to ensure the perfect secrecy. However, transforming directly current PLS methods into secure communication in ISAC-assisted IoV systems faces two significant challenges, because of sensing-communication coupling interference and strong directional beamforming caused by higher frequency bands. To address these challenges, this paper formulates an optimization problem aimed at maximizing the average secrecy rate by jointly designing the transmission power allocation and radar sensing power allocation, while ensuring the desired sensing accuracy and transmission reliability. To solve this non-convex optimization problem, we introduce the block coordinate descent (BCD) and successive convex approximation (SCA) methods. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to optimizing transmission power or radar sensing power individually, joint optimization significantly improves the average secrecy rate upon convergence, with increases of at least 265% and 441%, respectively.},

However, in delay-sensitive or high-mobility communications, the rapid movement of vehicles can lead to random scattering in the environment and time-selective fading in the channel. In view of this, we investigate in this paper an innovative linear model with low-complexity transmitter signal design and receiver detection methods, which boost stability in fast-fading environments and reduce channel training overhead. Specifically, considering the differences in hardware design and signal processing at the receiving end between uplink and downlink communication systems, distinct solutions are proposed. Accordingly, we first integrate the Rician channel introduced by the RIS with the corresponding signal processing algorithms to model the RIS-aided downlink communication system as a Doppler-robust linear model. Inspired by this property, we design a precoding scheme based on the linear model to reduce the complexity of precoding. Then, by leveraging the linear model and the large-scale antenna array at the base station (BS) side, we improve the linear model for the uplink communication system and derive its asymptotic performance in closed-form.

  abstract     = {This paper investigates a hybrid reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) architecture incorporating both passive and active elements, to enhance the ultra-reliable and low-latency communication (URLLC) services between a central controller (CC) and remote devices in mission-critical scenarios. Specifically, with the objective of maximizing the energy efficiency (EE) of the system under target reliability, an optimization problem in terms of the transmit precoding of CC, the reflecting coefficients of hybrid RIS, and the allocated blocklength is proposed. To deal with the intractability of the non-convex problem considering the various quality of service (QoS) issues of remote devices such as transmission latency and rate constraints, Dinkelbach's method is invoked to transform the original problem into a parameterized concave-convex function. Subsequently, efficient algorithms are developed based on alternating optimization, successive convex approximation, and Big-M formulation methods. In addition, the effects of several vital parameters on the performance of the proposed scheme are investigated. Numerical results show that compared to conventional full-passive/active RIS and no-RIS systems, the proposed hybrid RIS offers significant performance advantages. Furthermore, the optimal number and distribution of active/passive elements allocation are demonstrated. It is observed that the proposed hybrid RIS with only a few active elements can achieve higher EE than conventional passive RIS even with infinite blocklength, sufficiently revealing the potential of hybrid RIS to reduce transmission latency, guarantee rewarding reliability, and enhance EE for URLLC services.},

  abstract     = {This paper introduces a novel ±45° shared-aperture, dual-band, dual-polarized interleaved array for vehicle-mounted base station systems. The array integrates a lower band (LB) antenna with four higher band (HB) antennas. To address the issue of cross-band scattering and its impact on higher band performance, we employ an innovative method that involves reducing the aperture size and incorporating lumped or distributed inductors. These inductors function as frequency-selective structures, permitting low-frequency currents to pass while blocking high-frequency currents. Consequently, at high frequencies, these inductors act as open circuits, making the low-frequency antenna radiator resemble multiple discontinuous small metal strips. This approach achieves an electromagnetic transparent (EMT) bandwidth of over 82.9%, making it highly suitable for mobile base station applications. By integrating this low-scattering LB antenna with four bandwidth-optimized cross dipoles, we achieve a dual-band interleaved array. The measured results confirm that the dual-band array operates effectively within the 0.85-0.98 GHz and 1.4-2.7 GHz frequency ranges, maintaining stable radiation performance. The superior performance of this design makes it an ideal choice for vehicle-based base stations.},

  abstract     = {This paper investigates secure hybrid beamforming with subarray architectures in a millimeter-wave (mmWave) integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system. To achieve secure communication against a potential eavesdropper, we design the sensing signal in a dual-functional form, serving both to detect the target and to generate artificial noise (AN) that disrupts the eavesdropper. With fixed subarray architectures, the security and sensing performance are analyzed, including the impact of imperfect channel state information (CSI). Moreover, the design of analog and digital beamformers is formulated as the problem of minimizing transmit power while satisfying the constraints of sensing beampattern and secrecy rate. To solve the non-convex problem, semi-definite relaxation (SDR) and successive convex approximation (SCA) techniques are employed to transform the original problem and obtain the solution. For the scenario with imperfect CSI, the robust hybrid beamforming is designed based on S-procedure. Additionally, to optimally utilize spatial domain resources provided by multiple antennas, a dynamic subarray architecture is introduced, along with two dynamic subarray partitioning algorithms. This flexible architecture can be dynamically adjusted according to the CSI, ensuring a bidirectional alignment with the actual channels and the proposed scheme. Specifically, the greedy algorithm and the secrecy rate increment maximization (SRIM) algorithm are designed to partition the dynamic subarray, and the alternating optimization is utilized to further improve the quality of the solution. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed schemes.},

As a promising technology in future communication systems, reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) has been expected to improve the system performance by reconfiguring the propagation environment. In this paper, we investigate a practical aerial RIS-assisted URLLC system in the presence of transceiver hardware impairments where the RIS is mounted on an autonomous aerial vehicle (AAV). We aim to maximize the weighted sum spectral efficiency (WSSE) by jointly optimizing the transmit power, the passive beamforming, and the AAV's location. As the primal problem is non-convex with coupled variables, the problem is first reformulated by using fractional programming (FP), and decomposed to subproblems with decoupled variables. An alternative optimization (AO) algorithm is then proposed to jointly optimize the passive beamforming, the position of AAV, and transmit power at the IoT devices. Simulation results verify that the proposed robust design can significantly improve the WSSE performance compared to the conventional non-robust scheme. And we reveal hardware impairments at the IoT devices have more impact on WSSE than the control center (CC).},

  abstract     = {This paper proposes an adaptive anti-jamming resource allocation scheme to address both external malicious jamming and internal interference in dynamic multi-user communication environments. The scheme assesses jamming levels through a module based on average channel quality indicator (CQI) and adaptively selects the appropriate anti-jamming policies by utilizing the resouces of power-domain, frequency-domain, or a combination of power-frequency domain. This approach overcomes the limitations of fixed-domain policies in dynamic and complex jamming scenarios. To optimize resource allocation, a discrete soft actor-critic (DSAC) algorithm with an adjustable temperature coefficient is employed, addressing sample inefficiencies in traditional actor-critic methods and enhancing policy robustness. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme improves convergence speed under intelligent jamming (IJ) by 55%, 62%, 65%, 75%, and 60% compared to trusted region policy optimization (TRPO), deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG), proximal policy optimization (PPO), deep reinforcement learning with dual action network (DRL-DAN) and soft actor critic with fixed temperature coefficient (SAC-FTC)-based schemes, respectively. The scheme achieves evasion rates of 99% against periodic comb jamming (PCJ), 98.7% against sweep jamming (SJ), 95% against combined jamming (CJ), and 90.8% against IJ. When the jammer alternates between regular jamming (RJ) and IJ, the proposed scheme responds quickly, demonstrating robustness in dynamic jamming environments.},

However, optimizing the beamforming matrix in the base station (BS) for HMIMO systems is challenging, given the prohibitive overhead of directly estimating the channels between the BS and the user equipment. Instead of following the traditional method of channel estimation and beamforming optimization, in this paper we employ a deep-learning technique to optimize the beamformers at the BS based on a loss function. Specifically, in this paper we introduce a graph neural network (GNN) designed to map the received pilot signals to optimized beamforming matrices and to model interactions among user equipment within the network. The simulation results show that our deep-learning method effectively maximizes the sum-rate objective while using reduced number of pilots than traditional channel estimation and beamforming optimization techniques.},

The tightness of the UatF bound is, however, ensured in channel environments where the channel hardening manifests. It has been often reported that the channel hardening may not always be strongly observed in some channel environments. In such cases, the UatF bound seriously underestimates rates for users experiencing weak channel hardening. To address the issues associated with the UatF bound, we develop a new lower bound offering a more accurate estimate of the achievable rate for uplink in CF-mMIMO networks regardless of the extent of channel hardening. The claim is substantiated by applying the proposed bound to the joint optimization of power control and large-scale fading decoding (LSFD) coefficients for the design of CF-mMIMO networks on spatially correlated Rician fading channels. To facilitate the optimization, we also develop an approximation of the proposed bound in a more computationally amenable form. We conduct extensive performance evaluations and comparisons for CF-mMIMO networks designed with the proposed and UatF bounds. The comparisons highlight that the design based on the proposed bound leads to considerable performance improvement in the fairness. In addition, for the first time, we reveal with the new lower bound that an widely held belief based on the UatF bound is incorrect.},

This paper proposes a self-supervised learning framework, named cross-view prediction with automatic augmentation (CPAA). Unlike existing supervised methods requiring substantial labeled data, CPAA leverages massive unlabeled samples and minimal labeled data. Initially, an automatic data augmentation module is incorporated with traditional augmentation methods. Subsequently, the unlabeled pairwise signals are utilized for self-supervised pertaining through the cross-view prediction (CP) module. Finally, supervised fine-tuning using well-trained encoder is conducted on a small amount of labeled datasets. The proposed framework is capable of identifying five different OFDM modulation formats and enhancing performance through automatic data augmentation, which effectively retains data identity and generates diverse views. Simulation results indicate that CPAA can achieve robust classification performance with massive unlabeled samples and extremely limited labeled samples. Moreover, the proposed framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods across a range of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) levels and demonstrates better generalization capabilities under low SNR conditions. Based on the simulation results, the CPAA framework achieves a classification accuracy of over $\bm {85\%}$ at SNR $\bm {&gt;}$ 8 dB with only one labeled sample per SNR for each modulation scheme. Moreover, the automatic data augmentation module enhances the performance of self-supervised learning when limited labeled data are available, yielding an approximate average performance gain of $\bm {48.78\%}$ and demonstrating good transferability on the existing self-supervised learning algorithms.},

However, most existing works only consider invariant channel parameters without jitter during the movement of RIS, which is unrealistic. This paper proposes a more practical autonomous aerial vehicle (AAV)-mounted RIS-assisted communication scheme, where an elevation angle-dependent 3D channel model with AAV jitter is established and the max-min rate problem is effectively solved. Specifically, modeling the Rician factors and the path loss exponents as functions of 3D elevation angles, we reestablish an A2G channel model suitable for 3D reflections containing angular deviations caused by AAV jitter. Furthermore, by rigorously dealing with the difficulties caused by angle dependence, an innovative algorithm is designed for static/mobile RIS-AAV scheme via the joint optimization of base station beamforming, RIS coefficients, and AAV 3D position/trajectory. Additionally, in mobile RIS-AAV scheme, we extra develop a fast algorithm for solving the 0–1 binary integer scheduling factor, which first approximates the solution and then precisely reconstructs it.

  abstract     = {Low-cost reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) are being considered as promising physical-layer technology for next-generation wireless networks due to their ability to re-engineer the propagation environment by tuning their elements. Although RIS-aided systems have many advantages, one of their major bottlenecks is that they can provide coverage only in front of the surface. Fortunately, simultaneous transmitting and reflecting surface (STARS)-assisted systems have emerged to fill this gap by providing $ 360^{\circ }$ wireless coverage. In parallel, full-duplex (FD) communication offers a higher achievable rate through efficient spectrum utilization compared to the half-duplex (HD) counterpart. Moreover, two-way/bi-directional communications in an FD system can further enhance the system's spectral efficiency. Hence, in this paper, we propose a STARS-enabled massive MIMO deployment in an FD two-way communication network for highly efficient spectrum utilization, while covering the dead zones around the STARS. This model enables simultaneous information exchange between multiple nodes, while potentially doubling the spectral efficiency (SE). By invoking the use-and-then-forget (UaTF) combining scheme, we derive a closed-form expression for an achievable SE at each user of the system considering both uplink and downlink communications based on statistical channel state information (CSI), while also accounting for imperfect CSI and correlated fading conditions. Moreover, we formulate an optimization problem to obtain an optimal passive beamforming matrix design at the STARS that maximizes the sum achievable SE. The considered problem is non-convex and we propose a provably-convergent low-complexity algorithm, termed as projected gradient ascent method (ProGrAM), to obtain a stationary solution. Extensive numerical results are provided to establish the performance superiority of the FD STARS-enabled system over the HD STARS-enabled and FD conventional RIS (cRIS)-enabled counterparts, and also to show the effect of different parameters of interest on the system performance.},

  abstract     = {Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS)-assisted Autonomous Aerial Vehicle (AAV)-enabled Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) systems have received wide attention due to flexible mobility of AAVs and auxiliary links provided by RIS. However, the existing works usually neglect the peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR), a key communication performance metric that reflects amplifier efficiency, interference levels, and equipment costs. Motivated by this, we consider PAPR constraints in RIS-assisted AAV-enabled ISAC system. An optimization for joint beamforming and RIS phase-shift matrices design is established, with the goal of minimizing the weighted sum of the multiuser interference (MUI) for communication and sensing beam pattern mismatch (BPM), subject to PAPR constraints, power constraints, ideal beam direction approximation constraints, and constant mode constraints on the phase-shift matrices. To tackle this non-convex problem, a multivariate cyclic iterative alternating-direction multiplier method (MCI-ADMM) is adopted to decouple the original problem into three sub-problems regarding three variables. Some mathematical techniques are adopted to solve these sub-problems, including augmented lagrangian, constraint reconstruction method based on orthogonal Procrustes problem, manifold optimization, quadratic representation, and variable substitution. The experimental results show inherent trade-offs between dual functionalities under PAPR constraints. In addition, the consideration of PAPR performs better system performance compared with baselines. Also, the stability and reliability under different parameters settings are verified.},

  abstract     = {6G is expected to support a massive number of connected Internet of Things (IoT) devices that are producing data on an unprecedented scale. Full-duplex-enabled integrated access and backhaul (FD-IAB) emerges as one of the pivotal solutions for ensuring efficient and reliable 6G IoT networks. Orbital angular momentum (OAM) is well-suited for innovative multiple access schemes and backhaul networking due to its capability for mode multiplexing. This paper introduces a new FD-IAB network framework utilizing OAM multiplexing, which incorporates multiple uniform circular arrays (MUCA) antennas. Two types of MUCA are suggested, specifically multi-ring-based MUCA (MR-MUCA) and single-ring with subarray based MUCA (SS-MUCA), and their respective performances are analyzed. However, the OAM-based FD system is significantly challenged by various interferences. Primarily, the FD system introduces self-interference (SI), and secondly, OAM multiplexing suffers from inter-mode interference (IMI) due to misalignment between the transceiver antennas. To mitigate SI, antenna configuration method for MUCA is proposed consisting of several subsets, which involves adjusting the space of antenna elements. To reduce IMI, a beam steering matrix (BSM) is utilized to compensate for the misaligned angle at the receiver. Simulation results validate the performance of two types of MUCA and the subset configuration method regarding the impact of SI and IMI in terms of the sum rate and outage probability.},

  abstract     = {Radio frequency fingerprint (RFF) technology has emerged as a prominent research direction within the field of wireless security because it uses the distinctive hardware characteristics of individual devices for identity authentication. In the context of the Gaussian Filtered Minimum Shift Keying (GMSK) modulation mode, this research introduces an RFF identification framework centered on the analysis of eye diagram, and proposes an RFF feature extraction method based on eye diagram traces deviation (EDTD). In practical applications, considering that the presence of synchronization errors leads to the divergence of the eye diagram traces (EDT) obtained through baseband demodulation, a frame folding synchronization algorithm is proposed, which enhances the generation of the EDT. The eye diagram traces density plot generated from EDT is further utilized to obtain the probability density curve with peak clustering characteristics. Furthermore, recognizing the significance of the time-bandwidth product ($\boldsymbol {BT}$) in shaping the GMSK baseband signal eye diagram, a $\boldsymbol {BT}$ parameter estimation algorithm based on probability density curves is proposed, and then an inversion calculation is applied to attain the ideal EDT. By scrutinizing the statistical attributes of the EDTD, which represents the disparity between the measured signal's EDT and the theoretically ideal EDT derived through inversion, a 27-dimensional RFF feature vector is constructed. This feature vector is combined with a lightweight classifier to accomplish the task of wireless device identification. To verify the effectiveness of our proposed method, two types of devices utilizing GMSK modulation methods were used to construct separate datasets, which are marine automatic identification system (AIS) devices and Internet of Things (IoT) modules utilizing the global system for mobile (GSM) communications technology. And it was tested and compared with intelligent feature extraction methods based on deep learning. The results show that with only 150 training samples per device, our solution can achieve 99% identification accuracy for AIS devices composed of independent radio frequency circuits, and over 80% for GSM IoT devices composed of integrated circuits.},

In this design, we apply the concept of low probability of intercept (LPI) to the waveform design for resisting intercept by the electronic support measure (ESM) system. Different from the conventional LPI waveform design strategies, the cyclic frequency sidelobe level (CFSL) is adopted as the LPI performance metric. We also employ the integrated sidelobe level (ISL) optimization to improve the sensing performance. Consequently, a new LPI ISAC waveform design is proposed with the objective of minimizing the weighted sum of the CFSL and ISL under the constraints of energy budget and peak-to-average-power ratio (PAPR), as well as the similarity constraint to assure the communication quality. Then, to further enhance the sensing capability, a joint design of the transmit waveform and radar receive filter is proposed. As the formulated schemes require solving high-dimensional non-convex problems, efficient algorithms based on the majorization-minimization (MM) and alternating iteration are respectively developed. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed schemes is verified by simulation experiments.},

As automation technologies evolve, the requirements for higher accuracy, reliability, energy efficiency, rapid updates, and minimal latency in position estimation have intensified. In this paper, we propose the exploitation of backscattering from retro-directive antenna arrays (RAAs) to address these imperatives. Two RAA-based architectures are introduced and evaluated for a range of applications, including network localization and navigation. These architectures enable swift and simple angle-of-arrival estimation by using signals backscattered from RAAs. They also leverage multiple antennas to capitalize on multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) gains, thereby addressing the challenges posed by the inherent path loss in backscatter communication, particularly at high frequencies. This approach enables angle-based localization with remarkably low latency, making it suitable for vehicular applications. To achieve this, ad-hoc signaling and processing schemes are developed and their performance is analytically assessed. Numerical results highlight the potential of these schemes, delivering precise, ultra-low-latency localization with low-complexity, energy-efficient devices.},

  abstract     = {Two-dimensional (2D) direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation using sparse arrays shows advantages in reducing hardware costs and enhancing degrees-of-freedom. However, most current studies primarily focus on generating covariance-like matrices associated with higher dimensional difference co-arrays, neglecting the valuable information embedded in pseudo covariance matrices relevant to sum co-arrays when noncircular (NC) components are present in impinging signals. This leads to suboptimal estimation performance. To address this limitation and well leverage both covariance and pseudo covariance matrices, we propose a two-stage reconstruction-based sequential decoupled (TR-SD) approach using both sum and difference co-arrays corresponding to the deployed sparse symmetric planar array (SSPA). This approach enables the estimation of 2D DOAs of impinging signals and NC phases of NC signals simultaneously. The TR pre-procedures are developed to efficiently reconstruct the conjugate augmented covariance matrix corresponding to the uniform counterpart of the SSPA. Subsequently, SD post-procedures are devised with low computational complexity, maintaining high identifiability and the capability to estimate the NC phases. Numerical simulations are conducted to validate the effectiveness of our proposed TR-SD approach in diverse signal scenarios, demonstrating enhanced identifiability, improved detection probability, increased estimation accuracy, and high angular resolution.},

However, in the filtering process of nonlinear systems, the performance of the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) is severely affected by the influence of linearization rounding errors, which can lead to performance degradation and even divergence as the rounding errors increase. This paper primarily proposes a category of high-precision Kalman filtering methods to enhance the estimation accuracy of train operation states. Firstly, we establish identification methods for discarding residual terms in the state and measurement models, and design a new type of Extended Kalman Filter, referred to as the Residual-based Extended Kalman Filter (REKF), which incorporates the statistical characteristics of the residual terms in the Kalman filter framework. Furthermore, a REKF-embedded deep neural network (DREKF) is developed to further augment the REKF's capability in nonlinear systems. Numerical simulations show that the REKF improves the estimation accuracy by more than 5$\%$ on average compared to the EKF, and the DREKF estimation accuracy is better than the REKF with higher stability.},

In this study, a novel battery degradation trajectory prediction method based on actual EVs operational data is proposed. Firstly, the state of health of the battery is estimated using Coulomb counting methodology, refined through analysis of noise sources and charging pattern, and further denoised through Empirical Mode Decomposition. Moreover, a Transformer-based battery degradation trajectory prediction method is introduced, which demonstrates significantly higher prediction accuracy compared to various existing methods. To address the scarcity of real-world aging data, a data augmentation method based on Variational Auto-encoder (VAE) is proposed. Through data augmentation, diverse and representative battery aging data are generated, enhancing the prediction performance of all neural networks. Following data augmentation, the Transformer still exhibits the lowest Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 0.5813% and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 0.7012%. This indicates that the VAE enhances the accuracy and reliability of battery degradation trajectory prediction. Additionally, the high accuracy of the VAE-Transformer in early prediction scenarios is validated. A comprehensive analysis of the resource consumption of the neural networks further demonstrates the high applicability of the proposed method in practical applications.},

This paper proposes a novel comprehensive probabilistic approach to calculate the parking lot power and energy for battery and hybrid electric vehicles. At first, a decision is made for the operation mode of an EV arriving at the PL, using an algorithm considering ten influential random variables. Then, the aggregated parking lot power and energy are determined using Monte Carlo simulations. Finally, the Gaussian Mixture Model is used to estimate the parameters of the output probability density functions, where the maximum likelihood estimation is employed to find model components. The proposed approach is applied to a sample parking lot, and its performance is demonstrated by comparing it to a base case study and one of the pioneering techniques introduced in the literature. Finally, a thorough sensitivity analysis is applied to assess the robustness of the outputs under different scenarios.

  abstract     = {This manuscript presents a millimeter-wave wideband and wide-angle scanning dual-circularly polarized (CP) antenna array based on traveling-wave sequential feeding metasurface (TSF-MS) for vehicular communication systems. The antenna element consists of a dual-layer rectangle metasurface structures fed by a simple two-port traveling-wave sequential stripline through four non-uniform crossed slots. Each crossed slot will be excited twice by the ring strip line, which means the slots are reused. By adjusting the length and width of the crossed slots and strip line, two orthogonal electric fields with equal amplitudes and 90° phase difference can be achieved, thereby realizing good right- and left-handed circular polarizations (RHCP, LHCP). The antenna element can achieve a wide impedance bandwidth of 25.8% and axial ratio (AR) bandwidth of 31%, with a compact size of 0.38 $\lambda_{\text{mid}}$, which is far smaller than the other reported CP antenna. Then, based on the newly designed dual-CP antenna element, a 4 × 4 array is constructed by 2 × 2 sequentially rotated subarrays. This layout can improve the scanning performance, suppress the cross polarization, and realize modular wiring to simplify the feed network. Benefited from the layout, the array can achieve a wide scanning angle of ±60° over the whole bandwidth with the gain variation and AR less than 3 dB. For demonstration, one prototype is fabricated and the measured results show a good agreement with the simulated results. The dual-CP wide-angle scanning phased array can fully meet the communication needs of vehicular communication systems, indicating a good application prospect.},

  abstract     = {Developing powertrain control functions is time-consuming and resource-intensive, often leading to sub-optimal solutions. Reinforcement Learning (RL) allows agents to perform complex control tasks with minimal human involvement, but is often confined to simulations due to testing costs and safety concerns. To effectively apply RL in embedded powertrain control, agents must be able to handle real-world scenarios, particularly through direct interaction with real actuators and control systems. Therefore, this research applies Transfer Learning (TL) and X-in-the-Loop (XiL) simulations to develop agents that can seamlessly transition and perform robustly in real-world environments. For transient exhaust gas re-circulation control of an internal combustion engine, the process begins with a computationally inexpensive Model-in-the-Loop (MiL) simulation to select a suitable algorithm, fine-tune hyperparameters, and conduct preliminary training. In the next step, pre-trained agents are transferred to an advanced Hardware-in-the-Loop (HiL) system with real hardware using TL for further training. Compared to agents trained entirely on HiL systems, transferred agents required significantly less real-world training time (up to $5.9$ times shorter) while outperforming the series production Engine Control Unit (ECU). The results highlight that for real-world effectiveness, integrating actual hardware into training is essential, reward fine-tuning plays a critical role in optimizing these interactions, and the maturity of the policy significantly influences both training duration and overall performance.},

  abstract     = {The great progress and wide application of electronic products and electric vehicles have entailed more stringent requirements for the reliability of lithium-ion batteries. The State of Health (SOH) serves as a significant indicator for evaluating the condition of such batteries. However existing methods are lack of refined modeling for sequences and unable to make precise estimation for SOH. In this paper, a micromesh multi-scaled features extraction network (MMFEN) is proposed for accurately estimating SOH. A refined representation block is developed for heterogeneous elaborate feature extraction. Then, a multi-head convolution attention block is constructed to capture multi-scaled efficient state information. To demonstrate the superiority of MMFEN, experiments are conducted on the NASA and CALCE data published online and a real-world electric vehicles (EVs) data set which is collected from existing battery management systems. Comparing with traditional methods, MMFEN achieves remarkable performance with average root mean square error of 1.21% and mean absolute percentage error of 0.99% on NASA samples, 2.78% and 2.71% on CALCE dataset, while 2.39% and 2.08% on EVs data set, respectively.},

  abstract     = {Modern vehicular applications heavily rely on accurate Position, Velocity, and Timing (PVT) information provided by the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS). However, the vulnerability of GNSS to spoofing attacks presents a significant threat to vehicle safety and efficiency. Rapid detection of spoofing attacks is thus vital for ensuring the security of vehicular navigation. Among existing methods, Doppler shift emerges as a typical means of spoofing detection in vehicular applications, as the anomalous Doppler bias associated with the user's real state serves as a distinctive indicator of spoofing. Conventional approaches, however, focus on directly observing Doppler bias, which remains embedded within raw measurements and necessitates additional complexities, thereby limiting their effectiveness. In this paper, we introduce Doppler-based Receiver Autonomous Integrity Monitoring (D-RAIM) as a practical method for GNSS spoofing detection in vehicular applications. In contrast to direct monitoring methods, D-RAIM indirectly detects spoofing by assessing the impact of Doppler bias on Doppler positioning integrity. Operating without the need for external sensors, D-RAIM performs integrity monitoring by leveraging residuals derived from Doppler positioning equations, offering a flexible approach for standalone GNSS receivers. Through simulation experiments and field tests, we validate the effectiveness of D-RAIM, demonstrating its broader applicability and robustness compared to previous methods. Overall, the proposed D-RAIM method offers a practical solution for GNSS spoofing detection in vehicular applications, characterized by its flexibility, robustness, and wider applicability in enhancing vehicular navigation security.},

Through theory analysis and simulation experiments, the superior performance for our constructed $\alpha$SAP in dealing with highly correlated input signals and impulse disturbances, as well as its advantages in ensuring stability and minimizing the steady-state excess-mean-square-error (EMSE) are demonstrated.

  abstract     = {The strapdown inertial navigation system (SINS) and pitch-independent laser Doppler velocimeter (PI-LDV) integration represents a traditional navigation architecture. However, its effectiveness in obtaining precise altitude measurements remains constrained by the PI-LDV's inherent limitation of providing only one-dimensional velocity information. This study addresses this limitation by using the optical path structure of the PI-LDV to construct a frame capable of providing two-dimensional velocity information. To achieve this objective, two innovative integration methods are proposed: a SINS/PI-LDV loosely coupled integration method and a SINS/PI-LDV tightly coupled integration method, both of which consider the influence of potential laser beam fluctuations. Furthermore, a displacement increment measurement model is developed for the SINS/PI-LDV integrated navigation system to maximize the utilization efficiency of PI-LDV measurements while reducing the impact of sensor noise and outliers. The effectiveness of the proposed methods is rigorously validated through a comprehensive series of experimental tests, including: 1) extended-duration, long-distance tests using high-precision inertial measurement units (IMUs); 2) short-duration, limited-range evaluations using high-precision IMUs; and 3) two additional long-distance verification experiments using both high-precision and medium-precision IMUs. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms traditional methods, particularly in height accuracy. Notably, the performance advantages become more pronounced when implementing the SINS/PI-LDV integrated navigation system with medium-precision IMUs, suggesting enhanced practical applicability in cost-sensitive applications.},

  abstract     = {The vehicular Metaverse represents an emerging paradigm that merges vehicular communications with virtual environments, integrating real-world data to enhance in-vehicle services. However, this integration faces critical security challenges, particularly in the data collection layer where malicious sensing IoT (SIoT) devices can compromise service quality through data poisoning attacks. The security aspects of the Metaverse services should be well addressed both when creating the digital twins of the physical systems and when delivering the virtual service to the vehicular Metaverse users (VMUs). This paper introduces vehicular Metaverse guard (VMGuard), a novel four-layer security framework that protects vehicular Metaverse systems from data poisoning attacks. Specifically, when the virtual service providers (VSPs) collect data about physical environment through SIoT devices in the field, the delivered content might be tampered. Malicious SIoT devices with moral hazard might have private incentives to provide poisoned data to the VSP to degrade the service quality (QoS) and user experience (QoE) of the VMUs. The proposed framework implements a reputation-based incentive mechanism that leverages user feedback and subjective logic modeling to assess the trustworthiness of participating SIoT devices. More precisely, the framework entails the use of reputation scores assigned to participating SIoT devices based on their historical engagements with the VSPs. These scores are calculated from feedback provided by the VMUs to the VSPs regarding the content they receive and are managed utilizing a subjective logic model. Ultimately, we validate our proposed model using comprehensive simulations. Our key findings indicate that our mechanism effectively prevents the initiation of poisoning attacks by malicious SIoT devices. Additionally, our system ensures that reliable SIoT devices, previously misclassified, are not barred from participating in future rounds of the market. This work provides a crucial security solution for the emerging vehicular Metaverse, enabling trustworthy data collection and reliable service delivery.},

By exploiting the upcoming signal-phase-and-timing information of multiple traffic lights via vehicle connectivity technologies, a connected car optimizes the speed trajectory, leading to reduced stops in the dilemma zone compared to the vehicles that strictly comply with traffic rules. As a result, it is observed that connected cars could pass through multiple traffic lights when the green or yellow signals are turned on, resulting in the minimization of the entire trip time. The proposed method is comprehensively verified through simulations under various situations, and, the behavior of the connected cars is observed similar to that of experienced human drivers, particularly in the dilemma zone. We also show the efficacy of our approach through the experiments comparing the speed trajectory generated by our approach with those of different human drivers using a lab-scale driving simulator.},

However, most of the existing research fails to consider the collaboration between video quality and security optimization in wireless offloading, making it less efficient in real-world scenarios with diverse requirements. To address these challenges, we propose a novel V2V-based secure computation offloading algorithm for video analysis, called radial basis function (RBF)-based multi-objective double deep Q-network (R-MDDQN). We use Wyner's wiretap coding scheme to obtain the achievable secrecy capacity and ensure that video data cannot be decoded by eavesdroppers. To address the trade-off problem among multiple objectives, we employ an RBF weight network to dynamically adjust the weights by learning the variations of different objective values. Each DDQN agent receives reward evaluations based on different objective functions and effectively and dynamically approximates the optimal offloading strategy. Extensive experiments conducted using real-world datasets from Shenzhen demonstrate that the proposed R-MDDQN reduces latency by approximately 9.32$\%$, decreases energy consumption by around 7.3$\%$, improves video analysis accuracy by about 18.9$\%$, and enhances security capacity by roughly 14.8$\%$ compared to existing task offloading schemes.},

However, constrained by sensing range and prediction accuracy, the performance of CAV platoon can not be guaranteed in the scenario of mixed traffic consisting of CAVs and human-driven vehicles (HDVs). This is not only due to the uncertainty of HDVs but also related to the occurrence of various traffic anomalies, such as emergency braking and accidents. In this paper, we aim to investigate an efficient control strategy to guarantee the operation of the platoon in mixed traffic, especially in the case of traffic anomalies. To tackle the problem, an edge-assisted platoon control strategy, called E-CACC, is proposed. First, an error-aware flexible tracking policy is designed to adapt to HDV uncertainties and speed prediction errors. Based on the tracking policy, a zone model predictive control (ZMPC) method is then designed to guarantee travel safety and avoid undesired acceleration. Further, a coordination strategy of CAV platoon and roadside unit (RSU) is proposed to prevent the platoon from potential collision in the case of traffic anomalies, where an event-based communication trigger is designed to determine whether and when the platoon establishes communication links with RSU to acquire exogenous sensing data of anomaly segment. Finally, the evaluation results illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in improving travel safety and comfortableness.},

To address these challenges, we propose a trajectory Distribution-aware Spatio-Temporal Attention network (DSTAnet) for vehicle trajectory prediction. The proposed DSTAnet begins with a temporal feature extractor that combines Transformer Encoder Layers (TEL) and Gated Recurrent Units (GRU), extracting both long-term teporal dependencies and short-term variations in vehicle trajectories. Next, Graph Attention Networks (GAT) are introduced to extract spatial features in dynamically changing interactions, and focus on the most noteworthy vehicles, which are beneficial for modeling interactions between vehicles. Meanwhile, Mixed Density Network (MDN) is used to learn potential trajectory distributions from spatiotemporal features, which enriches the features related to driver intentions, providing a probabilistic understanding of possible future trajectories. By predicting multiple trajectories through random sampling, DSTAnet captures the inherent uncertainty of driver intentions. Finally, the INTERACTION dataset is adopted to estimate the model performance and results indicate that the proposed method outperforms others.},

  abstract     = {Centralized machine learning algorithms in vehicular networks face privacy and resource constraints.Federated Learning (FL) addresses these by enabling collaborative model training without sharing raw data. To incentivize vehicle participation despite resource constraints, we propose a contract between Roadside Units (RSUs) and vehicles, specifying required computation resources and rewards based on local data quality. The contract is designed to maximize the utility of the RSU, subject to constraints that ensure the participation of the vehicles in the task and truthful reporting of their data quality parameter. However, designing an optimal contract with classical methods is limited to specific utility functions. To extend the design methodology of optimal contracts to a broader range of utility functions, our study proposes a deep learning-based solution. Specifically, we present a novel application of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), marking the first instance of applying DNNs in contract theory-based incentive mechanisms to achieve near-optimal contracts. We design the DNN's structure to inherently satisfy specific constraints of the optimization problem, enhancing its efficiency and accuracy in determining the optimal contract. We utilize an augmented Lagrangian method to approximate the optimal contract in federated learning tasks. A case study on traffic sign recognition demonstrates the applicability and effectiveness of our method. Comparing our approach with the well-known generative diffusion model shows that in the FL scenarios, the DNN results are closer to the optimal contract compared to those of the generative diffusion model.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a finite-time adaptive fuzzy event-triggered control approach based on command filtered backstepping for addressing the altitude and attitude control problems of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) with full-state constraints. Firstly, a finite-time command filter is employed to fast approximate the derivative of the virtual control signal, effectively avoiding the computational complexity issue that existed in traditional backstepping design. Subsequently, an error compensation system has been devised to eliminate the errors generated by the filter. Considering the existence of unknown nonlinear dynamics within the system, the fuzzy adaptive control is adopted to handle them. Finally, an event-triggered control with fixed threshold strategy is proposed to reduce the communication and computation burden between the controller and actuator. It has been proven that the tracking errors can converge to a region close to the origin in finite time and without violating full-state constraints. The validity of the control approach has been verified through simulations and experiments.},

  abstract     = {In uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV) navigation, one of the foremost challenges is devising efficient flight paths that navigate complex environments while conserving energy and avoiding obstacles. The paper proposes a High-Altitude Platform aided Fruit Fly Optimization Algorithm (HAPFOA) as a novel approach to address sub-optimal path planning in dynamic complex environments by leveraging fruit fly's innate foraging strategies and adapting them to the three-dimensional challenges of UAV navigation at high altitudes. This approach applies the Fruit Fly Optimization Algorithm (FOA), where each UAV is analogous to a ‘fly' exploring potential pathways. The paths chosen by these UAVs are evaluated using a comprehensive ’smell' metric that integrates crucial navigational factors such as closeness to the target, obstacle avoidance, energy utilization, and maneuverability. This process is iterative, with each UAV continuously adjusting its flight path based on the ‘smell' metric feedback, aiming to find the route with the best possible ’smell' score. The algorithm helps to avoid obstacles during the vision phase. Cubic spline interpolation is used to refine and smoothen the UAV trajectories to ensure the practical application of these flight paths, making them more applicable and realistic for risky operations. Based on obstacle warnings from HAPUAV, the simulation results show an efficient route formulation by the proposed model with no idle time and a faster convergence rate. Another advantage of HAPFOA is its ability to preserve more energy than other models.},

We address safety of networked autonomous systems where the information exchanged between robots incurs communication delays. We formalize a notion of distributed control barrier function for multi-robot systems, a safety certificate amenable to a distributed implementation, which provides formal ground to using graph neural networks to learn safe distributed controllers. Further, we observe that learning a distributed controller ignoring delays can severely degrade safety. We finally propose a predictor-based framework to train a safe distributed controller under communication delays, where the current state of nearby robots is predicted from received data and age-of-information. Numerical experiments on multi-robot collision avoidance show that our predictor-based approach can significantly improve the safety of a learned distributed controller under communication delays.},

To tackle it, reinforcement learning (RL) was introduced for path tracking control of autonomous mining trucks, through designing separate RL control networks and adjustment networks to adapt to mining paths and the truck's control response. To address the computational time and black-box issues associated with RL, an adaptive preview controller was used to simplify the state inputs and improve computational efficiency, and a safety control strategy was implemented to mitigate the safety risks posed by the black-box nature of the model. Simulation tests on actual mining paths show the RL controller achieves an average lateral error under 0.05 m with an average execution time under 10 ms, and the safety layer effectively intervenes when network control fails. Field experiment results show a maximum lateral error under 0.22 m with an average execution time under 20 ms, ensuring safe driving even in complete network control failure.},

Specifically, an auxiliary stabilizable control law based on adaptive sliding mode surface (ASMC) and extended state observer (ESO) is first designed. Considering that the traditional ESO-ASMC approach has a slow convergence rate and unsatisfied stability characteristics, a rolling time horizon optimization technique is incorporated, and the new ESO-DASMPC control scheme is designed, which greatly improves the stability and the convergence of the formation system while inheriting the robustness of the existing auxiliary controller. The recursive feasibility and stability of the ESO-DASMPC algorithm are guaranteed by constructing the constraints of the auxiliary controller and associated Lyapunov function.

To address these challenges, we propose a collaborative framework that leverages device-to-device (D2D) communication and multiple UAVs to enhance MEC performance. We aim to minimize the system average latency by jointly optimizing content caching, task offloading, UAV trajectory planning, and computational resource allocation. The problem is formulated as a mixed-integer non-convex optimization problem and decomposed into three subproblems. An iterative algorithm based on penalty successive convex approximation (P-SCA) and Lagrangian duality is developed to alternately optimize these subproblems until convergence.

Several deep learning-based Semantic Communication (SC) models have been proposed to reduce feature transmission overhead and mitigate channel noise interference. Previous research has demonstrated that Spiking Neural Network (SNN)-based SC models exhibit greater robustness on digital channels compared to Deep Neural Network (DNN)-based SC models. However, the existing SNN-based SC models require fixed time steps, resulting in fixed transmission bandwidths that cannot be adaptively adjusted based on channel conditions. To address this issue, this paper introduces a novel SC model called SNN-SC-HARQ, which combines the SNN-based SC model with the Hybrid Automatic Repeat reQuest (HARQ) mechanism. SNN-SC-HARQ comprises an SNN-based SC model that supports the transmission of features at varying bandwidths, along with a policy model that determines the appropriate bandwidth. Experimental results show that SNN-SC-HARQ can dynamically adjust the bandwidth according to the channel conditions without performance loss.},

Unlike previous work that assumes ideal and global server information, we study a practical online framework for acquiring edge server information. We propose an online offloading and scheduling algorithm that efficiently integrates the Moore–Hodgson algorithm into this practical framework to satisfy hard deadlines required by tasks. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms conventional first-come-first-serve scheduling and D-Dedas scheduling. Furthermore, the results show that the performance of proactive broadcasting of server information closely approaches that of ideal server information as the number of vehicles increases.},

The lower and upper bounds of OP are derived firstly according to the inclusion-exclusion principle. Then, the diversity order is deduced, pointing out the conditions for full time diversity.

Conventional importance sampling (IS)-based DPD approaches are designed under the assumption of large distances between the sources, thus suffering from accuracy degradation when some of the sources are closely spaced. To this end, using channel state information (CSI), we propose a novel IS-based DPD algorithm by introducing a source classification step before generating position realizations. A more appropriate importance function is also developed. Specifically, rather than processing all sources independently, the new importance function assumes that the closely-located radio sources are uniformly distributed around a central point. The simulation results validate the robustness of the developed importance function. Furthermore, the results clearly show that the proposed algorithm can achieve a better estimation accuracy than state-of-the-art DPD techniques.},

The performance metrics for the link, including the average bit error rate (BER), outage probability and ergodic capacity are formulated and employed to assess the performance of inter-orbital ISC at THz band. Simulation results demonstrate that an increase in the variance of the beam misalignment angle reduces the accuracy of the ISC link, resulting in a higher average BER and outage probability. Furthermore, optimal central frequency selection is essential to achieve the highest ergodic capacity for different variances, with the potential for reaching tens or even hundreds of gigabits per second (Gbps).},

Different 5 G NR codebooks incur varying overheads and exhibit performance disparities under diverse channel conditions, necessitating codebook adaptation based on channel conditions to reduce feedback overhead while enhancing performance. However, existing methods of 5 G NR codebooks adaptation require significant overhead for model training and feedback or fall short in performance. To address these limitations, this letter introduces a federated reservoir computing framework designed for efficient codebook adaptation in computationally and feedback resource-constrained mobile devices. This framework utilizes a novel series of indicators as input training data, striking an effective balance between performance and feedback overhead. Compared to conventional models, the proposed codebook adaptation via federated reservoir computing (CA-FedRC), achieves rapid convergence and significant loss reduction in both speed and accuracy. Extensive simulations under various channel conditions demonstrate that our algorithm not only reduces resource consumption of users but also accurately identifies channel types, thereby optimizing the trade-off between spectrum efficiency, computational complexity, and feedback overhead.},

However, state-of-the-art grant-free massive NOMA schemes for mMIMO systems require accurate estimation of random access channels to perform activity detection and the following coherent data demodulation, which suffers from excessive pilot overhead and access latency. To address this, we propose a pre-equalization aided grant-free massive access scheme for mMIMO systems, where an iterative detection scheme is conceived. Specifically, the base station (BS) firstly activates one of its antennas (i.e., beacon antenna) to broadcast a beacon signal, which facilitates the user equipment (UEs) to perform downlink channel estimation and pre-equalize the uplink random access signal with respect to the channels associated with the beacon antenna. During the uplink transmission stage, the BS detects UEs' activity and data by using the proposed iterative detection algorithm, which consists of three modules: coarse data detection (DD), data-aided channel estimation (CE), and fine DD. In the proposed algorithm, the joint activity and DD is firstly performed based on the signals received by the beacon antenna. Subsequently, the DD is further refined by iteratively performing data-aided CE module and fine DD module using signals received by all BS antennas. Our simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme outperforms state-of-the-art mMIMO-based grant-free massive NOMA schemes with the same access latency.},

With tunable reflection phase shifts, RIS can improve the mmWave channel conditions. However, the degrees of freedom of mmWave RISs are limited by hardware constraints, often restricted to only 1-bit phase control, which significantly increases the difficulty of beam synthesis. In this paper, a generic framework is proposed for arbitrary beam pattern synthesis for mmWave RIS with discrete phase shifts, which is divided into two stages. Specifically, an initial solution is obtained by applying the principles of segmentation and superposition. Subsequently, an iterative optimization algorithm is employed after quantization to refine the discrete phase shifts for improved performance. Given target beam requirements, simulations demonstrate the ability of the proposed algorithm to synthesize any expected beam pattern. Finally, the obtained phase coding is experimentally validated on a fabricated mmWave RIS through a measurement campaign, confirming the practicability and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.},

Since it is difficult to replace batteries in buried end nodes, energy efficiency (EE) needs to be improved to extend the lifespan. As link quality is closely related to LoRa physical layer (PHY) parameters and soil characteristics, it is necessary to carefully configure parameters to maintain reliable connectivity and high EE in the dynamic underground environment. To this end, we propose EnergySaver, which utilizes soil moisture to estimate the underground path loss, derives signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) to characterize the packet delivery rate (PDR), and finally calculates EE. The combination that maximizes EE is the best configuration for current channel state. In addition, for the case of densely deployed buried LoRa nodes, we propose a low-complexity collision decoding scheme in EnergySaver that utilizes packet time offsets to decompose concurrent transmissions. The simulation results confirm that EnergySaver improves EE by at least two times without sacrificing high link quality, and effectively reduces packet loss during concurrent data transmission with excellent scalability.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we investigate the problem of target detection in the reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) radar system. Firstly, we propose a general signal model adapted to the RIS-assisted MIMO radar, where the RIS is far-field deployed, and orthogonal waveforms are employed by the MIMO radar. Based on the signal model, a non-coherent detection scheme that requires no phase synchronization and is relatively easy to be implemented, and a coherent detection scheme that obtains a detection performance gain by exploiting the phase information, are proposed. Furthermore, we analyze the detection probability and false alarm probability of proposed detection schemes, and optimization algorithms for the phase shift settings of the RIS elements are formulated using the Neyman-Pearson criterion. Simulation results demonstrate that the RIS-assisted MIMO radar outperforms the traditional MIMO radar.},

  abstract     = {Extremely large-scale multiple-input multiple-output (XL-MIMO) communications, enabled by numerous antenna elements integrated into large antenna surfaces, can provide increased effective degree of freedom (EDoF) to achieve high diversity gain. However, it remains an open problem that how the EDoF is influenced by the directional radiation pattern of antenna elements. In this work, empowered by the wavenumber-domain channel representation, we analyze the EDoF in a general case where the directivity of antennas, determined by the antenna structure and element spacing, is considered. Specifically, we first reveal the uneven distribution of directivity-aware wavenumber-domain coupling coefficients, i.e., channel gain towards different directions, in the isotropic Rayleigh fading channel. EDoF is then calculated based on such distribution of coupling coefficients. A numerical method is also provided to obtain coupling coefficients via full-wave EM simulations. Due to the influence of antenna directivity, how EDoF and ergodic channel capacity vary with the element spacing are explored via simulations for different antenna types.},

  abstract     = {This study proposes a likelihood function (LF) learning method for time-varying multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems using one-bit analog-to-digital converters. In time-varying channels, the initially-estimated LF becomes inconsistent with the true LF owing to channel variation. To mitigate this inconsistency, the LF can be learned by using input-output samples obtained from the MIMO detection. However, the input-output samples inevitably have some uncertainties due to detection errors. To address this challenge, we consider a Markov decision process (MDP) to minimize the mismatch between the true and learned LFs under sample uncertainty. Subsequently, we propose a computationally efficient LF learning method to solve the MDP. In the proposed method, we first simplify an LF update model in the MDP, which efficiently captures temporal channel variations by considering the expectation of the channel model noise. Based on the LF update model, we obtain the optimal policy in a closed-form solution by considering the most probable state transition. Simulation results show that the proposed learning method significantly improves complexity without sacrificing performance.},

  abstract     = {Wideband spectrum sensing (WBSS) based on sub-Nyquist sampling (SNS) effectively alleviates sampling pressure, improves spectrum utilization, and has significant applications in modulation recognition and localization. Recovery algorithms widely used in WBSS are the classical simultaneous orthogonal matching pursuit (SOMP) algorithm and its variants. For the optimization function, the sensing matrix in the SNS model based on multirate or multicoset sampling in earlier research is typically a unitary matrix, allowing the optimization to be achieved by transposing the sensing matrix. However, current research is increasingly shifting towards models that use the Modulated Wideband Converter (MWC) structure as the basis for SNS, where the sensing matrix is generally non-unitary. In this context, the traditional transpose operation no longer provides accurate results, leading to a significant decline in optimization performance. Additionally, for the estimation method, SOMP typically employs the least squares (LS) method, which suffers from large variance and sensitivity to noise, significantly reducing estimation accuracy, especially when the signal is sparse or noise levels are high. It is due to the fact that LS assumes that all signal components contribute equally to the estimation, which prevents it from fully exploiting the sparsity of the wideband signal in WBSS, thereby affecting estimation accuracy. To address these issues, this paper proposes an improved SOMP algorithm based on principal component (PC) estimation. First, in the optimization function, we replace the transpose operation with a pseudo-inverse for a non-unitary sensing matrix to more closely fit the communication system model. Second, in the estimation method, we replace LS method with PC estimation, which focuses on the main components of the signal while ignoring secondary ones, making full use of the signal's sparsity. And we prove that PC estimation has a lower variance. Finally, for the SOMP and its variants, the proposed methods are effective in both aspects. And simulations illustrate the correctness of the proposed methods.},

To address these requirements, we propose a novel redundancy version (RV)-adaptive hybrid automatic repeat request (HARQ) scheme. Our approach builds upon the existing 5G HARQ framework and 5G low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes, introducing an adaptive selection of the RV for the subsequent transmission based on the current decoding states. To determine the optimal RV, we use a modified version of the reciprocal channel approximation (RCA) algorithm to compare the decoding thresholds of all available RVs and select the one with the lowest threshold to maximize the likelihood of successful decoding. To further reduce processing delay, we apply a deep neural network (DNN) to predict the optimal RV for the next transmission. This prediction is made prior to the decoding process, ensuring that no additional delay is introduced. Since the selection is made before the decoding starts, our proposed method can seamlessly integrate with other adaptive-HARQ and fast HARQ schemes.},

  abstract     = {Short-packet communication (SPC) is essentially synonymous with ultra-reliable low-latency communication (uRLLC), which must meet stringent latency and reliability requirements. However, achieving efficient hybrid beamforming (HBF) in SPC-based millimeter wave (mmWave) systems is challenging due to the constraints of finite block lengths, limited number of radio frequency chains (RFCs), and owing to the complex optimization of transmit precoders (TPCs). In this work, we investigate the achievable rate region of an SPC-based mmWave downlink system. We harness the HBF for finite block lengths low-latency communication, relying on a low number of RFCs. We formulate a Pareto optimization problem for characterizing the achievable rate region, while considering the transmit power, mmWave hardware, and block length constraints. To solve this highly non-convex problem, we propose a bisection search-based block coordinate descent (Bi-BCD) algorithm, in which we optimize the RF TPC, the baseband (BB) TPC, and the block length. Specifically, we jointly optimize the RF and BB TPCs for a fixed block length, which involves both Remanian conjugate gradient (RCG) and second-order cone programming (SOCP) techniques, and then we optimize the block length by the mixed integer programming method. Subsequently, we update the achievable rate via the bisection search method. Finally, we present simulation results and quantify the efficiency of the proposed scheme.},

This technique harnesses an autoencoder architecture, where an encoder network transforms CSI into a low-dimensional latent vector, and a decoder network reconstructs the CSI from the latent vector. In this paper, we propose a vector quantization (VQ) framework for DL-based CSI feedback to provide an efficient finite-bit representation of the latent vector. In our framework, a trainable VQ module is employed after the encoder network, and entropy coding is applied to the output of the VQ module. To jointly train the encoder and decoder networks with the VQ codebook, we design a quantization criterion and loss function of vector-quantized variational autoencoder based on the rate-distortion theory. We also devise two practical strategies to make the proposed framework applicable under a strict bit budget constraint. Using simulations, we demonstrate that DL-based CSI feedback with the proposed framework outperforms existing quantization-aware DL-based CSI feedback methods.},

Then, in the second stage Bob helps Alice's covert downlink transmission via jamming as per his detection outcome in the first stage. We optimally design the covert ISAC system to maximize the formulated overall covert rate subject to a covertness constraint, an average power constraint at Bob, and an uplink rate requirement. As shown in our examinations, the proposed two-stage framework significantly outperforms a benchmark scheme without the detection function in terms of achieving a higher covert rate.

Unlike existing transmission schemes that treat the channel as invariant, this work proposes to actively adjust the radiation power of each scattering path of the wireless channel by adjusting the radiation pattern of the transmit array, thereby removing the limitations that communications can only adapt to the wireless channel passively. We separate the optimization into two stages. In the first stage, an optimization problem on the channel matrix aimed at maximizing the worst user's quality-of service (QoS) without investing additional signal power is formulated. Given the non-convex nature of the formulated problem, we design an alternating optimization algorithm, and obtain the channel covariance matrix that achieves optimal performance for each transmission symbol slot. This structure, proven to be optimal, provides key theoretical insights into the ideal channel conditions for symbol-level precoding (SLP). In the second stage, we propose the radiation pattern design in reconfigurable MU-MISO communication systems, where communication channels are jointly decided by the radiation pattern of the transmit array and the physical propagation channel, aligning the practical pattern channel with the theoretical optimal channel. Numerical results verify the superiority of the proposed SLCPO scheme in PR MU-MISO systems in terms of error rate over state-of-the-art.},

To improve the spectral efficiency (SE) of a point-to-point MIMO system, we exploit the channel reconfiguration capabilities provided by multiple intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRSs) to enhance the spatial multiplexing. Unlike most existing works, we address both the issues of the IRSs placement and elements allocation. To this end, we first introduce an orthogonal placement strategy to mitigate channel correlation, thereby enabling interference-free multi-stream transmission. Subsequently, we propose a successive convex approximation (SCA)-based approach to jointly optimize the IRS elements and power allocation. Our theoretical analysis unveils that equal IRS elements/power allocation scheme becomes asymptotically optimal as the number of IRS elements and transmit power tend to be infinite. Numerical results demonstrate that when the total number of IRS elements or the power exceeds a certain threshold, a multi-IRS assisted system outperforms a single IRS configuration.},

To reduce interference between data and pilot, a deep learning based residual attention network (DRAN) is proposed in this paper. The DRAN consists of four modules, i.e., the residual module, the channel attention module (CAM), the position attention module (PAM) and the attention feature fusion (AFF) module. The residual module transforms the received signal into a series of domains. The CAM re-weighted information from these domains to extract the pilot information, which could be regarded as a filter in the delay-Doppler (DD) domain. And the PAM is further used to reduce the fluctuation in the filter. Finally, the AFF is used to fuse the results from CAM and PAM. The proposed framework extracts the pilot from the signal and reduces the interference from data and noise.

In this paper, we analyze the PAPR performance of the FSIM signaling and propose a PAPR reduction method based on filter bank optimization. And since the ISI constraint is relaxed in the process of optimization, an enhanced ISI reconstruction and cancellation scheme is also proposed to address the extra introduced ISI. Simulation results exhibit that, compared to the traditional single-carrier system, the proposed schemes reduce the PAPR of the FSIM signal and achieve 0.45 to 2 dB net SNR gains at different transmission rates under the multipath fading channel.},

We formulate this as a multi-objective, non-convex Non-Linear Mixed Integer Programming (NLMIP) problem, incorporating both deployment and resource allocation practical constraints. To manage the problem's complexity, we decompose it into two sub-problems: FBS deployment and resource allocation optimization. To optimize the 2D deployment of FBSs in horizontal space, we propose a general, low-complexity heuristic method based on a statistical variant of the Self-Organizing Map (SOM) algorithm, named Evolutionary Bayesian SOM (EBSOM). Then, utilizing a Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA) communication scheme between FBSs and SGUs, we maximize the downlink sum rate while adhering to constraints on FBS positions, transmission power, and bandwidth availability. In this stage, the deployment of FBSs is further refined to enhance resource allocation by dividing the problem into two non-convex sub-problems, which are solved iteratively using Surrogate Optimization (SO). Numerical simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of our strategy, particularly in reducing the number of active FBSs, minimizing overlapping areas, and improving network sum rates.},

In this paper, we introduce Software-Defined Multicast (SDM) to broadband LEO constellations and propose a robust SDM policy capable of effectively managing the dynamic nature of LEO constellation networks. To address the obstacle avoidance requirements, we develop an Obstacle-Avoiding Rectilinear Steiner Tree (OA-RST) algorithm and construct an intelligent multicast routing tree. Additionally, we present a resilient multicast management strategy to ensure seamless maintenance and management of multicast groups, even in the face of frequent satellite switching, dynamic membership updates, and resource contention among multiple groups.

  abstract     = {Beyond 5G and 6G networks are expected to support new and challenging use cases and applications that depend on a certain level of Quality of Service (QoS) to operate smoothly. Predicting the QoS in a timely manner is of high importance, especially for safety-critical applications as in the case of vehicular communications. Although until recent years the QoS prediction has been carried out by centralized Artificial Intelligence (AI) solutions, a number of privacy, computational, and operational concerns have emerged. Alternative solutions have surfaced (e.g. Split Learning, Federated Learning), distributing AI tasks of reduced complexity across nodes, while preserving the privacy of the data. However, new challenges rise when it comes to scalable distributed learning approaches, taking into account the heterogeneous nature of future wireless networks. The current work proposes DISTINQT, a novel multi-headed input privacy-aware distributed learning framework for QoS prediction. Our framework supports multiple heterogeneous nodes, in terms of data types and model architectures, by sharing computations across them. This enables the incorporation of diverse knowledge into a sole learning process that will enhance the robustness and generalization capabilities of the final QoS prediction model. DISTINQT also contributes to data privacy preservation by encoding any raw input data into highly complex, compressed, and irreversible latent representations before any transmission. Evaluation results showcase that DISTINQT achieves a statistically identical performance compared to its centralized version, while also proving the validity of the privacy preserving claims. DISTINQT manages to achieve a reduction in prediction error of up to 65% on average against six state-of-the-art centralized baseline solutions presented in the Tele-Operated Driving use case.},

To solve the utility maximization problem while dynamically adjusting the weights of the E2E-CECN utility to accommodate the variation of users' service requests, we proposed a reward comparison double deep Q network algorithm to optimize the large timescale joint virtual basestation activation and CC-EC scheduling, and a reward comparison deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm to optimize the small timescale allocation of backhaul link capacity (BLC), CC/EC capability and transmission power. Numerical results show that both the high-throughput and low-delay service requirements can be satisfied simultaneously under the reasonable BLC usage and power consumption.},

Specifically, the main objective of multi-static radar network is to maximize the jammer tracking accuracy under power constraints, whereas the jammer aims to minimize the index. The closed-form expression for the Bayesian Cramér-Rao Lower Bound(BCRLB) with radiation power as variable in the non-ideal detection environment is derived and adopted as the criterion function. Then, the multi-static radar network and the jammer are taken as the leader and follower based on Stackelberg game, and the power allocation model is established to optimize their power resources. Finally, by integrating the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions and cyclic minimization algorithm, an iterative two-step solution is developed to tackle the power allocation problem between two players in the game efficiently, and the existence and uniqueness of the Stackelberg game equilibrium are derived.},

Due to the interdependence of user association and inter-cell interference in the network, collaborative efforts among individual BSs become imperative. The problem is modeled as a decentralized partially observable Markov decision process (DEC-POMDP) and a multi-agent proximal policy optimization (MAPPO) algorithm is proposed to obtain a collaborative BS control policy. Simulation results demonstrate that the obtained policy can significantly improve network energy efficiency, adaptively switch the BSs into different depths of sleep, reduce inter-cell interference, and maintain good QoS compared to the two benchmark algorithms. The results also validate that enabling user offloading among BSs can improve both user QoS and system performance.

The key challenge involves how to efficiently execute tasks offloaded from IoT devices, given limited on-board computation capabilities of UAVs and delay constraints of tasks. To address it, UAVs are first allowed to adjust their trajectories to accommodate as many tasks as possible from IoT devices. Subsequently, UAVs compute a portion of these tasks while delegating the rest to LEO satellites for further execution. Accordingly, we formulate a joint optimization problem including UAV trajectory planning, task offloading, and bandwidth allocations, aiming to maximize the long-term energy efficiency of UAVs and LEO satellites (i.e., the total data size in computation offloading divided by energy consumption of UAVs and LEO satellites). Considering the interactions among intelligent UAVs, this problem is reformulated as a set of interconnected multi-agent stochastic games, and the existence of corresponding Nash Equilibrium (NE) is theoretically proved. To obtain the NE, a multi-agent reinforcement learning-based algorithm, namely UTPTR, is developed concerning system dynamics and uncertainties. Simulations evaluate the performance of the UTPTR and demonstrate its superiority compared to existing approaches.},

  abstract     = {Edge computing (EC) has emerged as an important technology to support the low-delay request of massive devices nowadays. Task offloading is an essential part in EC because it can influence the use of network resources and network performance dramatically. Most existing task offloading works are only from the view of users. To effectively considering the features and objectives of both users and edge nodes from their different perspectives, a Stackelberg game-based joint computing resource allocation and task offloading method is proposed in this paper. For the nature in EC where edge nodes and users play different roles, the problem is formulated as a bi-level optimization model with multiple leaders and multiple followers. The edge nodes can be seen as leaders and the users are followers. When jointly allocating computing resource and offloading tasks, edge nodes and users have different objectives. The objective of edge nodes is to achieve the most revenue and least energy cost, and the objective of users is to obtain short delay, consume little energy and pay less. Further, considering the particular features of EC, unlike existing Stackelberg game-based task offloading research, we focus on the computing resource allocation rather than pricing. The edge nodes decide the amount of computing resources to be allocated to each user. The users will then react according to such allocation to decide task offloading strategies. Interference, delay, energy, and payoff are all considered. Evolutionary optimization method BLEAQ-II is applied to solve the designed Stackelberg game-based task offloading model. Numerical results have shown the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {Oil spills represent significant environmental hazards in ocean ecosystems, requiring rapid and accurate detection and response mechanisms. Due to its efficacy, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is an important tool for remote monitoring of ocean environments. However, operational constraints such as communication time between low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites and ground stations (GS), as well as finite buffers, pose challenges. To address these issues, this paper proposes a space-air-ground-integrated network (SAGIN) scenario comprising LEO satellites, high altitude platforms (HAPs), and ground stations (GSs), suitable for rapid and accurate oil spill detection using SAR images. In addition, a novel three-step algorithm is proposed to facilitate SAR image transmission effectively. The first step of the proposed algorithm focuses on maximizing the transmission of ocean SAR images from the LEO satellites to the HAPs. This optimization involves the neural Myerson auction (NMA)-based scheduler, a second-price auction mechanism with deep learning methodologies for truthfulness, distributed computation, and low computational complexity. In addition, the pathloss is also considered for effective communication system design. The second step algorithm aims to maximize data transmission efficiency from HAPs to GSs, employing scheduling strategies based on the Markov decision process (MDP). This algorithm enables optimal decision-making over time steps, considering the throughput of each GS and the age of the information (AoI) ratio. Finally, an image compression rate control algorithm based on Lyapunov optimization is employed at the GSs to enhance detection accuracy while ensuring queue stability. The performance of the proposed three-step algorithm is intensively evaluated against various benchmark algorithms, demonstrating its superiority in oil spill detection efficacy.},

To achieve this goal, we leverage two artificial intelligence algorithms—federated learning and actor-critic—to develop a proactive and intelligent cell switching framework. This framework can learn the operating policy of small base stations in an ultra-dense heterogeneous network, resulting in maximum energy savings while respecting quality of service (QoS) constraints. Additionally, the use of federated learning enhances the security of the system as only the model parameters are shared among the entities, rather than the raw and potentially sensitive data. In other words, in the event of a data breach or eavesdropping, only the parameters of the developed artificial intelligence model would be compromised. This approach ensures that the network remains secure against attacks targeting confidential and sensitive data. The performance evaluation reveals that the proposed framework can achieve an energy saving that is about 77% more than that of the state-of-the-art solutions while respecting the QoS constraints of the network.},

  abstract     = {Age of Information (AoI) is a critical metric that can be used to assess the freshness of information in highly dynamic low-earth orbit (LEO) terrestrial-satellite communications. In most existing research on the AoI of wireless transmissions, the packet transmission rate rarely changes. However, over a given period of time and without perfect transmit power control, the transmission rate of LEO terrestrial-satellite links cannot remain constant. This is due to the time-varying path loss fading experienced by the transmitted signal over the LEO terrestrial-satellite links, as the LEO satellites can travel at speeds exceeding Mach 10 and complete 12-16 Earth orbits per day. Inspired by this observation, this paper investigates the effects of the swift motion of LEO satellites on the freshness of information in LEO terrestrial-satellite uplink transmissions. At the same time, the Slotted Aloha protocol is considered to manage the process of multiple ground nodes accessing the LEO satellites. The closed-form expression for the average AoI of the LEO terrestrial-satellite uplink transmissions is explicitly derived for the single ground node scenario. Furthermore, a model for analyzing the average AoI in the multi-ground node scenario is proposed accordingly. Finally, numerical results are presented to validate the proposed analysis models of the average AoI and to investigate the AoI variation in the target LEO terrestrial-satellite transmission systems.},

  abstract     = {Controller area network (CAN) bus is the most widely used protocol for in-vehicle networks, but it lacks security mechanism in design and is susceptible to various attacks. In addition, the on-board diagnostic port (OBD-II) is the physical access point of the CAN bus. However, adversaries can inject messages into the CAN bus through this port, thereby maliciously controlling the vehicle. Aiming at the above problems, this paper proposes a novel authentication and key agreement scheme for in-vehicle networks. Specifically, the proposed scheme considers the issue of secure communication on the CAN bus and the device access issue of the OBD-II port. Static random access memory physical unclonable function (SRAM PUF) is used to perform electronic control unit (ECU) authentication, group key distribution and data frame authentication, ensuring the authenticity of the ECU and the confidentiality and integrity of the data frame. It can also resist replay, physical and other attacks. Besides, we design the authentication and key agreement protocols of external devices in two scenarios respectively to prevent external devices from injecting malicious messages into the CAN bus through the OBD-II port. Finally, we use Scyther and Go language to verify the proposed scheme. The verification results demonstrate that the proposed scheme is not only able to achieve various security goals, but also proves the correctness of its logic. Compared with existing group-based schemes, this scheme has moderate computational and communication overhead overall, but has obvious advantages in key update and authentication of external devices, which can fulfill the low-latency and resource-constrained requirements of in-vehicle networks.},

  abstract     = {In wireless sensor networks, sensor relative localization is a crucial technique. Most of the existing methods utilize ultra-wide band (UWB) ranging signals to obtain internode measurements. However, when the sensor bandwidth is limited, the ranging measurement is of low-precision and leads to poor localization performance. Carrier phase positioning is critical for precise positioning in narrowband positioning systems such as Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) and radio interferometric positioning systems (RIPS). However, carrier phase positioning faces the challenge of unknown carrier phase ambiguity resolution, which is more complicated in sensor cooperative relative localization. To address the problem about the utilization of carrier phase in cooperative relative localization, we propose a carrier phase-based positioning method consisting of a four-stage framework. Firstly, we exploit the low-rank property embedded in matrices at multiple epochs and obtain a rough float estimate of ambiguities via a Gauss-Newton low-rank approximation algorithm. Then the proposed method uses multi-dimensional scaling (MDS) to accomplish the rough estimation of the sensor coordinates in the second stage. In the third stage, the float estimates of ambiguities and sensor coordinates are refined by solving the nonlinear least square problem. Finally, partial ambiguity resolution (PAR) is realized by the LAMBDA method and the fixed solution of sensor coordinates can be obtained. We derive the Cramér-Rao lower bound (CRLB) and utilize numerical simulations to verify that the performance of the refined float solution can reach the Cramér-Rao lower bound (CRLB). This method results in the fixed solution of sensor coordinates obtained by PAR being more precise. Furthermore, the proposed method has robustness to the ambiguity initial error and the carrier phase measurement noise, resulting in the localization performance achieving centimeter-level accuracy in general cases.},

However, several challenges arise in designing this system, including unknown IoT node positions, a non-convex optimization problem, constrained resources, a dynamic environment, and complex resource allocation. We propose using radar estimation rate as the measure for evaluating the UAV sensing performance. We formulate a UAV trajectory optimization problem that aims to maximize the radar estimation rate and minimize the UAV flight time, while adhering to constraints on radar sensing performance, information rate, and sensing all the nodes. However, solving this problem using standard optimization techniques is challenging due to the lack of information about the locations of IoT nodes and the non-convex nature of the problem. To address this challenge, we propose an algorithm by adopting multi-step learning Dueling Double Deep Q-learning network (DDQN) based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to solve this intractable optimization problem. The simulation results demonstrate that our proposed algorithm achieves stable convergence under different constraint thresholds. Furthermore, we verify the superiority of our algorithm by comparing it with other benchmark algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Space-air-ground integrated networks (SAGINs) offer seamless coverage and have emerged as a promising solution for high-speed railway (HSR) communications, which traverse various environments. This paper investigates a SAGIN architecture wherein the low earth orbit (LEO) satellite interfaces with multiple high altitude platforms (HAPs), establishing connections with high-speed trains. Operating such a mobile network requires a coordinated design of both the radio access and backhaul networks. The flows transmitted by the trains are accessed through HAPs and routed by the LEO satellite to reach the destination trains. Our objective is to maximize the number of scheduled flows while satisfying quality of service (QoS) requirements. To address this, we propose a joint transmission scheduling scheme for access and backhaul communications, facilitating multi-hop transmissions in this scenario, thereby enhancing network performance and efficiency. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme outperforms existing schemes in meeting the flow's QoS requirements.},

  abstract     = {As maritime activities increase, the demand for high-speed, low-latency communications and efficient task processing in maritime communication networks (MCNets) intensifies. Currently, sea-surface communications and tasks mainly depend on on-shore base stations, which have limited coverage, and marine satellites, which offer broader reach but cannot provide high-speed connections and are costly. Motivated by the above, we investigate the deployment of air base stations (ABSs) in MCNets to offer flexible coverage and handle maritime-specific tasks. ABS-aided MCNets benefit from the integration of mobile edge computing (MEC) and non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) techniques. Specifically, by optimizing the task offloading and resource allocation, we formulate a total task processing delay minimization problem under the constraints of task time-to-live (TTL) and successive interference cancellation (SIC) decoding threshold. Since the formulated problem is non-convex, we decouple it and solve it iteratively. The channel allocation, power control, offloading ratio, and computation resource allocation are tackled in turn. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme significantly outperforms existing schemes in reducing the total task processing delay. Notably, the incorporation of NOMA markedly enhances the task offloading rate, further decreasing the total task processing delay. The proposed scheme cuts the total task processing delay by at least 7.7% compared to the state-of-the-art schemes and by 40.9% against the local computing benchmark. Additionally, the performance of the proposed scheme, including its complexity, convergence, and the performance loss due to iterative optimization, is analyzed.},

  abstract     = {Advancements in maritime satellite technology have significantly impacted the maritime industry, enhancing both communication and safety at sea. These technological improvements have enabled Automatic Identification Systems (AIS) to transmit data through robust maritime communication networks. However, despite these advancements, AIS data often contain significant missing data due to limitations in both devices and network coverage. To overcome these limitations, this research presents an innovative approach for reconstructing missing points. In this paper, we first extracted the geometric shape and motion characteristics of vessels and constructed a decision tree using an adaptive sparse constraint mechanism to classify four types of vessel trajectories. Then, the vessel classification findings serve as input and the vessel acceleration features are constructed using the heading and velocity features of the trajectories at both ends. Finally, We employ a bidirectional Gate Recurrent Unit (GRU) network to simultaneously train on historical trajectory data. The method progressively shortens the reconstructed trajectory, thereby enhancing the accuracy of the reconstruction. In this paper, comparative experiments are conducted with several algorithms across various dimensions, including algorithm performance, trajectory types, and navigation scenarios. It is indicated by the experimental results that the algorithm discussed in this study outperforms baselines. Significant methodological advancements in vessel trajectory reconstruction are represented by this study, which also shows promising potential for application in intelligent maritime transportation systems.},

  abstract     = {Streaming applications like smart monitoring and real-time data processing are characterized by long data-collecting duration and delay stringent computation. Mobile edge computing can enable mobile devices to execute such applications more smoothly. However, achieving timely completion of streaming applications necessitates processing a flow of computation tasks in an assembly-line fashion, which requires an unprecedented system model and thus needs further study. This work addresses the above concern by investigating a scenario where multiple mobile devices run streaming tasks and offload them to a nearby BS for edge computing through a cooperative node. In this system, the duration of data collection, task offloading and edge computation together with multiuser offloading ratio and bandwidth allocation are jointly optimized to achieve low power consumption of the mobile devices and the cooperative node. The introduction of streaming tasks and cooperation mechanisms turns the task execution into multi-stage process and thus greatly exacerbate the complexity of overall solution. To this end, Dinkelbach method is first utilized for problem transformation. Subsequently, a hybrid approach of block coordinate descent (BCD) and Lagrangian multiplier method is employed to find local optimal solution when the BS has abundant computation capacity and difference of convex algorithm (DCA) is leveraged to attain convergent solution when the BS has finite computation capacity. Finally, numerical results are demonstrated to verify the effectiveness of the proposed methods and offer some insightful results about our proposed strategy.},

  abstract     = {Roadside units (RSUs) with strong sensing abilities enhance the viability of the RSU-to-Everything (R2X) paradigm, offering crucial infrastructure support for Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) that enables real-time data processing and reduced delay. Since RSUs collect a large volume of data but have limited computing capability, data analysis tasks are usually offloaded to other network nodes, such as the cloud, other RSUs, or even vehicles. The multi-hop distributed collaborative task offloading scheme is expected to achieve high resource utilization efficiency and low task delay in this scenario, despite increasing energy consumption in data transmission. However, the highly dynamic nature of the R2X network topology makes it challenging for a node to independently select the next hop and collaboratively allocate tasks to neighbors in a multi-hop transmission path. Specifically, offloading decisions made by an individual node are influenced not only by its immediate neighbors but also by other nodes along the multi-hop path, referred to in this paper as the effect value. Additionally, the heterogeneity in computing resources and link delays among network nodes further increases the difficulty. To address these challenges, we first apply a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model to predict and update the neighbors for each node while considering effect values, allowing them to independently adapt to environmental changes. Then, we design a two-layer Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithm for network nodes to make decisions. The first-layer DRL algorithm is implemented by RSUs to determine task offloading modes. When an RSU decides to offload tasks to multiple vehicles for collaborative computing, the second-layer DRL algorithm is used by a vehicle to select its next hop vehicle and allocate tasks. Simulation results show that our proposed approach effectively adapts to topology changes in complex and highly dynamic network environments. Compared with existing methods, this approach significantly improves task completion ratio and reduces processing delay.},

Thanks to the cooperation among distributed access points, cell-free multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems support the deployment of multistatic radar sensing, while providing high spectral efficiency for data communication services. To this end, in a cell-free MIMO system, distributed access points (APs) communicate over fronthaul links with a central processing unit (CPU) in the cloud. This work proposes four different types of PMN uplink solutions based on cell-free MIMO systems, in which the sensing and decoding functionalities are carried out at either the cloud or the edge. Accordingly, we develop and compare joint cloud-based decoding and sensing (CDCS), hybrid cloud-based decoding and edge-based sensing (CDES), hybrid edge-based decoding and cloud-based sensing (EDCS) and edge-based decoding and sensing (EDES). In all cases, we target a unified design problem formulation for fronthaul quantization to maximize the achievable rate under sensing and fronthaul capacity constraints. Via numerical results, the four implementation scenarios are compared as a function of the available fronthaul resources by highlighting the relative merits of edge- and cloud-based sensing and communications. This study provides guidelines on the optimal functional allocation in fronthaul-constrained networks implementing integrated sensing and communications.},

  abstract     = {The implementation of intelligent driving technology is inseparable from reliable wireless communication and efficient cache scheduling in Vehicle Ad-hoc Networks (VANETs). The purpose of cache scheduling in VANETs is to provide efficient and fast data services to vehicles. In response to difficult to handle wireless communication interference and high requirements for communication delay and energy consumption optimization in vehicle-road cooperation, we propose a new communication model of “Retrieving-Cast” to simplify the cache scheduling process oriented by data requirements. In V2I mode, consider the uplink of all roadside units(RSUs) retrieving data from vehicles, and prioritize data retrieving based on factors such as the number, density, and urgency of vehicles within the communication coverage range of RSUs. We hope that as many high-priority RSUs as possible to complete cached data retrieving as soon as possible under wireless communication interference. To overcome the limitations of traditional heuristic algorithms with low scheduling efficiency and deep learning methods requiring a large amount of training data, we propose a double-$\varepsilon$ online reinforcement learning method, which efficiently solves the cache retrieval scheduling problem. Through experiments and analysis, our method achieved better scheduling results compared to traditional approximation algorithms and single $\varepsilon$-greedy Deep Q-learning methods. The designed data transformation method also addresses the issue of requiring a large amount of training data, enabling rapid computation of scheduling requests in the network at an extremely low training cost, meeting the low-latency computation requirements in VANETs.},

  abstract     = {The recent exponential growth of HTTP video Adaptive Streaming (HAS) services is primarily driven by the increasing popularity of mobile devices, advancements in mobile networks, and wide availability of diverse video content online. Efficient resource allocation in telecommunication networks is becoming increasingly crucial for mobile operators. As networks become more complex, the demand for higher bitrates and increase in traffic continues. To meet the Quality of Experience (QoE) needs of HAS users, emerging wireless networks are incorporating technologies like Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC), Software-Defined Mobile Networks (SDMN), and Cloud Radio Access Networks (C-RAN). This paper studies optimal allocation strategies for radio, storage, and computing resources across a wireless network enabled by MEC, SDMN, and C-RAN to support high-quality adaptive video streams. Video streaming quality can deteriorate when users move between network nodes or when mobile network conditions worsen. A novel MEC Collaborative Cross-Layer Bitrate Allocation (MCCBA) algorithm is introduced to enhance QoE for HAS users by enabling collaboration between MEC servers and RAN components. By addressing a mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem that considers radio resources, MEC server resources, user QoE, system throughput, and RSRP measurements, MCCBA aims to maximize user QoE, improve the system utilization, and minimize discrepancies between throughput at the MAC layer and allocated bitrates for video frames at the application layer. Compared to a baseline scheme, MCCBA improves video quality by 15.97%, minimizes the deviation of the throughput in RAN MAC layer and user's application layer by 43.6% and reduces backhaul traffic by 58.77%.},

Vehicle Edge Computing (VEC) emerges as a promising solution by offloading computational tasks to edge servers positioned near vehicles. However, the limited computing capacity of these edge servers necessitates the efficient allocation of resources to adequately meet the demands of all vehicles. In this paper, we introduce a multi-vehicle VEC offloading framework that considers both the execution time of tasks and the costs incurred when utilizing edge server resources and transmitting tasks between Roadside Units (RSUs). Building on this framework, we design an optimization problem to minimize the average weighted cost, modeled as a Markov Decision Process (MDP). To address this, we propose a DDPG-based Resource Allocation and Offloading Decision Algorithm (DRAODA). This algorithm enables the control center to generate resource allocation strategies while allowing individual vehicles to make task offloading decisions independently, based solely on their own data and the edge server's status, without relying on information from other vehicles. Additionally, we propose an Optimal Task Offloading Destination Selection Algorithm (OTODSA) to further minimize the average weighted cost, enhancing the overall efficiency and effectiveness of the resource allocation process.},

  abstract     = {Federated learning (FL), as a transformative approach in vehicular networks, enables collaborative model training without exposure of vehicle users' local data. However, vehicular FL services are susceptible to Byzantine attacks, since malicious vehicles can upload false local updates to degrade the performance of the global model. Additionally, the honest-but-curious mobile edge computing (MEC) nodes may attempt to extract sensitive information from the shared updates via inference or inversion attacks. In this paper, we propose DRL-PBFL, a privacy-preserving Byzantine-robust FL scheme in vehicular networks that tolerates Byzantine vehicles and the honest-but-curious MEC node during the training process. Specifically, the deep reinforcement learning (DRL) technique is leveraged to maintain the robustness of FL against Byzantine vehicles, and a novel secure aggregation algorithm is designed to prevent curious inferences from the honest-but-curious MEC node. A performance-based weighting aggregation policy optimized by a deep deterministic policy gradients (DDPG) component is also devised to aggregate local updates. As it is challenging to directly integrate weighting aggregation policy with general pseudo-random masking methods for Byzantine resistance, the Lagrange interpolation is utilized to generate local perturbations to defend against the honest-but-curious MEC node and eliminate the weighted perturbations after secure aggregation. Notably, DRL-PBFL effectively achieves Byzantine robustness in FL even though the vehicles' data is not independently and identically distributed (non-IID). Experiments on three benchmark datasets with different adversarial settings show that DRL-PBFL effectively improves the global model accuracy under tailored Byzantine attacks compared with state-of-the-art schemes.},

  abstract     = {We consider the problem of accurately localizing $N$ uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAV) in 3D space where the UAVs are part of a swarm and communicate with each other through orthogonal time-frequency space (OTFS) modulated signals. The OTFS communication system operates in the delay-Doppler domain and can simultaneously provide range and velocity information about the scatterers in the channels at no additional cost. Each receiving UAV estimates the multipath wireless channel on each link formed by the line-of-sight (LoS) transmission and by the single reflections from the remaining $N{-}2$ UAVs. The estimated channel delay profiles are communicated to an edge server to estimate the location and velocity of the UAVs from the relative echo delay (RED) measurements between the LoS and the non-LoS paths. To accurately obtain such estimations, we propose a solution called Turbo Iterative Positioning (TIP), initialized by a belief-propagation approach. Enabling a full cold start (no prior knowledge of initial positions), the belief propagation first provides a map associating each echo to a reflecting UAV. The localization of the $N$ UAVs is then derived by iteratively alternating a gradient descent optimization and a refinement of the association maps between UAVs and echos. Given that the OTFS receivers also acquire the Doppler shifts of each path, the UAV's velocities can be sensed jointly with communication. Our numerical results, obtained also using real-world traces, show how the multipath links are beneficial to achieving very accurate position and velocity for all UAVs, even with a limited delay-Doppler resolution. The robustness of our scheme is proven by its performance approaching the Cramér-Rao bound.},

  abstract     = {Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) has emerged as a critical enabling technology for future communication networks because of its higher spectrum efficiency and lower hardware cost. Considering arrays will possibly be mounted on moving platforms in mobile ISAC scenarios, in this paper, array motion is introduced into monostatic multiple input multiple output (MIMO) radar based on orthogonal frequency division multiplexing ISAC (OFDM-ISAC) waveforms to improve the array aperture. Specifically, a time-frequency dual expansion (TFDE) framework, which exploits the channel state information (CSI) containing the entirety of the motion samplings and subcarrier information, is designed to construct a synthetic virtual array with an expanded aperture. With this TFDE framework, two array configurations are proposed and then analyzed, which can generate more virtual elements than the stationary MlMO array. Subsequently, taking into account the issues of parameter coupling, a reduced-complexity multiple signal classification with two-step decoupling (TSD-RC MUSIC) algorithm is pertinently designed to estimate the direction of arrival (DOA) and time of arrival (TOA) of targets while ensuring high estimation accuracy and low complexity. Numerical simulation verifies the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed TFDE framework and TSD-RC MUSIC algorithm under the proposed array configurations.},

Considering the demands of resource-constrained wireless communications and green communications, power-efficient minimum shift keying-type (MSK-type) signals have also been introduced into uplink ANOMA, but they are only for a basic flat fading channel and perfect conditions. In this paper, an uplink ANOMA based on MSK-type signals with imperfect channel state information and successive interference cancellation over generalized fading channels is proposed, and its ergodic capacity is investigated. Specifically, the system model is first established. Then, a moment generating function (MGF)-based ergodic capacity expression applicable to general fading channels with known MGF is derived. Based on the expression, the integral expressions for the ergodic capacity over Rayleigh and Rician fading channels are exactly derived, respectively, and their closed-form expressions are also provided by exploiting the Gauss-Laguerre method. Further, their expressions with perfect conditions, asymptotic expressions at high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and high SNR slopes are also derived. The accuracy of the expression is verified by numerical and simulation results. It also shows the superiority of the proposed scheme over conventional OMA and ANOMA with linear modulation, and the relationship between system performance and time offsets, imperfect conditions, channel differences, and modulation formats.},

However, the link budget shortage resulting from long propagation length limits the capacity of communications. Distributed beamforming is a solution that provides high power gain by utilizing multiple transmitters simultaneously. This work presents a novel distributed beamforming scheme for LEO satellites direct connectivity services that can provide high power gain for multiple ground UEs with arbitrary locations and numbers. Firstly, an algorithm is designed for static satellites. By selecting satellites from a set of available ones and optimizing the transmit phases of electromagnetic waves on satellites, all the ground UEs can receive power gains improvement. Furthermore, this work considers satellite motions by proposing a fast algorithm that adjusts phases according to changing satellite locations. Finally, a satellite re-selection process is designed to ensure stable power improvement when satellites become unavailable due to their motions. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our design. For four static satellites and 10 UEs, we examine 20 cases with different satellite and UE locations. Results show that UEs receive an average of at least 7 dB power gain in most cases. The condition of four moving satellites is also tested, and results demonstrate that all 10 UEs can have consistent receiving power gain as satellites move quickly.},

Existing and coming wireless networks allowing vehicles connect to terrestrial base stations (BS), autonomous aerial vehicles (AAV), and satellites networks are the key to accomplish this ambitious goal of IoV connectivity. The wireless industry as well as the vehicle leaders are now seeking antenna innovations to support the integration of sub-6 GHz (vehicles-to-AAV), 24 GHz (vehicles-to-BS), and 20/30 GHz (vehicles-to-satellites) networks. Here, we introduce a new triple-band high-gain antenna, which produces the operating frequencies at sub-6, K- and Ka- bands for the first time. The triple-band performance is realized on a shared-aperture configuration by hybridizing a sub-6 GHz Fabry-Perot Cavity antenna (FPCA), a K-band folded reflectarray antenna (FRA) and a Ka-band reflectarray antenna (RA). Three kinds of meta-atoms (MAs) with distinct functions at different frequency bands are used to constitute the respective three functional metasurfaces of the proposed shared-aperture antenna. For demonstration, a prototype is fabricated and measured. The measured effective bandwidths (for the reflection coefficient ≤ −10 dB and the gain variation ≤ 3 dB) are 5.62 to 5.94 GHz, 19.5 to 26 GHz, and 29.5 to 35 GHz with the peak gain of 16 dBi, 27.4 dBi and 30.9 dBi at three bands, respectively.},

Meanwhile, non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) stands out as a key contender for enhancing spectral efficiency and reducing transmission delay. In this paper, we amalgamate the pattern division multiple access (PDMA), recognized as an appealing NOMA scheme, with OTFS, coined as OTFS-PDMA, to leverage the benefits of both technologies and address the low-latency and massive connectivity demands of sixth-generation (6G) networks. Specifically, we first reformulate the input-output relations in the delay-Doppler domain for localized and distributed-mapping-based OTFS-PDMA systems featuring various PDMA pattern allocation schemes. Then, we propose a low-complexity power vector expectation propagation detection algorithm (PV-EPA) for OTFS-PDMA schemes operating in spatially correlated channels. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed OTFS-PDMA scheme offers substantial performance improvements over the conventional OTFS-OMA scheme. For irregular PDMA patterns, localized mapping-based OTFS-PDMA schemes exhibit superior performance relative to their distributed counterparts. Additionally, the proposed PV-EPA receiver shows remarkable robustness against channel correlation and achieves a favorable trade-off between performance and complexity.},

To deal with the proposed nonconvex problem, we adopt the alternating optimization (AO) method to divide the original problem into two subproblems. The first subproblem is related to power/subcarriers allocation, which is equivalently transformed into a Semidefinite Programming (SDP) problem and eventually solved by the penalized convex-concave procedure (PCCP) method. The second subproblem is a quadratic integer problem related to APs mode selection, which is transformed into a convex quadratic integer problem that can be efficiently solved by the convex optimization toolbox. The numerical results demonstrate the tradeoff between the total transmission rate and sensing performance with different parameter configurations.

At the same time, considering the high demands for communication delay in vehicular network scenarios, it is essential to meet the requirements for reliable information transmission in high-speed mobility environments. To address these issues, we propose the Task-Centric Multi-User Semantic Communication (TCMSC) solution, designed to meet the energy consumption and transmission time delay requirements in line with the new paradigm of semantic communication. Our solution introduces a task-centric semantic processing model aimed at improving Semantic Spectral Efficiency (S-SE). The TCMSC solution is tailored for multi-service vehicle scenarios, optimizing power consumption and enhancing reliability, making it well-suited for challenging environments. Moreover, we propose a novel method using Stochastic Network Calculus (SNC) to accurately model semantic task delay and calculate the upper bound of Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) delay-bound violation probability. However, to tackle the increased optimization complexity from SNC while simultaneously enhancing feature extraction, we propose the Transformer Advantage Actor Critic (TR-A2C) algorithm. This algorithm leverages the Transformer to capture dynamic vehicle parameters across scenarios, accelerating the TCMSC solution. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to traditional single-service vehicle dispatch, TCMSC improves delay violation probability by ${2.88\%}$ and reduces power consumption by ${31.1\%}$, all while effectively enhancing S-SE in complex traffic environments.},

The challenges of long-range spectrumprediction stem from the long-time dependencies, intricate nonlinear correlations, and multi-scale characteristics of electromagnetic spectrum data. This paper proposes the Multi-Scale Time Fusion Transformer (MSTFformer) architecture, which not only deeply mines the spectrum occupancy characteristics, but also designs a pyramid attention mask to effectively reduce the computational complexity of the multi-head attention mechanism. The MSTFformer consists of three components, namely the Trend Building Net (TRENDNET), Time Series Encoding Net (TENET), and Pyramid Attention Mechanism Decoding Net (PADNET). The TRENDNET is employed to capture the long-range trend features of electromagnetic spectrum data over varying time lengths. The TENET leverages BiLSTM memory units to enhance the nonlinear attributes of local temporal information and utilizes Gating Propagation (GP) and Gating Residual (GR) components to regulate information flow. The PADNET automatically constructs a multi-scale pyramid to extract correlation information within and between scales, thereby promoting the interaction of cross-scale information, and using pyramid masks to reduce model complexity. Experimental results show that compared with the other ten methods, the MSTFformer ranks third in inference speed, while surpassing the second-best method in prediction accuracy with reductions in MSE, RMSE, and MAE by 71.4%, 43.2%, and 26.6%, respectively.},

A novel data fusion technique is proposed within the MIMO-OFDM system, which promotes cooperative sensing among monostatic joint sensing and communication (JSC) base stations by sharing range-angle maps with a central fusion center. To manage data sharing and control network overhead introduced by cooperation, an excision filter is introduced at each base station. After data fusion, the framework employs a three-step clustering procedure combined with a tracking algorithm to effectively handle point-like and extended targets. Delving into the sensing/communication trade-off, resources such as transmit power, frequency, and time are varied, providing valuable insights into their impact on the overall system performance. Additionally, a sophisticated channel model is proposed, accounting for complex urban propagation scenarios and addressing multipath effects and multiple reflection points for extended targets like vehicles.

  abstract     = {This paper proposes a novel joint weight design scheme for pre/post-coding in multiuser massive multiple-input multiple-output (MU-mMIMO) downlink in time-varying channel environments. It combines Null-Space Expansion (NSE) and Maximum Eigenmode Beamforming (MEB), mainly focusing on user terminals (UTs) with multiple antenna elements. NSE steers additional nulls for interfering UTs using multiple past channel state information (CSI). Since NSE does not predict future channels, it performs excellent interference suppression in high-mobility environments for UTs. However, the limited antenna degrees of freedom (DoF) on the base station (BS) side make it challenging to form nulls effectively for interference suppression in NSE. Therefore, this paper utilizes maximum eigenmode beamforming (MEB). MEB utilizes singular value decomposition (SVD) to form a single stream corresponding to the maximum singular value on the UT side. MEB can supplement the beamforming gain reduction on BS side caused by NSE. Moreover, when a dominant line-of-sight (LoS) component exists in the channel, MEB also performs beamforming for this LoS component on each UT side. Since the LoS component is not highly sensitive to channel fluctuations, the nullification by NSE works more effectively. Computer simulations demonstrate that NSE incorporated with MEB can significantly enhance the Signal-to-Interference-plus-Noise Ratio (SINR) performance compared to conventional channel prediction-based precoding schemes. Its improvement is particularly notable in high-speed UT movement scenarios. This study presents MEB-NSE as an effective solution for stable multiuser spatial multiplexing in mobility environments.},

This paper investigates the performance of UC D-mMIMO systems enabled by a swarm of uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs). Specifically, it presents a comprehensive study on the deployment and trajectory optimization of UAVs as aerial transmission and reception points (TRPs) of D-mMIMO systems, considering systems composed solely of aerial TRPs and those implemented combining aerial and terrestrial TRPs. Moreover, user equipment (UE) mobility is modeled using a discrete-time Markov chain, and a novel approach to heuristically optimize the positions of aerial TRPs is proposed, considering the continuous movement of UEs in the coverage area. The proposed approach optimizes the three-dimensional location of each UAV under a time discretization framework, with the positioning of the UAVs being adjusted periodically, allowing for iterative trajectory optimization to improve the spectral efficiency (SE) performance of the UEs. Simulation results reveal that the proposed UAV trajectory optimization allows for significant SE improvement, especially for a low UE density scenario. Specifically, comparing the proposed method with a fixed position setup, an up to 47.84% increase in average SE is achieved.},

The vertically polarized element (VPE) is composed of a top-loaded metal disk, four bent arms and a round ground, which has a low profile of 0.049λL (λL represents the free space wavelength at the lowest operating frequency) and a broad band of 1.66 GHz to 4 GHz. It is evolved from a mono-conical antenna and eventually achieved an ultra-low profile while remaining the broad band by replacing the complete cone with four metal arms, adding a top-loaded metal disk and grounding structures, and the multiple bents of the four arms. After that, two horizontally polarized elements (HPEs) are meticulously designed and embedded in the ground and the top disk of the VPE, respectively. Benefiting from the low profile VPE, the planar HPEs and the compact embedding scheme, the proposed antenna has a profile of only 0.053λL. To verify the design, a prototype is manufactured and measured. The results indicate that the prototype has overlapping bands of 1.63–2.7 GHz and 3.22–3.82 GHz, gain variation in omnidirectional plane of below 2.4 dB, and isolation between ports of better than 25 dB.},

  abstract     = {Physical layer security (PLS) technique is expected to play a crucial part in the vehicle-to-everything (V2X) networks, by offering secure transmission to protect confidential information from potential eavesdropper. Considering a hybrid active-passive reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs)-enhanced integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system, this paper proposes a novel secure scheme for transmitting confidential information and performing radar sensing, where vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) links share the spectrum resource preoccupied by vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) links. We aim to optimize the sum secrecy rate of V2I links by jointly designing the transmit beamforming of RSU, the radio spectrum reuse scheme of V2X links, and active and passive reflection beamforming of hybrid RIS. With above optimization, the proposed approach can enhance secure communication performance of V2I links while guaranteeing the communication quality of V2V links and target sensing capacity of RSU. Since the system model is dynamic, and it is difficult to handle the nonconvex problem, an efficient hierarchical twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient (HTD3) method is developed to learn the secure beamforming and spectrum sharing strategies against potential eavesdropping. The proposed method decomposes the spectrum allocation into the deep Q-network procedure and designs the secure beamforming variables by employing the TD3 algorithm. Numerical results exhibit that given a sufficient power budget of hybrid RIS, our HTD3-based method enhances both the secure communication performance of V2I links and radar detection capability of RSU compared with the existing learning methods.},

Effective throughput (ET) is employed as the key performance metric in this study to explore the trade-off between the decoding error probability and achievable rate. A mixed-integer non-convex problem is formulated to jointly optimize power allocation, rate control, and user grouping. To tackle this challenge, the achievable ET is approximated using a lower bound, and a decomposition approach is developed to decouple the optimization variables. Specifically, for a given user grouping scheme, an iteration-based concave-convex programming (CCCP) method and an iteration-free lower-bound approximation (LBA) method are proposed for power allocation and rate control. Furthermore, a greedy search-based scheme and a minimum correlation user grouping (MCUG) scheme are designed for the user grouping problem. Simulation results verify the effectiveness of the CCCP and LBA methods in power allocation and rate control and the MCUG method in user grouping when compared to the greedy and random methods.

  abstract     = {In this paper, we provide expressions for the secrecy outage probability (SOP) for suboptimal and optimal opportunistic scheduling schemes in a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) aided single antenna system with multiple eavesdroppers in approximate closed form. A suboptimal scheduling (SS) scheme is analyzed, which is used when the channel state information (CSI) of the eavesdropping links is unavailable, and the optimal scheduling (OS) scheme is also analyzed, which is used when the global CSI is available. For each scheme, we provide a simplified expression for the SOP in the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime to demonstrate its behavior as a function of the key system parameters. At high SNR, the SOP saturates to a constant level which decreases exponentially with the number of RIS elements in the SS scheme and with the product of the number of RIS elements and the number of users in the OS scheme. We also show that the derived SOP of the SS scheme can directly provide the SOP for the best antenna-user pair scheduling scheme in a multiple antenna system. We compare the performance of the opportunistic user scheduling schemes with that of a non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) based scheduling scheme which chooses a pair of users in each time slot for scheduling and we show that the opportunistic schemes outperform the NOMA-based scheme. We also derive a closed-form expression for the SOP of a decode-and-forward (DF) relay-aided scheduling scheme in order to compare it with that of the RIS-aided system. It is found that the RIS-aided system outperforms the relay-aided system when the number of RIS elements is sufficiently large. An increased number of RIS elements is required to outperform the relay-aided system at higher operating frequencies.},

Passive ultra high frequency radio frequency identification (pUHF RFID) based radio tomographic imaging (RTI) emerges as a particularly favorable DFL approach due to its inherent advantages. However, accurately localizing multiple targets remains a challenge for it. To address the challenge, we propose a novel unsupervised link analysis based movement superposition RTI (ULA-MSRTI), including movement superposition RTI (MSRTI) model and the unsupervised link analysis (ULA) scheme. MSRTI models the influence of target movement on wireless signals at every moment. Then, we design the ULA scheme to determine received signal strength (RSS) variations of target-affected links required for MSRTI. Firstly, the scheme adopts statistical analysis to remove wireless links that are mainly affected by noise. Then, we design an adaptive selection algorithm based on density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise to eliminate wireless links affected by burst signals and self-environmental multipath. After that, the scheme matches RSS variations of remaining links with the single-target database to recover RSS variations of target-affected links at one moment. Finally, we input recovered RSS variations into MSRTI to obtain the locations of multiple targets. The experiment shows that ULA-MSRTI's performance improves by an average of over 14.6% compared to other methods, and ULA-MSRTI is the insensitive to the locations of multiple targets.},

Despite the challenges posed by severe path loss and blockage at mmWave bands, this work incorporates reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) into ISAC systems to enhance both sensing and communication. To comply with the waveform utilized in current cellular systems, this paper studies mmWave orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) ISAC systems in the presence of RISs. Specifically, we jointly design the hybrid beamforming and RIS phase shifts to guarantee the sensing functionalities via minimizing the beampattern mean squared error at RIS, subject to signal-to-interference-plus-noise (SINR) and power constraints. The non-convexity of the investigated problem poses a challenge which we address by proposing a solution based on the penalty method and manifold-based alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). Simulation results demonstrate that both sensing and communication capabilities improve when the RIS is adequately designed. In addition, we discuss the tradeoff between sensing and communication.},

Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) signal is a mainstream candidate ISAC waveform. However, there are inter-symbol interference (ISI) and inter-carrier interference (ICI) when the round-trip delay exceeds the cyclic prefix (CP) duration for OFDM signals, which limits the maximum sensing range of ISAC system. When detecting a long-range target, the wide beam inevitably covers the close-range target, of which the echo's power is much larger than that of the long-range target. In order to tackle the above problem, a multiple signal classification (MUSIC) and least squares (LS)-based spatial signal separation method is proposed to separate the echo signals reflected from different targets. Moreover, a coherent compensation-based sensing signal processing method at the receiver is proposed to enhance the signal to interference plus noise power ratio (SINR) of the OFDM block for generating the range-Doppler map (RDM) with higher SINR. Simulation results reveal that the proposed method greatly enhances the SINR of RDM by 10 dB for a target at 500 m compared with two-dimensional fast Fourier transform (2D-FFT) method. Besides, the detection probability is also significantly improved compared to the benchmarking method.},

  abstract     = {An integrated sensing and backscatter communication (ISABC) system is introduced herein. This system features a full-duplex (FD) base station (BS) that seamlessly merges sensing with backscatter communication and supports multiple users. Multiple access (MA) for the user is provided by employing rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA). RSMA, unlike other classical orthogonal and non-orthogonal MA schemes, splits messages into common and private streams. With RSMA, the set of common rate forms can be optimized to reduce interference. Optimized formulas are thus derived for communication rates for users, tags, and the BS's sensing rate, with the primary goal of enhancing the transmission efficiency of the BS. The optimization task involves minimizing the BS's overall transmission power by jointly optimizing the BS's beamforming vectors, the tag reflection coefficients, and user common rates. The alternating optimization method is employed to address this challenge. Concrete solutions are provided for the received beamformers, and semi-definite relaxation and slack-optimization techniques are adopted for transmit beamformers and reflection coefficients, respectively. For example, the proposed RSMA-assisted ISABC system achieves a 84.5% communication rate boost over a non-orthogonal multiple access-assisted ISABC, with only a 24% increase in transmit power, leveraging ten transmit/reception antennas at the BS.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we propose a novel modulation scheme named Sparse Orthogonal Time Frequency Space (S-OTFS), which sparsely maps data symbols in the delay-Doppler (DD) domain. The proposed S-OTFS is designed for use as a secondary user (SU) waveform in an underlay cognitive radio (CR) system. While the primary system divides the entire spectrum into subbands and allocates them to primary users (PUs), the S-OTFS spreads the data symbols across the entire frequency-time (FT) domain, effectively reducing interference power levels to the primary system. To mitigate the interference from PUs at the underlay S-OTFS receiver, we propose modified linear minimum mean square error (M-LMMSE) equalizers in both time and FT domains. To this end, we rigorously derive the necessary statistical properties of the PU's interference as the explicit functions of the PU's subband location. We investigate various sparse patterns for the proposed S-OTFS and demonstrate through simulations that the scattered-type sparse patterns exhibit superior performance compared to the clustered-type sparse patterns. Most importantly, the proposed S-OTFS-based CR system with the scattered-type sparse patterns consistently demonstrates substantially improved performance compared to conventional underlay CR systems where multicarrier code division multiple access (MC-CDMA) is employed for a SU, especially in high-speed mobile environments.},

  abstract     = {A semi-passive reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) enables integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) framework is proposed, where the passive elements is used for communication in the RIS-user links and the active elements are used for sensing in the RIS-target links. By considering general transmit waveforms, the Fisher information matrix (FIM) corresponding to the unknown parameters in the three-dimensional (3D) coordinates is derived. According to the FIM, the Cramér-Rao bound (CRB) for estimating the 3D coordinates can be obtained. Furthermore, by introducing the priori information into the ISAC system, the corresponding FIM and CRB can be derived. Both CRB without the priori information and CRB with the priori information are investigated: 1) For the CRB without prior information, to optimize the objective function, the CRB is converted to an closed-form expression. Since the optimization problem of CRB is non-convex, a semidefinite relaxation based method is proposed to deal with it; 2) For the CRB with prior information, a more trackable modified FIM optimization problem is proposed to transform the complicated CRB minimization problem. Finally, the numerical results demonstrate that: 1) The proposed scheme can effectively improve the sensing performance compared with benchmark schemes; 2) The additional prior angle information can effectively improve the sensing accuracy. 3) As the minimum communication rate increases, the system with prior information has better performance and is more robust than that without prior information.},

  abstract     = {Distributed matrix-vector multiplication plays a key role in numerous computing-intensive applications, including machine learning, by leveraging distributed computing resources known as workers. When workers are wirelessly connected, there is flexibility, enabling efficient resource utilization and scalability of computational tasks. This distributed approach facilitates parallel processing, leading to faster computations and improved performance of machine learning algorithms. However, two key issues arise: stragglers and limited channel resources. In this paper, we propose an approach based on analog coding to not only mitigate stragglers but also leverage over-the-air (OTA) computation. This approach offers scalability without necessitating an increase in bandwidth as the number of workers increases, by taking advantage of the superposition property of radio frequency (RF) signals. This capability addresses the limitations of digital communication-based approaches, where performance is typically constrained by available bandwidth. We derive a closed-form expression for performance in terms of mean squared error (MSE) and compare it with an ideal digital method. Simulation results and comparisons confirm that the proposed analog coding scheme is well-suited to various scenarios with a large number of workers.},

  abstract     = {In reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted systems where the line-of-sight (LoS) path is entirely obstructed, there are the same number of RIS elements as pilot signals. This makes RIS implementation challenging and incurs signaling costs. In addition, there is power consumption due to multiplicative fading resulting from the fact that each RIS element induces two sub-channels. Therefore, a permanent use of the RIS module when not needed can be seen as resource mismanagement. A solution to reduce this cost and power consumption is the use of the RIS technology on-demand (OnD). This offers resource management, cost, and energy efficiency advantages. Reflecting on this situation, in this paper, we analyze a free space optical (FSO) system aided by the OnD RIS technology. We consider that the LoS link can be severely obstructed and its channel significantly degraded. This degradation affects the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the LoS path, $\gamma _{o}$. We set its threshold value, $\gamma _{th}$, which corresponds to the system's triggering point. The analysis considers three main scenarios, namely $\gamma _{o} &gt; \gamma _{th}$, $\gamma _{o} \leq \gamma _{th}$ with total interruption of the LoS link, and $\gamma _{o} \leq \gamma _{th}$ with gradual degradation of the LoS link. For these three scenarios, we define the sub-channel SNRs, derive the end-to-end (e2e) channel statistics, including the probability density functions, cumulative distribution functions, and moment-generating functions, for the LoS link alone, the non-LoS path through the RIS module alone, and the combined LoS and non-LoS paths. Furthermore, we derive, analyze, and evaluate the e2e ergodic channel capacity and average bit error rate, and provide results. We demonstrate that when the LoS link experiences high disturbances, a RIS module can restore the LoS system's performance for a specific time slot. Finally, we show that the RIS can be solicited in an OnD manner to prevent FSO degradation when the weather condition worsens.},

We consider bistatic detection at a passive radar and monostatic detection at the transmitting BS. The radar-mode performance is significantly more vulnerable than the communication-mode due to the double path-loss in the signal component while interferers have direct links. To combat this, we propose: 1) a novel dynamic transmission strategy (DTS) and 2) joint monostatic and bistatic detection via cooperation at the BS. We analyze the performance of monostatic, bistatic and joint detection. We show that bistatic detection with dense deployment of low-cost passive radars offers robustness in detection for farther off targets. Significant improvements in radar-performance can be attained with joint detection in certain scenarios, while using one strategy is beneficial in others. Our results highlight that with DTS we are able to significantly improve quality of radar detection at the cost of quantity. Further, DTS causes some performance deterioration to the communication-mode; however, the gains attained for the radar-mode are much higher. We show that joint detection and DTS together can significantly improve radar performance from a traditional radar-network.},

  abstract     = {Integrating non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) and mobile edge computing (MEC) enables IoT nodes to offload their complicated tasks to MEC servers. Most of the existing resource allocation schemes in NOMA-MEC networks are based on the centralized optimization framework, which may increase the communicational and computational burden on the central unit. In this paper, the NOMA-MEC multi-cell network without the central unit is considered. To minimize the task completion time and offloading cost, a joint optimization problem including sub-channel allocation, transmit power, offloaded proportions, computing frequencies of IoT nodes and MEC servers, and price of MEC resources is investigated. In order to tackle the formulated mixed integer nonlinear programming problem, a two-stage low-complexity distributed algorithm based on the cooperation of all base stations (BSs) is proposed. Specifically, in Stage 1, a distributed heuristic sub-channel allocation algorithm is designed based on the sub-channel gains. In Stage 2, with the obtained sub-channel allocation result, a cooperative distributed continuous variable optimization algorithm is devised based on the distributed optimization and alternating optimization methods. Numerical results demonstrate the convergence of the proposed two-stage algorithm for three interference cases. Besides, the impacts of system parameters and schemes on the network performance are analyzed. More importantly, the resource allocation time can be significantly shortened by employing the cooperation of BSs compared with the centralized algorithm.},

Central to this system is the dynamic adaptability of the BBU pool, which connects to the RRH, allowing real-time adjustments based on shifting usage demands. This flexibility plays a vital role in reducing energy consumption, especially in dynamic and fluctuating network environments. To optimize the architecture's performance, the study addresses the trade-offs between handover frequency, transmission delay, and power consumption by formulating a multi-objective optimization problem. Two resource allocation strategies based on meta-heuristic algorithms are proposed: GARAH and SARAH. GARAH prioritizes minimizing energy consumption and delay time, demonstrating its effectiveness through simulations. SARAH, on the other hand, achieves a balance by maintaining energy efficiency and low latency while reducing handover occurrences. These strategies highlight the potential of the heterogeneous UAV-based C-RAN architecture to foster more sustainable, efficient, and adaptable mobile networks.},

Then we formulate an optimization problem by configuring the number of networks, QoS requirements of flows, and the number of time slots (TSs) in each frame for transmission schedule. To address the problem, we first propose a network selection algorithm to help the airship and BSs select the right MRs, and determine whether the number of TSs occupied by flows can satisfy the QoS requirements. Furthermore, to enhance the number of scheduling flows, we propose a flow scheduling algorithm to optimizing the scheduling order of flows in different networks, and we also consider the flow scheduling when there is no network switching in certain frames. Finally, simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can effectively improve the number of scheduling flows and transmitted bits. We also verify that the proposed algorithm can further improve the system performance with different periods of network switching compared to other algorithms.},

Given the unique nature of UAVs and the broadcast nature of wireless channels, there are significant instances of unregulated flight operations and malicious attacks, making it essential to ensure the security and fairness of spectrum allocation. The previous work on spectrum sharing schemes seldom considers UAV communication scenarios and fails to consider the transaction environment. This paper employs combinatorial auctions and Stackelberg games to study spectrum trading between multiple base stations (BSs) and UAVs to address these issues. A dynamic, demand-driven spectrum trading model is proposed that accounts for UAVs' flexibility and evolving spectrum needs, maximizing utility for both UAVs and BSs. Subsequently, a blockchain-based spectrum sharing framework is designed, in which the blockchain is made public to trading participants to uphold decentralization. It reflects transactional fairness and reliability through mutual evaluations between the blockchain management platform and trading participants. To simulate a realistic trading environment, we consider specific attack scenarios to assess the credibility guarantee of spectrum trading under blockchain. The simulation results validate the effectiveness of the blockchain-based spectrum trading scheme, enhancing spectrum utilization, ensuring the utility of all entities involved, and maintaining the reliability of the trading process.},

  abstract     = {A high-gain duplex antenna with multibeam radiation based on a Fabry–Pérot Cavity (FPC) is proposed in this paper. For the performance, it is the first FPC antenna integrated with duplex and multi-beam radiation. It is the first endeavor to apply a wideband FPC to a duplex antenna with two channels, aiming at significantly enhancing their realized gains and subsequently achieving three switchable directive beams. Firstly, a low-profile duplex slot antenna with two isolated channels (9.4 and 10.7 GHz) is designed. Then, to enhance the realized gains for two channels simultaneously, a wideband FPC with a stepped reflective ground is designed and combined with the proposed duplex slot antenna. The upper ground of the duplex antenna can be reused as the reflector for FPC. Even there three duplex sources on the ground, it will not affect the reflectivity of the wave in FPC due to the relatively small radiation aperture of the slot. By utilizing this method, the experimental results show that the realized gains of two channels are increased to 15.2 and 16.2 dBi, respectively, which are improved by more than 12 dB. Finally, three duplex slot antennas are placed on the bottom of the FPC, and excited individually. For two channels, the H-plane directive beams can be switched at −18°, 0°, and 18° relative to its broadside direction. The proposed antenna is a good candidate for vehicular communications systems such as vehicle-satellite and low-altitude communication where requires low profile, wide coverage range and long-distance data transmission.},

However, the increased vehicles equipped with radars make mutual interferences in automotive radars become an nonnegligible issue. The incoherent interferences between automotive frequency modulated continuous wave (FMCW) radars can significantly increase the noise level, leading to the degeneration of target detection. To address the problem, this article proposes an interference suppression approach based on the Fractional Fourier Transform (FRFT). It is noted that the interference component in the intermediate frequency (IF) signal exhibits chirp-like characteristics, which shows the energy concentration in a FRFT domain. Therefore, the interference component can be easily filtered out in the FRFT domain. Additionally, to decrease the computational cost in the presence of multiple interferences, a two-dimensional (2-D) constant false alarm rate (CFAR) detector is utilized to detect interference components. The proposed approach is also effective in scenarios with a large proportion of interference samples. Both simulations and field experiments demonstrate the performance of the proposed approach.},

  abstract     = {Cellular signals have become a promising candidate for localization due to advantages such as broad coverage and high signal quality, especially in dense urban environments. However, pedestrians, vehicles, and buildings substantially increase non-line-of-sight (NLOS) signal propagation, leading to gradually varying biases in the ranging measurements. Additionally, ranging measurements may contain outliers due to factors such as electromagnetic interference and hardware impairments. The lack of consideration for the statistical differences between these biases has diminished the performance of traditional robust methods. In this paper, we propose a novel bias classification and mitigation filter (BCMF) model for robust localization using cellular signals and apply variational Bayesian inference (VBI) to derive the prediction and update equations for this model. In the proposed filtering model, irrelevant outliers will be mitigated, while the gradually varying bias information will be propagated across time steps, thus improving localization accuracy. We also conduct numerical stability and computational complexity analyses to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed filtering method in engineering applications. Finally, simulation and real-world localization results demonstrate that the proposed filtering method significantly outperforms several state-of-the-art filtering techniques in scenarios where ranging measurements are contaminated by both outliers and NLOS biases.},

Challenges in achieving a robust model span statistical heterogeneity, adaptability, and resilience to noise and cyber-attacks. This study introduces a novel, privacy-preserving robust SOH estimation for heterogeneous batteries using customized federated learning (FL). The approach aggregates local SOH models into a global model while preserving data privacy at the source. It leverages statistical and system utility indicators for battery management system client selection, incorporating the Epsilon-Greedy method to dynamically include new clients and adjust the participant count based on global model efficacy. Additionally, a performance-discrepancy weighted aggregation mechanism is designed by using the L2 distance and loss indices as weights for local models. A discrepancy-based personalization method further refines the number of personalization layers, enhancing local model performance. Through detailed case analysis, the proposed algorithm is shown to surpass conventional FL, centralized, and local training methods across scenarios of varied battery types, data inaccuracies, communication errors, and operational risks, demonstrating superior adaptability and robustness.},

This paper proposes a theory-constrained neural network (TCNN), integrating physical significance without compromising accuracy. A theory-guided filter is applied to ensure the interpretability of each sub-module. Fuel cell temperature and voltage are modeled separately, each serving as an important input for the other. Sub-networks are trained individually under the constraints of the theory-guided filter to minimize the error between the final output and the data. Additionally, a neural network based on the CNN-BiLSTM-MHSA architecture ensures model accuracy. Results show that the proposed neural network significantly improves fitting accuracy for both fuel cell temperature and voltage. The proposed TCNN successfully integrates the theoretical model, improving accuracy by 33.7% compared to the theoretical model and maintaining accuracy comparable to the purely data-driven model. Hydrogen consumption calculated based on this model shows accuracy improvements of 63.7% and 49.4% compared to traditional methods using efficiency curves and hydrogen consumption curves, respectively. The proposed voltage model and temperature model using TCNN enable accurate hydrogen consumption calculations, which can be broadly applied to energy management, component sizing, and other related areas.},

The process is based on a multi-objective optimisation approach which involves many objective functions (mass, rotor inertia, average total losses), constraints (geometrical feasibility, current and voltage limit, torque-speed profile, thermal constraints) and a large number of design variables (rotor, stator and winding parameters) that describe the physical properties of the motor. The design of computer experiments is based on a Low Discrepancy Sequence (LDS).The electric motor performance indices are evaluated through multiphysics simulations (electromagnetic, thermal) carried out by Motor-CAD™ software. Artificial Intelligence (AI) is adopted to approximate the physical model behaviour. Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) are exploited, in this way a large set of design variables combinations can be investigated with a reasonable computational effort. Since the multi-objective optimisation of electric motor is particularly complex, a special algorithm had to be developed to find Pareto-Optimal solutions. A new Adaptive Pareto Algorithm allows to reduce the computational cost and to achieve an even distribution of the optimal solutions in the Pareto optimal front. The algorithm is particularly effective when it is integrated with a global approximation model, the infill operation allows to improve the metamodel approximation. The derived electric motors show the best compromise performances among millions of possible configurations.},

However, traditional dynamic simulation methods for stray currents in CDEGS involve considerable effort in establishing a series of static models. To improve calculation efficiency, this paper proposes a fast, automated method for modeling and simulating dynamic metro stray currents. In this method, the coordinates of the trains are derived based on the mathematical relationship between the metro line topology and the trains' mileage. Then, using a CDEGS script, a series of metro stray current models are generated, incorporating dynamic train operations. The rail potential results are then extracted from the software's output. Based on the rail potential and the operational strategies of the reflux devices, the switching states of these devices are determined and updated through iterative calculations involving rail potential and reflux device resistances. Finally, the simulation results of a series of models are spliced in chronological order to obtain the stray current distribution for the simulated time period. The model is validated by comparing the simulated rail potential data with actual test data. Furthermore, compared to traditional methods, the proposed approach demonstrates a remarkable 98% reduction in manual intervention, confirming its enhanced efficiency.},

Specifically, a round-trip multipath propagation model is established. Firstly, under the assumption of $H_{0}$, the 0-1 non-coherent threshold for noise and multipath is calculated based on the constant false alarm rate (CFAR) detection method. Secondly, the signal and noise in the radar's received echo are separated using this 0-1 threshold, leading to the proposal of a 0-1 non-coherent binary accumulation imaging method. Finally, a two-stage NLOS target positioning method is introduced to address issues of false alarms and missed detections, and simulation and experimental results verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.},

A lightweight resilient formation control framework based on watermarks is proposed to achieve the desired formation configuration without extra monitoring attack status. Since deception attacks are covert, the shared information is watermarked before transmission to establish the protocol among networked AAVs. To facilitate the resilient formation controller design, a decoder is first developed to decipher the inverse transformation of deception attacks, where the watermark is the criterion for approximating the inverse transformation. The Gauss error function is introduced to eliminate some unrealistic input commands under deception attacks, obtaining the predefined input performance. Then, a resilient formation controller is developed to guarantee the global boundedness of all signals within the inner-loop and outer-loop system, while the formation error converges to a small neighborhood of zero by solving the linear matrix inequality. Two challenging deception attack examples in simulations and experiments are conducted to verify the effectiveness and performance of the proposed resilient formation control framework.},

Intermediate decision variables are introduced to enable the high-level RL policy to provide an interaction-aware reference, for guiding low-level model predictive control (MPC) and further enhancing the generalization ability of the proposed framework. By leveraging the structured nature of self-driving at unsignalized intersections, the training problem of the RL policy is modeled as a bilevel curriculum learning task, which is addressed by the proposed Exp3.S-based BiMAB algorithm. It is noteworthy that the training curricula are dynamically adjusted, thereby facilitating the sample efficiency of the RL training process. Comparative experiments are conducted in the high-fidelity CARLA simulator, and the results indicate that our approach achieves superior performance compared to all baseline methods.

  abstract     = {To mitigate the impact of human-driven vehicles (HDVs) on connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) in mixed traffic environments, the implementation of dedicated lanes has been proposed to achieve partial separation between CAVs and HDVs, thereby improving the operational efficiency of both CAVs and the road segment. The lane management policy, where dedicated lanes for HDV (HDLs) and general lanes (GLs) coexist on a road segment, is referred to as the (G, H) policy. This paper proposes a multi-lane fundamental diagram model for mixed traffic flow and aims to investigate the effects of HDL configuration on the efficiency of road segments under the (G, H) policy. Firstly, different car-following modes in mixed traffic flow are analyzed, and various car-following models are employed to characterize the mixed traffic flow. Secondly, two lane selection principles are introduced to describe the lane choice behavior of HDVs under the (G, H) policy. Based on these principles, five equilibrium states that may exist on the road segment under the (G, H) policy are analyzed. Subsequently, a multi-lane fundamental diagram model incorporating HDL is derived based on the lane selection principles of HDV. Finally, numerical analysis is conducted to investigate the influence of lane configuration schemes under the (G, H) policy on the distribution of equilibrium states, fundamental diagram, and capacity. The results indicate that: (1) Based on the lane choice behavior of vehicles, the equilibrium states of road segment can be classified into five types. The distribution of each equilibrium state under different traffic conditions only depends on the proportion of HDL to the total number of lanes on road segment. A higher number of HDL leads to a reduced applicability of the (G, H) policy under different traffic conditions. (2) Under different penetration rates, as density increases, the overall traffic volume of road segment initially increases and then decreases until reaching the critical jammed density. (3) In a three-lane scenario, compared to the absence of HDL, the optimal HDL configuration scheme can increase the traffic volume of road segment by approximately 11%. (4) With HDL deployment, the capacity of road segment initially increases and then decreases with an increase in CAVs penetration rate.},

  abstract     = {Parking in tiny and cluttered slots is a critical challenge for automated parking systems, where the planning module serves as a core component responsible for generating collision-free and kinematically feasible trajectories. However, existing methods face significant limitations, such as geometric-based approaches generating paths rather than trajectories, mass point models failing in tiny berths, and full-dimensional models with large-scale constraints lead to time-intensive computations. To address these issues, this paper proposes an anytime trajectory optimizer for accurately parking an autonomous vehicle in tiny spaces cluttered with obstacles. The proposed method incorporates differentiable collision-avoidance constraints and a trust region strategy to improve computational efficiency. It can also iteratively refine the solution, enabling the optimizer to converge to a new minimum by breaking previous constraints and establishing new ones. Extensive simulations show the proposed method outperforms mainstream planners, effectively handling cluttered environments and tiny parking slots where others fail, or outperforming them in speed when they succeed. It reduces runtime by 90.19% compared to the baseline, while ensuring feasibility and continuous optimization.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a novel approach integrating motion replanning, path tracking and vehicle stability for collision avoidance using nonlinear Model Predictive Contouring Control. Employing torque vectoring capabilities, the proposed controller is able to stabilise the vehicle in evasive manoeuvres at the limit of handling. A nonlinear double-track vehicle model, together with an extended Fiala tyre model, is used to capture the nonlinear coupled longitudinal and lateral dynamics. The optimised control inputs are the steering angle and the four longitudinal wheel forces to minimise the tracking error in safe situations and maximise the vehicle-to-obstacle distance in emergency manoeuvres. These optimised longitudinal forces generate an additional direct yaw moment, enhancing the vehicle's lateral agility and aiding in obstacle avoidance and stability maintenance. The longitudinal tyre forces are constrained using the tyre friction cycle. The proposed controller has been tested on rapid prototyping hardware to prove real-time capability. In a high-fidelity simulation environment validated with experimental data, our proposed approach successfully avoids obstacles and maintains vehicle stability. It outperforms two baseline controllers: one without torque vectoring and another one without collision avoidance prioritisation. Furthermore, we demonstrate the robustness of the proposed approach to vehicle parameter variations, road friction, perception, and localisation errors. The influence of each variation is statistically assessed to evaluate its impact on the performance, providing guidelines for future controller design.},

This article presents a neural network-based adaptive optimized attitude control approach for an FWEPAUV system, considering unmeasurable yaw angular velocity, system uncertainties, and external disturbances. The composite observer and radial basis function neural networks (RBF NNs) are established to estimate the yaw angular velocity, system uncertainties, and disturbances. The estimated signals are then jointly utilized to compensate for the redundant signals in the control channel, thereby enhancing robustness. A composite-observer-actor-critic reinforcement learning architecture is proposed to learn the optimal value function, generate the control torque, and achieve the balance between the control accuracy and cost. The introduced prescribed performance mechanism ensures the smoothness of the FWEPAUV's transient response and the accuracy of the steady-state response while guaranteeing all error signals semi-globally uniformly ultimately bounded (SGUUB).

  abstract     = {In the realm of intelligent transportation systems (ITSs), safeguarding the resilience of connected automated vehicles (CAVs) with vulnerable interactions is imperative, particularly amidst the rapid spread of cyber-attack effects within the system. This paper introduces a pioneering Neural Network-based Cooperative Adaptive Resilient Control (NNCARC) approach that seamlessly integrates adaptive neural networks and resilient control mechanisms to counteract the impacts of nonlinearity, cyber-attacks, and external disturbances. The methodology commences with the development of an adaptive neural network to precisely estimate system nonlinearity, followed by the proposal of a cooperative adaptive resilient control strategy leveraging the Lyapunov theorem for stability analysis and adaptive laws. To the authors’ knowledge, this is the first time that a NNCARC is proposed which ensures all vehicles within a platoon, with any type of network topology, adhere safely to the leader's time-varying profile, without necessitating additional controller switching algorithms in the event of a cyber-attack. By eliminating restrictive assumptions like the Lipschitz condition on nonlinear components, the proposed methodology enhances its versatility and robustness. Theoretical analyses validate system stability and objective achievement, while simulation studies across diverse network topologies, cyber-attack scenarios, and external disturbances substantiate the efficacy of the approach in controlling CAVs within a platoon. This paper constitutes a significant advancement in resilient control methodologies for CAVs, offering a comprehensive solution to mitigate cyber-attack and disturbance effects while ensuring system stability and performance.},

The proposed DRL approach leverages agents to optimize the parameters of a backstepping tracking control strategy, effectively embedding DRL within an established control framework to enhance stability and accelerate convergence. A new backstepping control algorithm incorporating improved barrier Lyapunov functions (BLFs) and variable time headway (VTH) spacing strategy is presented to address state constraints and input saturation while enhancing road utilization in vehicle platoon. The training of RL agents incorporates vehicle trajectories from both natural driving conditions and simulated extreme hazardous scenarios.

However, the existing matching schemes incur high computational overhead, and cannot resist the attack of malicious adversaries. In this paper, we proposed a privacy-preserving matching scheme based on threshold private set intersection, which can protect the location privacy in the malicious model. To reduce computational overhead, we designed a new efficient method for the cardinality test of the route intersection size, based on symmetric-key primitives and a constant number of public-key operations. In addition, our privacy-preserving matching scheme uses geographic indistinguishability to generate virtual points as input sets of privacy-preserving matching scheme, and the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) uses the output of privacy-preserving matching scheme to match the appropriate vehicle for the user. The performance evaluation shows that the proposed scheme is efficient for IoV-enabled ride-sharing services.},

This paper introduces a two-stage method aimed at safeguarding the right of way for CAVs and optimizing traffic efficiency in the scenario. Additionally, A CAV safety controller is developed to effectively handle the challenges posed by HVs violating game rules through continued aggressive lane changes. Simulation experiments demonstrate that compared to conventional game algorithms, the proposed method enhances traffic flow, increases average speeds, and diminishes traffic congestion in this scenario.

Deep reinforcement learning has become a major research focus due to its advantages in data acquisition and interpretability. However, current models often overlook collaboration, which affects not only impacts overall traffic efficiency but also hinders the vehicle's own normal driving in the long run. To address the aforementioned issue, this paper proposes a method named Mix Q-learning for Lane Changing (MQLC) that integrates a hybrid value Q network, taking into account both collective and individual benefits for the greater good. At the collective level, our method coordinates the individual Q and global Q networks by utilizing global information. This enables agents to effectively balance their individual interests with the collective benefit. At the individual level, we integrate a deep learning-based intent recognition module into our observation and enhance the decision network. These changes provide agents with richer decision information and more precise feature extraction for improved lane-changing decisions. This strategy enables the multi-agent system to learn and formulate optimal decision-making strategies effectively. Our MQLC model, through extensive experimental results, impressively outperforms other state-of-the-art multi-agent decision-making methods, effectively improving the overall efficiency.},

Drawing from this highlight, we have designed a multi-sensor fusion scheme to integrate raw data from inertial measurement unit (IMU), underwater transponder positioning (UTP) system, Doppler velocity log (DVL), and depthometer (DM). Additionally, we have developed an IMU reconstruction algorithm to support the navigation scheme validation. This algorithm preserves the complex dynamics of the UUV and the intricate effects of the marine environment, and it inverses the IMU incremental data rather than instantaneous data, making it more aligned with the actual sampling process. Finally, the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed scheme have been verified through semi-physical experiments from the Equator to the North Pole.},

We adopt a dynamic trajectory tracking approach, wherein a subject vehicle (SV), modeled by the nonlinear dynamic bicycle model, must follow the desired dynamics governed by the dynamic lane-change trajectory planning (DLTP) model, for changing lanes efficiently. We design a robust and adaptive Coupled Multiple Sliding Mode Control (CMSMC) law that ensures trajectory tracking despite time-varying disturbances acting on the SV. The controller accepts position and velocity inputs from the neighboring vehicles, through vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication. The design is initially validated for an ideal communication channel that does not drop any data packets. Subsequently, we derive a sufficient condition that ensures the boundedness of the tracking error even when the communication channel exhibits packet drops. Using an appropriate model for packet drops, we derive an upper bound on the packet-transmission interval for each vehicle communicating with the SV, and also outline the associated condition for update of the controller. The DLTP model is validated using real-world field traffic data extracted from NGSIM; and the analytical results are substantiated through numerical computations, and simulations performed on SUMO.

  abstract     = {In connected and automated environments, implementing feedback control on selected key connected and automated vehicles within a platoon can indirectly influence the operation of human-driven vehicles, ultimately optimizing overall traffic efficiency and safety. To enhance global traffic flow through centralized control of essential vehicles, an improved spectral clustering-based pinning control (ISC-PC) strategy is proposed in this paper. The strategy considers communication topology, vehicle individual features and vehicle interactive features to identify key control nodes, targeting them for pinning control to enhance traffic flow. A control algorithm is developed for these pinning vehicles, incorporating communication topology and vehicle dynamics, with a dual focus on safety and efficiency. Furthermore, the proposed ISC-PC strategy is validated through numerical simulations, employing both synthetic and real-world datasets, which include typical noises in traffic flow. Control effects are analyzed and compared under various pinning node identification methods and pinning rates. Experimental results indicate that the ISC-PC strategy is highly effective in reducing traffic oscillations and improving traffic efficiency and safety, underscoring its potential to maximize control effects under constrained control conditions.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we establish a unified mathematical approach that connects the ergodic capacity of a wireless channel to the iterated Laplace transform of the channel's statistical characteristics. Particularly, we show that the ergodic capacity of any wireless channel can be interpreted as the iterated Laplace transform of the complementary cumulative distribution function (CCDF) of the effective channel power gain. Building on this intriguing result, we analyze and exemplify the ergodic capacity of a very general class of wireless channels whose CCDF is expressed in terms of a product of a power function and a Fox $H$-function. Interestingly, the ergodic capacity of such a class of wireless channels can be straightforwardly obtained by means of the iterated Laplace transform, thereby circumventing the task of solving intricate integrals that are typically indispensable to quantifying the ergodic capacity. Furthermore, we extend our iterated Laplace transform approach to analyze and exemplify the ergodic capacity in various communication settings, including diversity combining receivers, double fading channels, mobility, and communication in the presence of co-channel interference. Our approach not only simplifies the evaluation of ergodic capacity across these settings but also provides a novel perspective that underscores its merit across a wide range of applications.},

  abstract     = {The implementation of the partitioned edge learning (PARTEL) framework in practical fast-fading wireless systems with time-varying channels is investigated in this paper. By exploiting the benefit of only training and transmitting a light-size sub-model on devices, PARTEL enjoys both enhanced computation and communication efficiency compared to federated edge learning framework where each device needs to train and transmit all model parameters. In this work, we aim at further enhancing the learning efficiency via minimizing the training latency of each training round in practical fast fading channels, where each round includes multiple channel time-coherence time durations. The challenges arise from the unknown channel state information (CSI) of future durations and the coupling between load balancing and bandwidth allocation among devices. To this end, an equivalent Markov decision process (MDP) problem is derived, where each decision step corresponds to one channel coherence-time duration. The learning load balancing is first determined based on an existing design for static channels by using the expected channel gains. Then, the bandwidth allocation for uploading the local sub-model updates in each duration is sequentially determined by the proposed optimization algorithm. The spectrum efficiency is enhanced since the bandwidth is adaptively allocated to all devices according to their communication and computation statuses in each coherence-time duration. Finally, extensive simulations are conducted to show the superiority of our proposed algorithms over the existing benchmarks. Specifically, the proposed algorithm can reduce the one-round latency by up to 25.51% for the bandwidth of 70 MHz.},

  abstract     = {Several previous works have pointed out that the channel aging effect may severely degrade the performance of wireless systems. This effect may be more pronounced in cell-free networks due to two main reasons. First, designing centralized precoders for cell-free (CF) systems requires the exchange of a large amount of channel state information (CSI) data between access points and a central processing unit, which may cause considerable processing delays. Secondly, the CF architecture requires keeping track of multiple aging channels, since user equipment devices are served by multiple cell sites. In this paper, we consider a CF multiple input multiple output (MIMO) system that uses joint coherence transmission and operates in the presence of channel propagation clustering under high Doppler frequencies. Unlike previous works, which focus on analyzing the impact of channel aging, this paper proposes a Kalman filter-based directional CSI prediction scheme that relies on a set of underlying $P$-th order autoregressive processes that correspond to the active links of the CF system. The extended Kalman filter is chosen with the purpose of predicting the channel path parameters. Using the predicted directional CSI, we design centralized hybrid precoding. Our results indicate that the proposed CSI prediction and precoding schemes outperform related benchmarks schemes and a 3rd order AR process model is a good engineering trade-off between model complexity and CSI prediction performance in practically relevant CF scenarios.},

  abstract     = {Accurate tire capacity information is crucial to maintaining vehicle handling stability and optimizing safety control systems. Tire capacity, which refers to the grip margin of the tire, represents the maximum additional force that a tire can exert under current conditions. It determines whether the vehicle is capable of executing additional steering, braking, and driving maneuvers while ensuring safety. This study proposes a direct tire capacity estimation method, which represents an advance in the field of tire capacity identification method. This method utilizes an end-to-end architecture to train the network, enabling direct utilization of signals from on-board sensors for estimating tire capacity, irrespective of whether the tires operate under pure or combined slip conditions. Additionally, it mitigates the issues of error transfer and accumulation often found in traditional layered estimation methods that overly rely on intermediate states. Outputs from the single-track (2-DOF) vehicle model are integrated as features to enhance the network's learning capability and interpretability. Additionally, a long-short-term memory (LSTM) based network is constructed to capture the nonlinear relationship and address the phase difference between features. The results of the validation and test sets show high identification accuracy, while the cosimulation of real driving scenarios is used for further verification. The results indicate that the proposed method accurately captures tire capacity information during whole tire working regions and exhibits robust generalization ability.},

The existing GNSS-only FDM methods are ineffective in scenarios involving multiple faulty observations due to either their theoretical model limitations or high computational costs. In this paper, a novel GNSS multi-fault detection and correction method is developed that achieves a balance between computational complexity and performance. The proposed method incorporates an Expectation Maximization (EM) framework to jointly estimate an approximate maximum likelihood of states and latent model parameters in the presence of observation outliers, i.e., faults. However, the EM algorithm is known for its high computational complexity. To reduce the computational complexity of EM, an importance sampling step based on unsupervised clustering is introduced. As demonstrated by the results and analysis herein, the proposed method outperforms the existing Least-squares Residuals method, achieving an average improvement of up to 48% in positioning accuracy. Additionally, the computational complexity of the proposed method is an order of magnitude lower than the state-of-the-art Solution Separation method. The method enhances positioning reliability at a lower computational cost and does not require additional infrastructure, hence, can be readily integrated into standalone real-time GNSS applications},

  abstract     = {Network slicing has garnered significant attention within the telecommunications community since the introduction of 5G. However, achieving dynamic and intelligent network slice configuration to accommodate diverse service types remains a critical challenge in advanced network orchestration. With the advent of 6G, which is characterized by its highly dynamic and robust nature, there is an urgent need for an intelligent and slice-compatible assignment approach to meet the evolving demands of next-generation networks. In this context, this work introduces an end-to-end network slicing framework that spans from the user to the Centralized Unit, within a system model incorporating an Open Radio Access Network and Cell-Free massive Multiple-Input Multiple-Output architecture. Our contribution begins with a detailed review of the anticipated 6G Key Performance Indicators and their implications for network slicing. We then propose a novel approach that leverages Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning (MORL) to enable a single intelligent agent to address multiple service requirements through a unified training phase. By replacing multiple specialized agents with a single MORL agent, our approach significantly improves the scalability, reduces the complexity, and enhances the practicality of network slicing orchestration—while maintaining optimal system performance. Numerical results validate the effectiveness of the proposed MORL-based solution. The trained agent not only ensures the Quality of Service for diverse user service requests but also successfully manages the coexistence of conflicting service types. This includes accommodating the stringent requirements of Extremely Reliable and Low-Latency Communications alongside Further-Enhanced Mobile Broadband services within the same network environment.},

  abstract     = {A set of fast optimization-based procedures for the selection of an optimal subset of satellites from those within view of a receiver is provided. Resource limitations, the low marginal utility of using an all-in-view navigation solution, and the need for solution separation procedures in safety-critical navigation systems necessitate the use of a smaller subset from a collection of visible satellites. The goal of the present research is the fast selection of $k$ satellites from among $m$ that are available such that the selection is maximally informative (having minimum covariance measure) of user position. With many GNSS satellites currently deployed and more than four satellites required for integrity monitoring purposes, brute-force search through all $^{m}C_{k}$ options is not a reasonable approach. Satellite geometry and measurement precision are essential metrics in satellite selection; however, much of the literature on this topic has focused on geometry alone. In this work, we jointly account for satellite geometry and measurement precision in a single optimization framework. We present a semidefinite programming (SDP) formulation that considers both geometry and measurement quality. Afterward, we provide a reduction of the SDP form to that of a second-order cone program (SOCP). The SOCP formulation yields significant speed improvements while providing the same solution as the SDP form. Furthermore, we demonstrate exact satellite selection using a mixed-integer SOCP formulation, a first in the literature. Additionally, we show how context-specific constraints for GNSS can be easily incorporated into our selection framework. To illustrate the proposed set of methods, experiments are conducted on real-world multi-constellation GNSS data from GPS, GLONASS, BeiDou, Galileo, and QZSS satellites. For a comparative perspective, we offer an efficient greedy search technique, a genetic algorithm, a globally optimal exhaustive search (where applicable), and an all-in-view strategy.},

Specifically, we build the cell-free RIS-aided ISAC transmission model and then derive a closed-form RIS beamformer to minimize MBMUI.

Our focus is on minimizing task processing delay by jointly optimizing task offloading and the AAV's flight path. This problem can be effectively addressed using the DRL method. However, it necessitates frequent interactions with the environment, which may lead to increased resource consumption and risks associated with some “bad” actions. To mitigate these challenges, our proposed DT comprises a predictive model to anticipate the reward and next stage of the physical environment. Additionally, a generative model is introduced to enhance sample efficiency, with these two models realized by a fully connected neural network and a variational auto-encoder, respectively. Subsequently, we generate a hybrid experience replay buffer to facilitate DRL training, resulting in faster convergence, improved performance, and fewer environmental interactions. Numerical results demonstrate that our proposed method achieves superior delay performance and training efficiency compared to state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract     = {The intrinsic geometric connections between millimeter-wave (mmWave) signals and the propagation environment can be leveraged for simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) in 5G and beyond networks. However, estimated channel parameters that are mismatched to the utilized geometric model can cause the SLAM solution to degrade. In this paper, we propose a robust snapshot radio SLAM algorithm for mixed line-of-sight (LoS) and non-line-of-sight (NLoS) environments that can estimate the unknown user equipment (UE) state, map of the environment as well as the presence of the LoS path. The proposed method can accurately detect outliers and the LoS path, enabling robust estimation in both LoS and NLoS conditions. The proposed method is validated using 60 GHz experimental data, indicating superior performance compared to the state-of-the-art.},

  abstract     = {Efficient task information interaction is the key to unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarm collaboration. However, the driving force of both the spatial-temporal correlation and physical-virtual interaction has not been fully considered in existing works. In this paper, we aim to utilize the advanced digital twin technology to realize the efficient information interaction between the physical and virtual layers for UAV swarm collaboratively performing various tasks. Considering the driving force of both task correlation and transmission timeliness, the physical-virtual interaction link selection problem is formulated under uncertain estimation deviations in the form of interval number. To address this challenging problem, we first utilize the interval optimization for transforming the uncertain utility values to the certain preference orderings in matching theory, and then propose an interval rank-maximal matching algorithm to make predictive link selection based on unilateral preference information. Simulation results confirm that our proposed method can improve the interaction efficiency significantly under uncertainty.},

By leveraging the SWIPT technique, the assistant UAV can simultaneously transmit energy and the computing results during the downlink period. In this scheme, our objective is to maximize the remaining energy among all GEs by jointly optimizing computing task scheduling, UAV transmit and receive beamforming, BS receive beamforming, GEs' transmit power and power splitting ratio for information decoding, time scheduling, and UAV trajectory.

To address the intolerable latency often encountered in long-range maritime communications, this paper proposes a collaborative transmission framework. Unlike traditional wired connections or fixed base stations, we employ an uncrewed surface vehicle (USV) as a mobile fronthaul for cache-enabled buoys deployed along shipping routes. Multiuser multiple-input multiple-output (MU-MIMO) technology is implemented to enhance diversity gain and reduce interference. In this setup, we leverage the tendency of fleet-based marine users to request similar contents, formulating a problem that jointly optimizes the USV trajectory and multicast beamforming to maximize the minimum rate among fleet members. Due to the coupling between trajectory and beamforming in the MIMO rate expression involving matrix inversion and $\log \det (\cdot)$ operations, we propose a trajectory-dependent equivalent rate transformation method, which eliminates the need for a block coordinate descent process. Using the Lagrange dual method, we derive a closed-form solution for buoy network-wide beamforming at each step. Simulations confirm that the USV-enabled wireless fronthaul and collaborative framework significantly reduce transmission latency.},

With the aim of maximizing the covert rate, the FD transmit and receive beamforming, A-IOS refraction and reflection beamforming, NOMA transmit power, and FD jamming power are jointly optimized. To tackle the non-convex covert rate maximization problem subject to the highly coupled system parameters, an alternating optimization algorithm is designed to iteratively solve the decoupled sub-problems of optimizing the system parameters. The optimal solutions for the sub-problems of the NOMA transmit power and FD jamming power optimizations are derived in closed-form. To tackle the rank-one constrained non-convex fractional programming of the A-IOS beamforming and FD beamforming, a penalized Dinkelbach transformation approach is proposed to resort to the optimal solutions via semidefinite programming. Numerical results clarify that the deployment of the A-IOS significantly improves the covert rate compared with the passive-IOS aided uplink NOMA system. It is also found that the proposed scheme provides better covert communication performance with the optimized NOMA transmit power and FD jamming power compared with the benchmark schemes.},

First, based on the pairwise error probability (PEP), novel codebook design criteria have been presented, namely the hybrid minimum product distance of the Euclidean distance (MPD-ED) and the minimum Euclidean distance of the superimposed constellation at each frequency element (MED-FE). Then, enhanced mother constellations (MC) are proposed by maximizing the MPD-ED of the MC based on the alternating optimization. Subsequently, the multi-dimensional codebooks are obtained by applying user-specific rotation of the proposed MC to maximize the MED-FE, where the unitary rotations are considered to fully leverage the Euclidean space of the transmit antennas while maintaining the MPD-ED value of the codebook.

To address the challenges, we first consider the perfect wiretap CSIT and approximate the reformulated problem as a smooth problem. Then, we derive the first-order optimality condition and interpret it as a nonlinear eigenvalue problem. Finally, we adopt a power iteration method to solve the condition. To extend the algorithm to the partial wiretap CSIT scenario, we reformulate the problem with an average wiretap rate by deriving an approximate lower bound of the rate. This enables us to exploit the partial channel knowledge. Subsequently, we propose the algorithm for the partial wiretap CSIT. Simulations validate the proposed methods.},

  abstract     = {Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) is a promising solution to mitigate the increasing congestion of the wireless spectrum. In this paper, we investigate the short packet communication regime within an ISAC system assisted by a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) to meet the low latency ultra-reliable requirements in the next-generation wireless networks. We consider a non-ideal RIS model that captures effects of the phase-dependent amplitude variations in the reflection coefficients, and we have incorporated the near-field model into the channels between the RIS and the users or targets. In this setup, we jointly design the transmit beamforming and the RIS phase shifts to maximize the sum rate while satisfying the sensing signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) requirement. The system simultaneously carries out multitarget sensing and multi-user short packet communications with the help of the RIS. Considering the non-convex and dynamic nature of the resulting optimization problem, we propose an asynchronous advantage actor-critic (A3C) based method for beamforming and reflection design in this setup. Numerical results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed scheme over the benchmarks.},

We adopt a hierarchical framework based on Stackelberg game to model the interactions between legitimate users and the hybrid attacker. Furthermore, we model the optimization problem as a many-to-one matching problem with externalities, and propose two swap-based resource allocation algorithms, aiming to maximize the overall SS-R and meet fairness awareness. The two proposed algorithms are able to guide the iteration properly based on the dynamic of attack behaviors, which improves the secure resource allocation efficiency.

To this end, we formulate a problem to maximize the average secrecy rate (ASR) of the BD by jointly optimizing its power reflection coefficient (PRC) and two key parameters of Wyner's encoder, i.e., the rate of the transmitted codewords (TC) and the rate of the confidential information (CI), subject to constraints on the S2OP and the successful decoding probability (SDP) of the BD's information. We first determine the optimal rate of TC and then derive closed-form expressions of the S2OP and SDP, based on which the optimal PRC is obtained and a locally optimal rate of CI is attained by a projected gradient descent method. Simulations verify our analytical results and reveal the impact of S2OP on the ASR of WPBC.},

Existing RIS-assisted PHY SKG studies mainly focus on improving the SKR by optimizing RIS phase. However, RIS can also be exploited by active attackers to contaminate the channel probing. As a result, there is a trade-off between the increased randomness and the improved correlation between legitimate channels and eavesdropping channels in a RIS-assisted SKG system under channel contamination. In this paper, we study the impact of RIS on PHY SKG by analyzing the SKR performance. A closed-form expression for the lower-bound of secret key capacity is obtained. Theoretical analysis shows that gains of legitimate channel, eavesdropping channel, and RIS-induced channels are key parameters in determining whether the assisting RIS is beneficial or harmful to the PHY SKG. Further, a SKR maximization problem under channel contamination is proposed and solved. Results show that the assisting RIS is definitely harmful to the SKG when the gain ratio of legitimate channel and eavesdropping channel is reduced with the leverage of RIS, while it can significantly improve the SKR with an optimized RIS phase when the gain ratio is improved with the help of RIS.},

We utilize waveguide slot antennas to generate four different modes of these novel OAM beams at X-band frequency. These different OAM-mode beams are used to illuminate metallic target, and the resulting RCS is compared with that obtained using plane waves. The findings reveal that the novel OAM beams produce significant azimuthal RCS diversity, providing a new approach for the detection of weak and small targets.

The integration of RIS into cell-free networks, termed RIS-aided cell-free networks, offers the potential to significantly enhance network performance. However, the realization of this potential is constrained by the limited capacities of the fronthaul links. To address this challenge, we investigate the joint design of access point (AP) clustering, transmit and passive beamforming in RIS-aided cell-free networks. The objective is to maximize the weighted sum-rate performance while minimizing the number of clustered APs to alleviate the fronthaul overhead. The problem is formulated in a group sparse manner, employing a mixed zero-norm/two-norm term to represent the number of the clustered APs. To solve this problem, we first approximate the mixed zero-norm/two-norm term by the mixed one-norm/two-norm term and provide its equivalent formulation by introducing receive beamforming vectors and weight parameters. Then, an iterative method is proposed based on the block coordinate descent (BCD) technique, which is guaranteed to converge to a stationary point.

Numerical results demonstrate that compared to the state-of-the-art method on fronthaul signaling minimization, our approach can save up to 94% of the fronthaul signaling load and 83% of the CPU processing power at the cost of only up to 8.6% spectral efficiency loss, or no loss in some cases.},

  abstract     = {This correspondence investigates a multi-user covert communication system, where active flying and ground wardens co-exist. Considering covertness requirement, the position uncertainty, finite observation and active jamming constraints for the multiple wardens, a general three-dimensional dynamic optimization framework assisted by unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is formulated to maximize the minimum average covert rate (MACR). Firstly, the effects of active jamming and covertness contraints on transmission rate are analyzed. Then, slack variables are introduced to equivalently transform the nonconvex problem. Besides, an iterative algorithm is proposed, which can optimize 3D trajectory, power and bandwidth allocation ratio simultaneously, based on S-proceduce and successive convex approximation (SCA). Simulation results reveal that the proposed algorithm can enhance the MACR significantly while the constraints being satisfied compared to the baseline algorithms.},

On the other hand, rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) scheme can effectively manage interference in a multi-user setup. In this context, we study the synergistic advantages of these technologies in a robust UAV-integrated A-STAR-RIS RSMA network, deployed in remote and disaster-stricken areas. Specifically, we consider practical impediments such as co-channel interference, hardware impairments, and imperfect successive interference cancellation. We derive accurate expressions for outage probability (OP) and throughput in both delay-limited and delay-tolerant modes over Nakagami-$m$ fading channels. Further, we obtain asymptotic OP expressions to determine the achievable diversity order. We introduce a deep neural network framework that efficiently estimates the complex OP and ergodic sum rate with rapid execution. Our simulations validate these results and demonstrate the network's advantages over traditional relaying systems.},

  abstract     = {Low-Earth orbit (LEO) satellite communication is poised to be a key enabler in the burgeoning 6G era. However, the emergence of unauthorized LEO satellite user terminals (LSUTs) poses significant threats to communication security, creating an urgent need for effective LSUT surveillance. Nevertheless, LSUT surveillance is challenging since the transmit beamforming of LSUT leads to the highly directional uplink beam, which complicates the reception of high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) signals necessary for accurate geolocation and monitoring by surveillance equipment. To handle the above issues, we develop a dual-grained recursive Bayesian filtering scheme for unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-enabled spectrum surveillance. Specifically, we construct an LSUT uplink signal detection probability map, enabling a coarse-grained search to identify the surveillance region of interest (SROI). This procedure enhances the SNRs of received signals and improves the initialization of LSUT monitoring. Furthermore, we propose a particle filter with beam motion mode tracker for fine-grained monitoring, which facilitates accurate geolocation and robust monitoring despite dynamic beam pointing direction and satellite handovers. Numerical results demonstrate that our dual-grained trajectory planning approach significantly benefits LSUT surveillance, yielding superior cumulative detection probability, monitoring accuracy, SNRs of received signals, and geolocation accuracy.},

The system comprises a base station (BS) equipped with multiple FAs that transmit signals to an energy receiver (ER) and an information receiver (IR), both equipped with a single FA. Our objective is to maximize the communication rate between the BS and the IR while satisfying the harvested power requirement of the ER.

To address this complex convex optimization problem, we employ an alternating optimization (AO) approach, decomposing it into three sub-problems and solving them iteratively using first and second-order Taylor expansions.

In this system, a central processor (CP) is connected to multiple base stations (BSs) via capacity-limited fronthaul links to perform cooperative communication and sensing. To meet the capacity limitation, we employ a compressed forward relaying strategy and formulate a joint FCPA (J-FCPA) optimization problem to minimize the transmit power subject to the fronthaul capacity limit, the signal-to-interference-compression-noise-ratio (SICNR) requirements of communication, and the Cramér-Rao lower bound (CRLB) constraint for target sensing. Due to the non-convexity and the large number of constraints, the problem is challenging to solve. To tackle it, we first analyze the optimal compression noise levels and derive their closed-form expressions. Based on these findings, we can significantly reduce the number of constraints, achieving a simplified problem. By demonstrating that the CRLB constraint admits a difference-of-convex (DC) form, we further attain a convex approximation of the simplified one. Finally, following the idea of successive convex approximation (SCA), we develop an efficient J-FCPA algorithm by solving the approximate problem successively. Simulation results validate that our proposed design can effectively save power compared to the state-of-the-art benchmarks.},

In near-field conditions, channels exhibit a diffusion phenomenon in the angular domain, existing research indicates that this phenomenon can be leveraged for efficient parameter estimation and beam training. However, the channel model in angular domain lacks closed-form analysis, making the time complexity of the corresponding algorithm high. To address this issue, this paper analyzes the near-field diffusion effect in the wave-number domain, where the wave-number domain can be viewed as the continuous form of the angular domain. A closed-form approximate wave-number domain expression is proposed, based on the Principle of Stationary Phase. Subsequently, we derive a simplified expression for the case where the user's distance is much larger than the array aperture, which is more concise. Subsequently, we verify the accuracy of the proposed approximate expression through simulations and demonstrate its effectiveness using a beam training example. Results indicate that the beam training scheme, improved by the wave-number domain approximation model, can effectively estimate near-field user parameters and perform beam training using far-field DFT codebooks. Moreover, its performance surpasses that of existing DFT codebook-based beam training methods.},

To counter DoS attacks, we propose a resilient control scheme that exploits polytopic overapproximations of the closed-loop dynamics under DoS attacks. This scheme allows synthesizing robust controllers that guarantee tracking of both the desired spacing policy and spatially varying reference velocity under all space-varying DoS attacks within a hard upper bound on the attack duration. In addition, $\mathcal {L}_{2}$ string stability conditions are derived to ensure that external perturbations do not grow as they propagate through the platoon, thus ensuring the string stability.

In this work, we propose a distributed power control scheme based on the combination of the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm and the successive convex approximation (SCA) algorithm. With the aim of maximizing energy efficiency, the original problem is decomposed into multiple convex subproblems through SCA, and the distributed optimization of ADMM is used to solve each subproblem, thus making the solution of the problem more efficient. In particular, a dynamic penalty coefficient strategy is also developed to improve the convergence performance of the distributed algorithm. The simulation results demonstrate that compared with centralized power control methods, the proposed method can achieve similar optimal values and effectively distribute the computational load to each device, which can support the optimization design and implementation of future D2D communication systems.},

Within this context, a data-driven method based on time-frequency feature maps and spatial-temporal neural networks is proposed for state-of-health estimation and cycle-to-knee prediction. First, raw data is acquired from partial charging curves of different fast-charging protocols to better align with real-world application scenarios. Second, to make full use of frequency domain information, the time-frequency feature maps are generated through continuous wavelet transformation. Then, spatial-temporal information is mapped to battery state-of-health and cycle-to-knee through a convolutional neural network and bidirectional long short-term memory network sequentially. The fusion of spatial-temporal features and the organization done by the attention mechanism contribute to improving battery PHM accuracy. Finally, experiments conducted on LFP/graphite A123 batteries under different fast-charging protocols indicate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method. In addition, the ablation experiments are carried out to demonstrate the necessity of each model component. Experimental results show that using time-frequency feature images significantly enhances accuracy, and each component plays a pivotal role in enhancing the overall performance.},

The Nash Bargaining Solution (NBS) from the cooperative game theory has been one of the fair and optimal resource management solutions for multiple users. However, the computational complexity required to find the NBS for general utility functions exponentially increases either as the number of users increases or as the resources change over time. This is because the size of bargaining sets where the NBS should be found changes. In this paper, we propose an algorithm to reduce the size of the search spaces by considering the adjacent bargaining sets correlated by resource changes. We use the axiom of independence of linear transformations in NBS for the linear approximation of NBS in the adjacent bargaining sets based on its linear transform, leading to reduced residual search space. Moreover, we prove that the NBS is always included in the reduced residual search space based on the axiom of independence of irrelevant alternatives in NBS. Through simulations and experiments on synthetic and real traffic data, we demonstrate that the complexity of existing algorithms for NBS is lowered with the reduced residual search spaces.},

In this paper, we formulate a joint optimization problem of the cooperative IV selection, compression ratio selection, transmit power control, task offloading decision and computation allocation to minimize the end-to-end delay consisting of compression, transmission and computation. In particular, to meet the perception probability requirement, the quality and quantity-aware matching algorithm is proposed to optimize the cooperative IV selection. To guarantee the queue stability of offloading tasks, we develop the Lyapunov optimization algorithm to determine the upper bound of the offloading tasks and the corresponding optimal computation allocation. The Lyapunov aided deep reinforcement learning algorithm is further proposed to dynamically adjust the task offloading decision and compression ratio selection to minimize the end-to-end delay with the transmit power control being optimized by the successive convex approximation algorithm.

However, to support many-to-one transmission in UCN, the densely deployed BSs need to repeatedly acquire files from the core network via backhaul links, which further lead to tremendous backhaul traffic on existing UCN. In order to alleviate the backhaul traffic pressure in UCN, in this paper, we propose to deploy cache at BSs in UCN and investigate the performance of such cache-enabled UCN from a stochastic geometry perspective. To measure the network backhaul traffic offloading performance, we define a Universal Offloading Probability of Backhaul (UOPB) metric with deriving the coverage probability expression by stochastic geometry tools. Then, a UOPB maximization problem is formulated with respect to file caching probabilities to approach an optimal backhaul traffic offloading performance. By mining the monotonicity of the formulated problem, we develop an optimal polyblock outer approximation-based caching optimization algorithm with exponential complexity and a suboptimal stepwise adjustment caching optimization algorithm with lower polynomial complexity. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed algorithms could bring up to 22% performance gains in terms of UOPB compared with reference caching schemes.},

  abstract     = {Mobile edge computing (MEC) provides stable and powerful computing services, and vehicle computing provides rich sensing services. Therefore, we develop vehicle-assisted mobile edge computing (VAMEC), integrating MEC and vehicle computing to maximize their advantages and broaden their applications. We address the resource allocation and pricing problem in VAMEC, in which the vehicle, as a resource provider, collaborates with the MEC servers to provide services to users. To enable MEC servers and vehicles to work in cooperation, we propose a mixed auction model that consists of two-step auctions: the first one-way auction and the second double auction. We consider three types of users based on their characteristics, where users participate in different auctions depending on the types. Users and vehicles are self-interested and may submit untrue values to harm the system's profits. Therefore, we propose the overall truthfulness for the mixed auction model, that is users or vehicles that cannot obtain higher utility by declaring untrue values regardless of which auction they participate in. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study proposing the overall truthfulness and showing how to design the mechanism that achieves it. We then propose an overall truthfulness mechanism and show it achieves individual rationality, budget balance, and consumer sovereignty. Simulation results indicate that the proposed mechanism can increase social welfare by at least 24%, compared with other mechanisms.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have proven their effectiveness in surveillance due to their superior mobility. By utilizing multiple UAVs with collaborated learning, surveillance of a huge area while consuming minimum resources is possible. However, the performance of UAV collaborative learning systems is still severely limited because the number of parameters in a classical NN is generally very large, which is unsuitable for unstable wireless communication. To address this issue, this paper uses a quantum neural network (QNN), which has large computational capabilities and uses fewer parameters to overcome the problems caused by many parameters. However, it is still difficult to send all the parameters of the QNN to the server under poor channel conditions. Therefore, this paper proposes dynamic quantum federated learning (DQFL), a novel framework designed for UAVs employing quantum computing (QC) and federated learning (FL). The proposed DQFL uses a dynamic quantum neural network (DQNN) with a multi-depth circuit and employs dynamic control of the circuit layer to improve the efficiency of local parameter transmission between UAVs in unstable wireless communication environments. Extensive simulations conducted under real-world autonomous surveillance conditions demonstrate the robustness of DQFL to non-iidness, varying signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs), and poor communication channel conditions in the UAV environment.},

To provide users with dependable services, VECONs need to offer efficient and secure task offloading services. Unfortunately, little effort has been put into addressing security issues such as the risk of privacy exposure when offloading data. Modeling and optimizing offloading dependability are affected by these issues. To address these concerns, a dependable three-layer offloading framework involving blockchain technology is presented in this paper, with fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) algorithm incorporated in order to mitigate privacy exposure risks. The framework divides tasks reasonably and introduces a novel measure of offloading dependability called cost from energy consumption, delay, and privacy exposure risk (cEDP) for constructing dependable offloading optimization. Additionally, a self-learning based dependable privacy preservation offloading (SDPPO) algorithm is presented that is capable of solving the optimal offloading problem in a decentralized manner. Simulation results show that the SDPPO algorithm outperforms its counterparts in terms of faster convergence speed, better cEDP convergence results, and improved scalability and tunability characteristics.},

The rapid development of maritime Internet of Things (IoT) and growing demand for these applications have led to an increasing number of computation-intensive and resource-sensitive tasks. Considering the limited computing capacity and energy of MWDs, it is challenging to transmit and process massive maritime computing tasks in an energy efficient manner. In this paper, we propose a three-tier maritime edge computing system in which low earth orbit (LEO) satellite and offshore base station (OBS) support to provide communication and computing services for MWDs. The system optimizes association variable, task partitioning, transmission power, and computing resource allocation to reduce system energy consumption under latency constraints. The optimization problem is formulated as a mixed integer non-linear programming (MINLP) optimization problem. We decompose the original problem into four subproblems and design algorithms to solve them. Firstly, the association variable optimization subproblem is solved by slack variable method. Then, we adopt quadratic transformation and design a difference of convex algorithm to solve transmission power optimization subproblem. Further, task partitioning subproblem is solved by obtaining upper and lower bounds of offloading task size by strict deduction, and then solved by the standard convex method. Finally, Lagrangian dual method is utilized to deal with joint computing resource optimization subproblem of LEO satellite and OBS. In simulation results, the proposed algorithm saves 39.3% of system energy consumption compared to benchmark schemes.},

  abstract     = {To realize a ubiquitous communication environment, network providers are currently attaching great importance to wireless backhaul options for the dense deployment of network nodes in urban areas. However, the increase in hop count due to wireless backhaul results in higher multi-hop delays. Network providers need an efficient UE association strategy to minimize multi-hop delays, considering the demand for future low-latency network services. To this end, we consider realistic TDMA frame configuration for downward integrated access and backhaul (IAB) communication and formulate the problem of end-to-end (E2E) delay minimization for UE association. To reduce the complexity of the problem, we apply a piecewise linear function to approximate the queueing delay part and consider an approximate optimization-based scheme (AOPT), which can be computed offline, as a reference scheme. To make the problem solvable online, we simplify the problem and propose a Delay-based user Association Control Scheme, termed DACS, that adaptively enables peak delay minimization by avoiding congested links and selecting routing paths with fewer hops for user association. DACS shows comparable performance to AOPT and outperforms other comparison schemes in terms of the 98th percentile E2E tail delay, helping each user experience acceptable low-latency services.},

In this paper, we propose an edge-driven industrial computing power network (CPN) by orchestrating the computing and network resources of edge servers through the centralized resource scheduling and decentralized task computing. However, efficient task offloading and collaborative processing is challenging, which requires higher degrees of network automation and intelligence. Therefore, we incorporate digital twins (DTs) into the edge-driven CPN architecture, where the DTs are created as the digital replicas to assist both the computation offloading and collaborative processing. A joint optimization problem of the computing power assignment, service association, task partition, and transmit power control is formulated for maximizing the system average weighted utility. Due to the temporal-spatial variability of tasks and the resulted dynamic environment, we transform the original problem as a Markov decision process aiming at maximizing the long-term average weighted utility. To efficiently handle the high-dimensional discrete-continuous action space, a hybrid soft actor-critic based deep reinforcement learning algorithm is developed for optimizing the joint design. Simulation results validate the superiority of our proposed algorithm over the benchmarks, showing the significant gains obtained by integrating DTs into the edge-driven CPN.},

Most existing task assignment mechanisms have assumed the availability of just a single service platform and without considering the preference of users and platforms. In this paper, we focus on studying how to design efficient task assignment mechanism when there are multiple service platforms in the MCS system and further the preferences of both users and platforms are considered while the sensing quality of each user is unknown in advance. The design objective is to maximize the overall sensing qualities of all completed tasks while respecting the budget constraint of each platform. We build a multi-platform oriented task assignment framework and formulate the problem under study as a 0-1 integer linear programming (ILP) problem. We propose a Multi-platform Stable Task Assignment mechanism (MSTA). MSTA works in a round by round manner. In each round, MSTA first performs budget splitting among different task locations for each platform, then makes stable matching between users and platforms and performs online learning of users' sensing qualities by using the multi-armed bandit (MAB) model. We deduce the time complexity of MSTA and prove that MSTA has the properties of stability, individual rationality, budget feasibility, and truthfulness. Simulation results demonstrate the high performance of the proposed MSTA mechanism.},

This emerging paradigm offers flexible edge resource management for Internet Service Providers (ISPs) and improves service satisfaction of diverse applications. However, a critical challenge lies in processing extremely unpredictable and bursty traffic flow, especially in event-trigger sensing tasks. In this paper, we study queue-aware service migration and resource allocation in an MEC network, where different devices with different arrival patterns request different network services. To this end, we first formulate a novel long-term operation cost minimization problem subject to the stability of multiple queues by adopting a simultaneous migration scheme and determining resource allocation dynamically. To address the problem efficiently, we propose an online control framework to make decisions without any prior system information. We first adopt the Lyapunov optimization technique to decompose the long-term optimization problem into multi-per-slot subproblems. Then, we adopt a decoupled optimization algorithm based on the coordinate descent method and augmented Lagrangian method to solve the offline mixed integer non-linear programming (MINLP) subproblems.

However, delivering these services within Vehicular Named Data Networking (VNDN) environments presents significant challenges, primarily due to the data broadcast phenomenon and the varying Quality of Service (QoS) requirements of different applications. This paper introduces an adaptive data forwarding scheme designed to effectively manage these challenges and optimize the delivery of infotainment services in VNDN. Our proposed scheme enhances the data packet format by incorporating additional attributes that prioritize data based on its criticality, specifically categorizing it into critical, non-critical, and entertainment data. Furthermore, we introduce an Enhanced Weighted Fair Queuing (EWFQ) policy to optimize the scheduling of data packets according to their importance. Two innovative data forwarding schemes, namely Advanced Push-based Data Forwarding (APDF) and Enhanced Pull-based Data Forwarding (EPDF), are developed to address the needs of critical and non-critical information and entertainment data, respectively. Simulation results demonstrate that our adaptive data forwarding scheme significantly outperforms legacy fragment schemes in delivering infotainment data within dynamic VNDN environments, ensuring reliability and efficiency.

  abstract     = {Federated learning on vehicles has been widely considered in autonomous driving. The model uploading of federated learning is time-consuming, which motivates the transmission optimization that exploits the mobility of vehicles. In this paper, an optimization framework integrated with the high-fidelity traffic simulator CARLA, namely FedCars, is proposed for the scheduling of model uploading in a Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) network. Specifically, a group of data collection vehicles (DCVs) move along their planned routes with random velocities to collect data and train a model via federated learning, where the uplink transmission of multiple DCVs is jointly optimized. We first develop the FedCars simulator to obtain a high-fidelity trajectory dataset of DCVs in the considered traffic scenario, and train the transition probabilities of DCVs' locations. Hence, the uplink transmission time and power of all DCVs can be formulated as a finite-horizon Markov Decision Process (MDP), where the prediction of DCVs' future locations is exploited to minimize a weighted sum of the average model uploading time and energy consumption. A low-complexity FedCars optimizer with a non-trivial performance bound is then proposed, where the optimization consists of global transmission time and local power allocation. Since the former periodically allocates the transmission time for the remaining time slots, the power allocation of all DCVs can be decoupled into local finite-horizon MDPs which can be solved with low computational complexity. The simulation results show that the proposed solution framework can achieve both a significant performance gain over the baselines and a flexible trade-off between performance and complexity.},

  abstract     = {Mobile edge computing (MEC) has increasingly been propelled into the spotlight as a promising paradigm to address the growing demand for latency-sensitive mobile applications. The practical challenges associated with deploying and maintaining traditional edge service devices highlight the attraction of leveraging end devices as edge servers. Yet, the inherent mobility and power constraints of such servers make them prone to failure. As an effective strategy, some edge servers are earmarked to mitigate probable failure, which may cause resource redundancy. In this paper, a novel partial resource reservation scheme is proposed to diminish this waste, each edge server in system reserves a part of their resources to defend probable failure. The approach directs reservation actions towards the individual resources, rather than the entirety of edge servers. Given that edge servers serve as key participants within the system, it is imperative to optimize overall income by carefully balancing incurred costs and generated benefits. We investigate this partial resource reservation problem from the perspective of edge servers, and transform it into Markov decision process (MDP). A scheme that fomulates strategies for edge servers then been proposed, called Q-learning-based resource reservation (QLRR), which can accommodate the dynamic nature of edge server failure. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our proposed scheme outperforms existing benchmark schemes, significantly enhancing the income of edge servers.},

  abstract     = {Satellite-terrestrial spectrum sharing is an effective method to alleviate the scarcity of spectrum resources. However, with the dense deployment of terrestrial systems, the satellite downlink beam covers multiple terrestrial base stations (BSs) and interacts with terrestrial downlinks during spectrum sharing. The spectrum sharing users encounter co-channel interference of inter-system, inter-cell and intra-cell, posing significant challenges for downlink spectrum sharing in converged system. In this paper, we propose a cooperative multichannel spectrum sharing framework where the multiple terrestrial BSs downlinks share multichannel spectrum resources of low earth orbit (LEO) satellite while guaranteeing the rate requirements of all shared users and aiming at improving spectrum efficiency of converged system. We formulate the cooperative satellite-terrestrial spectrum sharing strategy as a global spectrum efficiency maximization problem for the converged system, achieved through multichannel assignment and power allocation optimization for terrestrial shared users. To solve the non-convex optimization problem, we provide a dynamic and collaborative spectrum sharing (DCSS) algorithm based on multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL), which includes DDQN-based multichannel assignment and DDPG-based power allocation. DCSS transforms the problem to a decentralized partially observable Markov decision processes (Dec-POMDP) and adopts centralized-training-distributed-execution (CTDE) framework to address the challenge of acquiring global information in real-time. Specifically, each terrestrial BS acts as an agent with a globally trained two-layer joint deep neural network model that can adaptively allocate the multichannel and power based on observed system local information. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that DCSS algorithm outperforms the existing typical algorithms.},

However, most of existing relative schemes fail to support physical security and tracing robustness, and lack a mechanism to balance pseudonym unlinkability and system efficiency. In this paper, we propose PSRAKA, a physically secure and robust authenticated key agreement scheme for VANETs, which enables anonymous authentication on vehicles through chameleon hash functions. In particular, physical security is guaranteed by integrating physical unclonable functions and fuzzy extractors to resist against physical capture attacks. Our scheme is the first to support robustness by allowing the vehicle and central authority to jointly sign or commit to the vehicle's real identity, chameleon hash value and public key for binding to ensure public verification and prevent malicious accusations during tracing. Meanwhile, it is the first to model the relationship of vehicle pseudonym unlinkability and system efficiency for balance by formulating the unlinkability based on the frequency of pseudonym updates. PSRAKA achieves anonymity, conditional privacy, robustness, key escrow freeness and physical security, and resists against most known attacks. Comprehensive performance analysis and evaluation suggest the potential usability of PSRAKA.},

In this paper, we study mobile edge deployment and resource management for MEC-assisted maritime wireless networks where USVs with diverse computation resources are deployed to provide edge computing services that complement the cloud-based services. To this end, we formulate an optimization problem to minimize the expected response time by jointly optimizing the deployment of mobile USVs and computation offloading decisions. To solve the mixed-integer nonlinear program problem, we propose a Dual-Layer Reinforcement Learning (DLRL) framework to attain a near-optimal solution.

  abstract     = {Recently, edge content delivery has been promoted for video applications in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted vehicular networks (UVNs). UAVs could proactively cache (video) contents and transmit them to nearby vehicular users, thereby significantly mitigating delivery latency. However, since UAVs are typically deployed by untrusted third parties, the contents may be illicitly accessed by some curious and even malicious UAVs, compromising users' privacy. Besides, due to the limited resources, UAVs may be unwilling to deliver contents without adequate compensations. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose a novel secure edge content delivery scheme in UVNs. Specifically, we first devise a blockchain-based layered secure edge content delivery framework. With the scalable video coding (SVC) that encodes each content into a base layer and multiple enhancement layers, only the enhancement layers of the content are delivered by UAVs, ensuring that untrusted UAVs without the base layer cannot recover the content to access explicit information. Meanwhile, a lightweight consortium blockchain is utilized to supervise the enhancement layer delivery services of UAVs in a distributed fashion. The delegated proof of stake (DPoS)-based practical Byzantine fault tolerance (PBFT) consensus algorithm is designed to immutably and traceably record content delivery transactions between UAVs and vehicular users. Then, we formulate the content delivery incentive problem as a Stackelberg game, where UAVs act as game leaders to determine content delivery prices and vehicular users act as game followers to determine the number of required enhancement layers. Afterwards, through game analysis using the backward induction approach, the Stackelberg equilibrium is attained as the solution to the formulated problem, where the optimal strategies of both UAVs and vehicular users are derived by the Q-learning algorithm. Finally, extensive simulations are conducted to demonstrate that the proposed scheme can significantly enhance the security of delivered contents and efficiently motivate UAVs to cooperatively deliver contents.},

  abstract     = {The radio environment map (REM) is one of the representations of the wireless environments, which consists of the spectrum data and enables the users to understand the electromagnetic situation in temporal, spectral and spatial domains. Generally, the observations of the spectrum data are incomplete due to the insufficient acquisition capability, and even the observed ones could be corrupted by some interferences and white noises. In this paper, we model the REM in all domains using the tensor notation, and propose a Bayesian and a deep-learning approaches to complete the spectrum map from the incomplete and corrupted observed spectrum data. In the first approach, by using the Tucker decomposition on the spectrum tensor, a hierarchical Bayesian framework is modeled to characterize the core tensor, the factor matrices, and the other nuisances. These nodes and their distribution parameters serve as the latent variables in the model. The variational Bayesian method is adopted to compute the posterior probabilities in an iterative manner. Regarding the low-rank property and the correlation of the spectrum, an adaptive compressed tensor decomposition algorithm is proposed to denoise the recovered spectral map in each iteration. In the second approach, the spectrum blanks are initialized by the linear interpolation to obtain the initial complete spectrum tensor. We use the Vision Transformer to solve a semantic segmentation problem in order to identify the semantic regions of the spectrum map in which the power of one emitter dominates. Then, the tensor completion is performed in the individual semantic tensor using the proposed compression algorithm. At last, the simulation results show that both the proposed approaches outperform the existing ones. We further observe that the semantic approach outperforms the Bayesian one for the sparse emitter scenarios while the Bayesian approach exhibits better recovery accuracy as the density of the emitters increases in the normalized mean square error.},

Ray-tracing (RT) method is a widely used site-specific approach to calculate the propagation channel for a given geometry of an environment. Due to the high-frequency approximation used in RT, it suffers from errors in the calculated received power especially at low frequencies where objects may be on the same order or smaller than the wavelength. In this paper, we propose to reduce this error by attenuating the calculated received power depending on the size of the reflecting or diffracting object with respect to wavelength. We also propose two approaches to perform optimization of the algorithm parameters using measured training data. The proposed algorithms are trained and evaluated using measurement data taken in an actual factory environment at five different center frequencies in the sub-6 GHz and mmWave bands. Results showed that the proposed algorithm managed to significantly reduce the RMSE of received power from 11.6 dB to 5.9 dB for the 922 MHz band, and to below 3 dB for the 2.4 GHz and higher bands.},

The fundamental principle of this approach involves allocating FT resources within OFDMA to users through two-dimensional index modulation (IM). A subset of input bits from each user dictates the indices of subcarriers and time slots within the FT resources of OFDMA, while the remaining bits undergo a conventional $M$-ary modulation. FT-IMMA obviates the necessity for a prior scheduling mechanism, thereby reducing communication overhead. While this grant-free access approach may potentially introduce data collisions within the system, the collision probability of the proposed model is observed to be markedly lower compared to traditional IMMA systems. However, the two-dimensional IM approach increases the computational complexity of conventional maximum likelihood detection. To address this, the authors propose using orthogonal matching pursuit, a compressive sensing technique that effectively reduces the computational burden. Through analytical investigation and simulation results, FT-IMMA demonstrates superior performance compared to its counterparts, showcasing notable advantages in both bit error rate and SE.},

  abstract     = {Cell-free massive MIMO (mMIMO) stands out as a promising technology for delivering uniformly good wireless services. Prevailing solutions for downlink (DL) precoding are often derived from the uplink-downlink (UL-DL) duality, which correlates DL precoding with UL transmission parameters. Additionally, normalizing the DL precoding vector is a common practice for the sake of power control convenience. In this paper, we introduce a two-layer large-scale fading precoding (LSFP) purely from the perspective of DL transmission. We demonstrate that the optimal two-layer LSFP can be derived from two subsequent signal-to-leakage-interference ratio (SLIR) maximization problems, which is independent of UL transmission parameters. Furthermore, we reveal that normalizing the precoding vector diminishes spectral efficiency (SE) for worse-case UEs, whereas unnormalized precoding schemes, following specifically designed power control policies, ensure much higher SE for worst-case UEs by exploiting the channel diversity at both layers of precoding. We derive closed-form expressions for the proposed unnormalized LSFP scheme and achievable SE under local maximum ratio (MR) precoding and the proposed power control policies. Through analytical and simulation results, we demonstrate that the proposed unnormalized LSFP schemes significantly improve worst-case SE and ensure better fairness among users.},

  abstract     = {One of the great potentials to improve the confidentiality in mmWave/THz at the physical layer of technical communication, measured by the secrecy rate, lies in the use of reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs). However, an important open problem arises when the eavesdropper is aligned with the legitimate user or near the RIS or legitimate user. The limitation stems from the high directional gain caused by the dominant line-of-sight (LOS) path in high-frequency transmission and the high energy leakage in the proximity of the RIS and the legitimate user. To address these issues, we employ frequency diverse arrays (FDA) at the base station (BS) associated with random inverted transmit beamforming and reflective element subset selection (RIBES). More specifically, we consider a passive eavesdropper with unknown location and design the transmit beamforming and RIS configuration based on the channel information of the legitimate user only. In this context, the secrecy rate with the proposed transmission technique is evaluated in the case of deterministic eavesdropper channel, demonstrating that we can ensure a secure transmission regarding both direction and range. Furthermore, assuming no prior information about the eavesdropper, we describe the wiretap region and derive the worst-case secrecy rate in closed form. The latter is further optimized by determining the optimal subset sizes of the transmit antennas and reflective elements.

This paper focuses on 2-D Z-complementary array code sets (ZCACSs), which have ideal 2-D correlation properties within a rectangular zone around the origin. By developing a theory linking 2-D extended Boolean functions with 2-D arrays, we establish an efficient construction of 2-D ZCACSs. In contrast to previous work, the proposed construction is capable of producing 2-D ZCACSs with new flexible parameters. Constructions of three-dimensional (3-D) and higher-dimensional ZCACSs are further investigated. We remark that 2-D and higher-dimensional complete complementary codes (CCCs) can also be generated from the proposed constructions.},

We propose two novel deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approaches to address the weighted sum-rate maximization problem under quality of service constraints in this context. Instead of using widely linear transformation to amalgamate power and circularity coefficient into a unified precoding matrix, the two proposed DRL methods, referred to as interdependent deep deterministic policy gradient (I-DDPG) and collaborative DDPG (C-DDPG), both explicitly incorporate the factor of circularity coefficient in the optimization process, thereby enabling full exploitation of the interference management capabilities offered by IGS in the considered uplink NOMA system. Compared to I-DDPG, C-DDPG facilitates both collaborative training and independent adjustments of both decision variables, leading to enhanced generalization ability. Simulation results validate that the proposed DRL approaches achieve significant sum-rate improvement over conventional model-based optimization techniques, in which C-DDPG pushes individual user rates closer to the optimal NOMA boundary. Furthermore, our findings highlight the fact that the sub-optimality of the model-based optimization technique stems from its inability to fully utilize the circularity coefficient, rather than the power.},

This problem is an instance of the restless multi-armed bandit problem, and is provably hard to solve. Using a technique introduced by Whittle, we relax the hard per-stage constraint that each arriving user must be associated with exactly one mmWave base station (mBS) to a long-run constraint and then use the Lagrangian multiplier technique to convert the problem into an unconstrained problem. This decouples the process governing the system into separate Markov Decision Processes, each corresponding to a different mBS. We prove that the problem is Whittle indexable, present a scheme for computing the Whittle indices of different mBSs, and propose an association scheme under which, each arriving user is associated with the mBS having the smallest value of the Whittle index. Using extensive simulations, we show that the proposed Whittle index based scheme outperforms several user association schemes proposed in prior work in terms of various performance metrics such as average cost, delay, throughput, and Jain's fairness index. We also compare the proposed policy with the exhaustive search algorithm via simulations, and our results show that the performance of the proposed Whittle index based policy is close to optimal.},

This paper investigates the performance of an active RIS-assisted downlink non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) network with transceiver hardware impairments and imperfect successive interference cancellation (ipSIC). By employing the transmit antenna selection technique at the base station, closed-form expressions of the outage probability (OP) and ergodic capacity are derived in terms of the Meijer-G function. Regarding the former, we formulate the asymptotic OP and asymptotic ergodic capacity and obtain the diversity order of the system. Additionally, we explore higher-order modulation schemes such as rectangular quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM), cross QAM, and hexagonal QAM, which are integral for achieving increased data rates while maintaining power and bandwidth efficiency. For these modulation schemes, we derive closed-form expressions of the average symbol error rate (ASER) and asymptotic ASER using the Gaussian Chebeyshev quadrature approximation. The performance of the considered NOMA network is compared with an orthogonal multiple access technique. In addition, the system performance is compared to that with a passive RIS. We show that the diversity order of the considered network scales with the number of transmit antennas, the number of REs, and fading mitigation parameters, and the hexagonal QAM outperforms several other QAM schemes. Finally, simulation results affirm the accuracy of the derived closed-form expressions.},

In this paper, we propose a simultaneous transmission and reflection reconfigurable intelligent surface (STAR-RIS) aided dynamic scatterers tracking scheme for ISAC in high mobility millimeter wave communication systems, where the STAR-RIS is employed to provide communication service for indoor user with the base station (BS) and simultaneously sense and track the interested outdoor dynamic scatterers. Specifically, we resort to an active STAR-RIS to respectively receive and further deal with the impinging signal from its double sides at the same time. Then, we develop a transmission strategy with the activation scheme of the STAR-RIS elements, and construct the signal models within the system. After acquiring the channel parameters related to the BS-RIS channel, the dynamic paths can be identified from all the scattering paths, and the dynamic targets can be classified with respect to their radar cross sections. We further track the outdoor scatterers at STAR-RIS by resorting to the Gaussian mixture-probability hypothesis density filter. With the tracked locations of the outdoor scatterers, a beam prediction strategy for both the precoder of BS and the refraction phase shift vector of STAR-RIS is developed to enhance the communication performance of the indoor user. Besides, a target mismatch detection and path collision prediction mechanism is proposed to reduce the training overhead and improve the transmission performance. Finally, the feasibility and effectiveness of our proposed STAR-RIS aided dynamic scatterers tracking scheme for ISAC are demonstrated and verified via simulation results.},

  abstract     = {Low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite communication, as an essential technology in the 6 G era, still faces challenges such as high path loss, severe Doppler shifts, multi-path propagation, link budget, and limited satellite-borne resources. Recently, a novel proposed orthogonal time sequency multiplexing (OTSM) modulation that multiplexes information symbols in the delay-sequency (DS) domain performs well in high-mobility scenarios. DS-domain symbols can be transformed into the delay-time domain via the Walsh-Hadamard transform (WHT), which only includes addition and subtraction. It has been proven that OTSM can perform similarly to orthogonal time-frequency space (OTFS) with a much lower-complexity transceiver. In this paper, we derive the 2D quasi-convolution input-output (I/O) relationship of OTSM under general waveforms, reflecting the interaction between symbols and the channel. Next, we design an iterative detector for the ideal-waveform-based OTSM system based on the unitary approximate message passing (UAMP) algorithm. Specifically, based on our derived I/O relationship, we explore the structural characteristics of channels in the DS domain and design a specific unitary transformation matrix for implementing the UAMP framework, where the WHT is used to improve the computational efficiency of the detector further. Then, we extend our detection algorithm to the case of the rectangular-waveform-based OTSM system. Finally, numerical simulations demonstrate the performance advantages of our proposed detector in OTSM systems.},

  abstract     = {Accurate channel estimation ensures auto-pilot safety in 5G and 6G communications. Nevertheless, multiuser massive MIMO systems with one-bit ADCs significantly decrease accuracy due to information loss during quantization. Additionally, the limited number of samples also negatively impacts estimation accuracy. To mitigate these issues and enhance the utilization of massive MIMO in the automotive industry, we propose a channel estimation solution based on a novel generative adversarial network (GAN). Inside this modified GAN, the generator is constructed using a modified U-Net that incorporates the Pooling Fusion Module and the Squeeze-and-Excitation and Depth-wise Separable Convolution (SE-DSC) Module. Additionally, the discriminator is designed based on the Pyramid Dilated Convolution (DConv) Module. These modules are specially designed to extract more information (MI) from input features and compensate for the inadequacy caused by the quantization of one-bit ADCs and the limited number of samples. Numeric results demonstrate that the proposed solution, MIA-GAN, surpasses state-of-the-art (SOTA) channel estimation approaches in accuracy under various conditions, including the signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs), sample numbers, BS antenna numbers, pilot signal lengths, and loss selections. Meanwhile, the weight selection, convergence behaviors and model complexities are also studied.},

  abstract     = {Delay alignment modulation (DAM) is a novel wideband transmission technique for millimeter wave (mmWave) massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, which exploits the high spatial resolution and multi-path sparsity to mitigate inter-symbol interference (ISI), without the need of channel equalization or multi-carrier transmission. In particular, DAM leverages the delay pre-compensation and path-based beamforming to effectively align the multi-path components, thus achieving the constructive multi-path combination for eliminating the ISI while preserving the multi-path power gain. Different from the existing works only considering single-user DAM, this paper investigates the DAM technique for multi-user mmWave massive MIMO communication. First, we consider the asymptotic regime when the number of antennas $M_{t}$ at base station (BS) is sufficiently large. It is shown that by employing the simple delay pre-compensation and per-path-based maximal ratio transmission (MRT) beamforming, the single-carrier DAM is able to perfectly eliminate both ISI and inter-user interference (IUI). Next, we consider the general scenario with $M_{t}$ being finite. In this scenario, we characterize the achievable rate region of the multi-user DAM system by finding its Pareto boundary. Specifically, we formulate a rate-profile-constrained sum rate maximization problem by optimizing the per-path-based beamforming, which is optimally solved via the second-order cone programming (SOCP). Furthermore, we present three low-complexity per-path-based beamforming strategies based on the MRT, zero-forcing (ZF), and regularized zero-forcing (RZF) principles, respectively, and study their correspondingly achievable sum rates. Finally, we provide simulation results to demonstrate the performance of our proposed strategies as compared to two benchmark schemes based on the strongest-path-based beamforming and the prevalent orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM), respectively. It is shown that DAM achieves higher spectral efficiency and/or lower peak-to-average-ratio (PAPR), for systems with high spatial resolution and multi-path diversity.},

This paper addresses the critical challenge of managing dynamic interference in cooperative ISAC systems, focusing on fast-moving autonomous aerial vehicles (AAVs) operating in complex propagation environments. Rapid AAV motion induces significant Doppler shifts and fluctuating interference, leading to uneven signal quality and degraded detection performance, particularly in high-interference zones. To tackle this, we propose a fairness-based resource allocation framework that prioritizes the weakest links by maximizing the minimum radar sensing signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR). We formulate a joint optimization problem for ISAC beamforming and target allocation, ensuring communication quality of service (QoS) and base station (BS) power constraints. Although the problem is non-convex, we develop an alternating optimization approach. Optimal receive beamforming is derived using the generalized Rayleigh quotient, while transmit beamforming and target assignment are solved via Dinkelbach's method, exploiting strong duality. Numerical results demonstrate the proposed algorithm's superiority over benchmarks, achieving robust and equitable sensing performance across AAVs, even in dynamic, high-mobility scenarios. These results highlight the potential of cooperative ISAC with multiple BSs for reliable target detection and communication under challenging conditions.},

The dual-band CP performance is realized by using a dual-band branch-line coupler (DB-BLC) with +/−90° phase offsets between the split ports at the dual frequencies. Either the dual-band same CP (DB-SCP) or the dual-band opposite CP (DB-OCP) antennas can be implemented through the proper selection of the DB-BLC topology. The opposite polarization feature at the two bands of the DB-OCP antennas further enhances the isolation between the UL and DL bands through additional polarization diversity. The selection of operating modes is achievable by switching the excitation ports, providing great flexibility for system applications. The proposed configuration features the ease of fabrication using standard 2-layer printed circuit board (PCB) technology, and its planar structure makes it easy for integration with other circuitries at the system level. The proposed designs have been experimentally validated. The measurement results of the DB-SCP and DB-OCP antennas revealed an applicable system bandwidth (the intersection of impedance bandwidth and the axial ratio bandwidth) of 9.42%/6.40% and 8.06%/4.50% at 28 and 38 GHz, respectively, with reasonable antenna gain and total efficiency.},

In this paper, we propose a novel semi-symmetrical augmented coprime array (SSACA) that strategically positions sensors by arranging M-subarrays and symmetric N-subarrays. This design reduces redundancy lags, and increases DOFs, continuous DOFs, and array aperture, thereby mitigating mutual coupling effects and improving angular resolution for the direction of arrival (DOA) estimation. We derive closed-form expressions for the DOFs, continuous DOFs, and array aperture of SSACA. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed SSACA outperforms the existing studies regarding higher DOFs, reduced mutual coupling effects, and lower root mean square error (RMSE) in similar application scenarios, particularly in strong mutual coupling scenarios.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, a novel simultaneous transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surface (STAR-RIS) enhanced uplink non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) communication network is investigated. Specifically, we tackle the transmit rate maximization problem for the strong user, subject to the constraints on total power consumption and the successive interference cancellation order, while guaranteeing the minimum quality-of-service requirement for the weak user. To address such a non-convex optimal problem, we introduce a novel, efficient, and low-complexity scheme. Specifically, the power allocation and receive beamforming optimization solutions are acquired in closed forms, and the transmission and reflection coefficients are obtained in semi-closed forms with a one-dimensional bisection search. Then, theoretical analysis demonstrates our proposed scheme has a lower complexity compared to the schemes with alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) and semidefinite relaxation (SDR) strategies, and the complexity advantage of our proposed scheme over the SDR and ADMM aided schemes becomes prominent when the number of RIS elements increase. Simulation results show that the proposed STAR-RIS-NOMA scheme achieves a better performance than the conventional STAR-RIS-aided orthogonal multiple access (OMA) scheme and STAR-RIS aided NOMA scheme adopting random phase shifts. More specifically, the proposed STAR-RIS-NOMA scheme outperforms the STAR-RIS-OMA scheme in terms of the strong user's rate, especially when the quality-of-service (QoS) requirements for weak user is high, or there is a significant difference channel quality between the reflecting and transmitting links.},

  abstract     = {In Extended Reality (XR) applications, high data rates and low latency are crucial for immersive experiences. Uplink transmission in XR is challenging due to the limited antennas and power of lightweight XR devices. To improve data transmission rates, we investigate a relay-assisted carrier aggregation (RACA) system. The XR device simultaneously transmits data to an access point (AP) and a relay in proximity over low-frequency and high-frequency bands, respectively. Then, the relay down-converts and amplifies the signals to the AP, effectively acting as an additional transmit antenna for the XR device. In this paper, we propose two algorithms to maximize the data rate of the XR device in their respective protocols. In the centralized protocol, the rate maximization problem is equivalently transformed as a weighted mean square error minimization (WMMSE) problem which can be solved iteratively by alternating optimization. In the distributed protocol, the rate maximization problem is decomposed into two independent sub-problems where the rate of the direct link and the rate of the relay link are maximized by singular value decomposition (SVD)-based methods with water-filling (WF). Simulation results show that the rate of the RACA system is improved by 32% compared to that of the conventional carrier aggregation scheme.},

To solve this problem, a good resource allocation scheme is necessary. Existing resource allocation algorithms often pursue accurate transmission and ignore time-varying channels. In order to further obtain real and reasonable resource allocation results, this paper introduces semantic communication. It then decomposes that problem to further establish a hierarchical framework. The problem is addressed via a task-oriented channel optimization and resource allocation scheme based on a hierarchical reinforcement learning (TCRS-HRL) algorithm. First, a channel optimization and resource allocation problem under an imperfect channel state is developed, and it is divided into two separate sub problems for optimization. Second, the resource allocation problem at the edge is addressed with the introduction of hierarchical reinforcement learning and the TCRS-HRL algorithm. The ideal channel state and resource allocation approach are found by constructing the state space, action space, and environmental feedback for each aspect individually. Finally, simulations have demonstrated the superiority and performance benefits of the proposed algorithm compared to current methods, showing that the implementation of TCRS-HRL can result in an accuracy improvement of roughly 8%.},

The code can be dynamically shortened or extended by leveraging the generator matrix extension feature, allowing the code structure to be adaptive to varying user loads. To significantly enhance system performance, we establish one-to-one bit-protect pairs by strategically exploiting the design signal-to-noise ratio (design-SNR) and bit-channel reliability. Particularly, bit-channels in the extension part exhibiting higher reliability are paired with less reliable bit-channels from the original information set, maximizing performance gains by carefully selecting bit-protect pairs. We devise a simplified, multi-user-oriented extrinsic information transfer (EXIT) chart to streamline the search process for these optimal pairs, facilitating more efficient analysis. Our numerical results underscore the superior block-error rate (BLER) performance of the proposed multi-user polarized matrix extension (PME) based polar codes than traditional polar codes integrated with repetition codes in IDMA systems. Notably, the proposed codes consistently achieve competitive performance across diverse conditions of SNRs, code lengths, and user loads, illustrating their robustness and adaptability in dynamic IDMA environments.},

  abstract     = {The reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) with massive low-cost passive reflecting elements integrated on a planar surface has the ability to favourably reconfigure the wireless propagation environment, thereby significantly improving the performance of wireless communication networks. In this work, we consider uplink (UL) channel estimation for the RIS assisted millimeter-wave multiuser multiple-input single-output beamspace system where the base station (BS) is equipped with lens antenna array. This channel state information (CSI) estimation task is extremely challenging for two reasons. First, the BS only has limited number of radio frequency chains but the size of beamspace channel is very large. Second, the number of passive components in the RIS is abundance but they lack signal processing capabilities. By exploiting the parallel factor (PARAFAC) decomposition of the received signals, we derive an iterative estimation algorithm, called unitary approximate message passing (UAMP), to accurately estimate the channels between the BS and the RIS as well as the channels between the RIS and the users. To guide the selection of the system parameters, we provide the uniqueness conditions for our PARAFAC decomposition based channel estimation. To theoretically verify the efficiency of our UAMP algorithm, the Cramér-Rao bound (CRB) of the estimation is also derived. Besides, we investigate the achievable downlink (DL) sum rate for the channel estimation obtained by the proposed algorithm by using the maximum power beam selection, the optimized phase shift matrix and the zero forcing precoding. Extensive simulation results demonstrate the excellent mean squared error (MSE) performance of our UAMP estimation algorithm. In particular, for sufficiently high UL signal-to-noise ratio, the MSE of our channel estimation reaches the CRB. Simulation results also show that the DL sum rate achieved by the estimated CSI is very close to that obtained by the perfect CSI. Theoretical analysis and simulation results thus validate the effectiveness and reliability of our beamspace channel estimation approach.},

  abstract     = {In images semantic communication, the efficacy of communication systems is intricately influenced by multiple factors, including images compression rates, semantic noise, channel noise, etc. These factors exhibit intricate interdependencies and pose formidable challenges when it comes to their quantitative assessment through mathematical formulations. Furthermore, semantic communication tailored to various image transmission tasks imposes different requirements on the system, necessitating a holistic consideration of these influential elements. This paper presents a method devised to optimize images semantic communication systems by joining the facets of Source-Channel-Host-Task (JSCHT). The primary objective of proposing this approach is to ensure the successful execution of images communication tasks. Initially, we propose an adaptive scheme for semantic compression. This scheme is proposed to tackle the intricate problem of optimally aligning semantic information with channel states. This scheme establishes a dynamic linkage between the source and the channel, adjusting the degree of semantic compression in response to signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). As a consequence, the system's flexibility is heightened. Subsequently, we architect an end-to-end codec network grounded in deep learning (DL) principles to tackle the challenge of accommodating SNRs changes. The differentiable channel model is integrated into this framework as a network layer, actively participating in the processes of backpropagation and gradient computation. Through the implementation of end-to-end training by joint source-dynamic noise channel-host, system robustness undergoes pronounced enhancement. In addition, within the semantic communication environment for various image transmission tasks, an on-demand feature extraction module is incorporated to establish a contextual connection between the information source and task. The redundant components within an image will be removed based on different task objectives during the process of image transmission. The efficacy of the proposed approach is evaluated across three channel models varying in complexity. Simulation results underscore the system's capacity to accommodate fluctuations in SNR and its role in facilitating the optimal execution of images communication tasks.},

  abstract     = {Open radio access network (ORAN)-based vehicular networks play a pivotal role in future traffic data sharing. Due to the openness of the ORAN framework, it is necessary to encrypt the sharing data to prevent unauthorized access or misuse by malicious participants. However, current efforts struggle to address some emerging security requirements, such as the bilateral control of sending and access rights in cellular vehicle-to-everything (C-V2X) communications, as well as evolving replay attack on encrypted data. With these challenges, this paper presents a fine-grained access control encryption (FGACE) scheme for secure communication in ORAN-based vehicular networks. Our FGACE enables fine-grained and bilateral control over senders and receivers. We design a novel sanitization algorithm against dishonest sanitizer and replay attack. Furthermore, we deeply explore security models for replay attack on encrypted data to support secure sanitization, i.e., attribute-based replayable CCA security and related definitions. We prove that our FGACE satisfies the proposed security definitions. Feature comparison demonstrates that our scheme does better in security and privacy. Experimental results show that our scheme outperforms compared schemes. When the number of attributes increases to 50, our total computational overhead is lowest, and the total storage overhead is approximately less than 1/3 of other schemes. The impressive performance indicates that our FGACE is practical in ORAN-based vehicular networks.},

However, the intrinsic design of the system presents significant challenges for precise steering execution due to parameter uncertainties, external disturbances, and the substantial risk posed by actuator faults. To achieve exact, rapid, and robust tracking, this study utilizes a dual three-phase permanent magnet synchronous motor (DT-PMSM) to drive the SbW system and proposes a fault-tolerant tracking scheme integrating fixed-time sliding mode control (FT-SMC) with adaptive actuator fault compensation. Initially, we describe the structure of the DT-PMSM-driven SbW system and establish a mathematical model that accounts for actuator faults. Subsequently, utilizing dual-layer fixed-time sliding mode surfaces, we ensure that the tracking error converges within a fixed time. A novel adaptive control law, combined with FT-SMC, is introduced, guaranteeing fixed-time stability under normal and faulty conditions. Furthermore, a fixed-time extended disturbance observer (FEDO) is incorporated to suppress lumped disturbances, with its stabilization time being bounded and independent of the initial state. Real-vehicle experiments are conducted on high and low-adhesion road surfaces to validate the proposed controller's effectiveness. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed scheme exhibits excellent transient and tracking performance under normal and fault conditions.},

In the existing ISAC framework, the vehicle is usually treated as a point target and only the backscattered echo is used for sensing. However, in practice, the vehicle is an extended target composed of different reflecting/scattering surfaces, and hence the BS may receive multiple echoes. In this paper, by exploiting the directive scattering (DS) model for the incident signal at the vehicle surface, we demonstrate that the multipath echoes are substantial or even stronger, as compared with the backscattered echo. To capitalize on this observation, we develop a sensing-assisted predictive beamforming scheme with multipath echoes, where both the backscattered echo and multipath echoes are utilized for vehicle tracking. To accurately estimate the motion parameters of vehicles, we propose a particle filtering based tracking algorithm where the likelihood probabilities are designed based on the geometrical relationships of the multipath echoes. The beamforming vectors are then designed based on the predicted angles for establishing the communication links. Moreover, we present a particle swarm optimization (PSO) based algorithm to estimate the locations of the roadside scatterers when the prior information is unavailable. Extensive simulations are conducted to verify the superiorities of the proposed scheme.},

Utilizing semantic communication for D2D multicast is considered a promising approach. However, two challenges need to be addressed: user clustering and resource management based on semantic communication. For the first issue of user clustering, we introduce a semantic triple-based structure to extract semantic features of images and define user similarity for image delivery tasks based on semantic features and other indicators. Subsequently, improvements are made to the K-medoids algorithm to achieve efficient user clustering. For the other issue of resource management, a scaling compression factor is first designed to adjust the fidelity of image delivery for the semantic image communication process of semantic encoding and decoding. Then, we propose a mini-batch model training method by randomly selecting batches to train sub-semantic models, balancing model performance and training complexity. Secondly, we establish an optimization problem to maximize user quality of experience (QoE) through optimizing semantic compression ratios and D2D multicast channel selection. We analyze it from a game theory perspective, modelling the maximization of average QoE for all cell users as a potential game. Finally, we design a joint semantic compression ratio selection and channel allocation strategy based on the spatial adaptive (JSCSA) algorithm to achieve Nash Equilibrium (NE) and demonstrate the convergence of the algorithm.

  abstract     = {Motivated by the emerging interest in direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation exploiting array motions, this paper investigates a practical application scenario involving a single moving acoustic vector sensor (AVS). By reasonably arranging observations at different times, we construct a flexible measurement model for the resulting dual-AVS synthetic array. Since multiple components of an AVS are physically co-located, incorporating a synthetic aperture via the translation motion can contribute to remarkable performance improvement. Aiming at an explicit analysis, we delve into the corresponding Cramér-Rao bound (CRB) in the single-source case and formulate a CRB optimization problem to determine the optimal measurement model. Thanks to significant simplifications, we derive a closed-form CRB expression, which provides insight into the system performance and favors the analytical solution of the optimization problem. Regarding DOA estimation, especially for the spatially nonuniform noise specific to AVSs, we propose a weighted maximum likelihood estimator (WMLE) to fully leverage the promised theoretical gain in terms of the CRB. Further noting the intrinsic relationship between the WMLE performance and array data arrangement, we design a two-phase iterative procedure that updates the DOA estimate and the measurement matrix structure alternately to approximate the global optimal solution. Numerical experiments corroborate our analytical derivations and validate the statistical efficiency of the proposed methods. Their mean-square errors are tightly lower bounded by the derived CRBs at high signal-to-noise ratios.},

The circuitry topology is composed of two $LC$ filtered power modules. The upper/lower output capacitors of each power module are connected to the positive and negative DC bus terminals for the purpose of bypassing the leakage current from flowing into the grid side. The designed single-phase onboard charger achieves low leakage current with an MPC-based zero sequence control method. Also, the second harmonic pulsation on DC side is mitigated with the MPC-regulated power decoupling technique. With the proposed methods, the leakage current is limited below 15 mA without the need of isolation transformer. The required DC capacitance is reduced by a factor of 6. The dynamic performance is improved by MPC with a rise time smaller than 2 ms. The experimental results verifies the developed onboard charger.},

  abstract     = {Slotted Aloha-based 5G random access networks are regarded as a key enabler for vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communications. For V2X communications, the age of information (AoI) is an important metric that measures the freshness of received data packets. In the literature, the optimization of AoI performance and characterization of the effects of the retry limit on the optimal AoI performance of random access networks have remained largely unknown. In this paper, we focus on a slotted Aloha-based random-access network with a finite retry limit and aim to address the following open issues: 1) for a given retry limit, how to adaptively tune the system parameters to optimize the mean AoI performance of random-access networks, and 2) how the optimal mean AoI performance varies with the finite retry limit. Specifically, by modelling the behaviour of each head-of-line packet as a Markov chain, the network steady-state probability of successful transmissions is obtained. The analysis shows that for slotted Aloha networks with a finite retry limit, the network either has three steady-state points or one steady-state point, based on which the mean AoI of slotted Aloha networks is derived as a function of the transmission probability of each node, the input rate of each node, and the retry limit, and is shown to be a monotonic decreasing function of the transmission probability. The analysis further shows that to minimize the mean AoI, both the transmission probability and the retry limit should be adaptively tuned based on the aggregate input rates of nodes.},

It can achieve new modes such as wedge driving (with the same four-wheel steering angle) or even lateral driving (with all four-wheel steering angles of 90 degrees) through four-wheel steering angle coordination, making its stability judgment and control method completely different from traditional four-wheel steering systems. This poses challenges to the design of the steering angle coordination controller. To solve the above problems, the control requirements under different steering modes, such as 4WIS conventional/unconventional, are discussed, and a control objective design method is established considering the asymptotic evolution characteristics of the 4WIS critical stability boundary. Considering that the dynamic acquisition and control of 4WIS control objectives need online optimization, which will consume many computing resources, an event-triggered stability control method is proposed based on the dynamic redistribution of lateral force. The results show that the method proposed in this paper can make the 4WIS system self-adaptive and fast and smooth switching mode. The stability can be ensured by redistributing the lateral force so that the system can meet both the manoeuvrability and stability requirements.},

Further, the influence of structure parameters is studied, the entropy method is used to establish an evaluation model of the motor, and the optimal structural parameters of the motor are obtained.

Considering the high computational burden involved in solving min-max optimization, the linear matrix inequalities-based conditions are derived to facilitate the controller gain solving.

  abstract     = {Despite the advantages of better torque and greater speeds when using a transmission, electric vehicles (EVs) often forgo this component due to energy losses and the added cost and weight. A promising solution to these issues is to use a dog-clutch transmission. However, this introduces a new problem related to drivability, known as a torque hole, which hinders the implementation of dog-clutch transmissions in EVs. This paper proposes a novel preview gear-shifting strategy that adopts a two-motor architecture and utilizes predictive control to eliminate the torque hole problem. The optimal control problem is formulated to minimize torque holes while ensuring that drivability is not significantly compromised and system efficiency is maximized. The predictive control scheme leverages model predictive control (MPC) by incorporating forecasts of the vehicle's short-term velocity. In order to achieve accurate predictions, this paper utilizes a transformer network with headway distance and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) information. The results demonstrate that the proposed prediction model can drastically enhance the performance of velocity predictions. Furthermore, the proposed gear-shifting strategy with high prediction accuracy can substantially mitigate torque holes compared to a non-predictive strategy, effectively addressing the challenges of a torque hole issue. Consequently, this approach offers new prospects for developing electric vehicle transmissions with dog clutches.},

A novel Multiple Attention Mechanism for Camera-Radar Fusion Object Detection (MAM-CRF) is proposed. A new network architecture is designed specifically for CRF networks to seamlessly integrate with existing vision-based AM modules. Additionally, an innovative Azimuth Attention Mechanism (AAM) module is developed, combining visual and radar data to enhance the network's focus on azimuthal features. A data scrambling technique is also introduced to reduce over-reliance on individual sensors in fusion-based methods. In the absence of a publicly available dataset tailored to this task, the Camera-Radar University of Washington (CRUW) dataset was selected and modified. Furthermore, a new dataset, the Camera-Radar Nanjing University of Science and Technology Version 1.0 (CRNJUST-v1.0), was created to validate the proposed methodology. Results demonstrate that MAM-CRF improves performance by over 2% with only a marginal complexity increase of 5‰. The method also exhibits robust performance under severe data disturbances.

  abstract     = {Accurate positioning is crucial for intelligent vehicles, especially in scenarios with spatial constraints such as close vehicle proximities, tight parking spaces, and the docking process of autonomous modular buses (AMBs). Binocular cameras and Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) have shown great potential in intelligent vehicle applications. However, existing methods mostly rely on comparing the inter-camera extrinsic matrices and the results of the calibration between a single camera and LiDAR. This not only leads to the accumulation of errors in each process but also fails to accurately determine the source of errors when calibration results are suboptimal. To overcome these problems, this paper proposes a high-precision, phased joint calibration method based on binocular cameras and LiDAR, along with a combined global and local evaluation approach, and introduces a visualization scheme to enhance the reliability and intuitiveness of the joint calibration process. Experimental results on AMBs demonstrate that our methodology and selection of intrinsic and extrinsic parameters significantly improve performance compared to other mainstream methods.},

The upper controller employs non-cooperative Nash game theory to derive a coordination control strategy based on a three-party game, aiming to investigate the interaction between Active Front Steering (AFS), Active Rear Steering (ARS), and Four-Wheel Independent Driving (4WID). The Nash equilibrium solution is obtained by solving the coupled Riccati equation within a linear quadratic differential game framework, which provides the front and rear wheel angles as well as yaw moment required for the path tracking process. The torques of four in-wheel motors are allocated by the lower controller through quadratic programming. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, a joint simulation platform is constructed using CarSim/Simulink, and simulation tests are conducted. The results demonstrate that the coordination control strategy exhibits robust path tracking and lateral stabilization capabilities even under extreme operating conditions.},

With the development of detection technology, the traditional point-to-point covert communication method cannot effectively guarantee the reliability of covert communication. In order to solve this problem, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) are widely adopted in covert communication as common relay equipment. However, the UAV maximizes its benefits by taking advantage of the information asymmetry between itself and the covert communication sender. Therefore, it is necessary to encourage UAV-assisted potential users (UPU) to transmit covert data honestly by designing an information asymmetry-based incentive mechanism. In this paper, we propose a UAV-assisted contract-theoretic (UACT) model to improve the covert communication performance, where UPU honestly transmits covert data and the throughput of UACT can be increased. Specifically, we first divide UPU into finite types and model the data transfer contract between the sender, UPU, and receiver. Then, the contract feasibility of UACT is derived with sufficient and necessary conditions. Finally, we analyze the contract optimization in the continuous case of UPUs. Numerical simulations show that the UACT can incentivize UPUs to transmit covert data through UAV assistance and make covert communication performance close to the information symmetry case.},

Due to insufficient energy and computation resources of UAVs, an interactive multiple data evacuation paths problem of multi-UAV system is a challenge. In this paper, we study energy-saving and time-saving evacuation path for collected data. We formulate a Time and Energy Saving Multi-objective Path Optimization Problem (TESMPOP) to minimize the total transmission time of data and energy consumption of relay UAVs. Because of the NP-hardness of formulated TESMPOP, we propose a Data Temporary Staging Point Selection and Multiple Data Evacuation Paths Ant Colony System (DTSPS-MDEPACS) algorithm. Based on load balance of relay UAV and time constraints of data UAV, DTSPS algorithm is designed to select the suitable relay UAVs to temporarily store data to avoid the loss of data. Then, the MDEPACS algorithm is proposed to find the multiple data evacuation paths for data from the selected relay UAVs to base station. In MDEPACS algorithm, we design hybrid data transmission mode for relay UAV. Each relay UAV's transmission mode can be different. A novel solution construction which includes the mode and trajectory of relay UAVs is proposed. A new pheromone update rule based on nondominated solutions is designed to ensure that ant colony can quickly find the best evacuation paths. Simulation results illustrate that the proposed DTSPS-MDEPACS algorithm has better performance than some other benchmark methods.},

  abstract     = {Autonomous aerial vehicles (AAVs) can provide detection coverage service in many scenarios. The fair coverage is achieved by designing carefully AAVs' trajectories, which are established at each step by choosing the moving action and channel access for transmitting data. However, under the jamming environment, the problematic trajectories could lead to mutual interference and malicious jamming, such that the coverage service fails. The selections of moving action and channel access are usually coupled, and so far no work has addressed them jointly for planning trajectory. As such, this paper investigates the multi-AAV joint optimization of moving action and channel access for the energy-efficient detection coverage. To decouple the strongly-coupled moving action and channel access, we model the studied optimization problem as a hierarchical game, where the stochastic game (resp. potential game) is applied for selecting moving action (resp. channel access). Then, we propose a multi-agent hierarchical cooperative learning (MAHCL) algorithm to attain near-optimal solution for the joint optimization. It is proved that the proposed MAHCL algorithm can asymptotically converge to the near-optimal joint strategy with lower computational complexity. Finally, the simulation results show the higher energy efficiency of MAHCL algorithm compared with the benchmarks.},

  abstract     = {The integration of advanced adaptive cruise control (ACC) with energy management strategy (EMS) is crucial for improving the fuel efficiency of fuel cell hybrid electric vehicles (FCHEVs). The nonlinearity inherent in ACC and EMS arises from complex interactions between vehicle dynamics system and composite energy sources, necessitating intricate real-time adjustments and resulting in high-dimensional dynamic optimization problems. This paper proposes a data-driven, model-free deep reinforcement learning (DRL) integrated optimization framework that emphasizes balancing multiple objectives—safety, comfort, energy saving, and energy source durability while addressing the challenges of policy convergence exacerbated by potentially sparse rewards in high-dimensional action-state spaces. Specifically, an ACC based on course learning DRL is proposed, with a featuring a staged reward mechanism for driving safety, comfort, and speed consistency to model human-like progressive learning. Then, adaptive equivalent consumption minimization is combined to design the DRL-based EMS that balances fuel economy and power source durability. Finally, the decision sets of the integration optimization framework are generated and verified. The simulation results show that the proposed method can ensure driving safety and traffic throughput, the ego vehicle improves driving comfort by 73.4% and energy saving by 11.5% compared to the preceding vehicle.},

  abstract     = {With the merits of high mobility and easy deployment, mounting mobile edge computing (MEC) servers on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can efficiently fulfill the task offloading of ground users (GUs) over a large area. Nevertheless, data security is a challenging issue for the computation offloading in UAV-MEC networks, especially when there exist flying eavesdroppers. An intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) assisted secure communication scheme for a UAV-MEC network is proposed in this paper, wherein multiple IRSs are utilized to help the secure computation offloading from GUs against a UAV eavesdropper. Our aim is to maximize the secure computation capacity through the joint optimization of the IRS phase-shift, allocation of communication and computing resources and trajectory of UAV. We firstly solve the problem under a fixed UAV trajectory by alternating optimization to obtain the resource allocation and IRS phase-shift, wherein Dinkebach and Taylor expansion methods are used to transform the subproblems into tractable forms. Then, by adopting the proximal policy optimization, a joint optimization approach which further incorporates the UAV trajectory optimization is proposed. Numerical results verify that compared with benchmarks, the proposed scheme efficiently improves the system secure computation capacity.},

This paper proposes a novel light-weight visual-inertial odometry for ground vehicles and aerial vehicles with the help of a small portion of LiDAR measurements, which establishes correspondence between visual line as well as plane features and LiDAR point cloud. Specifically, proposed pipeline recovers depth of vertical and ground line via fitting points and line triming, which can avoid estimated depth drift generated by visual line triangulation. Furthermore, statistical information grid (STING) structure is adopted to detect plane using undistorted LiDAR points, while screened 3D mesh produced by 2D Delaunay triangulation are applied to determine correspondence between point as well as line features and plane. This strategy not only makes it more efficient to detect accurate surface but also avoids mis-assignment of features to plane. Both public dataset and man-mad data are implemented to verify progressiveness of proposed pipeline through comparison with state-of-the-art algorithm and ablation study.},

The MAB requires adaptive and online classification of data based on environment and vehicle specification. The SVM algorithm works inside the MAB algorithm to create adaptive online classification. The algorithm produces optimal torque for fuel consumption by choosing the best throttle angle based on online classification. The MAB algorithm chooses a suitable throttle angle to maintain a stoichiometric air/fuel ratio for the least emissions. The proposed controller adjusts engine torque to decrease fuel usage and CO and NOx emissions. The simulation results show that the proposed EMS can decrease vehicle fuel usage to 6.41 l/100km, 11.7% less than the vehicle without the controller.

This paper investigate the indoor combined positioning technology based on Ultra wide band (UWB) and inertial navigation system(INS), aiming to overcome the limitations of UWB in non-line of sight (NLOS) environment and cumulative errors of INS. For dealing with NLOS errors conveniently, we propose a two-layer NLOS error weakening method. Firstly, k-mediods clustering method is used to preprocess the obtained distance measurements, and some of the measurements containing NLOS errors are replaced with the measurements undisturbed by NLOS transmission. The processed result is processed again with gray Kalman filter, which reduces the process noise and NLOS error. A hybrid Gaussian fitting approach is suggested to determine the propagation conditions and simulate the likelihood of propagation through the residual after calculating the difference between the distance that was filtered and the distance that was measured. The two-sided correction technique changed the findings of the fitting method and the improved particle filtering method. The adaptive Kalman filter was then used to combine the INS and UWB location results to get the final location data. Simulation and experimental results show that the proposed algorithm owns higher localization accuracy and dependability.},

The dynamic network topology poses challenges to the high reliability needed for safe rail transportation information. To address this, we propose a cooperative medium access control (MAC) communication scheme based on distributed time division multiple access (DTDMA) for T2T communications. This scheme uses multiple nodes in their idle time slots to cooperatively forward failed data. To ensure the reliability and effectiveness of this cooperation, we propose a cooperative MAC protocol and frame structures combined with the automatic repeat request (ARQ) mechanism for reliability and effectiveness. Additionally, we propose a cooperative node selection method, modeled as a Markov decision process (MDP), to maximize system throughput and minimize overhead. For actions with hybrid space, we use the soft actor-critic (SAC) to set a continuous threshold and select nodes discretely. Simulations show that our proposed cooperative MAC protocol and cooperative node selection method effectively enhance transmission reliability.},

  abstract     = {Intelligent railway systems (IRS), based on the end-edge-cloud architecture, can significantly improve train operation safety and the quality of railway services by offering real-time data services. In this scenario, the data integrity protection of IRS data stored in the cloud is critical. Existing data integrity checking (DIC) schemes for user-oriented data storage systems provide proof of data possession by relying on the correctness of randomly sampled data blocks. However, in an IRS-oriented data analysis and storage system, the sampled data blocks are usually generated by massive different data sources. This situation makes it difficult for existing DIC schemes to achieve satisfactory auditing efficiency, rendering them inapplicable to IRS. To handle this challenge, this paper proposes a customized DIC scheme for IoT-edge computing assisted intelligent railway systems (IE-IRS). In particular, a cooperative data authenticator generation mechanism is designed to tackle the challenge of aggregating data authenticators from different sources, thus eliminating the additional communication and computational overhead of repeated verification of response proofs. Aiming at the massive and heterogeneous characteristics of IE-IRS data, a Chinese Remainder Theorem-based data aggregation scheme is developed on the base station side to realize multidimensional data processing. Finally, we formally prove the security of the proposed scheme under the defined security model, and performance analysis demonstrates that it is feasible for IE-IRS.},

At the kinetic level, two CESOs are developed to estimate the internal model uncertainties and external environmental disturbance, and antidisturbance kinetic control laws are designed subsequently. The proposed CESOs overcome the noises sensitivity problem of classical observers, and thus facilitate the practical implementation under measurement noises. The input-to-state stability of the closed-loop system is confirmed by the Lyapunov theory and cascade stability theory.

The intractable influence of disturbances and local nonlinear part on the design of fault detection thresholds is the principal difficulty in fault detection using the existing set membership estimation methods. To this end, a fault detection unknown input observer via a novel joint peak-to-peak analysis and zonotopic analysis threshold is proposed. Firstly, the disturbances are divided into decouplable and non-decouplable parts. An unknown input observer, designed with peak-to-peak performance criteria, is employed to achieve the decoupling of the decouplable disturbance part. Subsequently, based on the dynamic structure of the observer, the local non-linear part is represented as polyhedra through peak-to-peak analysis and zonotopic analysis, thereby providing an interval estimation for the system output. his method utilizes zonotopic analysis to mitigate the over-estimation issue in the initial stage inherent in traditional peak-to-peak performance-based interval estimation techniques. Furthermore, it retains the necessary degrees of freedom during the decoupling process of certain disturbances to optimize the observer's performance. Consequently, this approach significantly enhances the accuracy of the interval estimation as compared to existing methods. Moreover, the peak-to-peak performance of fault detection unknown input observer is analysed using the fuzzy basis-dependent Lyapunov function to decrease the conservatism. Lastly, simulations are analysed in order to validate the accuracy of the proposed thresholds.},

Secondly, the spatial correlation among the road sections may dynamically change over time, posing challenges for modeling. In addition, due to the complexity of urban traffic networks, capturing such non-linear spatial dependencies based on the global road structure may consume huge computational resources. To address these issues, this paper proposes an adaptive temporal graph attention network (ATGAN), which is implemented in two steps: 1) An outlier time series filter (OTSF) technique is introduced to mitigate the adverse impact of outlier points and to adaptively learn the distribution of fluctuations of traffic data; 2) We design a group attention temporal graph convolutional network (GA-TGCN) to model the spatiotemporal features among neighboring road sections, which is achieved by adjusting the spatial correlation matrix dynamically in each training epoch with attention mechanism. We evaluate the prediction performance of ATGAN on two real-world datasets and the results show that our model can achieve higher prediction accuracy in less computational time compared with baseline methods.},

Unlike the typical HVPSs results, the complete prior knowledge of the system parameters is not required. Firstly, to address the “explosion of complexity” challenge, an enhanced nonlinear PT filter is presented, which reduces the requirement of design parameter and improves the precision of linear filter. Then, an adaptive control strategy is proposed via backstepping technique and fuzzy approximation theory, which can realize the practical PT stability (PPTS) of HVPSs, and the asymptotic convergence of spacing errors is guaranteed by introducing smoothing function while meeting the constraint imposed by the performance funnel. Importantly, the complex Lyapunov function often associated with barrier Lyapunov function (BLF) technique can be avoided in this work. Finally, the validity of the theoretical results is verified by simulation of HVPSs under the predecessor-following communication topology.},

  abstract     = {Efficient and precise loop closure detection is essential for both autonomous vehicles and robotics. Currently, loop closure detection technologies can recognize locations using the similarity between environmental measurements. However, the inherent errors in these measurements present a significant challenge to detection performance, which has not been adequately addressed in the previous literature. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel modular loop closure detection scheme based on the temporal similarity of loop sequences to enhance the consistency of constructed maps and thereby improve detection performance. Specifically, the similarity and credibility of loop closure sequences, as well as their corresponding criteria, are defined based on the characteristics of loop closure occurrences in map construction. Fast filtering and accurate matching strategies have been developed based on the similarity and credibility of loop closure sequences. An independent recall strategy is then developed to mitigate the impact of measurement similarity errors on recall. Unlike traditional approaches, this method integrates temporal similarity with existing measurement similarity schemes in a loosely coupled manner, improving the performance and efficiency of loop closure detection in complex environments. The effectiveness of the proposed method is sufficiently validated using both the public KITTI dataset and real field-test vehicles. The results demonstrate significant improvements in loop closure detection, providing a solid foundation for the advancement of autonomous driving technologies.},

While the central-zonal E/E architecture provides significant advantages, including enhanced service integration, reduced wiring complexity, and seamless software updating, it also induces transmission competitions between time-sensitive services like steering and non-time-sensitive services such as information and entertainment, referred to as mixed-service package transmission competitions. These competitions can result in queuing delays within the control loop, termed mixed-service-induced loop delays, negatively impacting the stability and safety of ALC systems. To this end, a service-identification and active-scheduling (SIDAS) mechanism is proposed with a triple-plane framework consisting of strategy, plane and data planes. Further, a collaborative design scheme of control and communication is presented to ensure precise trajectory tracking and maintain the robustness and stability of ALC motion control in the presence of MSI loop delays.

  abstract     = {Fast-moving unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), serving as a messenger to visit ground vehicles (GVs) for information relays, can be applied to complex tasks in urban environments, such as air-ground cooperative urban rescue and UAV-assisted data collection. Existing work ensures that the UAV visits all GVs by assuming that it knows the motion parameters of GVs (e.g., velocities or paths) at any given time. However, in practice, GVs may not move with anticipated velocities due to motion uncertainties. This UAV path planning problem can be formulated as a Dynamic Dubins Traveling Salesman Problem with Uncertain Neighborhoods (DDTSPUN). The problem involves variables with complex interdependencies (e.g., the visiting sequence of the UAV to GVs and the access location of the UAV to GVs) and requires solving a sequence of uncertain encounter problems. To address the uncertainty in GV motion, we define robust neighborhoods and corridors and prove that the UAV can revisit GVs reliably by visiting these areas. By flying the UAV through robust areas, the DDTSPUN can be transformed into a deterministic optimization problem, namely Revisit-time-constrained Dubins Traveling Salesman Problem with Neighborhood (RDTSPN), which provides a simplified model and compresses the solution space. To address the RDTSPN, we propose an online heuristic path planning algorithm. It incorporates a gradient-based method for visiting robust neighborhoods and a sampling-based search strategy along robust corridors to obtain the Dubins paths of the UAV that achieve robust visit for each GV. Finally, the computational experiments, including representative instances, random instances with different scales, and an instance generated using real-world data, demonstrate its advantages over other state-of-the-art algorithms in obtaining the shortest path that satisfies UAV curvature constraints while ensuring robust access to all GVs.},

However, the over-conservative nature of tube-based MPC has limited its broader application. this paper proposes a stochastic tube MPC method subjected to state and control chance constraints. The probability distribution of system uncertainty is assumed as a prior knowledge. Leveraging covariance steering theory, the dynamic feedback gain mechanism of the perturbed system is designed accounting for the variability in the probability distribution of disturbances. Instead of robust positive invariant sets, the concept of probabilistic reachable sets is used to determine the constraint-tightening and convert chance constraints into deterministic ones. Furthermore, the discounted state chance constraints are incorporated in the cost function of nominal system, prioritizing near-term tracking performance over long-term behavior. A joint CarSim-Simulink simulation demonstrated that the proposed stochastic tube MPC method reduces conservatism and enhances the tracking performance. Further verification through hardware-in-loop (HIL) experiment confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

Serving as the upper-layer component of path planning, it provides the global reference path for the local trajectory planning module. However, the majority of conventional methods focus solely on optimizing path length, which can lead to redundant obstacle avoidance maneuvers by the lower-layer local planner or even planning failure. Furthermore, graph-searching methods commonly suffer from prolonged computation times and low efficiency. To address these challenges, this paper proposed a global path planning method based on deep reinforcement learning that integrates artificial potential fields. The method expanded the network structure of Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) by employing the constructed potential field to conduct supervised learning on two additional critic networks. Subsequently, the predicted values from the critic network were integrated into the actor network to guide agents in choosing states with smaller potential field values. Additionally, to mitigate the time cost of retraining due to changes in the global environment, a risk assessment module employing Monte Carlo random sampling was incorporated. The computed risk value was subsequently integrated into the network as the new state. Experimental results show that our method reduces computation time by 38.64% compared to conventional methods. The convergence is 40.48% faster and the path potential value is 95.72% lower than other reinforcement learning methods.},

This paper proposes a spatiotemporal calibration algorithm for the fusion system of GNSS data, LiDAR data, and visual data with the inertial sensor as the central coordinate system. First, we use the pseudo-distance information of GNSS to construct the space-time calibration model of GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) relative to IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit). Second, based on the reprojection principle, we construct a spatiotemporal calibration model of visual images relative to the IMU. Then, according to the distance formula of the LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) points cloud, the space-time calibration model of the LiDAR points cloud relative to the IMU is established. Finally, we use the nonlinear optimization algorithm to obtain the spatiotemporal parameters. We have done extensive simulations based on simulated data and publicly available real-world datasets. The simulation results show that using the proposed calibration model yields spatiotemporal parameter accuracy superior to existing calibration algorithms and exhibits some degree of robustness to the noise in IMU data. It achieves approximately 40% improvement in position estimation accuracy with the open-source odometry and the real-world datasets while ensuring good safety and reliability under high computational efficiency.},

This paper proposes a novel content caching framework tailored to DT-enabled IoVs, where DTs selectively cache on-demand contents on edge devices (i.e., cellular base stations and roadside units) managed by the edge service manager (ESM) along the VUE's trip to avoid backbone congestion yet save download time. However, ESMs are inherently selfish and reluctant to contribute resources to cache contents without benefits. Furthermore, considering the diverse trajectories of vehicles, it is inefficient to cache data along a single path. To address these challenges, we propose ACDV, which first models the interactions between the ESMs and DTs as a Stackelberg game to incentivize ESMs to actively participate in the content caching process. We then deploy a Markov model to predict the VUE distribution, which enables DTs to cache contents with a focus on predicted trajectories. To save storage costs, we derive an upper bound of content sizes that the VUE can download within a limited network connection time. Considering the lack of network information and users' private utility model in practical scenarios, we further develop a learning-based algorithm to find the optimal pricing scheme and content size strategies of ESMs and DTs. Through extensive simulations, we show that our proposal can effectively find the optimal strategy and achieve a fast convergence speed and high-level performance compared to the baselines.},

A correct and timely operation can reduce the probability of collisions, enable vehicles to avoid potential hazards on the road, and enhance overall safety.

Currently, the dominant research on this problem is based on the Deep Q-Network (DQN) approach and some of its improved variants to solve it. However, limited by deep networks, there are inevitably problems such as complex network structures and numerous parameters to be optimized, which will prolong the response time for self-driving vehicles to make decisions, and further increase the safety risks for drivers. The emergence of the Broad Learning System (BLS) offers a new scheme, which can overcome the drawbacks of the deep network mentioned above. Considering the importance of response time for vehicle safety decisions, we proposed the Double Broad Q-Network (DBQN) algorithm, which replaces the deep network inside Double Deep Q-Network (DDQN) with BLS, to solve lane-changing and overtaking problems. Finally, we designed a new reward function based on three scenarios, and experiments have shown that our method can reduce response times and collision rates, thereby improving vehicle driving safety.},

The transport sector accounts for around 30% of greenhouse gas emissions, which need to be decarbonized urgently. Railway electrification is one of the low-carbon solutions, but it still relies on power grids causing carbon emissions. To further decarbonize electric railways, the renewable energy sources (RESs) and energy storage system (ESS) integration scheme for railway traction power network has been proposed. This paper developed the energy management system to calculate the energy flow and global cost. Moreover, contact wire loss and conversion loss were considered. The optimization problem to find the optimal capacity and location of the PV farm, wind farm and energy storage system to achieve the lowest global daily costs was solved by the Brute Force Algorithm. The traction network of the High Speed 2 Railway in the U.K. has been taken as a case study. Results revealed that the global cost and carbon emissions are reduced considerably with both ESS and RESs installed. In the scenario of the ESS alone, 1.3% of the global cost is saved by capturing the regenerative energy and reusing it. Furthermore, this figure goes up to 10% and 62% when the PV and wind farms are integrated, respectively. When considering all variables, it is found that installing the wind farm is a more economical option than the PV farm. The study also shows that the optimal locations to install the plants and ESS vary by scenario.},

A conventional method for near-field localization in the presence of MC is the three-dimensional (3D) multiple signal classification (MUSIC) technique, which, however, suffers from extremely high computational complexity. Recently, two-dimensional (2D) search alternatives have been presented, exhibiting increased complexity still for direction-dependent MC scenarios. In this paper, we devise a low complexity one-dimensional (1D) iterative method based on an oblique projection operator (IMOP) that estimates direction-dependent MC and the locations of multiple near-field sources. The proposed method first estimates the initial direction of arrival (DOA) using an approximate wavefront model, and then, computes the initial MC and range of the near-field source using an exact wavefront model. Afterwards, at each iteration, the oblique projection operator is used to isolate components associated with one source from those of other sources. The DOA and range of this one source are estimated using the exact wavefront model and 1D searches. Finally, the direction-dependent MC is estimated for each pair of the estimated DOA and range. The performance of the proposed near-field localization approach is comprehensively investigated and verified using both a full-wave electromagnetic solver and synthetic simulations. It is showcased that our IMOP scheme performs almost similarly to a state-of-the-art approach but with a 42 times less computational complexity.},

  abstract     = {This article addresses the issue of bipartite consensus for Markov jump multi-agent systems subjected to bounded disturbance and input constraints under mode-dependent switching topology. To surmount the challenge of handling disturbance, hard constraints and bump suppression, which are not considered and difficult to deal with in existing literature on solutions to algebraic Riccati equation, a novel bipartite robust predictive bumpless control algorithm is proposed with integrating $H_\infty$ performance. To be specific, the offline designing process of bipartite controller parameters is firstly performed by investigating terminal constraint set and robust invariant set. In this sense, $H_\infty$ type cost function and consensus error state bump cost are constructed for achieving disturbance attenuation and suppressing bump in error state, respectively. This further avoids possible counterproductive results caused by setting constraints on bump with a small gain. Next, based on the optimization prediction dynamics, perturbation state of controller is optimized online for each agent, which efficiently reduces the computational burden compared with conventional online and efficient model predictive control. Furthermore, the recursive feasibility of the proposed method and stochastic stability of error dynamics are theoretically guaranteed. Finally, an application to rotary-wing air vehicles is utilized to verify the potential of theoretic results.},

  abstract     = {The integrated sonar and communication (ISC) system plays an important role in smart ocean engineering, owing to its convenience in environmental perception and communication. The characteristics of the integrated signal and the signal processing methods are critical to the ISC system's performance. Orthogonal chirp division multiplexing (OCDM) signal is considered as a potential integrated signal due to its robustness in communication as well as excellent detection performance. However, insufficient bandwidth and subcarrier spacing can significantly degrade the performance of OCDM-based ISC system due to the severe Doppler expansion of the underwater acoustic (UWA) channel. In this paper, we introduce the dictionary theory into the multicarrier signal design and propose a new Dictionary-theory-based orthogonal chirp division multiplexing (Dic-OCDM) signal. We consider the chirp signal as the basis function. The geometric transformation in structure dictionary design is implemented to rearrange the basis function, resulting in the dictionary-theory-based discrete Fresnel transform (Dic-DFnT) matrix. The Dic-DFnT matrix is regarded as the modulation matrix of Dic-OCDM and provides a larger subcarrier spacing without requiring additional bandwidth. Besides, a Dic-OCDM based ISC system is designed, and corresponding signal processing methods for detection and communication are given. Simulation and lake experiment results attest to the effectiveness of our proposed Dic-OCDM-based ISC system for underwater active detection and communication.},

To reduce the bandwidth cost, some tile-based 360° video streaming systems split video spatially into variable-sized coarse-grained tiles by grouping areas with the similar quality levels. However, these approaches do not minimize the number of tiles, resulting in considerable overhead in re-encoding the boundaries between small tiles. To improve the coding efficiency of 360° video, we propose a new video tiling scheme called TRAS, by using the convex decomposition of concave polygon. Meanwhile, to maximize user's quality of experience (QoE), we propose a greedy bitrate selection algorithm by considering the tile size and coding efficiency. The experiment results demonstrate that, compared with the state-of-the-art approaches, TRAS reduces the coding overhead by about 18% and significantly improves the video quality by about 5 dB.},

In this paper, we analyze the performance of the AAV-assisted AmBC network over Nakagami-$m$ fading channels. In this network, there are two different transmission links: a legacy link and multiple AmBC links, where one of the AmBC links is randomly selected for backscattering communication. For the randomly selected AmBC link, two main factors caused information outages are analyzed: the energy outage and the interference outage. Based on the probability density function of the Nakagami-m fading channel gain, the closed-form expressions of the outage probabilities are derived by using the Gauss-Laguerre approximation. Furthermore, we calculate the asymptotic outage probability, ergodic capacity, and diversity gain through theoretical derivation. For the air-to-ground legacy link, the reasons of the primary user's outage are analyzed as the transmission outage caused by air-ground channel attenuation and the interference outage caused by the high transmission power of the AmBC link. Building upon different cases, the closed-form expressions of the outage probabilities are also calculated. In addition, the related performance of the legacy link is also further studied. The simulation results show the performance of the two mentioned links under different parameters and verify the effectiveness of the network.},

  abstract     = {Device-free localization (DFL) is a potential positioning technique that can localize targets without requiring any device. Radio tomographic imaging (RTI) is one of the most favorable DFL methods and has many advantages over other methods. In multi-target localization indoors, target-affected wireless signal is inevitably contaminated with non-negligible interference of noise and complex multipath. Existing RTI positioning models utilize contaminated signals for multi-target localization, resulting in low positioning performance. To decrease the effect of contaminated signals, we propose a novel RTI positioning model based on the intersection map of wireless links (InterMap-NRTI). InterMap-NRTI utilizes the statistical method to determine wireless links mainly affected by targets and the interpolation method to complement the wireless links that are interrupted due to hardware malfunction and targets' obstruction. The next step is to formulate the definitions to extract high-intersections closest to the target based on the intersection map of target-affected links. Subsequently, we establish a novel positioning model based on signal strengths of wireless links and high-intersections in each cluster determined by DBSCAN algorithm using a saddle surface model. Finally, Hooke-Jeeves method is used to search for the optimal solution of the positioning model. The experiment shows that InterMap-NRTI's accuracy and identification accuracy rate outperforms other methods by an average of more than 30% and more than 14%, respectively, and InterMap-NRTI has a good tolerance for scenario layout.},

  abstract     = {Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) has become a promising technology in current sixth-generation (6G) wireless communications due to its ability to support both communication and sensing. Existing works regarding ISAC channels mainly focus on far-field propagation conditions based on plane wave assumption. However, with the deployment of ultra-massive multiple-in multiple-out (MIMO), the far-field assumption may no longer hold, as the communication and sensing propagation distances can become comparable to the antenna size. To address this issue, we propose a three-dimensional MIMO channel model that captures the characteristics of communication and sensing channels in ISAC environments, considering near-field propagation conditions. Additionally, we distinguish the communication and sensing propagation environments by employing different effective scatterer distributions. In the model, the sensing channel is divided into target sensing and environmental sensing components, whereas the communication channel is divided into line-of-sight and non-line-of-sight components. The weighted sum of each component in communication and sensing channels results in accurate channel representations. Based on the proposed model, we derive and thoroughly investigate space-time-frequency correlation function, normalized absolute error function, and channel capacity. A key observation is that the correlation between communication and sensing channels is high in dense scatterer environments, which implies that the communication channel can be recovered from the sensing channel. Error function results indicate that the proposed channel model achieves fairly high accuracy in ultra-massive MIMO scenarios. These findings provide essential support for the development of ISAC systems in future 6G wireless communications.},

First, the capacity of hybrid BDPSK-BPSK is derived and demonstrates a significant gain over PSAM-BPSK. Next, we propose layered polar codes with hybrid BDPSK-BPSK modulation as the transmission scheme. The polar codes are partitioned into two layers corresponding to the BDPSK and BPSK modulation, respectively. Then, two reception methods, separate decoder with in-between channel estimation (SD-CE) and lasting decoder with inside channel estimation (LD-CE), are developed. The difference is that LD-CE works continuously across two layers and performs path decision only once at the end of the second layer, while SD-CE decodes two layers separately and makes decisions at the end of both layers. Finally, it is shown with simulation that the layered polar codes with hybrid BDPSK-BPSK modulation could offer significantly enhanced performance compared to PSAM-BPSK over fast varying channels.},

  abstract     = {By introducing orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) modulation, the challenge of channel estimation (CE) in high-speed scenarios is alleviated. Nonetheless, the existing embedded pilot-based CE in OTFS systems significantly consumes user equipment (UE) energy and reduces system spectral efficiency (SE). Meanwhile, the superimposed pilot-based approach encounters the substantial challenge of superimposed interference. To tackle these issues, inspired by the advantages of differential modulation, differential modulation-aided CE in OTFS systems is proposed in this paper. At the UE, transmitted data is modulated using differential modulation to eliminate the need for pilot transmission and guard interval insertion. This strategy effectively reduces UE energy consumption and improves system SE. Especially, differential modulation is applied in the delay-time (DT) domain, which is less susceptible to Doppler spread compared to the delay-Doppler (DD) domain. At the base station (BS), employing a decision feedback-based scheme based on differential demodulation achieves the initial features of CE. Then, by leveraging the significant features of wireless channels in the DD domain, we design a lightweight network to enhance CE accuracy. This lightweight network consists of only one hidden layer, with the number of neurons in the hidden layer being identical to that of the input layer. This is attributed to the fusion learning involving differential detection-based decision feedback CE and the lightweight network assistance. Simulation results indicate that, in comparison to classic CE methods in OTFS systems, the proposed method enhances system SE, reduces UE energy consumption, and improves the CE accuracy.},

  abstract     = {This paper focuses on the challenge of jointly optimizing location and path loss exponent (PLE) in distance-dependent noise. Departing from the conventional independent noise model used in localization and path loss exponent estimation problems, we consider a more realistic model incorporating distance-dependent noise variance, as revealed in recent theoretical analyses and experimental results. The distance-dependent noise introduces a complex noise model with unknown noise power and PLE, resulting in an exceptionally challenging non-convex and nonlinear optimization problem. In this study, we address a joint localization and path loss exponent estimation problem encompassing distance-dependent noise, unknown parameters, and uncertainties in sensor node locations. To surmount the intractable nonlinear and non-convex objective function inherent in the problem, we introduce a variational Bayesian learning-based framework that enables the joint optimization of localization, path loss exponent, and reference noise parameters by leveraging an effective approximation to the true posterior distribution. Furthermore, the proposed joint learning algorithm provides an iterative closed-form solution and exhibits superior performance in terms of computational complexity compared to existing algorithms. Computer simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm approaches the performance of the Bayesian Cramer-Rao bound (BCRB), achieves localization performance comparable to the (maximum likelihood-Gaussian message passing) ML-GMP algorithm in some cases, and outperforms the other comparison algorithm in all cases.},

In the proposed scheme, by virtue of dynamically shifting the antenna activation patterns and energy allocation patterns, an untrusted user located near the base station (BS) can only successfully decode its own information generated by modulated symbols, while the information encoded by antenna and energy combination indices intended for other trusted users located far away from the BS cannot be decoded. Additionally, the secrecy rate is derived to evaluate the performance of the proposed NOMA networks.

  abstract     = {The conjunction of edge intelligence and the ever-growing Internet-of-Things (IoT) network heralds a new era of collaborative machine learning, with federated learning (FL) emerging as the most prominent paradigm. With the growing interest in these learning schemes, researchers started addressing some of their most fundamental limitations. Indeed, conventional FL with a central aggregator presents a single point of failure and a network bottleneck. To bypass this issue, decentralized FL where nodes collaborate in a peer-to-peer network has been proposed. Despite the latter's efficiency, communication costs and data heterogeneity remain key challenges in decentralized FL. In this context, we propose a novel scheme, called opportunistic communication-efficient decentralized federated learning, a.k.a., OCD-FL, consisting of a systematic FL peer selection for collaboration, aiming to achieve maximum FL knowledge gain while reducing energy consumption. Experimental results demonstrate the capability of OCD-FL to achieve similar or better performances than the fully collaborative FL, while significantly reducing consumed energy by at least 5% and up to 80%.},

However, with the increasing scale of artificial intelligence models, the limited resources on edge devices often become a bottleneck for efficient fine-tuning. To address this challenge, federated split learning (FedSL) implements collaborative training across the edge devices and the server through model splitting. In this paper, we propose a lightweight FedSL scheme, that further alleviates the training burden on resource-constrained edge devices by pruning the client-side model dynamicly and using quantized gradient updates to reduce computation overhead. Additionally, we apply random dropout to the activation values at the split layer to reduce communication overhead. We conduct theoretical analysis to quantify the convergence performance of the proposed scheme. Finally, simulation results verify the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed lightweight FedSL in wireless network environments.},

To fill this gap, in this paper the coverage probability (CP) for location-dependent users with RIS and without RIS is derived in closed-form expressions, through which the performance of RIS can be readily evaluated for different types of users. For some special practical cases, these closed-form expressions of CP can be simplified to very simple forms, which quantitatively reveal the potential of RIS on CP improvement. Also, the closed-form expressions of CP for various types of users with IM are derived to give a comparison with RIS. Furthermore, by employing the Jensen's inequality and Taylor expansion, the performance assessment of our analytical results and an accurate approximation for the case that RISs are randomly deployed are provided. The theoretical results are consistent with simulation results, which demonstrate that for different types of users under different performance requirements, proper choice for the methods of enhancing user performance (i.e., RIS-assisted or IM, and hence the operation model of RIS) is necessary.},

To explore this potential, this paper proposes an Efficient Neural Network Based Rate Control (ENNRC) for intra-frame in Versatile Video Coding (VVC). In particular, a neural network based bits prediction model is developed to directly map video content features to predicted bits, serving as guidance for bit allocation at both the frame and Coding Tree Unit (CTU)-levels.

Firstly, a consensus mechanism based on credit contribution ($CC$) is proposed by combining the sensing ability of secondary users (SUs) in cooperative spectrum sharing (CSS) with the consensus mechanism of blockchain, in which SUs can increase $CC$ by strengthening their sensing ability. However, improving the sensing ability means increasing the sensing time while reducing the access time. Therefore, there is a tradeoff between sensing time and access time in the perspective of blockchain. Secondly, to obtain $CC$ of SUs, a $CC$ evaluation scheme based on extended sensing time and transmission results is designed. In addition, under the constraint of $CC$, it is proved that the tradeoff between sensing and access in the perspective of blockchain can be solved by the golden section algorithm.

  abstract     = {Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) are a transformative technology for improving wireless communication and localization accuracy. This study focuses on optimizing RIS placement in the near-field (NF) scenario to minimize the position error bound (PEB) in single-input single-output (SISO) systems. Closed-form expressions for the fisher information matrix (FIM) and the PEB have been derived to evaluate localization performance. The analysis reveals that the RIS placement significantly affects localization accuracy. In this paper, the exhaustive search method is used to make a benchmark to test the correctness of the main problem-solving method, a meta-heuristic algorithm. This method is called gray wolf optimizer (GWO) and offers a more computationally efficient, continuous approach by imitating the behavior of gray wolves. Simulation results show that both methods effectively enhance localization accuracy, with the GWO method achieving superior performance in terms of computational efficiency and PEB minimization. The study highlights that strategic RIS placement can lead to substantial improvements in localization precision, making RIS a vital component for future wireless communication networks. This work provides a comprehensive framework for optimizing RIS deployment in NF communication scenarios, offering practical insights for enhancing localization accuracy in practical applications.},

The integration of channel coding with modulation, known as bit-interleaved coded modulation (BICM), is widely utilized in communication and broadcasting systems. In particular, iterative message passing processes between soft demapper and decoder have proven effective in improving the bit error rate (BER) performance in the bit-interleaved LDPC coded modulation with iterative decoding (BILCM-ID) systems. This study proposes a novel approach for representing the iterative state in the probability domain for high-order modulation within the BILCM-ID process.

To reveal important insights for system design, asymptotic analyses are performed on the ER in the region of high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). It is observed that the ER converges to some constant in the high-SNR regime and the convergence rate is influenced by the diversity order and the array gain. On this basis, a novel array gain maximization problem is formulated, and two efficient algorithms are proposed to improve the array gain and the ER.

To ensure superior dual-function performance simultaneously, we design the multi-layer cascading beamformer by maximizing the sum rate of the users while optimally shaping the normalized beam pattern for detection. A dual-normalized differential gradient descent ($\text{D}^{3}$) algorithm is further proposed to solve the resulting non-convex multi-objective problem (MOP), where gradient differences and dual normalization are employed to ensure a flexible trade-off between communication and sensing objectives at the gradient level, providing finer control over the optimization process.

Specifically, two coordinated multi-antenna base stations (BSs) send information to multiple devices assisted by two STAR-RISs. To improve the transmission rate of the system, a sum rate maximization problem for the joint optimization of the power allocation at BSs and the transmission and reflection coefficients at STAR-RISs is formulated for the proposed SRaNC. To make the problem tractable, we employ the fractional programming (FP) to design an iterative algorithm, which exploits the penalty function and successive convex approximation (SCA). Numerical results demonstrate that the SRaNC scheme outperforms other benchmark schemes in terms of the sum rate. Furthermore, when the total number of antennas at the BSs is large, the allocation of antenna quantity between different BSs has a marginal effect on the sum rate.},

Firstly, the probability density function of the desired signal and the equivalent noise are analytically calculated for M-ary pulse amplitude modulation, M-ary quadrature amplitude modulation, and M-ary phase-shift keying, respectively. Next, based on these analyses, the novel analytical expressions for the SER of different modulations are derived, which is verified by numerical results. Then, in order to enhance the SER performance of all users in different geographical locations, a geometric programming based power control (GPPC) algorithm is proposed. Finally, numerical results show that compared with four benchmark schemes of the full power algorithm, the fractional power control algorithm, the traditional max-min fairness power control algorithm, and the genetic algorithm, the proposed GPPC algorithm can effectively minimize the maximum SER among all users through collaborative control of the power control coefficient while ensuring lower computational complexity.},

In this paper, a general channel model with a tractable boundary is characterized and the near- and far-field of IRS are distinguished by applying different power scaling laws (e.g. additive and multiplicative path loss) for transmission signal in the channel as well as utilizing Rayleigh distance to demarcate the fields, based on which we analyzed the performance of IRS-assisted networks. Specifically, the impact of IRS element size is modeled into the near- and far-field effects, which directly alters the near-field boundary and influences the receiving signal power of user equipment (UE). In addition, the conditional signal power distribution is characterized as a piecewise function based on the division of Rayleigh distance and the interference Laplace function is rederived accordingly. The numerical results analyze the impact of near- and far-field effects, as well as different IRS parameters, on coverage probability, which demonstrates the significant variation of network performance compared to the far-field assumption when system parameter changes.},

  abstract     = {To achieve precise timing accuracy under phase distortion for 6G high-precision services, this paper presents two technological research approaches and proposes corresponding solutions, along with future prospects. The first approach involves signal design, where synchronization signals are crafted based on the distributed concatenation of a binary/complex sequence and its modification. The second approach focuses on deep learning, proposing a Convolutional Neural Network. Considering factors such as timing detection performance, computational complexity, memory usage, and the correlation between the wireless channel during offline training and the one during online application, performance evaluations provide insights into the challenges of deep-learning based approaches. These evaluations suggest that signal-design based approaches will be preferred at least until the advent of 6G. However, the paper also provides deep-learning approaches that aim to overcome these challenges beyond 6G.},

Specifically, we first derive an analytical expression for a lower bound of the achievable mutual information (MI). Then, we derive an analytical expression for an upper bound of the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence for the covertness, based on which we conceive an optimization problem to maximize the covert MI under the constraints on covertness, IRS coefficients and average transmit power. We utilize the semidefinite relaxation (SDR) technique along with the Gaussian randomization method to achieve high-quality solutions for both the transmit power and IRS reflection beamforming. We further propose a low-complexity algorithm, in which we derive analytical expressions for the transmit power and phase shift of each IRS element. Our numerical results demonstrate that, with finite-alphabet inputs, the devised IRS-aided scheme can achieve considerable covert performance gain on the basis of the scheme having no IRS.},

CHP estimation can be accomplished in traffic time slots with little need for additional dedicated time slots. Hence, channel changes can be tracked in time. Furthermore, a low-complexity solution for the optimal transmit beamforming (TxBF) weight is provided on the basis of CHP estimation results.

Nevertheless, existing ML approaches require a large amount of computational resources and data samples in the new scenarios or for different types of mobile devices (MD). To address the issues, we first propose a hierarchical framework that divides the deep neural network (DNN) for localization into two parts and deploys them on the server and MD, respectively. The on-device part can estimate a coarse location of the MD with local information, and the other part can improve the accuracy with global information on the server. Then, we develop a meta-learning-based training algorithm that trains the DNN in different scenarios or with different types of MDs. Then, it is implemented in unseen scenarios or on new types of MDs, where a small number of data samples are available for fine-tuning the DNN. By implementing a learning-based localization algorithm in the hierarchical framework, the root mean square error (RMSE) achieved by the on-device DNN is 1.18 m and the inference time is less than 20 ms. With the help of global information at the server, the RMSE is reduced to 0.6 m.},

Firstly, using non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA), a NOMA-ALOHA-based double-layer (DL) primary-secondary random access (RA) scheme is proposed, where the users are divided into two groups based on user priorities, i.e., primary users and secondary users. Secondly, to enhance the capacity of RA and overcome the non-linear hardware limitations of the transceiver, with the successive interference cancellation (SIC) a DL primary-secondary signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) level allocation scheme is proposed. Based on the conventional single-layer SINR level allocation, the SINR scale factor of the secondary system is derived, by which the secondary SINR levels are inserted into the primary ones. Thirdly, a required generation and random preemption (RG-preemption) policy is proposed. In this policy, at the beginning of each update period, with the requirement by access point, all users simultaneously generate and randomly transmit their status updates. During the remainder of the update delivery period, new random generation preempts the current update until the update delivery is successful or the current update period ends. Finally, using phase-type distribution, the work presents the derivations regarding absorbing Markov chain, one-step transition matrix, and the AoI of the secondary user.},

  abstract     = {It is crucial to recognize the sky and ground waves, i.e., to determine the delays of the waves, in enhanced long-range navigation (eLoran) systems. However, the performance of most existing algorithms sharply decreases when the delay differences $\Delta \tau$ between the sky and ground waves are small or the signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) are low. In this paper, after transforming the originally time-domain sky-ground waves recognition problem to the frequency domain, we interestingly find that it can be effectively addressed by the deterministic maximum likelihood (DML). Thus, we design a DML-based sky-ground waves recognition algorithm. The verification results based on both the simulated and the realistic data show that the DML outperforms the four representative algorithms, including the IFFT, the FOC-MUSIC, the WRELAX, and the LM, in terms of the success rate in recognizing the groundwave, particularly in situations with small $\Delta \tau$ or low SNRs. Numerically, compared to the IFFT, the LM, and the FOC-MUSIC, the success rate achieved by the DML is improved by 67.11%, 66.67%, and 64.19% respectively, and the WRELAX fails to work, in a challenging situation of SNR $=0$ dB and $\Delta \tau =37\ \mu s$.},

To address this issue, we propose a novel online UAV trajectory optimization approach for the weighted sum-predicted posterior Cramér-Rao bound (PCRB) minimization, which guarantees the feasibility of satisfying the two mentioned constraints. Specifically, our proposed approach designs the UAV trajectory by solving two subproblems: the candidate trajectory optimization problem and the energy-aware backup trajectory optimization problem. Then, we propose an algorithm converging to the global optimal solution to the candidate trajectory optimization problem based on Dinkelbach's transform and the Lasserre hierarchy. The energy-aware backup trajectory optimization problem is efficiently solved by the successive convex approximation method.

Subsequently, the system effective capacity is maximized by the joint optimization of the beamforming vector, phase shifts, transmit power, and time slots.

  abstract     = {The integration of intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) into over-the-air computation (AirComp) is an effective solution for reducing the computational mean squared error (MSE) via its high passive beamforming gain. Prior works on IRS aided AirComp generally rely on the full instantaneous channel state information (I-CSI), which is not applicable to large-scale systems due to its heavy signalling overhead. To address this issue, we propose a novel multi-timescale transmission protocol. In particular, the receive beamforming at the access point (AP) is pre-determined based on the static angle information and the IRS phase-shifts are optimized relying on the long-term statistical CSI. With the obtained AP receive beamforming and IRS phase-shifts, the effective low-dimensional I-CSI is exploited to determine devices' transmit power in each I-CSI coherence block, thus substantially reducing the signalling overhead. Theoretical analysis unveils that the achievable MSE scales on the order of ${\mathcal O}({K/({{N^{2}}M})})$, where $M$, $N$, and $K$ are the number of AP antennas, IRS elements, and devices, respectively. We also prove that the channel-inversion power control is asymptotically optimal for large $N$, which reveals that the full power transmission policy is not needed for lowering the power consumption of energy-limited devices.},

  abstract     = {Sums of random variables play a fundamental role in assessing the performance of wireless communication systems. This work introduces novel and exact formulations for the probability density function and the cumulative distribution function of the sum of ratios of $L$ independent $\alpha$-$\mu$ variates. These formulations are presented in terms of tractable fast-converging series. To the best of the author's knowledge, these are the first reported exact solutions for the sum statistics of ratios of $\alpha$-$\mu$ variates. Based upon these expressions, we analyze the performance of equal-gain combining and maximal-ratio combining diversity receivers operating over composite fading channels, i.e., in the presence of both multipath and shadowing fading effects. For the analysis, we consider that multiphath fading follows an $\alpha$-$\mu$ distribution, whereas shadowing fading is governed by an inverse $\alpha$-$\mu$ distribution. Exact and asymptotic expressions are obtained for the key performance metrics of the system, specifically the outage probability and the average-symbol error rate. Interestingly, the derived performance metrics demonstrated that the system's diversity gain solely depends on the multipath distribution parameters and the number of branches of the combining receivers. The validity of all our findings is confirmed via Monte Carlo simulations.},

  abstract     = {The convergence of mobile crowdsensing and the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) has advanced image forensics in intelligent transportation systems. However, the large influx of homogenized sensing images during evidence collection causes a massive waste of communication and storage, hindering forensic analysis. Additionally, due to privacy concerns, these images are often encrypted and uploaded as different ciphertexts, introducing new challenges for deduplication. Hence, securely eliminating these near-duplicate images is essential to improve forensic efficiency and privacy preservation in crowdsensing vehicular networks. In this paper, we propose a Secure Approximate Deduplication scheme (SA-Dedup) for forensic images in fog-assisted crowdsensing vehicular networks. In the scheme, we divide geospatial grid cells based on different positional perspectives to improve the deduplication efficiency while obscuring precise vehicular positions. In each grid cell, we design a novel encrypted approximate matching method to detect similar images based on Function Secret Sharing (FSS) and Boneh-Goh-Nissim-based Homomorphic Encryption (BGN-based HE). In the deduplication process, vehicles' real identities are concealed to enhance identity privacy and can be traceable in case of malicious behavior. Further, the designed incentive mechanism can encourage vehicles to provide valuable sensing images for forensic tasks. Finally, the theoretical analysis and the experiment results demonstrate that SA-Dedup can implement secure and effective near-deduplication of forensic images.},

In this paper, we propose an RL-based environment-aware vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication scheme to choose the transmit power and frequency channel, which exploits environmental features such as building layouts and traffic density in the state formulation to indicate the future channel gains, interference levels and jamming signal strength. This scheme enhances the utility as a weighted sum of signal-to-interference-plus-noise rate, communication energy consumption, frequency-hopping costs, and a penalty factor for dissatisfying quality-of-service requirements to avoid choosing risky V2I communication policies. The movement trajectories of vehicles, parameter of vehicular channel model and environmental features are used to formulate the simulated V2I communication experiences for updating Q-values in each time slot to accelerate learning speed. A deep version is further proposed to extract features of radio propagation in the area with variable traffic density and complex building layouts, as well as to address the quantization errors of the jamming signal strength, channel gain and interference levels in the RL state formulation, thereby improving communication reliability and energy efficiency. Experimental results based on three vehicles driving in campus area show the performance gains of transmission latency and communication energy consumption compared with the benchmark against a smart jammer.},

However, limited transmission power and size of the UAV make it challenging to use advanced communication models while meeting the growing need for high data rates and energy efficiency (EE). In this paper, we study an energy-efficient UAV network enhanced by an intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) with simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT), where the IRS is employed to improve the EE of ground user equipment (GUE). The goal is to maximize the average EE by jointly controlling the UAV's flying route, IRS phase steer, UAV transmission power, and power splitting (PS) ratio of the energy transfer technology. The formulated problem of maximizing the average EE is non-convex and thus challenging to be solved. To address this problem, we propose a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approach. The modified reward function is implemented to enhance the efficiency of the DRL agent, which is formulated based on the expected signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) map. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed DRL algorithm achieves lower energy consumption, higher data rate, and improved EE compared to the comparison algorithm.},

At present, user privacy preservation in MCS has attracted great attention, but there are still some shortcomings in the existing research. On the one hand, most research only focuses on privacy preservation mechanisms for either task allocation or data collection independently. On the other hand, most privacy preservation research relies on the fully trusted MCS platform, which is too idealistic in reality. In view of this, we propose a two-stage privacy preservation framework for MCS, which is composed of Differential Privacy based Task Allocation Scheme (DPTAS) and Privacy-aware Heterogeneous Data Collection Scheme (PHDCS). Specifically, DPTAS designs perturbation function based on differential privacy technology to preserve user bid privacy during task allocation. PHDCS designs different data collection methods to ensure user privacy and data quality. Both theoretical derivation and simulation results show that DPTAS can reduce social cost and has excellent performance on privacy preservation. Moreover, the performance of PHDCS is of high accuracy, low time consumption and good capability for privacy preservation.},

  abstract     = {In this study, we design a lightweight maximum-capacity path selection strategy for delay-sensitive services in satellite networks (SNs). Leveraging inter-satellite links (ISLs), large-scale SNs can offer low latency and high bandwidth for real-time communication (RTC). However, realizing data-intensive RTC over intermittent ISLs necessitates effective path selection algorithms that consider both dynamic link capacities and diverse latency requirements. Utilizing the enhanced time-discretization model, we represent SNs as time-varying graphs and formulate the delay-bounded maximum-capacity path selection as an integer linear programming problem. The branch-and-bound approach has a time complexity of $\mathcal {O}(|\mathcal {L}^{\tau }| \cdot (3 |\mathcal {V}^{\tau }| + |\mathcal {L}^{\tau }| - 1)^{|\mathcal {L}^{\tau }|})$, where $|\mathcal {V}^{\tau }|$ and $|\mathcal {L}^{\tau }|$ represent the number of available nodes and links during time window $\tau$. By adopting an alternative path flow-based formulation, it can be addressed using a $k$-shortest path-based method. However, it incurs a factorial worst-case time complexity of $\mathcal{O}(|\mathcal {V}^{\tau }|! \cdot |\mathcal {V}^{\tau }|^{3})$, making it impractical for large-scale scenarios. To solve the problem in an efficient manner, we propose a graph-based method that combines bounds estimation, graph filtering operation and bisection method accelerated by two techniques, enabling optimal solutions with a complexity of $\mathcal {O}(\log _{2}(f_{\textit {ub}}^{\tau }-f_{\textit {lb}}^{\tau }) \cdot (|\mathcal {L}_{\tau }| + |\mathcal {V}_{\tau }|\log _{2}(|\mathcal {V}_{\tau }|))$, where $f_{\textit {ub}}^{\tau }$ and $f_{\textit {lb}}^{\tau }$ denote the upper and lower bounds of link capacity, respectively.

While Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS), such as GPS, provide meter-level accuracy, their limitations in urban environments and high power consumption make them unsuitable for many use cases. Consequently, fingerprint-based localization methods leveraging existing sensor infrastructures have emerged as viable alternatives. This study investigates both traditional fingerprint-based algorithms and advanced deep learning techniques, noting their potential to enhance accuracy alongside challenges in data processing and collection. To address these issues, we propose a novel probabilistic model that enhances Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI)-based user location inference by incorporating user trajectories. This approach mitigates the effects of noise and signal fading. We further developed a comprehensive algorithm integrating this probabilistic model with system-level parameters to accommodate diverse real-world deployment scenarios. Performance evaluations demonstrate that our trajectory-enhanced method achieves accuracy improvements of 10% to 35% in urban environments compared to RSSI-only, Weighted k-Nearest Neighbor (WKNN), and neural network-based approaches. These enhancements rely solely on User Equipment (UE) signal strength from the serving cell and benefit from rapid training processes. Additionally, we introduce a simulation framework build on top of OMNet++, Veins, and Simu5G platforms, enabling realistic and generic validation of localization algorithms. This framework allows researchers and telecommunications operators to efficiently evaluate algorithm performance across diverse scenarios, reducing costs and deployment efforts by eliminating the need for extensive hardware resources.},

However, most of relative works cannot withstand quantum attacks due to the adoption of conventional cryptographic algorithms, such as those based on discrete logarithm and large integer factorization problems. Although some solutions generally employ lattice problems to resist against quantum attacks, they lack a privacy preserving mechanism to provide the unlinkability of vehicle public keys or certificates, as well as robust conditional traceability. In this study, we propose a lattice-based robust authenticated key agreement (LBRAKA) scheme for VANETs, which facilitates anonymous authentication and key negotiation between vehicles and RSUs and employs the ring learning with errors problem to withstand quantum attacks. Specifically, obfuscated expiration times are allocated to vehicle public keys and certificates for achieving the unlinkability of public keys. Vehicles and a central authority are required to create commitments to the vehicle's real identity and public key, in order to support robust conditional traceability. Security analysis demonstrates that LBRAKA not only ensures anonymity, conditional privacy, unlinkability, key escrow freedom, public verification of traceability, and tracing robustness, but also effectively thwarts most known attacks. Comparative experimental results show the promising usability of LBRAKA.},

By leveraging the graph topology, the proposed DCGNN-based approach can effectively exploit the SINR knowledge in the interference circumstances. We study the maximization of sum-spectral efficiency (SE) downlink power allocation in CF massive MIMO with correlated channel fading. The numerical results show that the proposed DCGNN-based approach outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches on the sum-SE performance.

This approach concurrently enhances the data rate capacity of backhaul links and supports access link services. Additionally, the proposed network is assumed to be equipped with multi-hop and multi-connectivity capabilities to improve network connectivity and coverage. Within that framework, an in-band frequency reuse scheme is proposed to further enhance network efficiency. More specifically, access energy efficiency (EE), defined by the ratio of the total achievable data rate of users to the total power consumption, is maximized through concurrent optimization of link association, subchannel assignment, and power allocation. The formulated mixed integer non-linear fractional optimization problem is first transformed into a subtractive form using parametric programming techniques. To make the problem tractable in polynomial computational complexity, we iteratively handle the problem by employing techniques such as successive convex approximation (SCA) and penalty method based relaxation to transform the non-convex constraints into tractable ones. Extensive simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed network structure over baseline models, achieving 36.1% higher EE compared to networks with single and fixed connections. Notably, the proposed in-band network, equipped with adequate self-interference cancellation ability, attains an average of 25.8% greater EE gain than the out-of-band benchmark.},

However, the use of fixed ground-based stations (BSs) often results in inflexible deployment, high overhead costs, and increased vulnerability to damage from natural disasters, which can impede continuous data collection. To address these challenges, this work explores the use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) as aerial BSs to gather data from IoT devices. First, we formulate a UAV-assisted data collection multi-objective optimization problem (UDCMOP) to efficiently collect agricultural data. Specifically, we aim to collaboratively optimize the hovering positions of UAV, visit sequence of UAV, speed of UAV, and the transmit power of devices, to simultaneously maximize the minimum transmit rate of devices, minimize the total energy consumption of devices and UAV. Second, the proposed UDCMOP is characterized as a non-convex mixed integer nonlinear optimization problem, containing both continuous and discrete variables, which presents considerable challenges in terms of solvability. Therefore, we solve it by proposing an improved multi-objective artificial hummingbird algorithm (IMOAHA) with several specific improvement factors, including the hybrid initialization operator, Cauchy mutation foraging operator, and the discrete mutation operator. Simulations are carried out to testify that the proposed IMOAHA can effectively improve the system performance in comparison to existing benchmarks. Additionally, to verify the effective working time of the UAV system, we investigate both random and uniform UAV deployment strategies and consider the impact of varying farm topology on the system model. Finally, practical implementation experiments using a Raspberry Pi confirm the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed UAV-assisted communication system in real-world environment.},

  abstract     = {With the rapid advancement of internet of vehicles (IoVs), the resource-constrained vehicle terminals cannot satisfy the demands of emerging applications for delay and quality of service (QoS) in remote areas. Low earth orbit (LEO) satellite communication, which is a promising technology for next generation mobile communication, can provide efficient and reliable real-time data transmission and stable service for IoVs. However, the communications between vehicle terminals and satellites cause transmission delay and energy consumption, which have a significant impact on system performance. Mobile edge computing (MEC) can satisfy the latency-sensitive and computation-intensive requirements in vehicular networks. In this paper, we leverage the advantages of LEO satellites to enhance the efficiency of computation offloading in satellite-assisted vehicular edge computing networks. To enhance the effectiveness of computation offloading, we put forward a joint optimization problem to minimize the weighted sum of delay and energy consumption. Despite the mixed-integer nonlinearity of the optimization problem, we formulate the problem as a partially observable markov decision process (POMDP) and present an efficient to attain the optimal solution. Eventually, we conduct simulations to confirm the validity and efficiency of our proposed algorithm. Simulation results indicate that our proposed algorithm can effectively diminish the average delay and energy consumption of the system, compared to other baseline algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Mobile edge computing (MEC) is widely recognized as one of the key solutions for future networks to enhance network performance. A reasonable offloading strategy can enhance network performance and improve quality of service (QoS). However, most of the existing offloading and resource allocation schemes have been developed for static MEC systems, whereas the randomness of user devices movement in cellular networks may lead to inevitable additional migration overhead, posing challenges to MEC task offloading. In this paper, considering the dynamics of stochastic events, including the randomness of user devices movement and the time-varying channel condition, a novel mobility-aware dynamic task offloading scheme based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL-DTO) is designed to minimize the long-term average overhead by jointly optimizing the local CPU resource allocation and edge server selection as well as the offloading rate decision. First, the virtual energy queue and Lyapunov optimization are introduced to address the long-term energy consumption constraint. The formulated stochastic MINLP problem can be further transformed into deterministic MINLP subproblems for each time slot. Then, the transformed subproblem can be further divided into local CPU resource allocation and offloading strategy optimization problems, in which the optimal edge server can be selected based on the maximum transmission rate. The sub-optimal offloading rate decision can be made by DRL. Finally, simulation results demonstrate that the proposed DRL-DTO scheme can achieve less overhead, have less energy consumption, and gain shorter task completion time in a dynamic edge environment compared with other concerned schemes.},

Compared to millimeter wave (mmWave), THz intrinsically possesses compellingly severer molecular absorption and high pathloss serving confined coverage area. These defects should be well conquered under the employment of ultra-thin 3D beamforming with enormous deployed antennas with high beam gains. However, pencil-beams require substantially high overhead of time and power to train its optimal THz beamforming direction. We propose an energy efficient (EE) oriented THz beamforming (EETBF) scheme by separating the original complex problem into beamforming training (EETBF-BT) acquirement and learning-enabled training power assignment (EETBF-PA). The historical beam data is employed to update next beam selection policy. The performance results have demonstrated that the proposed EETBF outperforms the existing benchmarks leveraging full beam search, iterative search, linear/binary search as well as non-power-control based mechanism in open literature. Our proposed EETBF scheme results in the lowest training latency and power consumption, achieving the highest effective rate and EE performance.},

Moreover, we represent Recurrent Flash (ReF) framework, which integrates linear attention with a recurrent mechanism to enhance the temporal memory abilities of agents.

The UAV is integrated with caching, resource allocation, multicasting transmission, and 3D flight trajectory (3DF) techniques, to serve the IoT devices and users (IDU) in different clusters. By further utilising many aspects of multimedia contents, IDU features, UAV-to-clusters association, and diverse characteristics of wireless propagation environments, we formulate a service time-aware caching, power allocation, and 3DF (TCP-3DF) optimisation problem. The TCP-3DF problem is solved by genetic algorithms (GA) for optimally finding 1) the multimedia contents to cache, 2) the powers allocated to multicast each content and to fly over each hop, and 3) where to stop in 3D coordinates and stop sequence. The optimal results are found under the constraints not only on the storage and power resources but also on the service time required by different multimedia applications and services. Due to the complexity of various optimisation variables and constraints, the GA is modified to ensure the accurate and stable convergence by applying penalty function and truncated chromosome scheme. Simulation results are shown to demonstrate the feasibility of GA and the benefits of the proposed TCP-3DF method in terms of sum rate, service time, and flight distance while conserving the storage and power resources.},

  abstract     = {Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) can serve multiple users by fully exploiting the channel diversity of users. Motivated by existing parallel decoding schemes in the in-phase and quadrature (IQ) domain, we investigate uplink parallel reception of multi-user transmissions assisted by multiple RISs. RISs adjust their phase shift to help separate the multi-user collided signals in the IQ domain, and then the signals from different users can be considered as collaboratively building up a higher-order meta-constellation. Eliminating the entanglement in the meta-constellation, different user signals can be demodulated simultaneously. To guarantee the effective separation and demodulation of multiple data streams in collided signals, we minimize the error probability under maximum likelihood detection. Besides, catering to the highly dynamic communication channel at reduced signaling overhead, we propose a design which requires channel state information (CSI) at two time scales. The base station selects the served users based on statistical CSI during each frame, while the transmit power of users and the phase vector of RISs are adaptive to the instantaneous CSI. This results in a challenging mixed-integer two-stage stochastic problem. Thus, a two-stage online algorithm is proposed, in which the short-term subproblems are transformed to convex optimization problems, while the long-term master problem can be transformed to an integer programming with an objective function exhibiting the structure of a convex function and affine constraints. Simulation results show that with the aid of RISs, the detection error probability drops by four orders of magnitude compared to the case without RIS.},

It aims to enhance maritime remote control operations, addressing the slow-changing dynamics due to climate and water flow, and limited network coverage. Our approach utilizes Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to adapt to non-ideal, model-free scenarios. The edge server provides immediate control commands based on resident models, while the cloud server employs life-long learning to adapt to changes, continuously improving model accuracy. Specifically, we adopt the Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithm under a discrete-time system, where the entropy in its loss function encourages the agent to explore the environment and exhibits greater stability when the controlled process dynamics change. Building on SAC, we propose the concept of Version of Model (VoM) and develop a weighted sampling strategy that adjusts the sampling probability for lifelong learning on the cloud server. We also introduce a dual-window updating strategy that surpasses standard updates by using a sliding and freeze window mechanism, minimizing unnecessary adjustments. The bifurcated control method, in conjunction with the dual-window update strategy, ensures timely and accurate process control, with effective correction for deviations. Finally, the efficacy of our approach is validated through simulations using a pendulum model and a Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV).},

  abstract     = {Distributed coherent aperture radar (DCAR) on moving platforms offers significant advantages of high mobility, long-range and high-power detection through coherent synthetic processing. However, radars may encounter signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) diversity issues in practice due to the variations in their locations, transmit powers, and time durations. Consequently, the detection performance of the DCAR can be severely degraded when the SNRs in each channel are different. Besides, the dynamic nature of platform motion poses challenges to coherent-on-receive detection due to the inconsistent Doppler frequencies across channels. In this paper, we consider the signal model incorporating the SNR diversity for DCAR on moving platforms. Subsequently, we propose two optimal channel weighting detection schemes for the moving target, including the weighted coherent-on-receive synthesis (W-CoRS) scheme and the weighted coherent-on-transmit/receive synthesis (W-CoT/RS) scheme, with both schemes aiming to maximize the output SNR. Notably, the two-stage W-CoRS scheme reduces communication costs by transmitting only weighted signals from each radar unit to the fusion center. Further, to optimize the detection performance, a high-precision coherent parameters (CPs) estimation algorithm based on the iterative Chirp-Z transform (ICZT) is proposed to address the off-grid issue of the Doppler frequency. At the same time, the proposed algorithm possesses the ability to accurately estimate the Doppler frequency offsets for each channel. Simulations demonstrate that the proposed schemes outperform the conventional DCAR (C-DCAR) in scenarios involving SNR diversity.},

However, concerns exist regarding its sensing performance when compared to the dedicated radar. To address this issue, the advantages of widely deployed networks should be utilized. This paper proposes networked collaborative sensing (NCS) using multi-domain measurements (MM), including range, Doppler, and two-dimension angles. For the NCS-MM architecture, this paper proposes a novel multi-domain decoupling model and a novel guard band-based protocol. The proposed model simplifies multi-domain derivations and algorithm designs, and the proposed protocol conserves resources and mitigates NCS interference. In terms of performance limits, this paper derives the Cramér-Rao lower bound (CRLB) of position and velocity estimations in NCS-MM. An accumulated single-dimension channel model is proposed, which is proven to be equivalent to that of the multi-dimension model. The algorithms of both MM estimation and fusion are proposed. An arbitrary-dimension Newtonized orthogonal matched pursuit (AD-NOMP) is proposed to accurately estimate grid-less MM. The degree-of-freedom (DoF) of MM is analyzed, and a novel DoF-based two-stage weighted least squares (TSWLS) is proposed to reduce complexity without DoF loss.

First, we construct the SR optimization problem. The constructed problem is strongly non-convex due to a high correlation between the integrated variables. Next, we develop a low-complexity iterative algorithm based on mean-square error (MSE) and block coordinate descent (BCD) methods to obtain efficient sub-optimal solution to this non-convex problem.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we address the key challenges of faster-than-Nyquist signaling (FTNS) in doubly selective fading channels (DSCs) by proposing an end-to-end architecture that jointly optimizes FTN waveform, data detector, and channel estimator. Unlike traditional model-driven approaches, our solution introduces a data-driven optimization strategy, enhancing its ability to optimize parameters on a larger scale. In the proposed architecture, constellation geometry, precoder, and pilot sequences are considered as optimizable variables. Specifically, with the goal of maximizing spectral efficiency (SE), the constellation geometry and precoder are co-trained with a neural network (NN)-based data detector, showing superior performance in mitigating inter-symbol interference (ISI) caused by FTNS and channel spreading. Concurrently, the pilot sequences are optimized alongside the channel estimator to improve the estimation accuracy of CIR at pilot blocks. To track rapidly time-varying CIRs, we apply an attention mechanism to the channel estimator that efficiently leverages the channel's temporal correlation through dynamically assigning weights to the pilot blocks to accurately predict the CIRs for each data block. Simulation results show that our scheme achieves a signal to noise ratio gain of more than 6 dB under a maximum Doppler shift of 10 kHz compared with the state-of-the-art linear pre-equalized FTN system with 64-ary quadrature amplitude modulation.},

Millimeter wave (mmWave) V2X is a promising direction for achieving high-rate, low-latency data transmission. In our previous work, we proposed a sub-6 GHz assisted mmWave V2X communication architecture to address the challenges of mmWave peer discovery and beam alignment. Additionally, we formulated a novel optimization problem for mmWave link scheduling that thoroughly considered realistic vehicular data features, i.e., data importance and freshness. However, a gap still remains in our previous solutions, such as how to design the mmWave link scheduling phase. In this paper, we study the impact of the scheduling phase period on the optimality of the mmWave scheduling problem. This problem is non-trivial as there exists a trade-off between the freshness of information and the utilization of channel resources. We derive a series of sufficient conditions on the scenario where the increase of scheduling phase period leads to a decrease in network utility. Extensive simulation studies are conducted to verify the theoretical results.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we investigate the hybrid secure transmission strategy for reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted multibeam satellite communications. In particular, two scenarios are considered based on actual transmission conditions and information theory. One is that when RIS has proper signal links with the satellite, it operates as the signal-enhancing RIS (SER). Otherwise, RIS operates as the signal-jamming RIS (SJR). In detail, two scenarios are presented as follows. I) For the SER scenario, a secure optimization problem is established by jointly designing the satellite and RIS beamforming under the constraints of total transmit power and quality of service. When the imperfect channel state information (CSI) of the RIS-eavesdropper (Eve) is obtained, a robust algorithm is proposed, and the $\mathcal {S}$-procedure-based successive convex approximation as well as the alternating optimization (AO) method are adopted. The case without Eve's CSI is also studied, and the maximum ratio transmission-based scheme is adopted. II) For the SJR scenario, different algorithms of zero-forcing (ZF) and ZF-based AO algorithms are given to obtain the artificial noise beamforming when considering the imperfect CSI of RIS-Eve and the CSI of no Eve, respectively, and both avoid the self-interference with legitimate user. Then, an AO-based algorithm for satellite beamforming design is presented. Numerical simulations are performed to evaluate the proposed approaches, which show superior performance.},

This paper proposes an $M$-ary spread multiple access (MSMA) scheme, designed to provide a high overload ratio for uplink cellular communications. The MSMA scheme distinguishes users by employing codes with superposition constellations. Specifically, it utilizes $M$-ary code mapping scheme to map each user's data stream onto several subcarriers, thereby achieving a frequency diversity gain. The receiver decodes incoming signals using $M$-ary code demapping based on generalized sphere decoding (GSD), which effectively balances diversity gain and multi-user interference, leading to enhanced performance. Both analytical and simulation results confirm that the MSMA system yields a lower bit error rate (BER) than power domain non-orthogonal multiple access (PD-NOMA) with the same overload ratio. In addition, MSMA surpasses sparse code multiple access (SCMA) in terms of both BER and overload ratio when the same number of subcarriers are reused. Therefore, with the same number of subcarriers and the same BER requirement, MSMA can support more users than SCMA and PD-NOMA.},

This article deploys an active reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) to assist the receive array, which provides numerous extra degrees-of-freedom to suppress interferences and to enhance the beamforming gain of target echo simultaneously since the active RIS has the capability of adjusting and amplifying incident signals. Aiming to maximize the output signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR), we jointly design the phase-only or power-limited transmit beamformer, receive beamformer, and active RIS reflection coefficients. We devise an alternating optimization-based algorithm to handle the resultant nonconvex-constrained fractional programming problem. Specifically, the phase-only transmit beamformer is determined by the Riemannian gradient descent (RGD)-based method while the power-limited one is given as a closed-form optimal solution, and the active RIS reflection coefficients are updated by the concave-convex procedure (CCCP)-based method. Moreover, we derive the convergence condition of the proposed algorithm based on the properties of RGD and CCCP.

In light of the challenging demand for accurate channel state information (CSI) with limited pilot in a short frame, we consider the practical downlink channel estimation.

We first develop the sufficient and necessary conditions in explicit closed-form for the formulated optimization problem to be feasible, and also analytically characterize the feasible region in explicit closed-form. These analytical results facilitate devising a low-complexity algorithm to obtain the optimal solution through statistical CSI-based static optimization.

First, the CF massive random access signal model for mMTC scenarios is given, and we formulate the devices AD as a maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) problem by leveraging the block diagonal property of the covariance matrix of the received signals. Next, we propose an improved device AD performance algorithm, which consists of a serial processing algorithm and a parallel processing algorithm. The parallel processing algorithm can further reduce the computational overhead. In addition, through the asymptotic analysis of the MLE via its associated Fisher information matrix and solving a quadratic programming problem, we derive a theoretical prediction bound of devices AD performance, which can numerically predict theoretical results of devices AD with the coordinate descent algorithm. Finally, simulation results show that the proposed AD scheme can achieve a better performance-complexity trade-off than existing schemes, and the theory prediction bound can match well with the simulation of devices AD as the antenna number increases.},

  abstract     = {Carrier-phase-based ranging can achieve highly accurate ranging at the sub-wavelength level. This paper explores and experimentally demonstrates the reuse of orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) communication signals for precise carrier-phase-based ranging. The approach involves leveraging a large number of phases extracted from OFDM subcarriers, including both pilot and data subcarriers, to suppress phase noise. For the best outcome, optimal selection of subcarrier frequencies is considered. The selection is formulated as a max-min optimization problem and studied with consideration of measurement error tolerance, along with analysis and quantitative assessment of range ambiguity defined in pairwise error probability. A decision-assistance phase extraction method is introduced to make use of data subcarriers in addition to the pilots. An iterative algorithm is proposed for ultra-accurate carrier frequency offset (CFO) correction, which is essential to measure the range-related phase polluted by phase noise for precise ranging. Laboratory proof-of-concept prototyping and experiments are conducted based on a bi-static setup in the fashion of simultaneous communication and sensing (a subcategory of integrated sensing and communication (ISAC)), which can be extended to a multi-static configuration. The simulation and experimental results demonstrate that, by using four or more data subcarriers in addition to the four pilots in a WiFi signal centered at 2 GHz, the proposed scheme can effectively mitigate the impact of phase noise to achieve millimeter-level accuracy without interrupting communication. This suggests that the proposed method is promising for detecting and estimating micro-motion.},

  abstract     = {This article studies a novel spatially aligned carrier aggregated non-orthogonal multiple access (SACA-NOMA) scheme for spectrum distribution and fair power allocation among grouped users. The proposed SACA-NOMA scheme integrates NOMA, carrier aggregation (CA) and joint transmission coordinated multipoint (JT-CoMP). It uses spatial differentiation between multiple NOMA pairs to combat interference. The main objective of the scheme is to maximize the spectral efficiency and quality of service (QoS) of cell-edge users by grouping them with multiple NOMA pairs. NOMA on top of CA assisted JT-CoMP is a promising contender for next-generation cellular networks because it can address the issues of spectrum scarcity and edge-user QoS. Two challenges arise from this integration when NOMA pairs are grouped with cell-edge user. Among these include an increase in interference at cell-edge user and complexity of implementing successive interference cancellation. These challenges can be addressed by exploiting the additional spatial domain. Base stations can cooperate to achieve interference alignment at cell-edge users through zero-forcing pre-coding. Similarly, a grouping scheme is presented wherein number of users in NOMA based pairing never exceeds two on any spatial axis. To this end, we formulated a joint problem of spectrum allocation, power control and BS's admission control into proposed scheme, with an aim to enhance the spectral efficiency of edge users. A fair power allocation and admission control algorithm is developed to solve the mixed integer non-linear fractional problem. The obtained numerical results show that the proposed SACA-NOMA scheme offers the cell-edge users a significant performance gain of about 60% and 300% when compared to the multi-cell hybrid NOMA-OMA and single cell OMA schemes, respectively. The proposed scheme is also validated for a typical macro-cell in an urban environment.},

  abstract     = {As 5G [3 GPP New Radio (NR)] deployments continue to expand, their use as an “opportunistic” bistatic radar sensing system that uses the base station (BS) as the transmitter (TX) and the user equipment (UE) as the receiver (RX) opens the possibility of a new sensing modality that does not need extra hardware, and thus efficiently realize integrated sensing and communication for vehicles (ISAC). In particular, such 5G-based radar sensing can complement and enhance the existing monostatic radar in advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) and future self-driving cars, e.g., for detecting non-line-of-sight (NLoS) objects. However, 5G-NR signals have been designed for communication purposes and, as per the 3 GPP standard definition, they are neither continuous nor periodic in time and frequency. This then makes it challenging to create an efficient standards-compliant bistatic radar system. This paper describes a suite of methods for overcoming these obstacles. We first explore the different reference signals (RSs) defined in the NR standard, and then analyze how they can be best combined for radar purposes. We also present high-resolution parameter-based serial interference cancellation (SIC) to extract the scatterers in the delay-Doppler domain with better-than-Fourier resolution. The impacts of combined precoding and beamforming stipulated in the standard are also discussed in this paper. To demonstrate the validity of our approach, we simulate our results using synthetic channels and validate them with channel measurements.},

  abstract     = {Recently, non-conventional odd-order statistics, especially the third-order cumulants (TOCs), have been introduced to direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation based on third-order nested array (TONA). Compared with the methods employing second-order statistics, it significantly increases the number of uniform degrees-of-freedom (uDOFs), which can even be comparable to the fourth-order cumulant approach with a small number of array elements. In this paper, through analysis of the second-order sum-difference co-array, a third-order sparse linear array (SLA) design scheme suitable for TOCs is proposed, which can extend the commonly used second-order SLAs to the third-order, and prototype arrays are analyzed along with their closed-form expressions. It is shown that by selecting an appropriate generator array, the derived third-order SLA has far more uDOFs than the existing TONA, and also reduces the mutual coupling effect. In addition, a strategy is developed to mitigate the mutual coupling effect further by mirror-flipping some elements of the dense segment. The proposed array design scheme balances high uDOFs and low mutual coupling, greatly improving its robustness as well as DOA estimation accuracy.},

  abstract     = {Targeting the high-quality and high-speed transmission signal in intelligent Internet of Vehicular (IoV) applications for sensing and communications, this paper proposes an ultra-wideband dual-polarized dipole antenna inspired by metasurface (MS). To widen the impedance bandwidth, hexagon-shaped cross-dipole with coupling-fed technique is utilized. Feed balun with truncated ground plane and stepped feedline are employed for improving the impedance matching. To restore the radiation deterioration in the higher band, a MS layer consisting of several periodic smaller patches and a larger patch in the center is loaded above the dipole radiators. Throng this novel scheme, the surface wave along the MS is excited, contributing to the broadside radiation significantly. The larger patch in the center is also excited for further improving the radiation performance in the higher band. As a result, good broadside radiation with stable gain of 8.8±1.2 dBi is maintained over the frequency range of 1.7–5.7 GHz, while it only covers from 1.7–3.9 GHz without the MS. This indicates that the gain bandwidth is significantly broadened by 37.5% utilizing the proposed MS layer. In addition, the proposed antenna achieves an ultra-wide impedance bandwidth from 1.7–5.7 GHz (108%) with reflection coefficients less than −15 dB and high isolation larger than 27 dB. The designed antenna is fabricated and tested, experimental results verify the ultra-wideband impedance and radiation performance, demonstrating that our antenna is very competitive for multiple applications in the future wireless vehicular systems.},

  abstract     = {Most human tracking techniques based on channel state information (CSI) require array antennas or high-frequency CSI acquisitions. Particularly, in a method having an arbitrary antenna arrangement, it is necessary to extract information about human gait that appears at 20–60 Hz. Therefore, these techniques require super-Nyquist sampling frequencies, above 120 Hz, for CSI acquisition. These restrictions make it challenging to achieve device-free human tracking using a wide variety of commodity WiFi devices within a competitive environment with other transmitters. To address this problem, a device-free human tracking method is proposed, using sub-Nyquist-sampled CSI, for example CSI acquired at approximately 10 Hz, with an arbitrary antenna arrangement. The key idea is to correspond the features extracted from CSI by utilizing statistics to the relative shift of the target position, enabling aliasing-free estimation of the target position even from sub-Nyquist-sampled CSI. Assuming that the CSI consists of two-ray of static and dynamic reflected waves, we used two features that corresponded to the relative shift of the target position. These features were inversely proportional to the reflected path length. Experiments showed that it is possible to estimate the walking direction with approximately 80% accuracy and tracking with decimeter-level RMSE, thereby confirming the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

The CACC of connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) based on the multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithm is studied to optimize platoon stability and energy efficiency simultaneously. Then the effectiveness of communication information is the key to guaranteeing learning performance in real-world driving, and thus this paper has proposed a communication-efficient MARL by incorporating the quantified stochastic gradient descent (QSGD) and a binary differential consensus (BDC) method into a fully-decentralized MARL framework. We evaluate this BDC-MARL algorithm against several typical non-communicative and communicative MARL algorithms, including IA2C, FPrint, and DIAL, focusing on metrics such as platoon stability, fuel economy, and driving comfort. Our results demonstrate that BDC-MARL achieves superior energy savings, with improvements of up to 5.8%, an average velocity of 15.26 m/s, and an inter-vehicle spacing of 20.76 m. Additionally, we perform comprehensive analyses of communicative information-sharing efficiency and scalability across varying platoon sizes, further validating the practical effectiveness through real-world scenarios using data from the open-source OpenACC.},

  abstract     = {Multipath components (MPCs) of wireless channels can be described as clusters of scatterers and reflectors with specific delay and angular power spectrum densities (PSDs). Hence, cluster-based wireless channel modeling has been widely adopted to characterize propagation environments for a good tradeoff between model accuracy and complexity. To enhance the performance of channel modeling, accurate clustering algorithms for MPCs are required. However, the accuracy of the existing kernel-power-density (KPD) algorithm for MPC clustering is limited by user-specific parameters, such as the nearest MPCs in the density calculation and the threshold in the cluster merging. In this paper, an improved KPD clustering algorithm is proposed without relying on priori knowledge. Specifically, the densities of MPCs and the minimum distance from one MPC to other MPCs with higher densities are jointly considered. A two-stage clustering method is used to mitigate the impact of the user-specific parameters. The key MPCs are found in the first stage. A novel criterion for determining cluster centroids is implemented in the second stage to merge neighbouring clusters generated in the first stage. To evaluate the performance of the proposed method, both simulation and measurement validations are performed. Results support the superiority of the improved KPD algorithm over the existing KPD algorithm for MPC clustering.},

This paper investigates joint uplink and downlink resource allocation in a multiuser multiple-input single-output (MISO) orthogonal frequency-division multiple access (OFDMA) URLLC system in a finite blocklength regime. A subchannel assignment and time slot allocation problem is formulated with the objective to minimize the round-trip delay of URLLC under a reliability constraint, including the transmission delays and queuing delays of both uplink and downlink. Since the formulated resource allocation problem is a sequential decision making problem, a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based proximal policy optimization (PPO) algorithm with a modified architecture is proposed to solve the problem. In the proposed algorithm, two actors are used to generate uplink and downlink resource allocation policies, respectively, and a shared critic is used to estimate the uplink and downlink state values while taking the states of both uplink and downlink into account. Meanwhile, a multi-head network structure, subchannel assignment masking, time slot allocation assistance and an adaptive hyperparameter are used for performance improvement. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed URLLC resource allocation algorithm has a lower round-trip delay and performs better compared with benchmark algorithms.},

In this article, we consider the communication between two trains running forward and backward on the same track. However, the 5G-R network has corresponding priority management according to the business application attributes, and different data flows between trains have different scheduling priorities. Therefore, our aim is to maximize the number of completed flows in the system with scheduling priority weighting. We deployed mobile relays on the roof of the train to provide relay assistance for the T2T communication link, and establish a mixed integer nonlinear programming optimization problem with a priority weighted system to maximize the number of flows. In order to reduce the computational complexity of the system, we propose an efficient and robust transmission scheduling optimization algorithm based on graph theory. This optimization algorithm consists of a relay node selection algorithm and a transmission scheduling algorithm. Finally, as shown in system simulation, the proposed algorithm can approximate system performance while reducing system computational complexity. In comparison with the baseline scheme in the literature, the proposed algorithm has significant performance improvement.},

  abstract     = {Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) is a key technology for 6G and vehicle networking. With the continuous improvement of communication and sensing performance requirements, high frequency scenarios such as ultra large scale Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO), Extremely Large-scale Antenna Array (ELAA), and millimeter waves (mmWave) have become research hotspots in ISAC. In scenarios such as mmWave and terahertz (THz), with the increase of frequency and the application of ELAA, the electromagnetic environment shifts from far-field to near-field. Unlike the far-field, the near-field electromagnetic wavefront changes from a plane to a sphere, and the dimension of the antenna steering vector function changes from a single angle dimension to two dimensions: distance and angle. Therefore, suitable beamforming schemes need to be designed for near-field ISAC scenarios. Firstly, this paper models the near-field ISAC system. Then three ISAC beamforming schemes are proposed for near-field scenario: Conjugate Sensing Beamforming (CSBF), Null-space Sensing Beamforming (NSBF), and Joint Communication and Sensing Beamforming (JCSBF). The maximal SINR of NSBF is used as the SINR threshold for JCSBF. The complexities and the suitable application scenarios for the three proposed near-field ISAC beamforming schemes are analyzed also. The closed form solutions for two performance indicators which are communication rate (spectrum efficiency) and sensing rate are derived also. Finally, the performances of the three proposed beamforming schemes and the state-of-the-art near-field ISAC beamforming scheme are compared through simulation. The simulation results show that compared with the state-of-the-art scheme, the proposed three beamforming schemes all have lower complexity, and JCSBF also brings certain performance improvement with good robustness and single/multi-target detection ability.},

  abstract     = {Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) has emerged as a promising technology to enhance the coverage and capacity in future wireless networks due to its capability of reshaping the wireless propagation environment. In order to flexibly integrate the low-cost advantage of the fully-passive RIS and the high amplification gain of the fully-active RIS, a novel hybrid active-passive RIS (HRIS) composed of both passive and active elements has recently been proposed. In this paper, we aim to maximize the ergodic capacity of a double-HRIS aided communication system by jointly optimizing the BS transmit beamformer and the reflection matrices at the two HRISs. To tackle this challenging problem, we first derive an accurate analytical approximation of the ergodic capacity, and then propose an efficient alternating optimization (AO) algorithm to find a locally optimal solution. For characterizing system capacity scaling explicitly, we focus on a simplified double-reflection-only system, where the optimal BS transmit beamformer and the optimal phase shifts at two HRISs are proved to achieve beam alignment, and the optimal amplification factors of all active HRIS elements are shown to be the same. Based on these facts, we derive the capacity scaling law with respect to an asymptotically large number of HRIS active/passive elements. It is revealed that under a fixed HRIS power budget, the capacity scales faster with the increasing number of passive elements than with that of active elements.

  abstract     = {In this paper, we investigate a downlink (DL) cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (CF-mMIMO) system equipped with reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) and explore how RISs affect the DL rate under spatially correlated Rician fading channels and variant conjugate beamforming (CB) schemes. Relying on the imperfect channel state information, tight closed-form achievable rate expressions under the enhanced CB (ECB) and normalized CB (NCB) schemes are derived, which facilitates the comprehensive analysis with respect to important system parameters, such as the numbers of RISs, access points (APs), elements per RIS, antennas per AP, user equipment, and antenna correlation. Apart from this, we formulate the design of RIS phase shifts and AP power allocation factors as an optimization problem aimed at maximizing the DL weighted sum rate (WSR). To tackle its difficulties, we decouple the original problem into two sub-problems and propose a particle swarm optimization-based phase shift optimization algorithm together with a geometric programming-based power allocation algorithm to determine numerical solutions. Simulation results indicate that ECB achieves a better DL rate than both NCB and conventional CB can achieve under various scenarios. Additionally, optimizing the RIS phase shifts is necessary and it results in a superior rate gain compared to the benchmark unoptimized scheme. Furthermore, the proposed power allocation algorithm has a fast convergence rate and can significantly improve the DL sum rates compared to the benchmark power allocation strategy.},

  abstract     = {Reactive jamming adversaries refer to those adversaries that inject jamming energy on the victim's frequency band and also monitor the same band for detecting countermeasures, thereby trapping the victim. Existing threat models under this class have studied adversaries that detect countermeasures by monitoring only the average energy on the victim's band. Inspired by the recent developments in multi-band processing capabilities of cognitive radios, in this work, we propose a stronger threat model wherein the jamming adversary measures several generalized energy statistics of the observed symbols over all the network frequencies to detect countermeasures. Identifying that existing countermeasures do not provide the desired covertness results against this threat model; we propose a new cooperative mitigation strategy wherein the victim takes the assistance for a helper radio in the network to reliably communicate its message to the destination by minimally disturbing the statistical distribution and the instantaneous energies of the symbols in the network. Through rigorous analyses on the reliability and covertness measures, interesting optimization problems are solved to compute the optimal division of energy resources between the victim and the helper so as to jointly minimize their error-rates while ensuring that the adversary fails to detect the countermeasure with high probability.},

  abstract     = {Cell-Free Massive MIMO (CF-mMIMO) networks are set to revolutionize wireless communication, overcoming fifth-generation (5G) limitations and paving the way for sixth-generation (6G). This paper explores channel estimation strategies in CF-mMIMO networks with multi-antenna users, filling a key research gap. A pilot-based linear minimum mean squared error (MMSE) estimator and a novel blind estimation approach leveraging the sample average power of the received signal vector at the mobile stations (MSs) are proposed assuming the transmission on spatially correlated Ricean fading with phase shifts. Rigorous capacity lower bounds are derived for various detection/decoding strategies, including the classical hardening-based detection (HBD), which relies on statistical channel state information (CSI), the pilot-based detection (PBD), the blind-based detection (BBD), and the genie-aided ideal CSI-based detection (IBD) across different precoding configurations. Numerical results reveal that with effective pilot contamination management, the classical HBD scheme performs close to optimally with advanced centralized precoding. However, in user-centric (UC) CF-mMIMO networks with distributed precoders, the BBD strategy consistently outperforms the other schemes. For multi-antenna users facing high pilot contamination, DL detection schemes using instantaneous CSI are preferable, with the blind-based scheme being the one providing the best performance metrics when jointly implemented with advanced precoding strategies. This study underscores the trade-offs between statistical and instantaneous DL channel estimation, pilot overhead, and precoding strategy, offering insights on how to design and manage a CF-mMIMO network with multi-antenna users and guiding future research on this particular topic.},

  abstract     = {With the development of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) technology, using UAVs as aerial communication platforms to provide additional communication services is a promising technology. However, due to the scarcity of spectrum resources, UAV will inevitably causes unintentional interference to primary users (PUs) when transmitting data to secondary users (SUs). Aiming at this problem, with the help of the multi-objective optimization problem (MOOP) framework, this paper studies the trade-off between UAV's communication rate and UAV's unintentional interference by optimizing UAV's trajectory, UAV's transmission power, and SU's scheduling. Specifically, we consider a cognitive UAV communication scenario that a single UAV needs to transmit data to multiple SUs in a shared spectrum scenario. During this process, if the existing PUs receive unintentional interference from the UAV does not exceed a given threshold which is also called interference temperature (IT), it will be regarded as a normal communication state. Then, a MOOP is established that includes maximizing the minimum UAV-SU communication rate and maximizing the times that PUs are in normal communication states. Finally, with the help of $\epsilon -constraint$ method and stochastic submodular optimization algorithm, we propose an iterative algorithm to obtain the approximate Pareto front. The tradeoff between UAV's communication rate and UAV's unintentional interference is analyzed through numerical simulation.},

Traditional PAPR constraints, however, fall short in managing the dynamic range of waveforms, thereby limiting power maximization. This study introduces a peak-to-valley power ratio (PVPR) constraint for multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) DFRC systems to enhance hardware compatibility, waveform fidelity, and consistent transmission power. We develop low-PVPR OFDM waveforms tailored for MIMO-DFRC systems, improving both radar and communication functions. For radar applications, we optimize the weighted peak or integrated sidelobe level (WPISL) and employ phase-encoded waveforms to minimize sidelobes. For communication purposes, we implement a constructive interference (CI) design coupled with a waveform similarity error (WSE) constraint. Utilizing the majorization-minimization (MM) framework, we convert the non-convex problem into a series of convex ones. Numerical results demonstrate significant improvements in sidelobe reduction, symbol error rate (SER), and average achievable rate, thereby validating the effectiveness of our approach in enhancing DFRC systems.},

Such realization of the Evolved Node B (eNB) with Software-Defined Radio Access Network (SD-RAN) can transcend the bottlenecks of existing BS architecture and effectively increase transmission efficiency. Here, we analyzed and collated the physical layer (PHY) of the original downlink process in OpenAirInterface (OAI), and then reconstructed the software architecture to improve the computing efficiency for multiple users. The functionality of POSIX Threads (Pthreads) leads to a refreshed process that is packaged into sub-functions, and then passed into a number of newly opened threads for execution in order to i) establish the multi-threading PHY with parallel processing in OAI Downlink; ii) maximize the efficiency of the utilization of hardware resources; iii) reduce the execution time of the downlink process; and iv) expand the capacity of the user equipment (UE) connection and improve connection throughput. We physically used the OAI platform to implement a Long-Term Evolution (LTE) 3GPP-based softwarized BS test. Finally, real experiments show that the proposed approach can successfully parallelize the execution of the downlink process in OAI. This process effectively reduced execution time and offered broad scalability.},

  abstract     = {Leveraging sensory information to aid the millimeter-wave (mmWave) and sub-terahertz (sub-THz) beam selection process is attracting increasing interest. This sensory data, captured for example by cameras at the basestations, has the potential of significantly reducing the beam sweeping overhead and enabling highly-mobile applications. The solutions developed so far, however, have mainly considered single-candidate scenarios, i.e., scenarios with a single candidate user in the visual scene, and were evaluated using synthetic datasets. To address these limitations, this paper extensively investigates the sensing-aided beam prediction problem in a real-world multi-object vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) scenario and presents a comprehensive machine learning based framework. In particular, this paper proposes to utilize visual and positional data to predict the optimal beam indices as an alternative to the conventional beam sweeping approaches. For this, a novel user (transmitter) identification solution has been developed, a key step in realizing sensing-aided multi-candidate and multi-user beam prediction solutions. The proposed solutions are evaluated on the large-scale real-world DeepSense 6G dataset. Experimental results in realistic V2I communication scenarios indicate that the proposed solutions achieve between $67-84\%$ top-1 and close to 100% top-5 beam prediction accuracy for the scenarios with single-user, and between $65-80\%$ top-1 and close to 95% top-5 beam prediction accuracy for multi-candidate scenarios. Furthermore, the proposed approach can identify the probable transmitting candidate with more than 93% accuracy across the different scenarios. This highlights a promising approach for significantly reducing the beam training overhead in mmWave/THz communication systems.},

  abstract     = {Collaborative Intelligence (CI) has emerged as a promising framework for deploying Artificial Intelligence (AI) models on resource-constrained edge devices. In CI, the AI model is partitioned between the edge device and the cloud, with intermediate features transmitted from the edge sub-model to the cloud sub-model to complete the inference task. However, reducing feature transmission overhead while maintaining task performance remains a challenge, particularly in the case of noisy wireless channels. In this paper, we propose a Spiking Neural Network (SNN)-based Semantic Communication (SC) model, SNN-SC, which extracts compact semantic information from features and transmits it through digital binary channels. Compared to the Deep Neural Network (DNN)-based SC model, whose output is floating-point, the binary output of SNN makes SNN-SC directly applicable to digital binary channels without the need for extra quantization. Moreover, we introduce a novel spiking neuron called IHF to enhance the reconstruction capability of the SNN-SC decoder. Finally, we enhance the performance of SNN-SC by maximizing the entropy of semantic information. SNN-SC achieves a higher compression ratio and overcomes the ‘cliff effect’ compared to the traditional separate source and channel coding method. In addition, SNN-SC has lower computational complexity than the DNN-based SC model and maintains higher task performance under poor channel conditions.},

Unlike straight tunnels, the propagation characteristic in curved tunnel is more complicated and there exist energy coupling and conversion between different modes. Therefore, it's important to study the propagation characteristics of radio wave in curved tunnel from both perspectives of propagating characteristic and mode coupling and conversion. A hybrid method based on alternating direction implicit parabolic equation (ADI-PE) and modal analysis is proposed in this paper to investigate the propagation characteristics and mode coupling, and the mode coefficients at a series of sampling cross-sections along the tunnel is extracted by point matching method. By analyzing the variations of receiving power and mode coefficients, the propagation property and energy coupling and conversion law between different modes in curved tunnels with different curvature radius are found.

However, the extensive collection and sharing of location data pose serious challenges to the semantic privacy preservation of user locations. To address these challenges in IoV, we propose a Semantic Correlation Trajectory Privacy-Preserving mechanism (SCTP). The SCTP combines the Hidden Markov Models (HMM) with differential privacy, aiming to protect the semantic privacy of user trajectory locations while maintaining high-quality location services and data usability. Our scheme introduces a trajectory prediction algorithm based on HMM, which dynamically and accurately predicts user trajectories and generates highly available semantically correlated trajectory datasets. Additionally, we design a personalized privacy budget allocation strategy based on semantic frequency. By assigning privacy weights, we significantly improve the usability of trajectory data while protecting data privacy. Theoretical analysis and experimental validation demonstrate that SCTP rigorously adheres to $\varepsilon$-differential privacy standards while exhibiting significant advantages in safeguarding the semantic privacy of user locations.},

Since the DCA is not uniform, we interpolate it and recover its signal by formulating the atomic norm minimization problem with the Toeplitz and orthogonal subspace constraints.The pseudo sample covariance matrix of coprime array does not contain the non-uniform noise component, which can be directly vectorized to create the sum co-array (SCA). Due to the non-uniformity of SCA, we interpolate it and recover its signal by formulating another atomic norm minimization problem with the Hankel and orthogonal subspace constraints. The directions of non-circular signals can be estimated by the traditional subspace method, which are utilized to estimate their non-circular coefficients. A least square optimization problem using the sample and pseudo sample covariance matrices of coprime array is formulated and solved to estimate the powers of non-circular signals. The interference-plus-noise covariance matrix (INCM), pseudo INCM and augmented INCM of coprime array are reconstructed, so that the ultimate augmented weight vector can be calculated. Simulation results indicate that the proposed WLB-CANUN method overcomes the limitations of WLB in coprime array with non-uniform noise, and enhances the performance compared to the existing WLB methods.},

  abstract     = {The performance of multi-user massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) intelligent reflective surfaces (IRSs)-assisted simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) systems is investigated. By considering a hybrid time-switching/power-splitting protocol with a non-linear energy harvesting model, the average harvested energy, achievable rates, and energy-rate trade-offs are quantified. This analysis renders it useful for studying the impact of system imperfections and transmission impairments, including the erroneously estimated composite channels, spatial correlation, and statistical composite channel state information based user signal decoding, optimization of IRS phase-shifts, and transmit power control. Two strategies are adopted based on the max-min criterion and alternating procedures to optimize the corresponding energy-rate trade-offs while guaranteeing user-fairness. The asymptotically achievable harvested energy and user rates are derived in the high transmit power regime. A set of numerical results and Monte-Carlo simulations are provided to validate the convergence of optimization algorithms and theoretical performance characterizations. The performance gains and design insights specific to the proposed IRS-aided massive MIMO SWIPT system with statistical composite channel knowledge are also obtained through the numerical results.},

A mean-squared error (MSE) minimization problem is formulated with constraints on the power budgets and residual self-interference (RSI) power. The problem is not convex, so we decompose it into two sub-problems: interference management beamforming and power allocation, and give closed-form solutions to the sub-problems. Then we propose an iterative algorithm to yield an overall solution. The computational complexity and convergence behavior of the algorithm are analyzed. Our method can enhance the analog self-interference cancellation (ASIC) depth provided by the precoder with less effect on the downlink communication than the existing null-space projection method, inspiring a low-cost but efficient IBFD transceiver design. It can achieve 42.9% of IBFD gain in terms of spectral efficiency with only antenna isolation, while this value increases to 60.9% with further digital self-interference cancellation (DSIC). Numerical results illustrate that our algorithm is robust to hardware impairments and channel uncertainty. With sufficient ASIC depth, our method reduces the computation time by at least 20% than the existing scheme due to its faster convergence speed at the cost of $&lt; 12.5\%$ sum rate loss. The benefit is much more significant with single-antenna users that our algorithm saves at least 40% of the computation time at the cost of $&lt; 10\%$ sum rate reduction.},

Vehicular hybrid power systems (VHPSs) can enhance these vehicle attributes. This study introduces a coordinated control framework to optimize the operation of VHPSs' diesel power pack in different modes. The first mode focuses on optimizing fuel consumption and dynamic response during the starting process using a reverse starting control strategy. The second mode targets fuel consumption and system stability during travel, proposing a two-layer coordinated control (TLCC) strategy that combines energy management and speed control. Through hardware in the loop simulation, the reverse starting control strategy reduces fuel consumption by 21.7% and starting time by 37.1% compared to conventional methods. Additionally, the proposed TLCC strategy outperforms the conventional rule-based (RB) strategy, achieving fuel consumption savings of 60.5%, 26.8%, and 21.9% across the typical three vehicular stages.},

We propose an agile decision support system (DSS) to mitigate these impacts by harnessing electric vehicles (EVs) as mobile energy sources serving the multiple microgrids ($\mu$Gs) formed within affected communities. Given that not all $\mu$Gs possess adequate energy storage and distributed energy resources (DERs), we advocate for the mobilization of vehicle-to-grid (V2G)-enabled EVs for equitable and resilient energy access. Our emergency service relocation (ESR) model incentivizes EV owners to transport stored energy between $\mu$Gs. However, traditional DSS cannot promptly solve the associated mixed-integer programming (MIP) problem, necessitating a faster solution algorithm for rapid EV deployment under emergency conditions. We introduce a learning framework employing graph convolutional networks (GCNs) that significantly expedites the MIP problem's solution by predicting binary values. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework in promoting grid resilience and considerably reducing solve time when the problem has 69k binary decision variables.},

In this paper, the structure and torque distribution principle of the novel TV drive-axle are analyzed first. Second, a relatively accurate system dynamic model of the TV drive-axle is established based on bond graph theory, and the system dynamic response characteristics are analyzed. Third, in order to improve the quality of the system dynamic characteristics, a TV drive-axle system controller based on the radial basis neural network sliding mode control (RBF-SMC) strategy is proposed. Finally, a hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) test bench is built, and the effectiveness of the proposed RBF-SMC control strategy is verified by the combination of off-line simulation and HIL experimental. The simulation and HIL experimental results all demonstrate that the proposed RBF-SMC control strategy can effectively improve the system dynamic response quality of the TV drive-axle, so as the controlled TV drive-axle can meet the requirements of real vehicle application.},

The computer vision tasks are typically based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs). However, CNNs often require significant processing power. Techniques like early exiting and split computing enhance CNN task execution latency and adaptability to varying environmental conditions. Since the split computing introduces additional overhead for offloading of the task from the CAV to an edge servers, we incorporate multiple autoencoders within each split point to enhance the adaptability of splitting under varying environmental conditions. However, the autoencoders introduce an additional layer of complexity related to the selection of the optimal compression strategy alongside the splitting and exiting decisions. To tackle this challenge, we introduce a novel approach based on the Multi-Agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (MADDPG) algorithm. This algorithm dynamically and jointly determines the most suitable exit point, split point, and autoencoder. Furthermore, the MADDPG-based approach considers other CAVs when selecting action, promoting cooperation among CAVs. Our results demonstrate that the proposed approach reduces latency up to 44.4% while maintaining at least comparable or even higher accuracy of the computed vision outcome compared to the state-of-the-art solutions.},

Therefore, Automatic Modulation Open-Set Recognition (AMOSR) has gained significant attention as a technique that could identify unknown classes, playing a crucial role in enhancing the reliability of cognitive radio systems. Existing AMOSR approaches have primarily concentrated on either extracting discriminative features or establishing robust decision boundaries to enhance the AMOSR performance. To overcome existing limitation, we propose an Adversarial Prototype Learning (APL) algorithm to jointly optimize the features and boundaries through iterative refinement of prototype learning and adversarial learning. The prototype learning exploits the semantic similarity with the designed distribution distance-based cross entropy loss, aiming to obtain compact feature distributions while enhancing inter-class separability. The adversarial learning fully leverages the generated counterfactual images to constrain the unknown feature space, thus conducive to robust decision boundaries between known and unknown classes. The joint optimization yields mutual enhancements to boost AMOSR performance, as discriminative features facilitate boundary formulation, while well-defined boundaries further consolidate feature concentration. Comprehensive experiments on simulated and real-world signals demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of APL compared to state-of-the-art AMOSR methods across various signal conditions.},

Searchable encryption (SE) technology stands as an effective method to mitigate this issue. However, during data retrieval via the on-board unit (OBU), users may encounter inaccurate search results stemming from spelling errors or similar keyword inputs. Consequently, the combination of SE with fuzzy keyword search has garnered increasing attention. Nevertheless, existing schemes often overlook the necessity for efficient access control, thereby exacerbating the risks of data leakage and unauthorized tampering within the IoV. Moreover, many of these solutions cater solely to single-owner models, limiting their applicability in IoV environments characterized by multiple data sources. Furthermore, fuzzy search schemes relying on locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) for index construction may inadvertently result in keyword insertion leakage. To address these challenges, we propose a fuzzy multi-keyword search scheme (FAMI) tailored for multi-owner IoV scenarios. Specifically, FAMI integrates a linear secret-sharing scheme (LSSS) with attribute-based keyword search, supporting a robust multi-to-multi model with effective access control. Additionally, an indistinguishable bloom filter (IBF) is utilized in conjunction with bi-gram keyword conversion technology to enhance the mapping accuracy for similar keywords while minimizing potential positional leaks. Finally, we validate the effectiveness and efficiency of FAMI through comprehensive security analysis and experimental simulations.},

Then, the two subproblems are transformed into game problems which can be modeled as Coalition Formation game (CFG) and Stackelberg game (SG), respectively. Moreover, we prove that the CFG game is Nash-stable and converges, and we analyze the SG game based on backward induction and prove that the game has a unique Nash equilibrium. Based on theoretical analysis, we propose an algorithm to solve these games, which aims to achieve an outcome that satisfies all participants through their strategic interactions.

  abstract     = {This paper addresses the consensus control challenge in 6-degree-of-freedom (6-DOF) fixed-wing multi-unmanned aerial vehicle (multi-UAV) systems with switching topologies. The primary obstacle in achieving this goal stems from handling asynchronous topology switching induced by topology identification delays during cooperative flight. Effectively mitigating these issues involves implementing an asynchronous switched observer design that incorporates the intrinsic mechanisms of switching topologies and a topology switching law design. In contrast to current state-of-the-art approaches, we introduce a novel piecewise Lyapunov function. Not only does it align with the asynchronous switching characteristic, where the system employs the same controller/observer during the matching interval of the previous topology mode and the non-matching interval of the current topology mode, but it also yields a more lenient topology switching law. This is ensured by guaranteeing that the Lyapunov function continues to decrease in the non-matching interval. Subsequently, we design an adaptive fuzzy fault-tolerant translational/rotational controller, ensuring a minimal consensus tracking error. Comparative simulations are conducted to underscore the superiorities of the proposed strategy.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we propose a Cooperative Perception framework with an Incentive Mechanism (CPIM) to tackle the lack of incentive mechanisms of cooperative perception among connected vehicles. This mechanism comprises three key components: point cloud area value assessment, bargaining mechanism, and greedy algorithm-based selection mechanism. The point cloud area value assessment quantifies the significance of point clouds in specific spatial areas, contributing to informed decision-making during the subsequent bargaining process. The bargaining mechanism uses a bargaining model to determine a price for each area that satisfies all participating vehicles. The selection mechanism enables vehicles to quickly make near-optimal purchasing decisions by greedily selecting those with the highest marginal utility per price in each area. The core innovation of the proposed CPIM lies in the unique design of point cloud area value assessment and vehicle bargaining components, which are specially crafted for rapid response and low bandwidth consumption in cooperative perception. Furthermore, the selection mechanism enables fast and accurate execution of the selection process. Extensive experiments demonstrate that compared to other cooperative perception frameworks, our approach achieves up to 89.03% reduction in bandwidth resource consumption without compromising accuracy. The proposed CPIM framework offers a promising solution to enhance both the effectiveness and efficiency of cooperative perception in vehicular networks.},

In this work, an iterative learning high-performance trajectory tracking control method is designed for quadrotors with finite-frequency uncertainties. The designed closed-loop flight control system includes the cascade connection of position and attitude loops. First, a cascade position loop, composed of the finite-frequency $H_\infty$ based PD-PID controllers, controls the translational dynamics of the quadrotor, and generates the desired attitudes for inner loops. Then, an iterative learning P-sliding mode controller is designed for inner loops to compensate for the repeatable tracking errors of the attitudes, and attenuate the sensor noises during the periodic flight maneuvers. By learning from previous iterations, the combination of SMC and PD-type learning terms yields a satisfactory inner-loop robust performance. The resulting algorithm requires little computational power and memory, and its convergence properties under measurement noise are shown. Experimental results have demonstrated the effectiveness of this approach in comparison to cascade PID-PID control and cascade PID-SMC methods.},

  abstract     = {The accurate prediction of smooth steering inputs is crucial for automotive applications because control actions with jitter might cause the vehicle system to become unstable. To address this problem in automobile lane-keeping control without the use of additional smoothing algorithms, we developed a novel soft-constrained iterative linear–quadratic regulator (soft-CILQR) algorithm by integrating CILQR algorithm and a model predictive control (MPC) constraint relaxation method. We incorporated slack variables into the state and control barrier functions of the soft-CILQR solver to soften the constraints in the optimization process such that control input stabilization can be achieved in a computationally simple manner. Two types of automotive lane-keeping experiments (numerical simulations and experiments involving challenging vision-based maneuvers) were conducted with a linear system dynamics model to test the performance of the proposed soft-CILQR algorithm, and its performance was compared with that of the CILQR algorithm. In the numerical simulations, the soft-CILQR and CILQR solvers managed to drive the system toward the reference state asymptotically; however, the soft-CILQR solver obtained smooth steering input trajectories more easily than did the CILQR solver under conditions involving additive disturbances. The results of the vision-based experiments in which an ego vehicle drove in perturbed TORCS environments with various road friction settings were consistent with those of the numerical tests. The proposed soft-CILQR algorithm achieved an average runtime of 2.55 ms and is thus applicable for real-time autonomous driving scenarios.},

  abstract     = {Cooperative decision-making technology for connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) plays a crucial role in the advancement of autonomous driving. Recently, graph reinforcement learning (GRL)-based methods have shown impressive results in addressing decision-making challenges by utilizing graph-based technologies. However, existing GRL research still faces difficulties in fully modeling mixed traffic scenarios and effectively generating driving feature embeddings. To address these issues, a multi-view spatial-temporal graph hybrid attention network (MV-STGHAT) is proposed to improve the feature extraction ability of the neural network model in the GRL-based framework, thereby improving the decision-making performance of CAVs. Initially, a method for constructing a multi-view spatial-temporal graph is introduced to effectively represent the interactions amongst vehicles. Then, an MV-STGHAT model is proposed, which integrates a dynamic gated graph attention network (DG-GAT) and channel attention temporal convolutional network (TCN) to efficiently generate the informative feature embedding. Furthermore, the double deep Q-learning (DDQN) algorithm is employed to train the proposed MV-STGHAT model. Finally, extensive experiments are conducted across three representative traffic scenarios to validate the proposed approach. Results show that our proposed method achieves zero collision and outperforms the baselines in multiple critical evaluation metrics, with improvements of up to 55.61% in overall reward, 33.68% in average speed, 33.49% in traveling efficiency, and 88.48% in model stability.},

To meet the high safety standards in AVs, especially under conditions at driving limits, it is essential to employ precise dynamic models that match real-world system responses as closely as possible and provide reliable, quantitative evaluations of handling safety levels. We propose a deep learning-based hybrid dynamic modeling approach that integrates a designed recurrent neural network with vehicle physical models to enhance the traceability and interpretability of prevailing data-driven models. Utilizing recorded vehicle data, we first train the designed neural network to learn vehicle dynamic responses, thereby enhancing modeling accuracy. Then, the knowledge-based physical model and trained network model interact with each other and are mixed by exploiting the unscented Kalman filter. Furthermore, a comprehensive metric is developed to quantify the level of vehicle handling stability. We propose a multivariate dynamic representation to facilitate the analysis of complex vehicle dynamic behaviors. The mathematical definition of the handling safety metric is provided. Finally, hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) experiments are carried out to validate the proposed methods. Experimental results verify the effectiveness and better performance of the proposed hybrid dynamic model and handling safety metric. This work holds promising implications for accelerating the release and deployment of AVs.},

However, current solutions assume unlimited bandwidth and transmit the entire point cloud for view merging, posing challenges in bandwidth requirements and computational burdens for time-critical autonomous driving applications. To address these issues, we propose a novel Region-of-Interest (ROI) aware method called OmniView, which can significantly reduce the required point cloud size for transmission while maximizing the point cloud coverage to create a “see-through” effect for bandwidth-limited connected vehicles. Most importantly, our solution ensures high object detection accuracy in obstructed areas with only polynomial complexity. Simulation results demonstrate its superior performance in terms of efficiency and accuracy compared to existing work. Overall, our study provides valuable insights into point cloud coverage augmentation for connected vehicles, making substantial progress toward the practical implementation of point cloud data merging in real-world scenarios.},

The integration of 360$^{\circ }$ video streaming in vehicles is expected to enhance road situational awareness, by providing panoramic live streaming and recording capabilities. This paper introduces the concept of roads digital twin, combining, for the first time, 360$^{\circ }$ video streaming with graph neural networks, in order to enhance predictive situational awareness in road environments. To this end, we have developed eGAT, a selective edge-enhanced graph attention network architecture, that uses graph neural networks with attention mechanisms. eGAT is capable of effectively predicting road coverage, considering uplink bandwidth limitations that may affect video streaming quality and user quality of experience (QoE). For the evaluation of our novel method, we utilized four different datasets, considering several vehicular scenarios. For performance comparison purposes, we employed three metrics, namely the overall percentage of the covered region, the normalized mutual information (NMI), and the precision-recall scores. In terms of overall coverage percentage, eGAT provided superior coverage performance against similar studies in all nine scenarios and for all numbers of streaming vehicles investigated, reaching an increase of up to 32.3%. In terms of NMI score, for low values of prediction horizon, eGAT outperformed similar attention-based algorithms, with an increase of up to 29.6%, whereas for larger prediction horizons, eGAT presented lower, however comparable, coverage performance. Our results suggest that eGAT is a promising solution for scenarios involving streaming vehicles, showcasing its potential for applications, such as autonomous vehicles and traffic management systems.},

  abstract     = {The use of a multi-stack fuel cell (FC) hybrid electric vehicle (HEV) has recently attracted a lot of attention as a key to enhance system modularity, efficiency, and redundancy. An essential challenge here is the high operating cost of the FC-HEV, which includes the cost of hydrogen, FC degradation, and energy storage system (ESS). For this purpose, this study proposes a predictive health-conscious (PHC) energy management strategy (EMS) to reduce the total operating cost of a multi-stack FC-HEV. The proposed EMS is a multi-layer strategy. In the upper layer, a rule-based strategy is devised to determine how many FCs should be activated considering the degradation of FCs, requested power, and battery state of charge (SOC) to decrease the hydrogen consumption and prevent extreme FC degradation. The lower layer is a real-time optimization algorithm called model predictive control (MPC) that employs its predictive ability to share the optimal power between FCs and the battery. Unlike the other studies, a new velocity predictor, stacked bidirectional long short-term memory (SBLSTM) networks, is utilized in the lower layer to provide accurate future velocity prediction for the MPC. The performance of the proposed strategy is benchmarked with dynamic programming (DP) and equivalent consumption minimization strategy (ECMS) under two different driving cycles. The obtained results indicate that the proposed PHC-EMS achieves close results to DP (with maximum of 3.728% difference) while outperforming ECMS up to 5.154%.},

Therefore, we propose a robust and unlinkable privacy-preserving federated learning framework RUPT-FL, that tolerates RSU dropout while disassociating local updates from the RSUs who gathered them. Based on packed secret sharing, secure multi-party computation, and homomorphic encryption techniques, we design a robust and lightweight multi-RSUs-aided local update upload protocol for vehicles, then construct an identity-oblivious update reconstruction and aggregation protocol under the two-server model. We conduct a series of experiments to demonstrate that the proposed framework not only improves the robustness and accuracy of federated learning against a semi-honest adversary, but also avoids expensive computational overhead for vehicles.},

This paper focuses on the geometric configuration optimization for received signal strength difference (RSSD)-based passive source localization by drone swarm. Different from prior works, this paper considers a general measuring condition where the spread angle of drone swarm centered on the source is constrained. Subject to this constraint, a geometric configuration optimization problem with the aim of maximizing the determinant of Fisher information matrix (FIM) is formulated. After transforming this problem using matrix theory, an alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM)-based optimization framework is proposed. To solve the subproblems in this framework, two global optimal solutions based on the Von Neumann matrix trace inequality theorem and majorize-minimize (MM) algorithm are proposed respectively.

  abstract     = {This paper introduces a local planner that synergizes the decision making and trajectory planning modules towards autonomous driving. The decision making and trajectory planning tasks are jointly formulated as a nonlinear programming problem with an integrated objective function. However, integrating the discrete decision variables into the continuous trajectory optimization leads to a mixed-integer programming (MIP) problem with inherent nonlinearity and nonconvexity. To address the challenge in solving the problem, the original problem is decomposed into two sub-stages, and a two-stage optimization (TSO) based approach is presented to ensure the coherence in outcomes for the two stages. The optimization problem in the first stage determines the optimal decision sequence that acts as an informed initialization. With the outputs from the first stage, the second stage necessitates the use of a high-fidelity vehicle model and strict enforcement of the collision avoidance constraints as part of the trajectory planning problem. We evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed planner across diverse multi-lane scenarios. The results demonstrate that the proposed planner simultaneously generates a sequence of optimal decisions and the corresponding trajectory that significantly improves driving performance in terms of driving safety and traveling efficiency as compared to alternative methods. Additionally, we implement the closed-loop simulation in CARLA, and the results showcase the effectiveness of the proposed planner to adapt to changing driving situations with high computational efficiency.},

To alleviate the burden on the communication network, a novel HT-based event-triggered mechanism is proposed. An HT-based event-triggered control strategy is then developed for autonomous motorcade systems to counteract deception attacks. Sufficient conditions for the HT-based event-triggered autonomous motorcade tracking are derived using Lyapunov stability theory.

The model is validated through high-fidelity simulations from GT-SUITE, achieving a root mean square error of $1.54 \,\%$ for cabin air temperature and $0.70 \,\%$ for battery temperature. The model is used for exploring energy reduction strategies. Optimal results demonstrate a $5.7 \,\%$ decrease in energy consumption during a cool-down scenario in high ambient temperatures. The usage of the model is showcased in a cabin thermal pre-conditioning problem where the vehicle is not occupied for an interval of $600 \,\mathrm{s}$ between two drives. Results show that the ability to predict occupancy and optimally manage cabin temperature could reduce energy usage by $12.9 \,\%$, compared to maintaining cabin temperature at the same level. Another example examines the impact of predicted data uncertainty and the result shows that it is more energy-efficient to maintain cabin thermal comfort instead of turning off the HVAC system when the likelihood of passenger arrival is uncertain and exceeds approximately $60 \,\%$ of the predicted non-occupied interval.},

  abstract     = {Electric bicycles (e-bikes) are playing increasingly important roles in satisfying people's personal mobility and short trips in an eco-friendly (reducing carbon dioxide emission) and efficient way. However, the popularity of e-bikes brings new challenges to public transport management. Fine-grained and accurate forecasting of traffic flow can help provide scientific decision support for urban planners, thereby alleviating many urban management problems, such as traffic congestion, parking lots and charging stations planning, etc. However, traffic flow forecasting is a highly non-linear problem with complex spatial and temporal dependencies. In particular, people usually have more flexible and random mobility when riding e-bikes. Existing methods do not effectively utilize the trajectory data of vehicles or capture the dynamic changes of spatial-temporal dependencies. In this paper, we propose a Dynamic Spatial-Temporal Graph Convolution Network (DSTGCN) for e-bike traffic flow forecasting. Specifically, we have designed an inter-road transition flow embedding module to extract spatial attention matrix between roads, in response to the flexible mobility of e-bikes. To cope with the dense urban road network, we combine graph convolution with the spatial attention matrix, making the model more efficient and refined in capturing spatial-related information. Then, a channel attention component is designed to enhance the ability of the graph convolution module to model the dependencies between channels explicitly. Finally, we conducted extensive experiments on both the real-world e-bike dataset and simulation scenario dataset, demonstrating that DSTGCN outperforms the baselines, including several state-of-the-art methods.},

To address this challenge, this paper proposes a multi-model adaptive Kalman filter (MMAKF), which can efficiently attenuate the impact of the cornering stiffness variation and significantly enhances the precision of the front wheel angles estimation. On this basis, a fault diagnosis and fault-tolerant control (FDFTC) strategy is also proposed to mitigate the impact of faults. Joint simulations using Carsim and MATLAB/Simulink demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed FDFTC strategy in detecting and reconstructing various sensor signal faults. Furthermore, the simulations conducted with varying road adhesion coefficients and vehicle speeds prove that the proposed MMAKF offers remarkable robustness and accurate estimation of front wheel angles under challenging conditions. Compared to the traditional Kalman filter (KF), it reduces maximum error by 22.17% and maximum root mean square error (RMSE) by 44.69%. Meanwhile, the validity of the proposed MMAKF algorithm and FDFTC strategy is demonstrated by the HIL platform. These results indicate promising prospects for the proposed MMAKF and FDFTC strategy in SBW fault-tolerant control applications and self-driving technology development.},

  abstract     = {Federated learning (FL) can not only improve training efficiencies for various intelligent recognition tasks (IRTs) in intelligent transportation system (ITS) with lower training latency, but also enhance data privacy during neural network training. Meanwhile, Internet of vehicles (IoV), supporting data transmission in ITS, is characterized by dynamic wireless environments and dense access demands. Thus, client selection is essential for FL arrangement to mitigate network unreliability resulted from the scarcity of spectrum resources, and improves the training performances of FL models. Thus, most scheduling strategies mainly aim to minimize the total latency for training, ignoring the consideration of client selection fairness. However, in ITS, if fairness is not taken into account, the trained global model would be out of balance with inaccurate recognition results, leading to unsatisfactory services quality, and even life-threatening accidents. Based on this fact, we design a multi-armed-bandit (MAB)-based client selection strategy to improve the training efficiency and reduce the latency for FL-based IRTs within ITS. Particularly, considering a high requirement of security for ITS related wireless services, we further propose a novel fairness measurement index in the reward function of MAB strategy to balance the delay and fairness performances of scheduling. Finally, we compare the proposed strategy with a gossip based and a delay-oriented client selection strategy. By comparing the performances with the previous strategies, the simulation results verified that the proposed scheduling strategy is the best in terms of scheduling fairness, with the highest accuracy and lower latency. That is to say, the proposed scheduling strategy can significantly improve the security of ITS with fairer, accurate and fast FL technologies.},

  abstract     = {Cooperative decision-making of Connected Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) presents a longstanding challenge due to its inherent nonlinearity, non-convexity, and discrete characteristics, compounded by the diverse road topologies encountered in real-world traffic scenarios. The majority of current methodologies are only applicable to a single and specific scenario, predicated on scenario-specific assumptions. Consequently, their application in real-world environments is restricted by the innumerable nature of traffic scenarios. In this study, we propose a unified optimization approach that exhibits the potential to address cooperative decision-making problems related to traffic scenarios with generic road topologies. This development is grounded in the premise that the topologies of various traffic scenarios can be universally represented as Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs). Particularly, the reference paths and time profiles for all involved CAVs are determined in a fully cooperative manner, taking into account factors such as velocities, accelerations, conflict resolutions, and overall traffic efficiency. The cooperative decision-making of CAVs is approximated as a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) problem building on the DAGs of road topologies. This favorably facilitates the use of standard numerical solvers and the global optimality can be attained through the optimization. Case studies corresponding to different multi-lane traffic scenarios featuring diverse topologies are scheduled as the test itineraries, and the efficacy of our proposed methodology is corroborated.},

  abstract     = {As intelligent and interconnected vehicles continue to progress, the importance of 3D LiDAR sensors in traffic perception is increasing. Accurate 3D object detection in point clouds is crucial for autonomous vehicles. Current methods focus on local feature extraction, disregarding vital feature interactions, leading to inadequate semantic information and suboptimal detection performance. We present Trans-LGS, a Transformer-based local graph structure. It employs a Graph Neural Network (GNN) and self-attention to learn semantic feature information by aggregating neighboring data and highlighting significant relationships relative to center point features within the local graph. Trans-LGS consists of four modules: Graph Feature Abstraction (GFA), Semantic Features Extraction (SEFE), Spatial Features Extraction (SPEF), and Local and Global Features Aggregation (LGFA). GFA establishes a local graph structure by selecting a center point feature and utilizing k-nearest neighbors. SEFE extracts neighboring features to learn crucial object points. SPEF calculates relative positions and distances to capture latent position information. LGFA combines low-dimensional global and high-dimensional local features. Comprehensive trials on the KITTI and DIARV2X-I datasets exhibit significant enhancements in established techniques (SECOND and PointPillars). Notably, 3D average precision (AP) increases by 6.35% and 6.72% on the KITTI test dataset. Introducing Trans-LGS improves and stabilizes performance for medium and long distances. Crucially, Trans-LGS integration minimally impacts real-time performance and model parameters.},

However, such the HTS maglev comes with potential safety hazards, such as the inherent passive levitation which may lead to an unknown attenuation in the levitation performance. In the event of severe external magnetic field disturbances, the superconducting levitator with HTS bulks inside may vibrate violently or even come into contact with the permanent magnet guideway (PMG). It may be unable to actively avoid dangerous situations. In order to suppress these levitation force attenuation and levitation drifts, an active inhibition structure of electromagnetic coil surrounding HTS bulk is proposed, and a new model of electromagnetic-pinning hybrid levitation (EPHL) is firstly established. The PID-based active control strategy can make the HTS magnetic levitation effectively avoid the safety hazards such as levitation drift and resonance. In the full speed domain (speed≤1500 km/h), the vibration acceleration suppression rate is increased by 11.5%–98.4%, and the safety margin is increased by 10.6%–34.6%. It is believed that this work can provide both a reliable simulation method and an active control scheme for the next-generation safety design of HTS magnetic levitation.},

Although energy consumed by WPD devices can be optimized by reducing the magnetic sampling rates, it may reduce the detection accuracy. For this reason, a geophone-magnetometer based parking detection method (GMPD) combing the signatures extracted from a self-powered geophone and magnetic sensor, is proposed. In the work, MPD algorithm can only be awakened when a vehicle-induced seismic feature is detected. Therefore, the magnetometer and microcontroller can sleep as long as possible when the parking space is free or occupied. Finally, the experimental results show that the overall accuracy of GMPD is 99.33%, and the energy consumption is only 18.07% of the existing algorithms, which provides a valuable reference for the WPD industry and reduces the pollution of waste batteries to the environment.},

Therefore, in order to divert EV loads from the grid, a grid-free EV battery charger is proposed in this article. The charger consists of a photovoltaic (PV) panel as a source with parallel sets of four-switch-buck-boost (FSBB) converters and Lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries. The main theme of the control method is to harvest maximum PV power while delivering energy to the battery with contemplating battery life extension. In order to fulfill these two control objectives, an accurate 4-point PV-MPPT combined with pulse current battery charging methods are employed. In a simulation study of the parallel configuration with a 250 W PV panel and two 48 V Li-ion batteries, the concurrent operation of converters (COC) and non-concurrent operation of converters (NOC) are examined. In the COC pulse charging, two batteries simultaneously receive half PV power, whilst in the NOC pulse charging, two batteries alternately receive full PV power. It has been established that the NOC delivers continuous PV power and charges both batteries at a faster rate than the COC. Further, the simulation analysis is illustrated with a 20 kW PV parking shed for workplace for charging ten e-cars' batteries possessing different initial SoCs in NOC. Finally, an experimental proof of the concept is validated through a laboratory-scale hardware design of a 250 W PV panel charging two 48 V Li-ion batteries.},

  abstract     = {Autonomous driving is developing rapidly and has become a hot topic in both industry and research. The planning system plays a crucial role in meeting the requirements of autonomous driving. However, current planning system designs may not effectively serve planning tasks. A typical modular planning system offers high interpretability and flexibility. However, it may cause task-agnostic problems between the upstream predictor and the downstream planner. End-to-end driving systems have a natural advantage in achieving system-wide integration, but their poor interpretability poses safety risks. Therefore, in this paper, a task-unified planning framework is proposed to inspire the current prediction-planning paradigm. In this architecture, driving tasks are first modeled. Then, the predictor and planner are jointly designed and optimized based on these tasks. Finally, during the actual planning process, the upstream and downstream components remain relatively independent to allow for flexible adjustments. The core of this architecture is a planning-oriented predictor named POP, which fully retains the advantages of modular systems by optimizing the predictor to meet driving requirements. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate its effectiveness. Compared to typical modular systems, POP-based framework shows significant improvements in planning tasks, particularly in collision avoidance, ensuring system safety without compromising driving efficiency or comfort.},

  abstract     = {Effective Electric Vehicle (EV) operation relies on robust State of Health (SoH) estimation algorithms, key for informed battery management. Various algorithms have been proposed to estimate degradation, often depending on full charge segmentation or on conditions that deviate from real-world EV operation. Addressing this gap, this study introduces a cell-level SoH estimation algorithm based on partial charges. The proposed approach employs Health Indicators (HIs) derived from realistic laboratory testing, which contains a variety of voltage ranges during charge to replicate the complexity of real data. The study compares two commonly employed data-driven algorithms, Support Vector Regression (SVR) and Neural Networks (NN) and two estimation voltage ranges, which encompass the second and third Incremental Capacity (IC) peak. Along with the SoH, the battery functionality is estimated through the State of Function (SoF), leveraging degradation data and performance requirements for each tested cell. This enables the definition of an indicator quantifying the proximity of the battery to underperformance in specific applications. In general, the second IC peak shows higher correlation to the SoH. However, the NN SoH algorithm, when trained with high number of observations in the third IC peak, shows the lowest error with an average Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 0.00330. Moreover, the translation from SoH to SoF highlights the different performance requirements for each case and supports a functional definition of End of Life (EoL) beyond the fixed threshold.},

  abstract     = {Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) is one of the key technologies in the sixth generation wireless communication network (6G). The wireless channel modeling for 6G should not only consider the communication channel, but also include the sensing channel. In this paper, we propose an air-to-ground (A2G) channel model for ISAC based on an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). We first calculate the channel impulse response (CIR), which sufficiently considers the characteristics of UAV (e.g., UAV wobbles, moving speed, and moving direction), the movement of scatterers, and the moving of user equipment (UE) on the ground. Secondly, we derive the statistical characteristics of the communication channel, including the space-time-frequency correlation function (STF-CF), the Doppler power spectral density (PSD), and the delay PSD. In addition, we model the echo signals from the UE and the scatterers (including the shared scatterers and the unshared scatterers) and investigate the estimation of time delay and Doppler. In addition, we analyzed the impact of UAV random wobbles, moving direction, and height, along with the scatter distributions on channel propagation characteristics. Finally, we simulate the probability of detection (Pd) and present interesting conclusions on the sensing performance related to the modulated waveform and the sensing signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). The simulation results show that the modulation waveform with constant modulus exhibits superior sensing performance compared to the modulation waveform with non-constant modulus. This work is helpful for the theoretical exploration and system design of ISAC based on UAVs.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we first propose a novel joint source-channel block code (JSC-BC) in which two protograph-based low-density parity-check (P-LDPC) block codes are connected not only by a source-variable-channel-check (SVCC) linking matrix, but also by a source-check-channel-variable (SCCV) linking matrix that consists of a zero matrix and a lower or upper triangular (base) matrix with “1”s on its diagonal. Also, we simplify the traditional joint protograph extrinsic information transfer (JP-EXIT) algorithm and propose an “untransmitted protograph-based EXIT (UP-EXIT) algorithm” for calculating the source threshold of a JSC-BC. The proposed UP-EXIT algorithm is more efficient because a smaller protograph consisting of only the untransmitted VNs (i.e., the source VNs and the punctured channel VNs) and their connected check nodes need to be considered. By using the UP-EXIT algorithm, we search for candidate codes with high source thresholds. Then, we select those among the candidate codes also with low channel thresholds. Theoretical and simulation results show that the newly constructed codes outperform state-of-the-art double P-LDPC (DP-LDPC) block codes. Furthermore, we spatially couple the joint source-channel block code and obtain a spatially coupled joint source-channel code (SC-JSCC). Theoretical analyses and simulation results show that even with a smaller window size and lower decoding complexity, the SC-JSCC with the spatially coupled structure for each sub-block (source protomatrix, channel protomatrix, SCCV linking matrix, and SVCC linking matrix) can achieve better error performance than existing spatially-coupled DP-LDPC codes.},

Especially, for 3D AAV trajectory, Rician fading is considered by including the vertical domain of AAV leading to higher AAV flight freedom. To tackle the optimization problem, the proposed algorithmic solutions leverage iterative algorithms for AAV trajectory, offloading data, and both uplink and downlink transmit power.

In this work, we explore the performance of a SIM-aided cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (CF-mMIMO) system that incorporates joint beamforming and power allocation. Specifically, we jointly design the transmit power allocation at access points (APs) and the wave-based beamforming at SIMs for maximizing the system sum rate. An alternating optimization (AO)-based iterative algorithm is proposed for solving the complex non-convex problem, which is decomposed into two subproblems. For the transmit power allocation subproblem, maximum ratio transmission (MRT) is employed to maximize signal receiving power. For the optimization subproblem of SIM phase shifts, a proficient gradient ascent algorithm is deployed to ensure convergence to a local optimum. Simulation results show an enhancement in the performance of the proposed AO algorithm compared to baseline methods. Additionally, numerical results contrast with those of RIS-aided CF-mMIMO systems, highlighting the advantages of SIMs in CF networks and demonstrating the efficacy of SIM-enabled wave-based beamforming design, where increasing the number of meta-atoms and layers of SIMs is beneficial for improving the sum rate.},

  abstract     = {An efficient routing strategy in Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite networks is critical for air-space-ground integrated communication towards 6G. However, the existing terrestrial routing algorithms cannot well handle the high-speed movement issue of satellites, while the existing satellite routing algorithms usually suffer from high communication overhead or high computational complexity. To address the above issues, we propose a fully distributed dynamic packet routing algorithm based on Graph Neural Network (GNN)-enhanced Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning (MADRL), named GraphPR. In GraphPR, the satellite routing problem is modeled as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP), where each satellite only needs to share the information with one-hop neighbors. Then, Graph Attention Network (GAT) is leveraged to encode the perceived one-hop information and derive a hidden representation implicitly consisting of multi-hop satellite information. Subsequently, MADRL is employed to build a fully distributed optimization framework and make routing decisions. In addition, a special mechanism called Residual Shortest Path Hops (RSPH) is designed to guide the routing selection and avoid routing loops. Finally, the experimental results illustrate that GraphPR has better performance in terms of packet loss rate, average delivery time, throughput, and average queuing length than the baseline algorithms.},

In particular, the energy splitting (ES) protocol of STAR-RIS is considered, leading to two types of NOMA: ES/NOMA, which simultaneously supports all users in the transmitting and reflecting spaces of the STAR-RIS and ES/hybrid NOMA (H-NOMA), which supports multiple ES/NOMA pairs in time division multiple access (TDMA). To maximize rate fairness, we develop STAR-RIS beamforming and resource allocation algorithms for ES/NOMA and ES/H-NOMA, along with a globally optimal solution and a closed-form solution for two-user ES/NOMA. The proposed ES/NOMA algorithm achieves faster computation than conventional alternating optimization. The proposed ES/H-NOMA algorithm significantly reduces the complexity of ES/NOMA by using a closed-form solution for two-user ES/NOMA and designing a faster user assignment algorithm with optimal time allocation. The simulation results validate the algorithms and analysis for ES/NOMA and ES/H-NOMA and demonstrate their superiority over the time-switching NOMA and TDMA protocols.},

In high-speed railway (HSR) communications, the fast velocity requires frequent handovers and beam switching, incurring expensive costs. In contrast, HAPs are being considered due to their extensive coverage and line-of-sight (LoS) paths. These platforms aim to offer communication capabilities that leverage the advantages of both terrestrial and satellite systems. Due to their extensive coverage, there is no need for frequent beam switching, thereby reducing the requirement for additional overhead costs. However, there can be unexpected floating of HAPs, lead to beam misalignment and deterioration in antenna gain, especially in narrow beams. To address these challenges, we propose an adaptive time slot allocation algorithm with neighbor-grid-based beam search scheme which optimizes the 3D beam direction to maximize the total transmitted data. Simulations show that our scheme achieves near-optimal performance but with lower complexity.},

  abstract     = {The short packet transmission (SPT) has gained much attention in recent years. In SPT, the most significant characteristic is that the finite blocklength code (FBC) is adopted. With FBC, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) cannot be expressed as an explicit function with respect to the other transmission parameters. This raises the following two problems for the resource allocation in SPTs: (i) The exact value of the SNR is hard to determine, and (ii) The property of SNR w.r.t. the other parameters is hard to analyze, which hinders the efficient optimization of them. To simultaneously tackle these problems, we have developed a recursion method in our prior work. To emphasize the significance of this method, we further analyze its convergence rate and investigate the property of the recursion function in this paper. Specifically, we first analyze the convergence rate of the recursion method, which indicates it can determine the SNR with low complexity. Then, we analyze the property of the recursion function, which facilitates the optimization of the other parameters during the recursion. Finally, we also enumerate some applications for the recursion method. Simulation results indicate that the recursion method converges faster than the other SNR determination methods.},

In specific, the transmission and reflection coefficients of the STAR-RIS are updated through a novel STAR-RIS element allocation technique. The STAR-RIS element allocation technique allocates each element to two sub-carriers, where one sub-carrier serves a single user-equipment (UE) in the transmission region of the STAR-RIS, and the other sub-carrier serves a single UE in the reflection region of the STAR-RIS. Through the element allocation process, the phase coefficients of the STAR-RIS are obtained in closed-form, and the amplitude coefficients of the STAR-RIS, which are to satisfy the law of conservation of energy, are obtained by iteratively solving a properly defined problem that has a closed-form solution, decreasing the complexity of the overall algorithm.

This work aims to propose a joint user activity detection and channel estimate approach for asynchronous mMTC scenarios in CFmMIMO. We deal with user activity detection and channel estimation as a structural compressive sensing problem, which is related to asynchronous latency, active users, and channel coefficients, making use of sporadic nature of mMTC traffic. In particular, we implement an asynchronous aware simultaneous orthogonal matching pursuit (AA-SOMP) scheme at central processing unit. This approach is effective to retrieve channel coefficients and active user information of numerous APs, even with restricted pilot length and asynchronous delays.

In this work, by integrating the generative pre-trained Transformer (GPT) with federated-tuning, we propose a CSI-GPT approach to realize efficient downlink CSI acquisition. Specifically, we first propose a Swin Transformer-based channel acquisition network (SWTCAN) to acquire downlink CSI, where pilot signals, downlink channel estimation, and uplink CSI feedback are jointly designed. Furthermore, to solve the problem of insufficient training data, we propose a variational auto-encoder-based channel sample generator (VAE-CSG), which can generate sufficient CSI samples based on a limited number of high-quality CSI data obtained from the current cell. The CSI dataset generated from VAE-CSG will be used for pre-training SWTCAN. To fine-tune the pre-trained SWTCAN for improved performance, we propose an online federated-tuning method, where only a small amount of SWTCAN parameters are unfrozen and updated using over-the-air computation, avoiding the high communication overhead caused by aggregating the complete CSI samples from user equipment (UEs) to the BS for centralized fine-tuning. Simulation results verify the advantages of the proposed SWTCAN and the communication efficiency of the proposed federated-tuning method.},

By exploiting the geometrical structure of the combined base station-RIS-user equipment channel, the proposed HDR estimator recasts parametric channel estimation as a single sixth-order rank-one tensor approximation problem, which can be efficiently solved using higher-order singular value decomposition to deliver parallel estimates of each channel component vector. Numerical results show that the proposed method provides significantly more accurate parameter estimates than competing state-of-the-art tensor-based RIS channel estimation, Khatri-Rao factorization, and least squares methods.

Simulation results show the outperformance of alternating optimization (AO) algorithm in guaranteeing secure communication and sensing for the active RIS-aided RSMA ISAC system.},

  abstract     = {Movable antenna (MA) technology can flexibly reconfigure wireless channels by adjusting antenna positions in a local region, thus owing great potential for enhancing communication performance. This letter investigates MA technology-enabled multiuser uplink communications over general Rician fading channels, which consist of a base station (BS) equipped with the MA array and multiple single-antenna users. Since it is practically challenging to collect all instantaneous channel state information (CSI) by traversing all possible antenna positions at the BS, we instead propose a two-timescale scheme for maximizing the ergodic sum rate. Specifically, antenna positions at the BS are first optimized using only the statistical CSI. Subsequently, the receiving beamforming at the BS (for which we consider the three typical zero-forcing (ZF), minimum mean-square error (MMSE) and MMSE with successive interference cancellation (MMSE-SIC) receivers) is designed based on the instantaneous CSI with optimized antenna positions, thus significantly reducing practical implementation complexities. The formulated problems are highly non-convex and we develop projected gradient ascent (PGA) algorithms to effectively handle them. Simulation results illustrate that compared to conventional fixed-position antenna (FPA) array, the MA array can achieve significant performance gains by reaping an additional spatial degree of freedom.},

  abstract     = {The characteristics of visible light communication (VLC) make them a potential candidate for beyond fifth generation (5G) cellular standards, specifically for applications related to short-distance and high-throughput indoor communication scenarios. However, in an outdoor environment specifically at the road intersection, VLC faces some challenges such as line-of-sight (LoS) link blockages due to obstacles, and uneven power distribution due to unguided non-line-of-sight (NLoS) reflections, which limits its large-scale deployment in dense scenarios. In this paper, we propose an optical intelligent reflecting surface (OIRS)-aided V2V system with an optimal irradiance angle method to guide the NLoS link towards the desired user in order to maximize the received power at the user. Further, for a given user distribution, we propose a novel algorithm to find the optimal orientation of the OIRS element that will produce the maximum power at the receiver. The proposed algorithm returns the rotational angles which will result in the optimal orientation of the OIRS elements with the time complexity of $O(1)$ . In addition, closed-form expression is derived for the obtained optimal irradiance angle, essentially a cosine of the irradiance angle for an element of OIRS based on the location of OIRS and the receiver's (user) position.},

In this paper, we consider a new setup of MAs-enabled multicasting, where we adopt a simple setting in which a linear MA array-enabled source ($\mathrm{{S}}$) transmits a common message to two single-antenna users $\mathrm{{U}}_{1}$ and $\mathrm{{U}}_{2}$. We aim to maximize the minimum rate among these two users, by jointly optimizing the transmit beamforming and antenna positions at $\mathrm{{S}}$. Instead of utilizing the widely-used alternating optimization (AO) approach, we reveal, with rigorous proof, that the above two variables can be optimized separately: i) the optimal antenna positions can be firstly determined via the successive convex approximation technique, based on the rule of maximizing the correlation between $\mathrm{{S}}$-$\mathrm{{U}}_{1}$ and $\mathrm{{S}}$-$\mathrm{{U}}_{2}$ channels; ii) afterwards, the optimal closed-form transmit beamforming can be derived via simple arguments. Compared to AO, this new approach yields the same performance but reduces the computational complexities significantly. Moreover, it can provide insightful conclusions which are not possible with AO.},

This paper introduces ET-FD, a novel fault detection method based on ensemble learning designed to address the unique challenges in VANETs. ET-FD satisfies stringent accuracy requirements and aims to reduce system overhead significantly. We present experimental results demonstrating the superior performance of ET-FD in terms of fault detection accuracy and false positive rates, alongside comparisons with other classification methods that highlight its reduced training time.

  abstract     = {In this article, an efficient wireless federated learning (FL) framework based on blockchain (BC) assistance is studied. Many existing frameworks adopt lots of third-party servers as consensus nodes, which is vulnerable to collusion attacks. In our framework, the blockchain-assisted FL (BFL) model selects edge users as blockchain nodes without any third-party intervention. Besides, the convergence analysis of this FL algorithm considering transmission outages is provided to prove the effects of wireless factors on FL. To solve the low efficiency of the BC based on the conventional linear chain structure, the Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) blockchain is introduced into our work. Moreover, since the design and optimization of FL and BC in most existing works are done separately, this may result in sub-optimal performance. To achieve an excellent trade-off between FL efficiency and BC performance, a joint optimization problem regarding DAG-BFL is formulated. The optimization objective is to maximize the FL performance and DAG-BC throughput. To solve the complex nonconvex optimization problem, considering the resource-constrained BFL system, the joint communication and computing resource allocation as well as block designing schemes are proposed, which are based on the twin-loop penalty dual decomposition (PDD) method and the successive block minimization technique (BSUM). Extensive simulations are performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Particularly, compared with the traditional alternative optimization, the proposed PDD-based algorithm achieves better performance.},

In order to guarantee the security and confidentiality of the data-sharing process, various advanced cryptographic techniques have been proposed by both the research community and industry. As one of the most intensive primitives among these techniques, searchable encryption (SE) has attracted extensive attention. SE enables users to search encrypted sharing data without decrypting operations. However, most existing works suffer from drawbacks such as privacy leakage, deployment complexity, or low efficiency when applied in practical IoV environments. In this paper, we design a lightweight certificateless searchable public key encryption (CLSPKE) scheme with trapdoor indistinguishability to simultaneously solve the above security and efficiency problems. The proposed scheme not only eliminates the need for complex certificate management and key escrow issues, but also achieves trapdoor indistinguishability without relying on the bilinear pairing operation. We compare the proposed scheme with other relevant schemes and implement its prototype. Extensive experiments and evaluations indicate that the proposed scheme is practical as it significantly reduces computation and communication costs while still maintaining strong privacy protection.},

The mobility of UAVs and the signal redirection capabilities of reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) can be utilized to reduce these negative effects. In this paper, we propose a multi-user localization scheme in UAV-enabled millimeter-wave wireless networks, where the UAV localizes the chosen ground user by receiving the positioning reference signal from both the direct path and the reflected path via a RIS in each time instance. We derive the positioning error bound (PEB) based on the Fisher information matrix (FIM) of the unknown channel parameters and location parameters. Then we propose an alternating algorithm to minimize the maximum PEB among all users, by optimizing the UAV trajectory, the user scheduling, the UAV beamforming, and the RIS phase shifts iteratively until convergence. Furthermore, we formulate a robust optimization problem with imperfect knowledge of location parameters to minimize the maximum worst-case PEB, which can also be solved by the alternating algorithm. Numerical results show that the proposed alternating algorithm can improve the localization accuracy by more than twice compared to the scheme with a fixed base station and the scheme without RIS deployment.},

To address the issue of excessive response latency caused by the surge in data traffic, edge caching (EC) technology has proven to be effective. However, accurately predicting the popularity of content in different regions is challenging due to the high degree of mobility of the vehicles. Additionally, as vehicles typically do not remain in the same region for a long period of time, making the content popularity within a region highly dynamic. To address this issue, we propose a deep reinforcement learning-based mobile-aware edge cooperative caching scheme (MAECCD). Our approach utilizes an AutoEncoder to capture user features from local vehicle user data and accurately forecast content popularity in both vehicle-local and edge regions. Furthermore, the MAECCD incorporates a cooperation model between edge nodes to optimize cache utilization and employs techniques in Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to refresh cached content and reduce transmission delay. Experimental results indicate that our MAECCD scheme outperforms other baseline algorithms in terms of cache hit ratio and content transmission delay.},

  abstract     = {Data generated through interconnected devices facilitates timely decision-making, paving the way for fresh data acquisition services. In particular, a service provider uses limited resources to acquire fresh data for multiple clients, and each client pays for the service according to the price set by the provider. In this paper, we aim to understand two key challenges: 1) how often a client uses the service in the presence of acquisition time and price, and 2) how the provider prices the service based on limited resources, acquisition time, and incomplete information about the clients. We first analyze a single-client Stackelberg game with a finite time horizon. Our analysis shows that the client's optimal decision is to use the service at equal intervals whose length depends on the minimum acquisition time and price. Leveraging the equal-interval insight, we further analyze the provider's pricing from a multi-client Stackelberg game with an infinite time horizon. We devise efficient algorithms for the multi-client problem with complete and incomplete information settings. Moreover, numerical results reveal that the realized profit from the complete information setting can be much lower than the expected profit from the incomplete information setting. We, therefore, develop a method for the provider to make the trade-off between profit and the risk of profit loss. Our numerical results suggest that lower pricing to serve a smaller number of clients reduces the risk of profit loss.},

  abstract     = {Data heterogeneity and communication bottleneck are two critical factors that limit the performance of federated learning (FL) over wireless networks. To address these challenges, this paper introduces a hierarchical personalized federated learning (HPFL) framework, which employs a three-tier network architecture to enable the simultaneous learning of a global model and multiple personalized local models. Meanwhile, over-the-air computation (AirComp) is leveraged to support communication-efficient device-to-edge and edge-to-cloud model aggregations. To provide useful guidance for enhancing learning performance, we derive the convergence bound of the proposed AirComp-assisted HPFL, taking into account the interference among different clusters as well as data heterogeneity across different devices. To minimize the impact of accumulated transmission distortion on learning performance, we formulate an optimization problem involving the beamforming design at both cloud and edge servers, followed by developing a successive convex approximation-based algorithm at the cloud server and an interference-aware algorithm at each edge server to perform the receive beamforming design. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed framework outperforms other FL frameworks and transceiver design algorithms in terms of test accuracy.},

  abstract     = {Network slicing is a key technology in sixth-generation (6G) communication networks. However, the performance of virtualized nodes sharing cache resources in 6G network slicing is degraded by the inappropriate allocation of resources. This paper proposes a cache resource allocation strategy for 6G network slicing based on game dynamics (RASGD). A 6G slicing network model is developed that describes the relationship between virtualized node mapping and resource sharing, and an evolutionary public goods game cache resource allocation (PGGRA) method is proposed to improve data transmission performance. This strategy defines the cache resource gap and selects the input cost according to the cache resource gap and evolutionary game strategy. When the cache resources are sufficient, the input is carried out, and when the cache resources are insufficient or the demand is large, unnecessary input is reduced to avoid the waste of resources, so as to achieve the intelligent allocation of cache resource. Simulation results demonstrate that the RASGD strategy improves the successful arrival rate of slice packets by at least 4.79% and improves the network congestion by at least 22.9% compared with the resource allocation strategy based on number of nodes (RANN) and resource allocation strategy based on node degree (RAND).},

This paper introduces a Shapley value-based power resource allocation (SVPRA) method developed for low-grazing angle detection in distributed multiple-input multiple-output (D-MIMO) radar sensor networks (RSN). The SVPRA leverages multipath echoes for improved detection performance through coordinated power resource allocation (PRA). A systematic multipath scattering model with uncertainty identifies four independent spatial paths, highlighting the impact of multipath effects (ME) fluctuations on detection. The PRA is then formulated as a non-convex Max-min optimization problem, incorporating the signal-to-interference plus noise ratio (SINR) indicator and modeling cognitive collaboration detection as a cooperative game. The application of the PRA rule has been mathematically proven to consistently enhance the detection performance. To address convergence challenges in multi-target scenarios, a fine-tuning method is introduced, providing a provisional iteration outcome, succeeded by a greedy selection process to achieve a feasible solution. Simulation results validate that the SVPRA method effectively enhances detection performance while reducing the system's timeliness load.},

  abstract     = {Direction of arrival (DoA) estimation is a fundamental task in array processing. A popular family of direction of arrival (DoA) estimation algorithms are subspace methods, which operate by dividing the measurements into distinct signal and noise subspaces. Subspace methods, such as Multiple Signal Classification (MUSIC) and Root-MUSIC, rely on several restrictive assumptions, including narrowband non-coherent sources and fully calibrated arrays, and their performance is considerably degraded when these do not hold. In this work we propose SubspaceNet; a data-driven DoA estimator which learns how to divide the observations into distinguishable subspaces. This is achieved by utilizing a dedicated deep neural network to learn the empirical autocorrelation of the input, by training it as part of the Root-MUSIC method, leveraging the inherent differentiability of this specific DoA estimator, while removing the need to provide a ground-truth decomposable autocorrelation matrix. Once trained, the resulting SubspaceNet serves as a universal surrogate covariance estimator that can be applied in combination with any subspace-based DoA estimation method, allowing its successful application in challenging setups. SubspaceNet is shown to enable various DoA estimation algorithms to cope with coherent sources, wideband signals, low SNR, array mismatches, and limited snapshots, while preserving the interpretability and the suitability of classic subspace methods.},

To guarantee the continuity and high-quality Internet services, satellite-aircraft handover is inevitable because of the high mobility of aircraft and satellites. However, the stringent passenger communication requirements and the considerable increase in the scale of candidate satellites pose huge challenges in satellite-aircraft handover in UDLSNs. In this paper, we investigate multiple civil aircraft handover issue including satellite handover, subchannel allocation, and power selection in the UDLSN and consider different levels of usersâ rate satisfaction, power overhead, and handover overhead as handover criteria for performance measure. The optimization problem is formulated to maximize the handover satisfaction of all civil aircraft. Particularly, the formulated handover problem is represented as a local cooperation game, where each aircraft determines the handover action and the power level by cooperating with other interference aircraft. We prove that the proposed game has at least one Nash Equilibrium (NE) solution in which no aircraft changes its handover strategy. The NE solution in the proposed game is further proven to locally or globally maximize the optimization objective and we then design the parallel handover strategy update (PHSU) algorithm to find the NE solution. Simulation results based on trajectories of real civil aircraft demonstrate that, the designed algorithm is robust, can effectively meet diverse user requirements, and reduce both handover frequency and delays.},

  abstract     = {With the exponential advancement of vehicle networking applications and autonomous driving technology, the demand for efficient and secure autonomous vehicles (AVs) is increasing. AVs require the ability to gather information to navigate complex and ever-changing traffic environments, making effective communication with other vehicles or roadside units (RSUs) crucial for achieving co-awareness. Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) technology emerges as a promising solution for the future of autonomous driving. However, in the dynamic and uncertain real-world road environment, the selection of sensing and communication (SC) functions becomes paramount in enhancing performance. Moreover, ambient noise often disrupts the interaction between vehicles and roadside units, leading to a partial loss of environmental states. To address this challenge, we propose a novel approach for selecting sensing and communication functions, even in the presence of partial loss of environmental states. Specifically, we approximate a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) to a complete Markov decision process (MDP) through matrix completion and subsequently utilize deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to solve it. Additionally, we propose a matrix completion algorithm based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) with deep unfolding to accurately complete the missing environmental states. Finally, we demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the other POMDP-based approaches for SC function selection in an ISAC-enabled vehicular network.},

However, the onboard computation resources may be insufficient, resulting in long processing latencies. To deal with this critical issue, we jointly consider roadside unit (RSU) and assistant vehicle offloading, along with resource allocation, to minimize latency for vehicular tasks. This approach also takes into account frequency reuse among sub-areas for assistant vehicle offloading. The latency minimization problem can be formulated as a mixed-integer non-linear programming (MINLP) problem. Given the inherent complexity of the MINLP problem, we propose a two-step solution. The first step focuses on the combined decision of assistant vehicle offloading and transmit power allocation. To solve this problem, we propose a particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm with low complexity and low average transmit power. The second step deals with RSU offloading/local computation decision, bandwidth allocation, and computation resource allocation. An iterative algorithm is proposed to achieve the optimal solution. Without adding additional computation resources, simulation results demonstrate that the proposed vehicular task offloading approach improves overall delay performance than the adaptive MEC offloading scheme and the pure MEC computing scheme.},

In order to solve the cooperative localization issue in high-density vehicle networks, This paper proposes a region-constrained vehicle cooperative localization algorithm based on stochastic geometry. By setting restricted areas of vehicles, the communication capability and network capacity between vehicles are effectively improved. Then, to take full advantage of the density of the Ultra-high density vehicles network, the Geometric Dilution of Precision (GDoP) metric is used to dynamically introduce cooperative vehicles. By dynamically selecting vehicles, the value of GDoP decreases significantly with the increase of vehicle density. Finally, experimental simulations show that the network capacity in the vehicle system is improved by about 71% at the maximum interruption probability when using vehicle selection with restricted areas. Furthermore, the positioning performance of vehicles improves continuously with the increasing density of the cooperative vehicle network.},

Maintaining the required quality of service of information including its timely delivery, in MANETs, is extremely challenging under dynamic conditions such as a changing bushfire scenario. Nodes get destroyed or their link qualities degrade leading to sub-optimal paths, reduced network performance, and disconnected end nodes. To remedy partitioning in ground-based MANETs and to improve their communication performance, aUtonomous Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have emerged as a promising relay solution. This paper presents U-QoIT, a UAV deployment algorithm for connecting the disconnected end nodes in a dynamic bushfire scenario. It aims to meet the Quality of Information requirements, with a minimal number of UAVs deployed. U-QoIT takes the UAV deployment problem as a combinatorial search problem and reduces the deployment complexity by applying a reduction by minimization approach. This is done to deploy fewer UAVs without compromising connectivity. Extensive simulation results depict that U-QoIT significantly improves user usability by 48% compared to the best-performing baseline approach, of Dynamic Service Area (DSA) based UAV deployment, at the expense of a negligible increase in computational time. It achieves a 38% drop in packet latency and retains its out-performance in a highly mobile network. In a sparse network, it improves user usability by 106%. Furthermore, it needs fewer UAVs, compared to the baseline UAV deployment methods, without compromising its performance gains.},

In this paper, we put the fast worker identification into a multi-armed bandit (MAB) framework and propose a Thompson sampling (TS)-based approach to tackle it. Then, our approach leverages the heterogeneity of computing speeds by formulating the task allocation problem to minimize the expected computing delay. We derive a lower bound for the delay and prove that our proposed algorithm minimizes this bound. Importantly, the time complexity of our algorithm is independent of the number of tasks to be assigned, which is typically large in practical scenarios. When our scheme is applied to solve the linear regression problem, simulation results show that it reduces the computing delay of a state-of-the-art method by more than 15% in two different scenarios.},

  abstract     = {The surge in mobile vehicles and data traffic in Vehicular Edge Computing and Networks (VECONs) requires innovative approaches for low latency, stable connectivity, and efficient resource usage in fast-moving vehicles. Existing studies have identified that utilizing digital twins (DTs) can effectively improve service quality in VECONs. However, it still faces substantial challenges posed by large-scale complex DT communications in sustaining real-time collaborative endeavors. In particular, within the dynamic VECONs, the decision regarding DT migration plays a pivotal role in sustaining the quality of services. In this paper, we propose an adaptive DT migration (ADM) algorithm to minimize the overall migration costs when DTs deliver services. Specifically, 1) We formulate ADM as a combinatorial optimization problem in VECONs, comprehensively considering communication latency and migration latency under complex DT communications, vehicular mobilities, and dynamic states of edges; 2) An ADM algorithm based on off-policy actor-critic reinforcement learning is proposed to make migration decisions. Moreover, the ADM agent employs warm-up policies to address exploration challenges in sparse state spaces; 3) Simulations based on real-world, large-scale urban vehicular mobility datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms existing algorithms by approximately 39% on average, and it can achieve results close to the optimal.},

  abstract     = {Compressive sensing (CS) has been applied as an effective technique to reconstruct collected data from a subset of sensors in a wireless sensor network (WSN). Although many algorithms have been proposed to exploit data correlation among sensors, a majority of these research endeavors focus on sensor selection under ideal communication links. As a result, reconstruction quality would be severely affected when packet losses occur during transmissions. In this paper, we propose to optimize allocation of communication resources to sensors for allowing data retransmissions so the impact of packet losses can be effectively mitigated. Unlike previous work that either does not allow retransmissions or determines the number of retransmissions for each sensor purely based on its packet delivery ratio while disregarding data correlation with other sensors, we further exploit data correlation among sensors for optimization of resource allocation. To proceed, we apply CS with Bayesian estimation to derive the analytical lower bound of data reconstruction error in the target scenario and incorporate retransmission opportunities into the problem formulation. Based on the principle of rank-one adjustment for matrix inversion, we efficiently compute matrix inversion of the data-loss matrix required to minimize reconstruction error. We then propose a greedy yet effective algorithm to determine resource allocation strategy and apply a meta-heuristic search algorithm to further validate its solution. Our proposed algorithms are evaluated using both simulated environment and data from real-world sensor deployment under various resource constraints and data correlation settings. Evaluation results show that the proposed algorithm can outperform existing algorithms in terms of reconstruction error and computation efficiency under link losses.},

  abstract     = {The significance of transportation efficiency, safety, and related services continues to increase in urban vehicular networks. Within such networks, roadside units (RSUs) serve as intermediaries in facilitating communication. Therefore, the deployment of RSUs is of utmost importance in ensuring the quality of communication services. However, the optimization objectives, such as time delay and deployment cost, are commonly developed from diverse perspectives. As a result, it is possible that conflicts may arise among the objectives. Furthermore, in urban environments, the presence of various obstacles, such as buildings, gardens, lakes, and other infrastructure, poses challenges for the deployment of RSUs. Consequently, the deployment encounters significant difficulties due to the existence of multiple objectives, constraints imposed by obstacles, and the need to explore a large-scale optimization space. To address this issue, two versions of multi-objective optimization algorithms are proposed in this paper. By utilizing a multi-population strategy and an adaptive exploration technique, the proposed methods efficiently explore a large-scale decision-variable space. In order to mitigate the issue of an overcrowded deployment of RSUs, a calibrating mechanism is adopted to adjust RSU density during the optimization procedures. The proposed methods also address data offloading between vehicles and RSUs by setting up an iterative best response sequence game (IBRSG). Comparative analyses against several state-of-the-art algorithms demonstrate that our strategies achieve superior performance in both high-density and low-density urban scenarios. The results indicate that the proposed solutions significantly enhance the efficiency of vehicular networks.},

This paper introduces an innovative algorithm based on a reputation mechanism, named the Dynamic Vehicle Reputation Consensus (DVRC), which focuses on improving the data security and communication efficiency of vehicular networks using blockchain technology. The DVRC algorithm comprehensively assesses vehicle behaviors and the consensus contribution within the blockchain network, utilizing a reputation scoring system to evaluate the reliability within the network. Furthermore, this study delves into multimodal communication strategies in vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) scenarios. Notably, when vehicles leave the range of basic infrastructure, those with high reputation scores (as determined by the DVRC's reputation values) relay the communication service. Additionally, the introduction of a reputation incentive mechanism and dynamic consensus threshold adjustments aim to improve consensus efficiency and encourage honest behavior. Experimental results demonstrate that the DVRC algorithm significantly improves communication efficiency in blockchain-based vehicular networks, such as increased throughput, reduced latency, and improved network scalability.

This paper focuses on the challenge of online access scheduling across multiple platforms. Specifically, when multiple users randomly enter the network and request access through high-altitude platform (HAP) relays, the system must make real-time decisions on whether to grant or deny access, while considering the connections between HAPs and low-Earth orbit (LEO) satellites. By explicitly modelingthe data collection process and the workload associated with transmission tasks, we formulate the multi-access scheduling challenge as a mixed-integer programming (MIP) problem, which presents high computational complexity. Given the practical system's lack of prior knowledge about user attributes, such as arrival times and channel conditions, we propose a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based model for real-time decision-making. To enhance feature extraction within the DRL architecture, we introduce a graph neural network (GNN)-based encoder, and employ a sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) module to manage the exponential increase in action space resulting from simultaneous decisions on multiple access requests. Extensive simulations demonstrate that the integrated GNN and Seq2Seq (iGNNSeq)-enhanced RL achieves performance comparable to offline solutions while significantly reducing computational complexity.},

Each SFC is composed of Virtual Network Functions (VNFs), where each VNF performs a specific task. In this work, we tackle two key challenges in deploying SFCs across an LSN. Firstly, we aim to optimize the long-term system performance by minimizing the average end-to-end SFC execution delay, given that each satellite comes with a pre-installed/cached subset of VNFs. To achieve optimal SFC placement, we formulate an offline Dynamic Programming (DP) equation. To overcome the challenges associated with DP, such as its complexity, the need for probability knowledge, and centralized decision-making, we put forth an online Multi-Agent Q-Learning (MAQL) solution. Our MAQL approach addresses convergence issues in the non-stationary LSN environment by enabling satellites to share learning parameters and update their Q-tables based on distinct rules for their selected actions. Secondly, to determine the optimal VNF subsets for satellite caching, we develop a Bayesian Optimization (BO)-based learning mechanism that operates both offline and continuously in the background during runtime. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our MAQL approach achieves near-optimal performance comparable to the DP model and significantly outperforms existing baselines. Moreover, the BO-based approach effectively enhances the request serving rate over time.},

We formulate the spectrum access and power control problem as a fully cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning task, where each V2V link receives an identical reward at each time step. This strategy caters to the heterogeneous Quality-of-Service requirements, including the high reliability and low latency requirements for safety-centric applications, as well as the high transmission rate requirements for entertainment applications. Consequently, we design a multi-criterion objective reward function that accounts for the heterogeneous traffic demands. Subsequently, we introduce a robust multi-agent proximal policy optimization algorithm with a centralized training and decentralized execution framework. The proposed approach employs global observation to learn policies for each V2V agent during training, while allowing each agent to take an action based on its local observation during distributed execution phase. Furthermore, we consider imperfect spectrum sensing and outdated channel state information (CSI) in the work. Henceforth, a critic network incorporating long short-term memory layers is developed to effectively leverage the global observation, thereby mitigating the impact of outdated CSI and sensing errors. Extensive experiment results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method comparing to other existing methods in terms of transmission success rate of cellular links, average capacity for entertainment applications of V2V links, and payload delivery rate for safety-centric applications of V2V links.

An air-ground coordinated MEC framework provides extensive signaling coverage and additional computing power for user equipments (UEs), especially in remote areas or emerging scenarios. This paper proposes a novel air-ground coordinated MEC system, comprising a laser-powered UAV and a ground access point (AP). In this setup, the UAV serves both as an MEC server and a relay, while the AP supplies energy to the UAV through laser charging. Given the uncertainties in wireless energy harvesting, our goal is to minimize the UAV's long-term average energy consumption by collaboratively optimizing its trajectory, task allocation between the UAV and AP, and time for energy harvesting. To tackle this non-convex optimization problem, we introduce a two-step alternating optimization algorithm that decouples the optimization variables into two subproblems. Subproblem 1 focuses on computation task and energy harvesting time allocation, formulated as a linear programming (LP) problem. Subproblem 2 addresses real-time trajectory scheduling for the UAV, tackled using the deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithm. Simulation results demonstrate the algorithm's convergence and its effectiveness in reducing UAV energy consumption compared to benchmark schemes across various scenarios. Additionally, the optimal policies pertaining to UAV trajectory and task allocation ratios are identified and discussed, highlighting key features and implications.},

  abstract     = {Cognitive Radio (CR) and Energy Harvesting (EH) techniques have offered insights to mitigate issues related to inefficient spectrum utilization and limited energy storage capacity. In Cognitive Radio Networks, security threats, particularly from eavesdroppers, may result in information leakage. This study focuses on enhancing the Physical Layer Security (PLS) of multi-users with EH by employing cooperative jamming via a Autonomous Aerial Vehicle (AAV) to maximize the secure communication rate. In the AAV-assisted EH-CR system, Secondary Users (SUs) can utilize the licensed spectrum band occupied by a Primary User (PU) if the cooperative jamming power from SUs to the PU remains below a certain threshold. SUs can harvest and use Radio Frequency (RF) energy from the Primary Transmitter (PT). The AAV jammer disrupts the eavesdropper by transmitting jamming signals, thereby minimizing stolen information to optimize long-term secure communication performance. The paper formulates the problem of maximizing the average secure communication rate while considering system constraints and jointly optimizes the AAV trajectory, transmission power, and EH coefficient. As the problem is non-convex, it is reformulated as a Markov Decision Process (MDP). The paper employs the Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization (MAPPO) algorithm to address the problem, introduces counterfactual baselines to tackle the credit assignment problem in centralized learning, and integrates the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network to enhance the learning capability of sequential sample data, thereby improving the training efficiency and effectiveness of the algorithm.

Specially, obfuscated expiration dates are set for vehicles' credentials and pseudonyms to guarantee the unlinkability of new and old pseudonyms. The public verification of tracing is ensured by adopting vehicles' commitments or signatures on their real identities and pseudonyms as the proof of tracing, and tracing robustness is provided by employing vehicles' credentials issued by a central authority as the proof of malicious accusations or framing behaviors by the corrupted authority during tracing. LRCPA not only achieves message authentication and integrity, non-repudiation, anonymity, conditional privacy, unlinkability, key escrow freedom, public verification of tracing, and tracing robustness, but also effectively withstands most known attacks.

  abstract     = {In this paper, we investigate the robust and secure transmission for a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) assisted multi-user simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (MU-SWIPT) system in the presence of an eavesdropper (Eve) with hardware impairments (HWIs). An optimization problem is formulated with the goal of maximizing the average sum secrecy rate (ASSR) of all users subject to the constraints of unit-modulus, maximum transmit power budget, and minimum average harvested power (AHP) threshold, taking into account the distortion noise caused by the HWIs at the base station (BS), users, and RIS. To handle this problem, the alternate optimization (AO) method is utilized to decouple the formulated problem into several sub-problems which are solved by optimizing one set of variables with other sets being fixed. Specifically, we employ the successive convex approximation (SCA) method to obtain the BS's transmit beamforming vectors (TBVs), while obtaining the RIS phase shifts based on the combination of SCA and penalty convex-concave procedure (CCP) algorithms, and an optimal power splitting (PS) ratio of each user is derived in a closed-form solution. Numerical results validate the effectiveness of the proposed AO and penalty CCP algorithms, and reveal the ASSR performance gain of the proposed RIS-assisted networks with robust transmission deign (Robust-RIS) scheme over the conventional schemes without considering HWIs or RIS.},

While vehicles of various intelligence levels are becoming more common on the road, most research overlooks the data distribution across different vehicles in multicast scenarios. Our aim is to allow different kinds of vehicles to receive the needed content in a multicast scenario and to fulfill certain freshness requirements. Although deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has been widely used to address this issue, it suffers from slow training convergence and unstable performance. Hence, this study proposes combining DRL algorithms with behavior cloning and action mask, leveraging prior knowledge and expert algorithms to enhance performance. Finally, the freshness of the data content is ensured for all kinds of vehicles and effective data transmission is achieved. The simulation results indicate a significant improvement in the training efficiency and performance in our proposed method, with 15.6% to 31.9% improvement in terms of effective traffic compared to other counterparts.},

Thanks to the advancements in Wireless communication and Software-defined Networks, the most demanding requirements of modern eHealth applications are resolved in their convergence, the 5th Communication Technology Generation. Besides, the cutting-edge technology also renovated the eHealth network landscape by employing Network Function Virtualization and Network Slicing concepts. By allowing third-party actors to manage and operate pre-deployed network infrastructure, 5G presented a novel network perspective that outdated the classic network research point of view. Recognizing such outstanding phenomenon, we update the eHealth literature by addressing the 5G's network perspective transformation. More importantly, we take a further step and present our enhanced vision to the community. The given network perspective emphasizes flexibility and adaptability regarding network infrastructure, which later aims to complete the 5G's current landscape. As the final result, we provide the community with a next-generation vision towards a unified, fully automated, and adaptively self-manageable network infrastructure. Four distinguished experimental approaches that support Healthcare transport communication (Opportunistic Network Enhancement, Connection Recovery, Self-assisted Coverage Deployment, and Data Transportation, and Priority Orchestration in High-density Network) are also designed to ensure the efficiency of the proposed idea.

Departing from traditional non-convex problem-solving methods, we introduce a hybrid RSMA optimization scheme based on deep residual networks to enhance the feasibility of hybrid precoding and decoding. Initially, due to the absence of standardized and universal datasets, we propose a dataset generation algorithm to create training and testing datasets for subsequent communication model training. Subsequently, we construct a loss function that integrates the objective function with the constraints of the optimization problem. Lastly, to ensure that the optimization variables strictly comply with the constraints, we design a mandatory constraint module comprising modulus, power, and rate constraint sub-modules. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm surpasses traditional optimization methods, and RSMA shows significant advantages over conventional multiple access (MA) schemes.},

  abstract     = {The use of millimeter wave (mmWave) and sub-terahertz (sub-THz) bands in 5G/6G cellular networks offers high data rates but demands infrastructure densification. To reduce deployment costs, the 3GPP has introduced Integrated Access and Backhaul (IAB) enabling multi-hop connectivity via low-cost IAB relay nodes. Multicast communications appear particularly advantageous in IAB systems as they permit saving spectrum resources both in access and backhaul. This work aims at evaluating the impact of the multicast transmission mode and multicast-aware user association in 5G/6G mmWave/sub-THz self-backhauled systems serving unicast and multicast traffic. We develop an optimization framework for user association and multicast grouping in IAB taking into account the specifics of the propagation in mmWave/sub-THz spectrum, antenna design, and resource sharing between access and backhaul. The resulting optimization problem is solved using an approximate dynamic programming approach capable of handling the 3GPP-recommended numbers of cell users. Our results show that in an IAB network unicast and multicast users differ in their optimal associations, namely, multicast users tend to be associated more frequently with the relay nodes compared to unicast users, and this difference is more notable in low blockage scenarios. Quantitatively, the use of multicasting in an IAB system permits saving up to 40% of resources.},

With the deploying of SLM units, OMC systems can split one light beam to multiple beams directing to different receivers, and hence bring in a new design freedom on the energy allocation for each sub-beam. In this paper, we study a general model of the OMC systems that the transmitter wants to broadcast multiple messages to multiple users, and some of the users may request a same message. We focus on characterizing the capacity region of such OMC systems, in order to assess the benefits on capacity by deploying SLM units. For the general cases, numerical solutions of the capacity region are raised, and for special cases that the system is symmetric or the signal to noise ratio (SNR) is rather low, closed form results of the capacity region are proposed. We also study the OMC system which broadcasts two different messages, and give out a partial closed form result of the capacity region. From this case, we can find that characterizing the capacity region for OMC systems is equivalent to optimizing high order polynomial, which is doable but impossible to find closed form results in general.

Our approach leverages orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) technology to address the challenges of frequency-selective fading. To mitigate the peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) issues inherent in OFDM signals, the desired low-PAPR property is also incorporated into the design of the waveforms. For enhanced radar sensing functionality, we introduce an advanced metric, the weighted peak or integrated sidelobe level (WPISL), meticulously crafted to measure and minimize low-range sidelobes. On the communication front, we integrate constructive interference (CI) techniques to significantly enhance quality of service (QoS) in data transmission. To address the intricate optimization challenges presented by our design objectives, we have developed an efficient algorithm anchored in the majorization-minimization (MM) framework. The numerical experiments demonstrate that this algorithm notably surpasses existing state-of-the-art benchmarks in reducing range sidelobe interference. Furthermore, our CI-based approach yields enhanced performance compared to traditional least squares (LS) methods, achieving lower symbol error rates (SER) and higher average achievable sum rates.},

  abstract     = {The uniform circular array (UCA) currently stands as the predominant method for generating orbital angular momentum (OAM) in the radio frequency band. Existing studies paid little attention to the impact of the antenna element's radiation pattern (AERP) on the OAM communication performance. In this paper, we present a UCA-based OAM communication model that considers the AERP. Through the model, it is theoretically demonstrated that perfect orthogonality of OAM modes is maintained only when the AERP is symmetric in the azimuthal angle. However, AERP is typically asymmetric due to the designing or manufacturing error, leading to a decline in OAM mode isolation. To address this issue, we propose the use of the sequentially rotated UCA (SRUCA) and prove that the mode orthogonality of SRUCA can always be maintained despite the asymmetry of the AERP. However, because the spatial orientation of each antenna element changes, the attribute of the SRUCA-based OAM communications also changes. To explore the performance difference, we further construct the electric field vector model of SRUCA-based OAM communications and theoretically prove that orthogonality among excitation modes still exists. Additionally, there is mode gain variation for the SRUCA compared with the UCA. Typically, in general communication scenarios where the communication distance is significantly larger than the UCA radius, there is 50% polarization loss (PL) for the linear polarization (LP) SRUCA when full modes multiplexing is performed. Comprehensive simulations of phase and amplitude error, mode isolation, polarization variation, and PL are performed. The results validate the theoretical analysis.},

In addition, embedded devices are not able to provide sufficient computing power, which hinders the application of DL solutions. Motivated by this, the dynamic self-attention mechanism is proposed to reduce the dependence of DL on training samples. Aiming for the optimal trade-off between sensing performance and computational complexity, the efficient model design, Self-Attention Channel Shuffle Mobile Network (SACSMN), is formulated. Experimental results demonstrate that SACSMN achieves similar sensing performance to that based on the full training set under the condition of few samples, the dependence of SACSMN on training samples is significantly reduced. Furthermore, SACSMN significantly reduces the computational complexity while achieving the same level of sensing performance as the benchmarks, realizing the optimal trade-off between system sensing performance and computational complexity.

  abstract     = {A novel integrated antenna supporting polarization and radiation beam reconfigurability is proposed for emerging millimeter-wave (mmWave) vehicular communication. To meet the reconfigurability requirement of the vehicular communication system, a compact shared-aperture two-dimensional leaky-wave antenna (LWA) is designed. The LWA is generated by the parallel-plate waveguide (PPW) long-slot structure and its open stopband issue is suppressed completely by employing a unit cell with two asymmetrical slots, leading to high-gain and broadband characteristics. Besides, a multifunction feeding network constituted by four switchable input ports, four parabolic reflector systems, and an integrated multifunction coupler is seamlessly incorporated with the radiation aperture within a single substrate, realizing a low-cost solution for vehicular communication applications. Based on the proposed design concept, a broadband high-gain integrated antenna featuring polarization and radiation beam reconfigurability is engineered, fabricated, and installed into an antenna measurement system for validation. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed antenna achieves a peak gain of 23.6 dBi together with a bandwidth of 56.6% from 19 GHz to 34 GHz. Additionally, it exhibits good polarization and radiation beam reconfigurable capability, providing horizontal/vertical linear-polarization single-beam, right-/left-handed circular-polarization single-beam, and dual-linear-polarization equal/unequal-amplitude dual-beam operating capability. Furthermore, a wide beam scanning coverage of 105$^{\circ }$ in xoz-plane and 108$^{\circ }$ in yoz-plane is achieved by the presented design. The extraordinary advantages of the proposed integrated antenna such as wide bandwidth, high gain, polarization and radiation beam reconfigurability, and low cost make it suitable for various millimeter-wave vehicular communication application scenarios.},

  abstract     = {Delay-sensitive services, particularly Ultra-Reliable and Low-Latency Communications (URLLC) services, are envisioned as one of the primary applications for 5G and forthcoming 6G networks. However, guaranteeing the stringent Quality of Service (QoS) requirements through efficient resource allocation remains a formidable challenge. While Reinforcement Learning (RL) presents a promising solution, conventional online RL methodologies typically necessitate direct interactions with practical wireless networks during training, posing potential risks to URLLC services if suboptimal actions are taken. In contrast, this paper introduces a novel offline data-driven optimization framework for designing radio resource allocation algorithms. Inspired by the dynamic nature of the wireless network inherently captured in the historical operation data traces, our proposed framework takes advantage of offline RL to optimize resource allocation policies solely from offline datasets, thus avoiding the risks associated with online training on practical networks. Moreover, to effectively characterize dynamic fluctuations in the number of active users, our framework incorporates Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), where the GNN-based architecture can enhance the policies' scalability and generalization capabilities, enabling the learned policies to adapt to evolving network conditions. Building upon this framework, we propose a novel radio resource allocation algorithm, namely GNN-based offline RL (GNN-ORL). Extensive experimental results validate the performance of the proposed GNN-ORL algorithm. Specifically, GNN-ORL exhibits both stable convergence and excellent generalization capabilities, and outperforms baseline schemes in meeting the QoS requirements of URLLC services.},

  abstract     = {Multi-dimensional spectrum prediction is pivotal for enabling spectrum sharing and dynamic spectrum access (DSA), which are critical for mitigating spectrum resource scarcity and enhancing wireless communication system performance. Traditional spectrum prediction techniques predominantly employ machine learning (ML) or deep learning (DL) approaches. However, ML-based methods often require manual feature extraction, leading to inefficiencies, while DL-based techniques typically demand computationally intensive graphics processing units (GPUs). To address these limitations, this paper proposes a lightweight multi-dimensional spectrum prediction model based on an adaptive broad learning network (ABLN). The model utilizes a sliding window approach for preprocessing historical spectrum data and establishes an input layer containing mapped feature nodes and enhancement nodes by randomly generating weights and biases. The weight parameters of the network are determined by solving the pseudo-inverse problem, and the network structure is extended by incremental learning method without necessitating retraining, effectively reducing the model's computational complexity. Furthermore, an adaptive node increment module is employed to quickly obtain the optimal hyperparameters. Experimental results on real-world spectrum datasets demonstrate that the proposed ABLN method consistently outperforms benchmark algorithms in terms of both prediction accuracy and computational efficiency across multi-step prediction tasks. Additionally, the model exhibits robust stability and adaptability in diverse scenarios.},

  abstract     = {Existing pilots based channel estimation schemes for orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) systems usually require sufficient guard intervals to avoid pilot-data interference, which inevitably reduces the spectral efficiency (SE). This SE loss can be remedied by using superimposed pilots (SP). In this paper, we propose an effective superimposed full pilots (SFP)-aided iterative channel estimation (SFPCE) scheme for multi-user OTFS uplink systems. First, we derive a multi-user minimum root mean square error (MMSE) channel estimation algorithm and a message passing (MP) data detection algorithm based on the proposed multi-user SFP structure. Then, a de-interference iterative detection (DIID) algorithm is proposed to improve the accuracy of channel estimation and symbol detection. The DIID algorithm only requires a few iterations to achieve optimal performance. Besides, a hybrid superimposed pilot (HSP) structure is introduced to estimate the delay/Doppler taps without sacrificing the SE. Simulation results demonstrate that the accuracy of channel estimation and symbol detection can be significantly improved after several iterations. Moreover, the proposed SFPCE scheme is superior to the superimposed single pilot-aided channel estimation (SSIPCE) and the superimposed sparse pilot-aided channel estimation (SSPPCE) schemes in the bit error rate (BER) performance.},

  abstract     = {When it comes to localization in urban or indoor environments, non-line of sight (NLOS) propagations and the associated multipath effects cannot be avoided, a phenomenon which significantly degrades the localization performance. To remedy the mentioned problem, this article proposes a novel localization method utilizing received signal strength (RSS) and time of arrival (TOA) measurements. To this end, the TOA/RSS hybrid maximum likelihood (ML) problem is cast into a probabilistic non-linear weighted least square (PNLWLS) problem, including probabilistic cost function and probabilistic constraints. Seven hypothesis tests are introduced to determine with what probability each measurement belongs to LOS (or mixed LOS/NLOS) or NLOS propagations. These probability values tightly bound the unknown NLOS error in the PNLWLS problem. The PNLWLS problem is then relaxed to a semi-definite programming (SDP) problem, which can be solved efficiently by interior point methods. Performance of the proposed method is evaluated for 5G technology using MATLAB 5G toolbox. Simulation results show that the proposed method significantly outperforms the existing hybrid methods and attains an estimation variance comparatively closer to the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB).},

Firstly, the PARAFAC model is constructed based on the wideband array output to suppress the noise influence. The propagation matrix, which includes DOA and time delay information, is then separated using a trilinear alternating least squares method. Subsequently, accurate DOA estimation and time delay vectors are obtained using a distributed compressed sensing approach. Finally, the multi-frequency characteristics of the wideband signal are employed to distinguish the main path of the multipath signal based on time delay differences among different paths.

  abstract     = {In reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-aided distributed multiple-input multiple-output (D-MIMO) systems, instantaneous channel state information (CSI) is essential for the optimization of the RIS phase shifts. However, the D-MIMO systems often involve numerous RISs and access points (APs), requiring the transmission of a significant amount of pilots for CSI estimation, thus resulting in high signaling overhead. To mitigate the high signaling overhead associated with CSI estimation, this paper introduces a location-aware communication method that only relies on large-scale fading information. Two new challenges have arisen in the proposed location-aware communication method. First, it is challenging to design a user position estimation method to achieve fast and accurate localization. Second, it is hard to handle the location uncertainty brought by the estimation error when performing beamforming. In response to the above challenges, we first design a space-time cooperative beam training-based localization method to achieve a favorable trade-off between localization accuracy and time cost. Subsequently, to handle the location uncertainty, by taking historical error distribution into consideration, we formulate a distributionally robust optimization (DRO)-based problem for sum-rate maximization. Numerical evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed localization method, which can achieve sub-meter accuracy with low beam training overhead. Furthermore, the proposed DRO-based beamforming method can improve the sum-rate by 11.4% compared to the robust optimization and non-robust schemes.},

In this work, we focus on the joint MUS-BF design with the goal of minimizing the network experience delay. Since the objective function is long-term and non-convex, we first equate the network experience delay with the long-term average network experience delay cost, which can be optimized by reinforcement learning techniques. Then, we propose a distributed MUS-BF scheme based on multi-agent reinforcement learning to minimize the long-term average network experience delay cost, where the adaptive multi-deep Q network (DQN) architecture is designed at each base station (BS) to find suitable MUS-BF with low computational complexity. Each BS is able to train its own multi-DQN and implement appropriate MUS-BF based on the local information. Simulation results validate that the adaptive multi-DQN architecture decreases 70% computational complexity of the proposed algorithm without compromising performance compared to the non-adaptive design. Compared to existing schemes, the proposed scheme achieves superior performance with the lowest information overhead, making it a more appealing solution for real-time MUS-BF in delay-sensitive scenarios.},

  abstract     = {The emergence of reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) represents a notable technological advancement that has gained considerable interest within the wireless communication domain. However, due to cost and privacy concerns, different operators may not make an agreement on cooperatively utilizing RISs and sharing resources. In the presence of non-cooperative base stations (BSs) from different operators, conventional resource allocation and RIS design are rendered inapplicable. Motivated by this fact, we explore the resource allocation scheme for RIS-assisted millimeter wave (mmWave) systems with cooperative and non-cooperative BSs. We first delineate between the cooperation and non-cooperation modes of BSs, based on their agreement concerning the joint utilization of RISs. We then formulate the joint optimization problem of the reflection coefficients of RISs, active beamforming, power allocation, and user association at BSs. The objective is to maximize the sum rates for users served by cooperative BSs while ensuring the channel gain constraints between non-cooperative BSs and their associated users so as to mitigate the effects of RISs on the communication of non-cooperative BSs. To address the mixed binary optimization problem, we leverage the block coordinate descent (BCD) technique to decompose the original problem into several sub-problems, each iteratively optimized until convergence is achieved. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of RISs in improving sum rate performance, while also providing additional benefits by mitigating their impact on non-cooperative BSs and their associated users.},

The proposed algorithm decouples the channel matching and transmission power selection to balance the resource utilization and quality of user experience satisfaction levels. In the first stage, we present a graph theory based centralized spectrum matching scheme to reduce the multiple interference between vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) links, and improve the system capacity of vehicular networks. Secondly, through predicting the future dynamic CSI trends of terminal vehicles based on the locally obtained CSI information, we propose a distributed DDQN based power control scheme to enhance the system reliability and meet the quality of terminal user experience requirements.

  abstract     = {Sub-terahertz (THz) (100–300 GHz) has attracted huge interest in recent years as a promising candidate band for applications in the future sixth-generation wireless networks. However, when extending to higher sub-THz band, the problems of scarce measurement data and incomplete channel characteristics become increasingly evident, hindering the establishment of sub-THz communications. This paper presents the measurements of small-scale fading (SSF) channel characterization and sparsity analysis based on the vector network analyzer in typical indoor scenarios at 215–225 GHz. The directional scanning scheme is adopted to identify the multipath components (MPCs) in a three-dimensional space. The MPC-level parameters, including power, delay, azimuth and elevation angles are estimated based on the power angular delay profiles and then processed with the multipath component distance-based density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise algorithm. Modeling of MPC-level and cluster-level temporal-spatial characteristics are presented. With the correlation matrix of sub-THz MPC-level SSF characteristics, the Gini index, root mean square delay spread, azimuth spread of arrival and elevation spread of arrival are firstly used to comprehensively evaluate the sparsity of the sub-THz channel. In addition, the key factors affecting sub-THz channel sparsity are explored. The numerical results indicate the strong sparsity of the channel at sub-THz band. Specifically, in empty and closed scenarios, the sparse channel characteristics are less pronounced, and there is a notable reduction in sparsity from line-of-sight (LoS) channel to non-LoS channel. The channel characterization extracted from the sub-THz channels in this paper is instrumental in the development of channel modeling, system design and performance assessment of sub-THz communication systems.},

  abstract     = {Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs), have become a revolutionary wireless channel control paradigm as a potential solution for future 6G networks. However, in many scenarios, due to the influence of “multiple-scatterer” environments, the existing RIS-assisted multi-user systems still have limitations in terms of capacity. Therefore, this paper proposes the novel concept of active RIS-assisted movable antenna systems (MAs), which can optimize channel conditions and improve communication performance by locally moving the antenna solely in the receiving area. Additionally, the optimization problem for RIS-assisted multi-user multiple-input single-output (MU-MISO) systems, which aims to maximize the sum-rate among multiple users, also entails beamforming optimization at the base station (BS), phase shift design at the RIS, and MAs positioning. To solve this challenging and nonconvex optimization problem, in the case of a fixed MA's position, the Lagrange dual transform is used to introduce auxiliary variables to decouple the original problem into three subproblems: the optimization of auxiliary variables, the optimization of beamforming transmission on the BS, and the phase shift design of the RIS. Furthermore, to identify the optimal positions of the MAs, an adaptive fractional programming quadratic transform algorithm based on a genetic algorithm (GA) (FPQT-GA) is proposed to investigate the proposed system. The simulation results show that compared with traditional fixed antenna systems (FAs) active RIS-assisted, the employment of MAs can significantly enhance the system's overall performance in typical application scenarios.},

  abstract     = {Optical intelligent reflecting surfaces (OIRSs) represent a paradigm shift towards improving the optical wireless communications capabilities. The application of this developing technology in the field of underwater wireless communication (UWC) systems is a promising way to overcome the limitations associated with such challenging environments. In this research, we analyze the performance improvement provided by OIRS in the context of non-line-of-sight (NLOS) underwater wireless optical communication (UWOC). The OIRS support multiple users by grouping and allocating different OIRS elements to different users based on their distance from the transmitter. To increase the aggregate spectral efficiency (ASE) and preserve user fairness, techniques based on equal mirror assignment (EMA) and distance-based mirror assignment (DMA) are presented. The outcomes are evaluated against conventional orthogonal multiple access (OMA), non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) and rate split multiple access (RSMA) schemes for UWOC. The performance variation of the overall system is also analyzed with respect to the ocean depth. We have also derived the analytical expressions for the probability density function (PDF) of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) considering exponential and generalized gamma (EGG) turbulent model and zero bore-sight model for pointing errors. We use Monte-Carlo simulation results to validate our analytical expressions. Furthermore, an asymptotic analysis of average spectral efficiency is performed to provide a deeper understanding of the proposed system's performance at high SNR. From the results obtained, it is analyzed that proposed DMA based scheme outperforms the EMA, OMA, NOMA and RSMA even with a large number of users.

  abstract     = {This paper investigates the performance of active and passive reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-aided multiple-input single-output systems with imperfect channel state information and discrete phase-shift RIS alignment over a generalized Nakagami-$m$ fading channel. Capitalizing on both a direct link and the assistance of an RIS, a source employs a maximum-ratio transmission approach to enhance the channel gains received by the destination. Approximate closed-form expressions for users' outage probability (OP) and ergodic capacity (EC) are respectively derived to capture the main system characteristics and the performance boundaries at high transmit power regimes, thereby providing useful insights involving the diversity order, coding gain, and ergodic slope. Several extensive simulations are presented and reveal some remarkable points: First, active RISs always bring higher EC than passive RISs and have outstanding outage performance in lower and moderate transmit power regimes. Second, active RIS-based systems can achieve a significantly improved performance by either reducing thermal noise or increasing the amplitude gain. Thirdly, the use of a large number of passive RIS elements yields a significant OP improvement when compared to active RIS design. Finally, increasing the number of antennas can achieve the users' OP and EC enhancement for both active and passive RIS-based systems.},

The electric/magnetic current element in an infinite parallel plate environment is firstly expanded into a vector cylindrical wave function via the mirror image principle. The equivalent electric/magnetic current distribution of the feed is then projected on the vector cylindrical wave basis. Afterwards, the scattering matrix of stratified CLLA is obtained through mode matching technology (MMT), and the field of stratified CLLA with a real feed is solved in an infinite parallel-plate environment. The radiation field of the actual parallel-plate stratified CLLA is then obtained. The numerical results of the proposed approach are in good agreement with the simulation results by commercial software. Finally, the proposed approach is extended to optimal design by integrating with the differential evolution (DE) algorithm, which facilitates the design and optimization of both linearly and circularly polarized CLLAs.},

To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel robust transmit beamforming approach for the MIMO-DFRC system, facilitating multi-user communication through beampattern modulation. Initially, the orthogonal Oppermann sequences are allocated to each user. Subsequently, these sequences are embedded into sub-beampatterns, which encode communication symbols for multi-user information transmission. Furthermore, the encoded information is strategically placed within the sidelobes of the transmit beampattern, aiming to minimize the integrated sidelobe levels. This goal serves as the objective function while maintaining mainlobe detection performance, which imposes a constraint, forming an optimization model for transmit beamforming. Due to the non-convex nature of the optimization model, it is decomposed using a coordinate rotation strategy and addressed iteratively via a convex optimization algorithm. Simulations validate that our method facilitates reliable unidirectional communication among multiple users and preserves the integrity of radar detection performance, contributing to the IoV application of the DFRC technology.},

This paper proposes two innovative designs of hybrid beamforming (HYBF) for a multicell massive multiple-input-multiple-output (mMIMO) millimeter wave (mmWave) FD system. Initially, we introduce a novel centralized HYBF (C-HYBF) scheme, which employs the minorization-maximization (MM) method. However, while centralized beamforming designs offer superior performance, they suffer from high computational complexity, substantial communication overhead, and demand expensive computational resources. To surmount these challenges, we present a framework that facilitates per-link parallel and distributed HYBF (P&D-HYBF) in the mmWave frequency band. This cooperative approach enables each base station (BS) to independently solve its local, low-complexity sub-problems in parallel for each user, resulting in a substantial reduction in communication overhead and computational complexity. Simulation results demonstrate that P& D-HYBF achieves comparable performance to C-HYBF, and with only a few radio-frequency (RF) chains, both designs surpass the capabilities of fully digital half duplex (HD) systems.},

However, in the face of limited wireless communication resources and diverse services, ensuring effective transmission and on-demand dissemination of traffic information has become increasingly urgent. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a novel targeted dissemination strategy driven by integrated sensing, communication and computing (ISCC-TDS), which endows traffic information dissemination with the capability of service awareness and on-demand scheduling. This paper initially establishes the targeted dissemination matrix, which incorporates the sensing of traffic flow and service arrival distribution. Furthermore, the service coexistence mechanism oriented towards communication modeling is designed to maximize the data transmission rate of regular services while ensuring the reliable transmission of emergency services. Additionally, this paper employs an improved proximal policy optimization (PPO) algorithm for computing integration. Simulation results show that the ISCC-TDS can achieve the lowest travel cost in the case of heavy traffic and severe congestion, and there is less than 5% transmission loss for regular services even with the dense arrival of emergency services.zhong},

  abstract     = {The next-generation Internet of Vehicle (IoV) with V2X as the core is the foundation for safe and reliable autonomous driving. As one of the crucial components of V2X, V2I requires roadside units (RSUs) to be equipped with both sensing and communication capabilities. For this reason, integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) is considered a promising technology that will be applied in RSUs. However, when vehicle users (VUs) move to the edge of RSU coverage, ISAC beams from different RSUs may collide and cause inter-region interference. We propose an ISAC-based beam tracking scheme for the multi-RSU V2I scenario based on coordinated multi-point (CoMP) to address this issue. The beam tracking scheme can be divided into two parts. The first part is the beam tracking approach including the method of predicting and estimating state parameters based on the unscented Kalman filter (UKF) and the method of managing VU sets based on predicted state parameters. The second part is the multi-RSU joint resource allocation against inter-region interference based on predicted VU sets to improve the tracking accuracy of VUs. Specifically, an optimization problem to minimize the sum of the posterior Crámer-Rao bound (PCRB) of all VUs is considered. By employing the alternative optimization (AO) algorithm, appropriate wireless resources can be allocated to different VUs, and then a bandwidth index method based on predicted state parameters to avoid spectral conflicts is designed. Finally, we analyze the performance of various schemes through numerical simulations. Our proposed scheme using UKF based on CoMP is outstanding in improving SINR for VUs while maintaining high tracking accuracy compared with other schemes.},

It provides a viable solution to replace the complex fully digital beamforming techniques. However, the current design of precoding and combining matrices in hybrid beamforming solely relies on the channel information, neglecting the crucial consideration of the structure of covariance matrices of the transmit signals. In this paper, we present a novel approach for the joint design of hybrid beamforming matrices at the transmitter and receiver. This approach is centered around the optimization of the covariance matrix of the transmitted signals. Our goal is to maximize the downlink sum rate capacity of the system by achieving an optimal design of the transmit covariance matrix. We tackle the non-convex nature of this problem by leveraging the dual relationship between the broadcast channel (BC) and the multiple access channel (MAC). Through extensive simulations in various scenarios, including point-to-point multi-input multi-output (MIMO), multi-user (MU) multi-input single-output (MISO), and MU-MIMO, we demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method over traditional designs. These results highlight the effectiveness and versatility of our approach in optimizing beamforming for mmWave systems.},

Since the satellite channel is mainly a direct path, and the Nakagami-$m$ distribution fits more experimental data with different $m$, we assume the Nakagami-$m$ distribution as the fading model for the downlink satellite communication system. Furthermore, we derive an exact expression of the system bit-error rate (BER). Then, we optimize the information rate by setting the appropriate number of access users according to BER.

Specifically, these two users are both legitimate users and mutual eavesdroppers. In this system, we investigate the achievable rate for these two users under three typical STAR-RIS protocols, i.e., energy splitting (ES), time splitting (TS) and mode switching (MS). Based on that, a series of weighted sum secrecy rate (WSSR) maximization problems subject to the constraints of BS transmit power and the transmitting and reflecting coefficients (TRCs) of STAR-RIS are formulated, which consider to jointly optimize the active and passive beamforming vectors at the BS and STAR-RIS, respectively. Due to the non-convexity of these problems and the coupled decision variables, the path-following method is applied to approximate the non-convex objective function and then, the alternating optimization (AO) method is utilized to decouple the decision variables. After that, relaxation and penalty convex concave procedure (PCCP) are adopted to solve the decomposed subproblems. In further, we analyze the computational complexity and convergence of the proposed AO-based algorithms. In the end, some numerical simulations have been done to demonstrate the performance of the proposed algorithms, and the results show that the ES protocol always obtains the best performances, followed by the MS protocol, and the TS protocol obtains the worst performance.},

We analyze the reason and establish a condition under which either the secret signal cancellation is inevitable or IA is infeasible. Then a modified IA is proposed. Compared with the traditional LM based IA, a tighter necessary condition is established and the secret signal is protected against cancellation. Moreover, we prove that the proposed condition guarantees the properness of system, which is a rigorous characterization of necessary conditions for achieving IA.

  abstract     = {Automatic Modulation Recognition (AMR) plays a crucial role in wireless communication systems. Deep learning AMR strategies have achieved tremendous success in recent years. Modulated signals exhibit long temporal dependencies, and extracting global features is crucial in identifying modulation schemes. Traditionally, human experts analyze patterns in constellation diagrams to classify modulation schemes. Classical convolutional-based networks, due to their limited receptive fields, excel at extracting local features but struggle to capture global relationships. To address this limitation, we introduce a novel hybrid deep framework named TLDNN, which incorporates the architectures of the transformer and long short-term memory (LSTM). We utilize the self-attention mechanism of the transformer to model the global correlations in signal sequences while employing LSTM to enhance the capture of temporal dependencies. To mitigate the impact like RF fingerprint features and channel characteristics on model generalization, we propose data augmentation strategies known as segment substitution (SS) to enhance the model's robustness to modulation-related features. Experimental results on widely-used datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance and exhibits significant advantages in terms of complexity. Our framework serves as a foundational backbone that can be extended to different datasets and applied to both mobile and static scenarios. We have verified the effectiveness of our augmentation approach in enhancing the generalization, particularly in few-shot scenarios.},

Numerical results validate the correctness of the theoretical ABEP of the multi-hop cooperative G-SFIM system under different CSI conditions.

  abstract     = {Sidelink relay technique is an effective technique for coverage enhancement and data rate improvement, which has recently achieved success in diversified wireless applications. The main bottleneck of applying sidelink to multiple-user multiple-input multiple-output (MU-MIMO) system is how to overcome interference among user equipments (UEs). In this paper, we consider an MU-MIMO relay network with both downlink and uplink UEs, where sidelink reuses the same resources of uplink UEs. To maximize the sum rate of downlink UEs, we propose a novel joint resource block allocation and beamforming design algorithm for the considered MU-MIMO relay network. Specifically, we first formulate an optimization problem with the constraint on the sum-rate degradation of uplink UEs. However, the formulated mixed integer nonlinear programming problem is NP-hard. In order to solve this problem, we first relax the discrete variables and then transform the continuous problem into a convex one based on the weighted minimum mean square error (WMMSE) algorithm. Meanwhile, we prove the equivalence between the aforementioned two problems. Finally, we utilize the block coordinate descent method to solve the transformed problem and obtain the resource block allocation and beamforming design. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm and demonstrate the importance of joint optimization.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, to meet the demand for the rapid growth of data traffic, we design a high data rate chaotic communication scheme. Consequently, we propose a differential chaos shift keying (DCSK) system with hybrid carrier-code and reference index modulation, which makes full use of time-frequency resources (HCCRIM-TF-DCSK). In this system, orthogonal reference signals are generated using Gram-Schmidt algorithm, and reference index modulation is performed in each time slot of each subcarrier by discarding a chosen reference signal. Additionally, the selected Walsh code in active subcarriers is used to perform the Kronecker product with the reference signal to achieve higher data rates. Furthermore, at the receiver, an efficient joint carrier-code index detection algorithm is proposed, and noise reduction processing is employed to improve the system's bit error rate (BER) performance. The theoretical BER expressions of the HCCRIM-TF-DCSK system over additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) and multipath Rayleigh fading channels are derived. Furthermore, this paper provides an analysis of the system's data rate, spectral efficiency, energy efficiency and complexity compared to those of advanced competitors. Simulation results confirm the accuracy of the theoretical derivations and the superiority of the system. Overall, the HCCRIM-TF-DCSK system is expected to become a cost-effective wireless communication solution.},

Besides seeking for additional physical resources for improving performance, such as Device-to-Device (D2D) paradigm and Intelligent Reflecting Surface (IRS), with Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI), information forecast brings a new dimension to unleash the potential of MEC. However, most existing literature does not tailor information forecast algorithm to the MEC context, which diminishes the utility of the forecast information. In this work, we propose a framework for adaptive task offloading based on channel forecast for MEC system. Specifically, we first propose an online resource allocation algorithm with forecast information through Lyapunov optimization. Then, the performance in terms of delay and power consumption is analyzed in closed-form, based on which critical insight towards the requirements on forecast algorithm is obtained. Next, based on Sparse Gaussian Process and Linear Model of Coregionalization (SGP-LMC), we propose a channel forecast algorithm to find a desired trade-off between forecast accuracy and model complexity in terms of maximizing the utility of forecast information. Finally, simulation is performed to verify the performance improvements.},

While CFmMIMO can achieve a macro diversity gain in mMTC, its fronthaul link capacity severely limits system performance. To balance fronthaul overhead and detection/estimation performance, in this paper we investigate joint user activity detection and channel estimation (JADCE) and develop a framework for uplink grant-free CFmMIMO systems based on mixed-quantization fronthaul compression. First, we model the JADCE problem as a mixed-quantization compressing sensing problem, making use of sporadic transmission nature of devices in mMTC. A multiple measurement vector (MMV) generalized approximate message passing (GAMP) algorithm is proposed to improve the performance of activity detection and channel estimation. Unknown priori parameters of the GAMP algorithm can be estimated by an expectation-maximization algorithm. In addition, we design a threshold detection rule at central processing unit (CPU) side and derive a lower bound of active user detection performance in a centralized CFmMIMO system. Numerical results reveal that the proposed mixed-quantization scheme can strike a good balance between fronthaul overhead and detection/estimation performance, verifying that a CFmMIMO with mixed-quantization scheme can perform well in activity detection and channel estimation by selecting an appropriate number of quantization bits.},

However, the presence of both services creates a difficult resource allocation problem due to their heterogeneous requirements. To address the challenge of simultaneously providing eMBB and URLLC services in vehicular networks, we propose a resource allocation approach that maximizes eMBB rate while ensuring that both URLLC latency and reliability requirements are satisfied. Our approach utilizes non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) technology, where the resource for eMBB services is allocated by slot and the traffic of URLLC service is accommodated using mini-slots. To solve this dual time-scale problem, we employ a dual decomposition and sub-gradient method to solve the power allocation and resource block assignment of eMBB services, while the Vogel's approximation method (VAM) and modified distribution method (MODI) are proposed to solve the URLLC resource allocation problem. Additionally, we present two low-complexity heuristic algorithms for the URLLC sub-problem. Simulation results indicate that our proposed approach surpasses baseline methods in terms of both eMBB rate and fairness.},

The EMS enables power sharing among the ICE and the HESS under a fully active topology to improve control flexibility, considering that the ICE-generator set and HESS efficiencies are limited to a specific power injection operating range and transient responses. In this context, power sharing is performed using S-shaped functions that focus on maximizing supercapacitor usability to reduce fuel consumption and battery current stress. The advantage of the S-shaped function lies on its easy configuration and reduced number of control parameters. Additionally, meta-heuristic optimization is used to tune the S-shaped functions according to the sources requirements for optimal performance in standard driving cycles, while Lyapunov’s indirect method performs the stability analysis of the control strategy. Finally, experimental and computational simulations are accomplished to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed EMS compared with traditional methods and an optimal approach.},

The dynamic model and efficiency model of each topology are established. The proposed integration optimization method includes a dynamic programming (DP) algorithm and a particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. DP takes energy loss as the objective function to optimize the control strategy of the operation process. PSO takes the linear superposition value of energy loss and motor power level as the objective function to optimize design parameters. The optimization results of five topologies are compared to get the optimal topology. The results of integrated optimization experiments show that the speed coupling - double brake topology is the optimal topology. Compared with the prototype, the energy loss is reduced by 10.37% and the system production cost has been well controlled. The comparison experiments further validate the superiority of utilizing PSO as the upper layer algorithm compared to other comparative algorithms.},

Firstly, the mathematical model with reflecting unknown disturbances of SBW system is established. Secondly, a new sliding mode reaching law with parameter adjustment function is proposed, which can dynamically adjust the reaching speed of system state according to the distance from sliding mode surface. Thirdly, an extended state observer with hyperbolic tangent function is designed to prevent the observation peak, and an adaptive law with mapping method is constructed to limit excessive disturbance compensation, which can estimate and compensate unknown disturbances effectually. Finally, the ADSMC method is applied to SBW system, and the effectiveness of ADSMC method is verified by simulation and test.

The forward-backward averaging scheme is adopted to construct real-valued tensor signal model instead of the complex-valued one, yielding the better accuracy at modest complexity. The proposed unitary PARAFAC algorithm is performed by decomposing the real-valued tensor without signal subspace estimate. Due to the inherent smoothing processing of the proposed unitary PARAFAC algorithm, it can effectively deal with high correlated target. Additionally, the proposed unitary PARAFAC algorithm can automatically obtain pair parameters including range and velocity of the same target without additional pair-matching operation. More importantly the regularized alternative least squares (RALS) algorithm is used to improve the decomposition performance of the real-valued tensor while maintaining iteration stability.

Typically, engineers define a control structure in advance and then tune its parameters in a real-world driving scenario through trial-and-error method. This method is undoubtedly time and resource consuming, and dis-courages the exploration of different control structures. In this paper, we present an improved learning-based controller tuning approach and achieve the rapid tuning of a trajectory tracking controller for a real vehicle. The proposed approach employs the framework of model-based reinforcement learning, in which a probabilistic dynamics model is first learned from the real data and then the controller parameters are updated based on the learned model. To facilitate real-world applications, the aleatoric uncertainties of the real vehicle and the measurement system are distinguished and separated during the learning of probabilistic model. Additionally, the original state propagation framework is extended by incorporating steering response model and prepro-cessed Gaussian noise. Simulation and experimental results show that controllers can be well tuned within 3 trials by our approach and the comprehensive tracking performance (i.e., cumulative cost) can be improved by up to 76% compared with the initial controller parameters. More importantly, the tuned controllers maintain high tracking accuracy in untrained driving scenarios. We believe that this approach will help to accelerate the controller design and tuning of autonomous vehicles.},

However, complicated intersection conditions and several safety problems challenge the optimal cooperative driving of CAVs. This paper proposes a bilevel coordination framework for CAVs at unsignalized intersections to improve efficiency and robustness while guaranteeing safety. The upper level focuses on a conflict-free and real-time scheduling problem for optimal passing order, and the results are transmitted to each CAV in the lower level for distributed control. To guarantee safety, we first project the conflicting vehicles on virtual lanes based on the conflict zones inside the intersection. Furthermore, the scheduling problem is transformed into a packing problem and formulated as a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) for higher traffic efficiency. We propose three practical principles to obtain the real-time solutions by removing several redundant constraints in the optimization problem. Eventually, considering the inevitable bounded disturbances (e.g., unmodeled dynamics and equipment measurement errors), a distributed robust model predictive controller is designed to form and keep the desired virtual platoons under uncertainty. Numerical simulations validate that the proposed method saves 4.2%-6.6% total evacuation time under heavy traffic volume.},

  abstract     = {Accurate trajectory prediction of surrounding vehicles is crucial for ensuring the safety of autonomous vehicles. However, current methods based on neural networks still have room for improvement by further reducing their long-term error. This challenge stems from extracting temporal feature dependencies and mining spatial interactions in lane change scenarios. Previous research has not adequately established the connection between the past and the future features. To this end, we propose a spatial-temporal multi-feature fusion and intention-enlightened decoding (STMF-IE) model that jointly considers all these aspects. Initially, STMF-IE uses multi-head temporal self-attention to establish temporal dependencies that make explicit the extent of information usage at different time steps. The interplay between the neighboring vehicles and the target vehicle is quantitatively depicted through a devised multi-head spatial cross-attention mechanism. Furthermore, a multi-feature fusion module is proposed such that the extracted temporal dependence and spatial interaction features are integrated to reduce the superfluous features. Additionally, a novel mask matrix and an intention-enlightened decoding module are developed to refine the prediction performance in different lane change scenarios. Experimental results show that STMF-IE outperforms state-of-the-art methods for long-term prediction on NGSIM and highD datasets. We improve the RMSE metric by 13%–36% at a prediction horizon of 3$\sim$5 s. We also analyze the spatial-temporal feature correlation through visual results, promoting more interpretation.},

  abstract     = {This paper is concerned with the cooperative dynamic positioning problem of marine surface vehicles (MSVs) subject to model uncertainty, unknown states as well as limited communication bandwidth. Particularly, a novel event-triggered fuzzy state observer (ETFSO), using fuzzy logic systems (FLS) and event-triggered mechanism, is developed that the unmeasured velocity is estimated at aperiodically sampled instants with only an updating adaptive parameter rather than heavy weight matrix, thus reducing the communication and computation loads. To well enhance the tradeoff between control performance and communication constraint, a prescribed specification is established via a boundary function, thereby precisely specifying the transient and steady-state performances of synchronized errors. Based on that, the controller is then devised via an input-based event-triggered rule and thruster allocation technique. Finally, simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control protocol.},

  abstract     = {Rear-end collision where a human-driven vehicle (HV) hits an autonomous vehicle (AV) from behind (called HV-AV collision) represents a critical scenario in the context of mixed traffic including both AVs and HVs. In the present paper, the Human-like Brake Initiation and Modulation (HLBIM) model is first proposed to emulate the driver brake control, and further employed to investigate HV-AV collision risk in the Stop-in-Lane (SiL) scenario where an HV follows an AV. The HLBIM model combines human driving intention, vision-based expectancy and certain inherent characteristics of human driving based on a novel dynamic accumulation of braking-needed evidence. Especially, the HLBIM model incorporates a high-level expectancy derived from practical driving expertise to ensure precise timing for braking initiation. Furthermore, the combined distribution of Off-Road-Glance and Time-Headway is originally proposed and integrated into the HLBIM model, to emulate drivers' diverted attention during their driving activities. Our approach addresses a main issue, which is often neglected in the existing studies on HV-AV collision, which corresponds to the coupling effect of human driving intention, vision-based expectancy and inherent characteristic of human driving on HV-AV collision risk. Moreover, we analyze HV-AV collision risk in two specified SiL cases, which has rarely been investigated in existing related studies. The model performance comparison shows that our HLBIM model outperforms the referred models. Furthermore, the case study comprehensively reveals how the HV-AV collision probability changes with respect to various collision speeds, initial speeds, decelerations of cars under test, percentages of overlap detection of the AV in front, and lane change durations. The HLBIM model can be used to simulate driver-in-the-loop car-following experiment. Moreover, it can be fitted in automatic braking systems within AVs to achieve human-like braking.},

  abstract     = {It is well-known that classical direction of arrival (DOA) estimation methods work well in the case of large samples. However, these methods may be theoretically invalid in the case of small samples, which frequently occur in large array systems. Such a large array has two effects: i) The number of samples is relatively quite small, and ii) the dimension of samples is very large. To handle the above problems, a more appropriate method for solving DOA estimators in the case of high-dimensional and small samples is proposed in this paper. First, considering the special structure of received samples, an alternative well-estimated second-order statistic, known as the Gram matrix, is originally constructed to better utilize the spatial and statistical information of signals and noise contained by small samples. Second, two novel methods for estimating the number of targets are derived by combining the Gram matrix and information-theoretic criteria. Third, a novel object function and the corresponding algorithm based on the Gram matrix are designed to estimate the signal subspace more efficiently, and then the DOAs of targets are obtained by multiple signal classification methods. In particular, the theoretical analysis indicates that the improved signal subspace estimation algorithm only needs to decompose the low-dimensional Gram matrix instead of the high-dimensional sample covariance matrix. Finally, simulation results are provided to demonstrate the high accuracy and lower computational complexity of the proposed methods in the case of high-dimensional and small samples.},

  abstract     = {Due to the rising number of Electric Vehicles (EV), the subsequent increase in demand for charging, as well as the long charging time, will make it difficult for drivers to charge their vehicles. Current charging service platforms inform their customers of the charging station information for the network to which they belong. However, they do not ensure the reliability and credibility of information and do not share the charging information of other charging stations. To address this issue, a model in which CSs collaborate for information sharing and charging must be developed. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based integrated charging platform for charging cooperation. Verifier groups for each CS verify the reliability of shared information. We applied the concept of Mobile Charging Stations (MCSs) to help busy CSs, reducing EV charging latency. We also designed a contribution-based incentive distribution process to elicit active CSs' cooperation. We performed a charging scenario simulation and blockchain implementation to demonstrate the proposed model's efficacy. The simulation results showed that the proposed charging scenario with MCS application showed a 46.9 % reduction in waiting time. Also, when the number of verifier members equals the global average of EVs per charging spot, the verification time is approximately 547 ms, demonstrating that the proposed model is effective.},

  abstract     = {The Virtually Coupled Train Set (VCTS) is a promising framework to improve the efficiency of urban rail transits (URTs), addressing challenges introduced by time-varying and location-varying passenger flow. However, traditional train control models, relying on liner approximation methods to fit nonlinear dynamic models, cannot meet the safety-critical and latency-sensitive task requirements of VCTS systems. Although artificial intelligence (AI)-based control models are promising, substantial training data and computational resources is challenging in URTs. In response to these challenges, this paper proposes a novel digital twin (DT) driven VCTS framework and an iterative-based control policy learning approach. In the designed DT-driven VCTS system, we collect essential training data from the physical domain, representing the real-world environment. We employ model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) to learn the dynamic train model and optimize the train control policy in the digital domain, a simulated environment mirroring the physical domain. This approach uniquely leverages model predictions for policy optimization during the training process, adapting to a broad range of scenarios beyond reliance on actual operational data. Furthermore, by employing an iterative learning approach and integrating the physical and digital domains, the train control model and policy can be updated to effectively handle uncertainties and complexities encountered in real-world situations. Extensive experiments validates the effectiveness of our proposed framework, demonstrating its robust performance and adaptability across diverse conditions.},

One is the decision-making module, in which the desired sailing speed and course angular velocity are generated. More specifically, through adopting the velocity obstacle approach (VOA), the feasible obstacle avoidance action set is obtained. Then, considering the maneuvering characteristics of ASVs, the discrete optional obstacle avoidance actions are obtained by using the dynamic window approach (DWA). Finally, by introducing the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea (COLREGs), the obstacle avoidance actions that meet the rules can be screened out. An evaluation function is designed to select the final practical obstacle avoidance action. The second part is the dynamic controller module. A radial basis function (RBF) neural network-based path point tracking controller design is given in this part.

Interference degrades radar target detection performance and makes sensed information unreliable, so interference suppression is necessary. In this paper, a novel method based on power-weighted Hough transform is proposed for mitigating the radar mutual interference and improving the safety of autonomous driving systems. Firstly, the frequency modulation characteristics of interference signals and target echo signals are analyzed, and differences between the two signals are presented. Secondly, based on the straight line detection technique, the interference power in the time-frequency domain is accumulated, and the interference is accurately detected and localized. Finally, the target echo is recovered by an autoregressive model. Compared with existing state-of-the-art methods, the proposed method has the ability to retain more useful signals after interference mitigation, and achieve better interference detection robustness under low signal-to-noise ratio conditions.

Specifically, a new surface-frontier information structure is extended to maintain the rich semantic information for the fine-grained planning. Driven by an attention-based frontier filter, a novel relevance-aware frontier sequence generation method is proposed to achieve the concentrative reconstruction of the target.

  abstract     = {Urban autonomous driving decision-making poses a significant challenge, particularly when navigating unsignalized intersections. This complexity mainly stems from the stochastic interactions between various traffic participants. While reinforcement learning (RL)-based decision-making has shown promise, there are valid concerns regarding safety and adaptability. In particular, current RL-based models lack safeguards to prevent issuing potentially unsafe commands in unfamiliar scenarios that are not covered during training. To mitigate this issue, this paper proposes a safe decision-making framework to improve driving safety at unsignalized intersections. First, the RL-based policy is constructed based on the soft actor-critic (SAC) that maps environmental observations into actions directly. Subsequently, the reliability of the SAC policy is measured at run-time via epistemic uncertainty quantification. Furthermore, the risky actions of the RL policy are filtered based on the estimated reliability with integrating a risk-adaptive model predictive control (RAMPC) backup policy. Finally, an unsignalized intersection with occlusion is built via Simulation of Urban Mobility (SUMO). More importantly, several cases are carried out to simulate scenario data distribution shifts, i.e., traffic flow density variation, observation with sensor noise, and observation range decrease, which are not included in the RL policy training process. The results suggest that the proposed method can reduce risk and enhance the safety of autonomous driving at unsignalized intersections.},

  abstract     = {Dual-antenna Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) has the advantage of independently measuring absolute attitude information without relying on Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU). In order to utilize this advantage to assist in the rapid absolute initialization of odometry, it is necessary to study the spatiotemporal calibration between dual-antenna GNSS and odometry. Considering that existing research mainly focuses on the calibration of single antenna GNSS/IMU and odometry, and frequently neglects the time-delay between sensors, so in order to make up for the gap in the calibration of dual-antenna GNSS and odometry, this paper proposes a spatiotemporal calibration method based on Kalman filter. The method comprehensively considers motion constraints among multiple vectors during vehicle movement and the time-delay between sensors, employs the feedback correction strategy of indirect filtering to solve the challenge of estimating large installation misalignment angle, and realizes joint estimation of time-delay and spatial extrinsic parameters. The results of simulation and field tests show that the proposed method can accurately achieve the spatiotemporal calibration and has significant advantages over existing methods. The time-delay estimation accuracy is smaller than the minimum data output interval, and the estimation errors of rotation and translation extrinsic parameters are about 0.1° and 0.01 m, respectively.},

  abstract     = {An Autonomous Driving System (ADS) uses various sensors and deep learning to improve navigation and control tasks. Maintaining road safety requires that these tasks are seamlessly synchronized and consistently utilize the most recent sensing data. This synchronization poses challenges due to 1) various sensing periods across different sensors, 2) the interdependency of tasks, and 3) constraints on computational resources. Our research pioneers the use of the Age of Information (AoI) to measure task scheduling performance within ADS. With theoretical analysis, we disclose that optimizing AoI simultaneously minimizes response time and maximizes throughput. We then offer a formal definition of the AoI-centric task scheduling problem. Given the NP-hardness of this problem, we design a 4-approximation algorithm. To enhance the practicality of our solutions, we propose an extended formulation optimizing AoI-centric scheduling over a specified cycle and correspondingly develop a reinforcement learning-based approach. Experimental simulations, benchmarked against the Apollo driving system, demonstrate that our AoI-optimized task scheduling outperforms Apollo's scheduling mechanisms in terms of AoI, throughput, and worst-case response time. Notably, our proposed solution operating on four cores yields a maximum AoI lower than Apollo's schedulers running on eight cores.},

This task is challenging due to the inherent nonlinear characteristics in traffic evolution. The popular deep learning-based traffic prediction methods lack the in-depth exploration of traffic evolution features. In this work, we propose a novel three-channel Temporal Convolution Network (TCN) framework incorporating temporal complex network feature information for airport delay prediction. The complex network feature sequence of the temporal networks can effectively capture the nonlinear dynamic behavior of airport delays. Firstly, we divide the original time series of airport delays into three distinct series (current, daily, and weekly) and feed them into three channels of our model. This operation allows the model to effectively capture the inherent characteristics of local proximity and global periodicity in airport delay time series. Secondly, the complex networks are converted from airport delay time series using complex network theory, and the topological features of networks are combined with three-chamel TCN, to improve the ability of learning short-term nonlinearity of airport delay evolution. Finally, we incorporate weather condition and flight schedule information as external features to further enhance the prediction accuracy. We perform extensive experiments on a flight dataset at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport (ATL), and the results demonstrate the superiority of our approach compared to existing benchmark methods.},

Addressing these pivotal challenges, this paper introduces a novel motion planning method employing a Lidar point cloud-based potential field (PF). Our approach innovatively extracts the drivable area boundary from point cloud, enhancing computational efficiency and reducing common perception errors, such as missed detections and inaccurate obstacle shape estimation. Built upon this drivable area boundary, the PF effectively represents the cost of traversing diverse areas. The PF is integrated into a model predictive control (MPC) framework to generate control commands considering vehicle dynamics, constraints, collision avoidance, and passenger comfort. Given the highly nonlinear nature of simultaneous longitudinal and lateral motion planning, an efficient Frenet frame-based trajectory sampling method is developed to provide an initial guess of the optimal trajectory for this complex motion planning task. The perception module has been validated in real bus tests, confirming its reliability and efficiency, and the entire motion planning methodology has been rigorously tested through simulations. These simulations show that our method efficiently generates smooth and safe control commands, even in challenging scenarios where the obstacle vehicle suddenly changes its lane, and remains robust under considerable state observation noise.},

  abstract     = {With the increase in urban traffic congestion, the problem of identifying vulnerable areas of road networks has attracted wide attention. Existing studies have mainly used mediated centrality methods or algorithms based on link analysis to find critical and vulnerable nodes in road network systems through network centrality methods. However, the experimental results of the mediated centrality approach under large-scale road network datasets have a certain degree of randomness, while the link analysis algorithms ignore the structure and interrelationships among nodes. For this reason, this paper proposes a new method to quickly identify vulnerable areas of road networks based on interflow degree and spatial density clustering. The main contribution of this paper is the introduction of a clustering-based road network density-related area vulnerability indicator $AVI$ aimed at assessing the level of area vulnerability. The indicator focuses on the relationship between the road network structure and nodes, avoiding randomness by considering all intersection nodes. Theoretical analysis indicates that the proposed method demonstrates excellent global stability and achieves a significantly lower time complexity of $O(n^{2})$ compared to the traditional Betweenness Centrality method, which has a time complexity of $O(n^{5})$. Through experimental validation of data from Beijing, London, New York, and Tokyo, the results show that the proposed method has high accuracy and reliability in identifying vulnerable areas of the road network with acceptable time complexity.},

Unlike existing data-driven motion forecasting approaches that do not explicitly consider human-like motion planning, this work proposes learning from human (expert) behavior based on Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL). We design a novel Hierarchical Transformer-based Motion Forecasting framework, called HTMF, that learns the multimodal future motion distribution using maximum entropy IRL and leverages transformer-based learned occupancy grid maps as a context-aware approximation to the true distribution, enabling the generation of realistic motions. To assess the performance of the proposed approach, we conduct comprehensive experiments on large-scale real-world datasets across diverse challenging scenarios such as highways and unsignalized intersections. The results demonstrate that HTMF outperforms other benchmark motion forecasting methods in terms of prediction errors and in generating more plausible and human-like trajectories.},

  abstract     = {Path tracking control is a crucial function in an autonomous vehicle. Previous studies have presented conventional model-based controllers, which lack generalization ability, especially in dealing with high-curvature cases. In contrast to those model-based controllers, data-driven controllers, represented by reinforcement learning (RL), are promising to improve tracking control accuracy and generalization by online learning. However, the inherent inexplicability of RL degrades the stability of an RL-based controller, further limiting its applications in real-world autonomous driving cases. To resolve this issue, this study proposes an adaptive tracking controller based on RL, allowing to enhance network stability through a preview model and adaptive correction. It is composed of three modules, namely a lateral controller, a lateral adaptive corrector, and a longitudinal speed planner. Specifically, the preview control theory is combined with the twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient (TD3) method to improve the tracking convergence of the lateral controller; the adaptive corrector derives correction compensations based on predicted waypoints along a path, thus enhancing control accuracy; the longitudinal planner outputs a speed profile via a reward increment soft actor-critic algorithm, through which large lateral tracking errors are reduced. Using an intelligent vehicle with sufficient steering capability, simulations and real-world tests show that curvy paths with a curvature larger than 2.0 m−1 can be closely tracked within an error bound of 0.1 m.},

Additionally, a novel dual-training paradigm is introduced, combining curriculum learning and modal separation techniques to address the complexities of multi-modal learning. A notable contribution is the strategic integration of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) algorithms, which mitigate information decay and preserve essential navigational strategies over extended periods.

These challenges arise from a “task-unaware” conventional tracking methodology that treats bounding box regression and classification as indistinct tasks, neglecting their differing feature requirements. This paper introduces a “task-aware” tracking methodology, addressing these issues by discriminating between the two subtasks and assigning them their optimal feature representations. The methodology includes a “task-aware” encoder, a “task-aware” decoder, and a mutual-self training strategy. The encoder provides tailored feature representations for each subtask, while the decoder employs distinct structures to leverage these task-specific features. The mutual-self training strategy further enhances performance by fostering synergy between the subtasks. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed approach. It outperforms the SOTA drone tracker by 2.3% and 3.8% across six drone tracking datasets and surpasses its baseline by 12% and 9% on average. Additionally, tests on conventional tracking datasets show the method's robustness, matching SOTA conventional trackers while improving the baseline by 28% and 13.5% across two metrics. This innovative method bridges the gap between task-specific needs and feature usage, advancing drone tracking performance. Codes and results will be publicly available.},

Considering the aforementioned limitations, a hierarchical federated data distillation method based on UAV-assisted MEC systems is proposed, called Data Augmentation Distilled Federated Learning (DADFL). Specifically, DADFL reduce the communication process between clients and edge servers to just one round. Each client extracts their private dataset, sends synthesized data to the server, and collectively trains a global model. Building upon this, we propose a Global Optimal Iterative Search Algorithm (GOISA) considering client heterogeneity and resource constraints. GOISA minimizes overall latency by optimizing client heterogeneity, bandwidth allocation, and UAV transmission rates. Simulation experiments demonstrate that our proposed system achieves performance comparable to or even better than traditional federated learning, while reducing communication overhead by three orders of magnitude, greatly improving communication efficiency.},

Traffic signs provide essential road information and regulatory instructions, which are critical to ensuring road safety. This paper presents the HCLT-YOLO model to address the challenges of false alarms and missed detections in complex traffic environments. Specifically, we propose a novel hybrid CNN-transformer network architecture that efficiently integrates both local and global features, thereby improving traffic sign feature representation. To further enhance the modelâs sensitivity to small traffic signs, we optimize the structure by introducing a dedicated small-object detection layer through upsampling and by leveraging SIoU to improve detection accuracy and computational efficiency. However, the addition of the small object detection layer and the Transformer module increases the overall computational complexity and parameter count, potentially affecting real-time performance. To address this issue, we introduce the DG-C2f module, which employs linear transformations for feature mapping, streamlining the convolution process and enhancing real-time feasibility. Experimental evaluations on the GTSDB and TT100K datasets demonstrate that the proposed model improves detection accuracy by 2.5$\%$ and 6.8$\%$, respectively, compared to YOLOv8s models. Notably, the detection accuracy for small traffic signs improved significantly, by 6.9$\%$ and 11.7$\%$, respectively. Additionally, processor-in-the-loop experiments on the NVIDIA Jetson AGX Orin show that the model achieves an inference speed of 46 FPS, meeting the real-time requirements for in-vehicle applications.},

A methodology based on studies from various procedures, both from research and the industrial sector (Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) & Tier1), is employed. A Design of Experiments (DoE) approach was employed to guide the experimental procedures, enabling the precise determination of critical parameters, magnitudes, and their interrelationships. Most studies on characterization focus on a single aspect, idealizing or simplifying other influences and nonlinearities, which limits the analysis and does not include the complete drivetrain. An analysis of Field Oriented Control (FOC) and its performance was conducted. This included experimentally quantification of factors such as losses, inertias, phase resistances, temperatures, back electromotive force (BEMF), nominal and peak torque and power, efficiencies, inductances and magnetic flux. Correlations were established through equations or Look Up Tables (LUT), to capture the nonlinearities, determining their effects on other variables. A numerical model of the powertrain was generated and validated in AVL CRUISETM M. The prediction error for torque and power of the model is less than 3%, and the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) for the phase (id) and quadrature (iq) currents are less than 4.74% and 2.51%, respectively. The model reduces the need for experimental testing in the development of electric powertrains. The experimental procedure described in this work enables a comprehensive characterization of the drivetrain, specifically addressing the nonlinearities and associated effects such as magnetic circuit saturation, inductance variation, and temperature impact, thereby providing a more accurate representation of the SPMSM motor's behavior.},

  abstract     = {Assessing risk in traffic scenarios is crucial for advancing autonomous vehicle safety. As the number of vehicles and their interactions increase, there is a heightened need for prompt and precise risk evaluation. Traditional collision warning systems, which rely on conflict points, are limited to specific traffic scenarios and are inadequate for the dynamic demands of complex and diverse traffic environments. Additionally, current field-based risk assessment methods evaluate collision risks based only on instantaneous vehicle motion states, lacking in both timeliness and accuracy. To address these challenges, this paper proposed a novel risk assessment method. It involves constructing a vehicle-road cooperative environment using a distributed digital twins system and employs a multi-agent multi-modal trajectory prediction algorithm to forecast future vehicle motion states. By leveraging predictive multi-dimensional kinematic features, the proposed method dynamically generates future driving risk fields, effectively assesses collision risks in complex traffic scenarios by modeling multi-source collision risks within future traffic scenes. Extensive simulation results and analyses reveal that DPDRF significantly improves the average Pre-Collision Warning Time (PCWT) by 2.53 times compared to DDRPF and by 1.81 times compared to DSF. Furthermore, DPDRF reduces the average Pre-Collision Warning Error (PCWE) by 79% relative to PRF.},

  abstract     = {Reducing the power consumption of baseband chips in wireless terminals of the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) is a great challenge. Among them, the rate matching and interleaving hardware module occupies a significant portion of power consumption in the baseband chip, so it is of great significance to design a low power rate matching and interleaving hardware. The interleavers used in 4G LTE and 5G NR/ 6G have not been merged into a single architecture. It is possible to use the same hardware for different communication standards to reduce hardware resources and power consumption. This paper studies the rate matching and block interleaving of turbo codes, convolutional codes, polar codes, and LDPC codes used in 4G LTE and 5G NR/ 6G communication links. With regard to the different algorithms for these four types of encoding, the sharing design is carried out on the hardware structure. In this experiment, according to the proposed storage and interleaving sharing scheme for hardware design and hardware implementation, the memory area of 0.1 μm2 and power consumption overhead of 4.33 mW are obtained based on the SMIC 28 nm process and the operating frequency of 50 MHZ. This achieves the maximum hardware reuse of four encoding schemes in the downlink communication link of 4G LTE and 5G NR/ 6G, and reduces power consumption.},

The algorithm decomposes the overall optimization problem into three successive subproblems, which are solved sequentially. During the three stages of the algorithm, the estimation of the total cost function's average gradient information, consensus among the states, and tracking of the optimal state trajectories are achieved in turn. Given the segmentation strategy's demand for rapid convergence, the algorithm ensures convergence within a prescribed time. Using the Lyapunov method, it is shown that all three subproblems can be solved within any user-prescribed time, independent of the system's initial states or topology. To further exploit the independence of prescribed-time convergence from system states, the algorithm eliminates the reliance on system topology information in parameter settings by introducing adaptive parameters in place of traditional fixed ones, thus enabling fully distributed control. Finally, numerical simulations and an UAV target tracking experiment are conducted to validate the effectiveness and practicality of the proposed algorithm.},

  abstract     = {Ultraviolet (UV) communication has garnered considerable attention as a method utilizing UV particle scattering for signal transmission. However, the significant path loss due to scattering presents challenges in maintaining signal quality in dynamic communication scenarios. Increasing the emitted signal power is not a viable solution due to safety regulations on radiated energy. Therefore, adaptive power control mechanisms are essential. In this paper, we develop a radiation model for UV LED arrays and propose a power optimization method tailored for UV LED arrays in linear communication links. This method accounts for variables such as communication distance, the number of active LEDs, and the transmit power of each LED, integrating both line-of-sight (LOS) and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) components into the receiver power calculation. We formulate an optimization problem with constraints on bit error rate (BER) and control parameters, aiming to minimize transmit power and beam coverage area. The particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is employed to solve this problem. The results indicate that the model we proposed is able to reduce the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) by 3.05dB to 4.06dB, thereby reducing the transmit power requirements. With BER constraints, the proposed power control strategy ensures energy stabilization across a broad range, with the maximum energy overshoot during distance variations being 41.22%. Compared to power control methods in visible light communication (VLC) systems, the method proposed in this paper is more aligned with the channel characteristics of UV communication. Building on traditional constant-power UV communication systems, the method proposed in this paper can reduce the transmit power by up to 84.24%.},

  abstract     = {To design a reliable communication system leveraging millimeter-wave (mm-wave) technology-gaining popularity for its capacity to deliver multi-gigabit-per-second data rates-it is essential to consider the site-specific nature of mm-wave propagation. Conventional site-general stochastic channel models often fail to reproduce channel responses in specific usage scenarios or environments accurately. To enable high-precision channel simulation that captures site-specific characteristics, this paper proposes a channel modeling framework leveraging the widely accepted 3GPP map-based hybrid channel modeling approach and provides a detailed methodology for applying it to real-world scenarios with practical examples. First, an extensive measurement campaign was conducted in typical urban macro and micro cellular environments using an in-house dual-band (24/60 GHz) double-directional channel sounder. The mm-wave channel behavior was then characterized, with a focus on differences between the two frequencies. Following this, site-specific large-scale and small-scale channel properties were parameterized. As a critical component for enhancing prediction accuracy, this paper introduces an exponential decay model for the power-delay characteristics of non-line-of-sight clusters, which are often significantly overestimated by deterministic prediction tools. Finally, using the in-house channel model simulator (CPSQDSIM) developed for grid-wise channel data (PathGridData) generation, a marked improvement in prediction accuracy over the existing 3GPP map-based channel model was demonstrated.},

This paper proposed a channel estimation for a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) OTFS system with high delay resolution in high-mobility environment. Shifts of the path indices and path appearance/disappearance are studied in this work. Due to the high mobility of the user and high delay resolution, the studied system can be more sensitive to index shift of paths. Considering the fractional components in OTFS channel, only the significant CSI elements are processed with minimum performance loss. A Deep Learning supported 3-phase scheme is developed. An auto-encoder (AE) is first deployed for compressed channel features, followed by a recurrent neural network (RNN) based scheme that provides a rough channel prediction. The indices of significant elements in the predicted channel are then extracted using the decoder function of the AE process. Finally, the values of the significant elements are reconstructed via the Least Squares based method. Analysis is provided on erroneous path predictions, i.e., missing existing paths or detecting non-existent paths. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed 3-phase scheme can outperform the existing channel prediction schemes with a much better accuracy and lower bit error rate in high-mobility use cases.},

  abstract     = {Integrated satellite-terrestrial networks (ISTN) are regarded as a critical 6G technology capable of providing seamless global communication coverage.

In this paper, we investigate a multi-agent DRL-based power control algorithm for minimizing the average age of information (AoI) in the non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) enabled ISTN. Specifically, a multi-agent proximal policy optimization (PPO) is employed to jointly allocate the power and reduce inter-beam interference. Due to the imperfect serial interference cancellation (SIC), the average AoI minimization is formulated as a non-convex problem that satisfies both quality of service constraints and total power limitations. Therefore, a generalized advantage estimation PPO-based power allocation (GAP3A) algorithm is proposed, which operates by centralized training and decentralized execution (CTDE) to enhance the training stability. Especially, an ingenious, global reward function is designed to guide the DRL training towards minimizing the average AoI of the ISTN. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed CTDE-based GAP3A algorithm can effectively lower the average AoI to an optimal level and significantly outperforms the other three benchmarks.},

To address such difficulty, intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRSs) can be employed to construct reconfigurable BS-IRS-user links, thereby enhancing spectral and power efficiency. In this paper, we design a quality-driven video broadcasting framework assisted by the IRS. The problem is formulated as the maximization of the minimum peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) for all users via a joint optimization of active and passive beamforming. To address the formulated non-convex problem, we introduce an effective algorithm that leverages penalty-based successive convex approximation (P-SCA) to achieve a suboptimal solution.

We aim at optimizing the ES beamforming and the RIS beamforming to minimize the transmit power of the ES under individual energy harvesting constraints for ERs. To handle the beamforming optimization problem, we develop an algorithm where an alternating direction method of multipliers based scheme is put forward for the RIS beamforming optimization. Compared with the counterpart which relies on semidefinite relaxation to optimize the RIS beamforming, the complexity of the proposed beamforming optimization algorithm is significantly reduced. Simulation results illustrate that the proposed algorithm performs close to the counterpart, which implies that the complexity reduction is achieved at very limited expense of performance.},

  abstract     = {The application of deep learning (DL) has improved the reliability and intelligence of automatic modulation recognition (AMR). However, real-world scenarios often involve a limited number of signal samples. Furthermore, most existing DL-based AMR models improve performance at the cost of computational complexity. Therefore, we propose an efficient contrastive multi-stage sparse attention network (CMSSAN) model for few-shot AMR without auxiliary datasets. Specifically, supervised contrastive learning is utilized to enhance the feature representation of the signal, and a joint loss with dynamic weights is constructed to balance the representation and classification tasks. In addition, a lightweight MSSAN encoder is proposed to enhance the recognition performance with lower computations and parameters. Simulation experiments are conducted on the ablation experiment and hyperparameter analysis of the proposed model, and the superiority of the model is verified on several datasets.},

The domain knowledge in satellite communications is exploited to design the structure and hyper-parameters of the GNN. To improve the generalization ability of the GNN in scenarios with different traffic distributions, we train the GNN in an unsupervised manner by using meta-learning. The idea is to train the GNN with different traffic distributions and then test it in unseen scenarios. Our simulation results show that the data rate achieved by the GNN-based power allocation policy is 30% higher than existing power allocation policies and is close to the upper bound.

In this correspondence, we propose a novel phase hopping scheme for IRS-aided multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communication systems, which dispenses with the channel state information (CSI) by randomly changing the IRS's reflections over different time slots within the channel coherence time, thereby creating artificial time diversity to enhance the communication performance.

Then, we derive its ergodic capacity and outage probability in closed-form using random matrix theory and gain essential insights into its asymptotic behaviors.

A finer grid interval is needed to distinguish these responses, but this could result in a significantly higher CE complexity when traditional methods are used.

To analyze the performance of this scheme, we first characterize the statistical properties of the users' cascaded channels.

Then the optimal solution to the original problem (OP) corresponds to that of the subproblem with the lower EP at the worst IN. After replacing integer variables with continuous ones, the convexities of the two subproblems are demonstrated. Consequently, the solution to the OP can be achieved by addressing the two subproblems via convex tools and utilizing an integer conversion method.

In each transmission, BS transmits the information to R, while one selected tag also conveys its own information to R by modulating and backscattering the BS's signals simultaneously. The communications from BS to R and tags to R are called as the cellular and backscatter communication (BackCom) transmissions, respectively. To describe the randomness of the position and number of the tags, the homogeneous Poisson point process is used. Besides, the consumed power by tags is considered and the optimal dynamic reflection coefficient is adopted. To achieve the tag access, the random selection access (RSA) scheme and selection diversity access (SDA) scheme are proposed and the corresponding outage performances are analyzed for both the cellular and BackCom transmissions. Numerical results show that the SDA scheme has a significantly superior outage performance compared to the RSA one at the cost of a higher system overhead. If neglecting the randomness of the number and position of tags, the obtained results will obviously deviate the practical performance. Moreover, the performance of the fixed RC scheme is much lower than that of the optimal dynamic RC.},

  abstract     = {In realistic cellular communication systems, multiple service providers will operate within different frequency ranges. Each serving cell, which is managed by a distinct service provider, is designed individually due to the orthogonal frequencies. However, when a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) is deployed for a certain cell, the RIS still incurs reflective channels for the overall system since the RIS reflects signals across all frequency ranges. This may cause severe undesired performance degradation for the other cells unless the reflection coefficients are properly designed. To tackle this issue, by utilizing the Riemannian manifold optimization method, an RIS reflection coefficients design is proposed in this paper to maximize the performance improvements of the cell that deploys the RIS while minimizing the undesired performance degradation for the other cells simultaneously. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed design can effectively balance the two objectives for practical scenarios.},

To provide low-latency communication services for multiple communication users while sensing an unmanned aerial vehicle simultaneously, a non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) empowered integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system is developed in this paper. To support the NOMA-empowered ISAC system efficiently, a beamforming-based cross-layer scheduling scheme is designed, which exploits the traffic dynamics information at the network layer and channel state information at the physical layer. Under the cross-layer scheduling scheme, an efficient joint beamforming, power allocation, and rate adaptation strategy is obtained via a developed Newton's method-based algorithm and the linear programming formulation. With the aid of the proposed strategy, the average delay in the communication task can be minimized while assuring sensing capability. Besides, an optimal tradeoff between the average delay and the average transmission power in the NOMA-empowered ISAC system is uncovered, which is further demonstrated by extensive numerical results.},

Except for the large-scale fading, the small-scale fading, allocated power from APs and inter-user interference are considered as important criteria for AP selection in this paper. Rather than the conventional FL method with predetermined fuzzy membership function, in the proposed adaptive FL scheme, the thresholds are adjusted adaptively according to the change of criteria's numerical ranges, which is more robust to the changing network environment. The proposed method considers the time-variation of the channel in each coherence block and remains system scalability in signal processing for data transmission and power control. This method also focuses on the AP clusters association by choosing the power and inter-user interference as criteria in FL, to avoid redundant connection and reduce interference between UEs. To achieve scalability in channel estimation, an initial association algorithm with switching scheme is proposed, making an attractive balance between UE fairness and limited AP processing capabilities. Simulation verifies that the adaptive FL based AP selection scheme outperforms other existing algorithms in terms of UE fairness, spectral efficiency and energy efficiency.},

  abstract     = {Extremely large-scale multiple-input multiple-output (XL-MIMO) is a fundamental technology for 6G. The surge in the number of base station (BS) antennas has introduced new characteristics such as spatial non-stationarity in the wireless channel, which means users at different locations probably ‘see’ different parts of the BS antenna array, namely their visible regions (VRs). The concept of VR has been widely employed to simplify the design of XL-MIMO transmission. However, the VR information has yet to be utilized in the design of non-orthogonal pilots. Therefore, we aim to leverage the VR information to reduce the pilot overhead. To this end, we first establish the relationship between the VRs of users and the spatial correlation of the corresponding channel. Subsequently, we formulate the non-orthogonal pilot scheduling problem for XL-MIMO systems with spatial non-stationarity. Assuming knowledge of all users' VRs, we propose a graph-based non-orthogonal pilot design approach called the two-stage graph partitioning (TSGP), which jointly exploits the VR and angle domain information. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed TSGP algorithm can effectively reduce the pilot overhead without compromising sum rate performance compared to the conventional orthogonal training approach.},

As a result, effective task allocation for MDC is becoming increasingly critical. In this work, integrating the concept of spatial crowdsourcing (SC), we develop an SC-based MDC network model and investigate the task allocation problem for UAV-assisted MDC. In variable maritime service scenarios, tasks are allocated to UAVs based on the spatial and temporal requirements of the tasks, as well as the mobility of the UAVs. To address this problem, we design an SC-based task allocation algorithm for the MDC (SC-MDC-TA). The quality estimation is utilized to assess and regulate task execution quality by evaluating signal to interference plus noise ratio and the UAV energy consumption. The reverse auction is employed to potentially reduce the task waiting time as much as possible while ensuring timely completion. Additionally, we establish typical task allocation scenarios based on maritime service requirements indicated by electronic navigational charts. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed SC-MDC-TA algorithm effectively allocates tasks for various MDC scenarios. Furthermore, compared to the benchmark, the SC-MDC-TA algorithm can also reduce the task completion time and lower the UAV energy consumption.},

  abstract     = {Satellite edge computing (SEC) has emerged as an innovative paradigm for future satellite-terrestrial integrated networks (STINs), expanding computation services by sinking computing capabilities into Low-Earth-Orbit (LEO) satellites. However, the mobility of LEO satellites poses two key challenges to SEC: 1) constrained onboard computing and transmission capabilities caused by limited and dynamic energy supply, and 2) stochastic task arrivals within the satellites' coverage and time-varying channel conditions. To tackle these issues, it is imperative to design an optimal SEC offloading strategy that effectively exploits the available energy of LEO satellites to fulfill competing task demands for SEC. In this paper, we propose a dynamic offloading strategy (DOS) with the aim to minimize the overall completion time of arriving tasks in an SEC-assisted STIN, subject to the long-term energy constraints of the LEO satellite. Leveraging Lyapunov optimization theory, we first convert the original long-term stochastic problem into multiple deterministic one-slot problems parameterized by current system states. Then we use sub-problem decomposition to jointly optimize the task offloading, computing, and communication resource allocation strategies. We theoretically prove that DOS achieves near-optimal performance. Numerical results demonstrate that DOS significantly outperforms the other four baseline approaches in terms of task completion time and dropping rate.},

  abstract     = {Due to the limited battery capacity and computational power of Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices, emerging IoT applications depend on mobile edge computing (MEC) networks for computational offloading and wireless power transfer (WPT) to sustain energy levels, with transfer performance influenced by the propagation environment and transmission strategies. Compared to the traditional reflecting-only reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS), simultaneously transmitting and reflecting (STAR)-RIS extends coverage from half-space to full-space, significantly enhancing transferring efficiency. This paper compares the performance of three different uplink transmission schemes on a STAR-RIS WPT MEC network. On this basis, for each scenario, a non-convex optimization problem is formulated to maximize the total computational bits for the system, where energy transfer, local processing, uplink transmission allocated resources, and phase shift vectors of STAR-RIS are jointly optimized. To address the non-convexity, each scenario is decoupled into two main subproblems: phase shift vectors of STAR-RIS optimization and joint power, time, and computing frequency optimization. While a closed-form expression is derived to optimize the phase shift vector of STAR-RIS in time division multiple access (TDMA), semi-definite relaxation is employed to optimize the phase shift vectors under Hybrid TDMA-non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) and NOMA. Furthermore, block coordinate descent is employed to address the remaining resources. Simulation results indicate the superiority of the proposed scheme for all scenarios in terms of total computational bits compared to benchmark schemes. Moreover, among the three uplink transmission schemes, TDMA performs the best in total computational bits and user fairness owing to its ability to flexibly adapt STAR-RIS phase shift vectors.},

To enhance flexibility, we introduce a smart dynamic task partitioning and cooperative offloading/delivery mechanism, enabling users to offload task partitions to various MEC servers. Uncertainties stemming from users' high mobility and traffic variations may lead to unpredictable task offloading demands and Imperfect Channel State Information (I-CSI), potentially causing unsuccessful task offloading/delivery. In response, we propose a robust and cooperative two-time-scale task offloading/delivery approach, adept at handling demand uncertainty and I-CSI. The problem formulation involves a two-time scale Markov decision process, aimed at minimizing task offloading/delivery costs while maximizing task completion rates. Large time-scale slots incorporate intelligent RSU activation/deactivation, while short time-scale slots focus on task offloading/delivery. To efficiently implement this framework, we propose Federated Reinforcement Learning (FRL) algorithm based on Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG); namely Low overhead Multi-Agent DDPG (LoMADDPG) where at each slot, all agents tune their Actor and Critic neural network weights with the help of Global Software-defined Networking (SDN) Controller (GSC) which acts as a global weight tuner.

  abstract     = {Assisted and autonomous driving are rapidly gaining momentum and will soon become a reality. Artificial intelligence and machine learning are regarded as key enablers thanks to the massive amount of data that smart vehicles will collect from onboard sensors. Federated learning is one of the most promising techniques for training global machine learning models while preserving data privacy of vehicles and optimizing communications resource usage. In this article, we propose vehicular radio environment map federated learning (VREM-FL), a computation-scheduling co-design for vehicular federated learning that combines mobility of vehicles with 5G radio environment maps. VREM-FL jointly optimizes learning performance of the global model and wisely allocates communication and computation resources. This is achieved by orchestrating local computations at the vehicles in conjunction with transmission of their local models in an adaptive and predictive fashion, by exploiting radio channel maps. The proposed algorithm can be tuned to trade training time for radio resource usage. Experimental results demonstrate that VREM-FL outperforms literature benchmarks for both a linear regression model (learning time reduced by 28%) and a deep neural network for semantic image segmentation (doubling the number of model updates within the same time window).},

The requirement for compute-intensive and delay-sensitive services is increasing rapidly. As a new network paradigm, Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC) can offer an environment for information technology service and extend cloud computing capability to the edge of mobile communication network. So communication data can be timely processed near the source to effectively solve the limitation of on-board resources. In this paper, we consider the heterogeneous characteristics of services and different requirements of tasks in urban rail transit system, and a MEC system architecture based on task classification is designed. To effectively utilize communication and computing resources, a resource allocation strategy based on Task Classification Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic policy gradient (TC-TD3) algorithm is proposed, which includes communication and computing resources allocation. In addition, to address the offloading selection issue of multi-MEC servers, a task offloading algorithm based on balancing tasks priority of MEC is designed. In the system model, considering the random arrival time of tasks and the dynamic resource allocation at each time slot, we propose a dynamic task execution model which is more suitable for the urban rail transit system. The findings of the simulation demonstrate that the proposed scheme can significantly improve the task completion rate and reduce the task processing delay of different tasks.},

  abstract     = {Long-range (LoRa) communication technology, distinguished by its low power consumption and long communication range, is widely used in the Internet of Things. However, the LoRa MAC layer adopts pure ALOHA for medium access control, which may lead to severe packet collisions as the network scale expands, consequently reducing the system energy efficiency (EE). To address this issue, it is critical to carefully allocate transmission parameters such as the channel (CH), transmission power (TP) and spreading factor (SF) to each end device (ED). Owing to the low duty cycle and sporadic traffic of LoRa networks, evaluating the system EE under various parameter settings proves to be time-consuming. Therefore, we propose an analytical model to calculate the system EE while fully considering the impacts of multiple gateways, duty cycling, quasi-orthogonal SFs and capture effects. On this basis, we investigate a joint CH, SF and TP allocation problem with the objective of optimizing the system EE for uplink transmissions. Due to the NP-hard complexity of this optimization problem, it is decomposed into two subproblems: CH assignment and SF/TP assignment. First, a matching-based algorithm is introduced to address the CH assignment subproblem. Then, an attention-based multiagent reinforcement learning technique is employed to address the SF/TP assignment subproblem for EDs allocated to the same CH, which reduces the number of learning agents to achieve fast convergence. The simulation outcomes indicate that the proposed approach converges quickly under various parameter settings and obtains significantly better system EE than the baseline algorithms.},

  abstract     = {LightFidelity (LiFi) is one of the most promising techniques to meet such high demand for indoor users by utilizing the visible light spectrum. A major challenge of LiFi is that its coverage is relatively limited, as the surrounding walls, objects, and other surfaces mostly absorb visible light. Thus, a number of studies have proposed aggregating the bandwidth of WiFi and LiFi to serve all users within a room. However, complementing LiFi with WiFi via bandwidth aggregation typically comes with an overhead in terms of both aggregation and computation, which reduces the data rates that can be used. Furthermore, data provided to users are often also limited by the backhaul capacity, which is typically wired Ethernet in indoor settings. In this work, we model the utilization of the functioning of WiFi and LiFi access points as a two-dimensional flow graph and show that the problem of maximizing the sum of data rate across all users is NP-Hard in practice. We then design an algorithm FLADA to solve this problem by solving its relaxed version where the variables are treated as real numbers, and then rounding to the nearest integer. We prove formally that it provides a solution that is at least $0.5\times$ the optimal. We further compare it with a greedy baseline approach through extensive simulations and show that it outperforms it by up to 81.6%.},

  abstract     = {Internet of Drones (IoD) has become crucial due to the surge of drone-based applications. In a dynamic wireless network, drones often share data with multiple users, which is vulnerable to various security threats, e.g., eavesdropping, privacy leakage, and impersonation. Ensuring secure sharing of drone operation data is a critical issue. Existing schemes employ blockchain to ensure accountability in untrusted IoD contexts. However, drones perform excessive operations, e.g., consensus and homomorphic encryption, leading to impractical drone computation overhead. Furthermore, these existing schemes perform point-to-multipoint (P2MP) data sharing by using identity-based broadcast encryption (IBBE) as it has stateless receiver property, i.e., drones can directly establish sharing groups based on the receiver identities. However, these IBBE-based schemes need to preset the sharing group capacity, reducing sharing efficiency and flexibility in dynamic IoD networks. Also, identities in sharing groups probably result in receiver privacy breaches. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-assisted data-sharing scheme with accountability and privacy-preserving for IoD networks. We utilize on-chain immutable smart contracts and short signatures to construct a lightweight accountability mechanism that can verify and punish the above misbehavior. We develop an efficient privacy-preserving IBBE algorithm for P2MP sharing of drone operation data that enables dynamic group sharing. We prove that our algorithm is secure and receiver anonymity against chosen ciphertext attacks. The experiment results show that our scheme outperforms existing schemes in computational and communication overhead. In real-world logistics scenarios, the wireless data rate of 50Mbps can satisfy the communication requirements for ciphertext lengths up to 19.5KB. For a sharing group of 60 receivers, drone encryption costs only about 101 ms. The decryption cost remains constant and takes about 3.1 ms.},

With the rapid growth of the number of EVs, cross-domain charging will become a strong demand. Despite massive research on EV charging, existing schemes can hardly meet the security requirements of privacy protection and access control for cross-domain scenarios. Meanwhile, centralized methods bring the single point of failure and data modification. The problem of designing a secure cross-domain EV charging scheme to simultaneously ensure decentralization, privacy and access control has not been studied and remains open. Therefore, in this paper, we design BlockPPA, the first blockchain-assisted privacy-preserving authentication scheme for cross-domain EV charging in order to achieve this purpose. Our scheme makes each EV obtain an attribute-based secret key, which is used to authenticate itself and also anonymously illustrate that it really satisfies a designated access policy when cross-domain authentication happens. Only authorized EVs satisfying the policy do they have the ability to charge. We design three smart contracts and exploit Fabric blockchain to record the domain's detailed information and the authentication record of each cross-domain access from an EV, while achieving the decentralized verification of an authentication request. The results of security and performance analysis show the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed cross-domain authentication mechanism.},

Failures rapidly propagate from congested and overloaded satellites to normal satellites, causing the network to be trapped in a vicious cycle of periodic failures, unable to return to a stable state capable of providing regular services. Existing routing schemes focus on optimizing network performance under normal conditions, paying little attention to fault tolerance mechanisms after satellite failures, or the mechanisms are too simplistic to handle large-scale cascading scenarios of satellite failures, ultimately leading to rapid failure propagation or even complete network paralysis. To address these issues, this paper proposes a distributed anti-cascading routing scheme based on fuzzy logic, aimed at promptly initiating takeover routing after the network triggers cascading failures, preventing further failure propagation, and restoring the network to stable operation. A strategy for collecting and sharing information of two-hop neighboring satellites is introduced, and a routing decision method based on fuzzy logic is constructed, five main update steps for the membership functions based on a detailed analysis of cascading scenarios. Satellites can make routing decisions to reduce the risk of cascading based on two-hop neighbor information. Compared with six routing schemes under a case constellation, simulation results show that the proposed scheme can ensure stable recovery within 35% satellite failure. The results offering valuable suggestions for network managers.},

  abstract     = {In unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) enabled mobile edge computing (MEC) system, rotary-wing UAV can be dispatched to fly close to ground terminals (GTs) to execute their offloaded tasks. This can extend GTs' computing capability and save their energy cost. However, to enhance the energy efficiency of UAV propulsion, ensure successful completion of each GT's mission, and maintain a stable UAV-GT uplinks, it is crucial to design a rational UAV 3D trajectory and mission offloading strategy. To address this joint problem, We further build a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based framework in the UAV-enabled MEC system, which applies Double Deep Q-learning (D-DQN) and convex optimization techniques to jointly work out the near-optimal UAV 3D-trajectory and task offloading strategy among GTs in an online manner. With the proposed framework, the UAV-enabled MEC system can finish each GT task quickly and save the UAV mission time and propulsion energy effectively. Numerical results show that the DLR-based framework outperforms the benchmark solutions, e.g., In scenario 1, the throughput, the average data transferring rate through UAV-GT links, and the average energy efficiency of UAV compared to DQN are improved from 64.24Kb to 72.99Kb, 4.72Kbps to 20.75Kbps, 0.32bits/J to 0.36bits/J, respectively, and almost the same as the existing Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) solution, making the energy efficient edge computing truly viable in UAV-enabled MEC system.},

Although previous research has made many efforts in this area, they have struggled to serve the scenario containing multiple heterogeneous task requests. This challenge is further exacerbated when the number of terminal devices increases and multiple edge servers are required to collaborate to handle task requests. To this end, this paper proposes a fine-grained Collaborative DNN Model Selection scheme for heterogeneous edge computing systems (CoMS), aiming to promote cooperation between edge servers and achieve more effective model selection. Specifically, we first design a reinforcement learning scheme with real-time dynamic normalization strategy, aiming to accelerate model convergence and improve the efficiency of model selection. Next, we introduce a model selection strategy based on greedy algorithm and an efficient fine-grained collaborative model selection strategy respectively to promote cooperation between edge servers, thereby further achieving a balance between inference accuracy and overhead. Extensive experimental results show that compared with baselines, our CoMS reduces the average trade-off overhead by 4.2% to 12.8% and improves the success ratio by 3% to 16%.},

To further enhance the detection accuracy, we propose an augmentation framework that integrates both theoretical analysis and channel fading models, and adopts an LSTM-based deep learning method. As for authentication of authorized CTC, we introduce a dynamic method that flips the error-prone chips. This enables authentication without introducing additional chip errors, further ensuring the transparency of existing CTC.

  abstract     = {Radio tomographic Imaging (RTI) provides high-precision localization of targets in a monitoring area by exploiting the relationship between target location and radio link attenuation. Most recent RTI approaches leverage pre-processing and data-driven strategies to improve the accuracy of moving targets. However, these approaches suffer from limitations such as training time and low frame rate, which constrain RTI to quickly and accurately localize the moving target. To address these limitations, we develop a coarse-to-fine RTI (CF-RTI) system that achieves a maximum frame rate of 29 frames per second (fps), surpassing the minimum requirement of 16 fps for a typical RGB camera while maintaining remarkable accuracy and resolution. First, CF-RTI enables high frame rate imaging by constructing a visual fingerprint database that establishes connections between target locations and potentially affected links, thereby enabling multi-step acquisition, reconstruction, and estimation. Second, the multi-step processing exploits the knowledge gained from localization efforts during acquisition processing, enabling high-quality imaging by rapidly identifying and collecting measurements from the target's affected links. Finally, the experimental results show that our CF-RTI can achieve centimeter-level positioning accuracy and a maximum frame rate of 29 fps while using only 9% of the traditional RTI measurements. The maximum frame rate of our CF-RTI is comparable to that of standard RGB cameras. These results suggest that our CF-RTI has excellent potential for implementing RTI techniques in real-world scenarios.},

  abstract     = {Traditional spectrum sensing schemes devised under the presumption of circular signals may suffer from performance deterioration when non-circular (NC) signals are present. To circumvent this drawback, this paper devises a novel non-circular signal detection scheme within the framework of generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT) by employing the non-circular characteristic of primary signals. The proposed method is able to leverage the exhaustive second-order statistical information of NC signals by taking into account both the standard covariance and complementary covariance. Performance merits in terms of false alarm probability (FAP) and detection probability (DP) are analyzed in the exact and approximate manners. Specifically, the exact distribution of proposed statistic under null hypothesis is derived with the support of Mellin transform, leading to a closed-form expression for the probability of false alarm. The Wilks' theorem is then used to approximately compute the FAP in the large-sample regime. Moreover, a computationally efficient and high-precision approximation for the FAP is provided via the method of Beta-based moment matching. Detection probability (DP) is also obtained by employing the moment-matching method once more. Extensive numerical examples are included to corroborate our theoretical calculations and demonstrate the superiority of our proposed NC-ST method over other state-of-the-art detectors.},

The objective is to maximize the overall spectral efficiency of users located in severely blocked dead zones, where there is no direct link between the base station (BS) and the users and, the ARIS acts as a relay to facilitate communication. To achieve this, we formulate a sum-rate maximization problem considering the joint design of active beamforming at the BS, passive beamforming at the ARIS, and determination of the ARIS height. The constraints include given packet size and packet error probability (PEP) requirements. Since the original problem is non-convex, we propose an alternating optimization framework to solve it. The framework involves solving sub-problems of beamforming design and ARIS location alternately. The beamforming design sub-problem is addressed using successive convex approximation, while the ARIS location sub-problem is solved using a particle-swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. The proposed solution demonstrates fast convergence within a few iterations, as validated through numerical simulations. Additionally, a computational complexity analysis is performed. The results show that the proposed RSMA scheme for the ARIS-aided DL URLLC system surpasses conventional multiple access schemes in terms of rate performance. The findings highlight the potential of utilizing ARIS and RSMA to enhance the spectral efficiency and meet the requirements of URLLC applications.},

This study leverages the Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) architecture's flexibility and programmability to introduce a novel deep reinforcement learning (DRL) strategy for QoS-aware intra-slice resource allocation. By employing intelligent agents and a Deep Q-Network (DQN)-based framework, our approach precisely tailors resource distribution within O-RAN, optimizing for enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB) and ultra-reliable low-latency communications (URLLC) slices. The proposed method, featuring intelligent QoS-aware resource allocation (IQRA) and its low-complexity variant (LIQRA), demonstrates significant throughput improvements for eMBB by 11.5% compared to state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods and reduces URLLC latency by 19.94% and 16.54%, achieving up to 45.5% lower latency than baseline. A streamlined algorithm effectively reduces computational complexity, ensuring robust performance under resource constraints. Simulation results underscore the algorithm's ability to substantially enhance 5G network slice performance, offering a parameterized solution for user association in O-RAN networks using DRL.

To this end, we consider a new framework for an energy-efficient design of AAV-aided short-packet transmission systems against cooperative hostile detection and eavesdropping attacks. Specifically, the false rate of the cooperative hostile detection is first derived by utilizing the likelihood ratio test and the bivariate Gaussian distribution property. Then, we formulate a problem to maximize the minimum covert secrecy energy efficiency (MCSEE) by jointly optimizing the user association, AAV power control, and AAV three-dimensional (3D) trajectory design. We propose a penalty-based dual-loop iterative optimization algorithm to tackle this complex problem suboptimally with the aid of auxiliary penalty variables, where the communication resource scheduling, the AAV trajectory planning, and the auxiliary penalty variables are optimized in the inner loop. In particular, the intractable joint AAV power control and 3D trajectory design sub-problem is suboptimally addressed by introducing slack variables and employing successive convex approximation (SCA) techniques. The penalty factor is updated in the outer loop. Finally, numerical results are provided to verify the effectiveness and superiority of our proposed solution to several benchmarks.},

However, a significant challenge arises in the transmission scheduling due to the rapid changes in channel state, link selection for train mobile relays (MRs), and order of the flow scheduling. To tackle this challenge, we introduce an optimization problem focused on maximizing the weighted sum completed flows that satisfy the quality of service (QoS) requirements for HSR mmWave communication in SAGIN. To facilitate the simultaneous scheduling of flows by base station-MR (BS-MR), satellite-airship-MR, and satellite-MR links, we propose a link selection algorithm, which can help each flow choose a suitable set of links in every frame and determine whether the BS networks need the assistance of the satellite and airship. Furthermore, taking into account the priority and occupied time slots (TSs) resource of different flows, we propose a multi-link weighted flow scheduling (MWFS) algorithm. This algorithm not only prioritizes scheduling high-priority flows but also aims to maximize the weighted sum completed flows for MRs. Our simulation results confirm that the proposed algorithm significantly increases the weighted sum completed flows and the total transmitted bits. Additionally, the proposed algorithm can achieve the optimal flow transmission in different link switching periods and enhance the scheduling of high-priority flows compared to other algorithms.},

In this paper, probability theory is adopted to deduce the connectivity probabilities of CVNs by analyzing the cognitive and communication characteristics of CVs, so as to unveil the correlations between network connectivity and the channel environment together with road traffic factors. In particular, to demonstrate the impact of cognitive and vehicular capacity on connectivity performance, two traffic scenarios with different vehicular transmission coverages and relay behaviors are discussed. Simulation results present the variation of connectivity probabilities with different signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs), coverage ranges of both RSUs and CVs, and the densities of CVs.

  abstract     = {In this paper, we propose a non-uniform pilot pattern based on the cyclic difference set (CDS) for sparse channel estimation in multiple-input-multiple-output orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (MIMO-OFDM) systems. The CDS-based pilot patterns can effectively enhance the performance of sparse channel estimation by applying compressed sensing (CS) techniques. However, the existing CDS pilot patterns are limited to single-input-single-output orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (SISO-OFDM) systems. In MIMO-OFDM systems, as the required number of CDS increases, there will be a growing number of intersecting (overlapping) elements among different CDSs (antennas), thus introducing significant interference among different antennas. To tackle this problem, a special CDS property called identical multi-set intersection (IMI) property is disclosed which can significantly reduce the inter-antenna interference. In addition, two constructions of desired CDS collection $\bf D_{I}$ having such IMI property are presented. To further eliminate the residual interference due to the remaining intersecting elements, i.e. the exact $\lambda$ overlapping positions among all antennas, two pilot placement algorithms, i.e., zero setting (ZS) and partial orthogonal cover coding (POCC), are proposed to achieve orthogonal pilot patterns in frequency. Our simulation results show that our proposed MIMO non-uniform IMI CDS pilot patterns exhibit superior estimation accuracy, closely approaching that of SISO systems. Furthermore, our MSE simulation results also show that, under the same condition, the proposed IMI CDS pilot scheme significantly outperforms the 3GPP 5G NR MIMO-OFDM pilot schemes, offering better estimation performance while maintaining much lower generating complexity compared with other existing multi-antenna pilot schemes.},

  abstract     = {Integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) technology is identified as a breakthrough in optimizing resource allocation and pursuing mutual benefits between radar sensing and wireless communications. In the complex Internet of Vehicles, however, the rapid increase in vehicles leads to a severe scarcity of spectrum resources that is fundamental for wireless communications. To fully exploit ISAC technology potential under strict resource constraints, this paper develops a joint channel, power, and bandwidth allocation scheme based on deep reinforcement learning to improve resource allocation efficiency. Firstly, a deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm is designed to ensure communication reliability by dynamically allocating wireless channels and transmitting power to vehicles based on their geographic positions. Then, we exploit a deep Q-network algorithm to maximize the communication rates by flexibly allocating frequency bandwidth. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm exhibits higher spectral efficiency and communication rates than benchmark schemes.},

An alternate joint optimization algorithm that decouples the aforementioned optimization problem to inner and outer layer optimization is proposed. The inner layer alternately optimizes the user association, power consumption and node position of UAVs, while the outer layer optimizes the number of UAVs. Numerical results show that: cooperative UAV communications with multi-beam association and the proposed joint optimization algorithm can flexibly adapt to the demand distribution of complex traffic tasks, reduce total power consumption and achieve load balance among UAVs.

Two problems, i.e. maximization of minimum user throughput and maximization of sum throughput, are investigated under transmit power, UAV mobility, and SAR-based sensing constraints. We propose two joint user scheduling, power allocation and trajectory design (JUPT) algorithms for solving the non-convex problems via alternating optimization.

However, the major drawback is the significant expense required to deploy and maintain numerous infrastructure sites and connect them to a central processing unit (CPU) for baseband processing. This paper proposes utilizing CF-M-MIMO processing atop existing micro/macrocellular deployments in current 5G networks. It suggests connecting all base stations (BSs) to a CPU via fronthaul links to enable joint processing of user equipment (UE) without the costly deployment of many scattered access points (APs). By jointly managing all transmit/receive points (TRPs) in the network, a novel switch on/off strategy is derived to maximize energy efficiency by exploiting the sleep mode capabilities of current baseband/RF hardware, adapting to changes in UE behavior and operator requirements. Additionally, the paper considers multiantenna user terminals, common in current 5G setups, and proposes a technique to manage the number of streams directed to each UE, balancing multiplexing gains and increased pilot contamination.},

  abstract     = {Edge caching is an increasingly vital technique in wireless networks, particularly needed to address users' repeated demands, including real-time traffic data and map access in vehicular communications. This paper presents a three-tier system for edge caching, integrating massive multiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO) networks. We consider a scenario with an extensive file library whose size is larger than the aggregated caching capacity of the small base stations (SBSs). Each SBS proactively caches files based on dynamic file popularity that is unknown in advance. A distinguishing aspect of our model is its file-wise approach to the cache instead of the conventional vector-wise methods based on aggregate popularity. This approach introduces additional computational challenges concerning the extensive file library. We formulated the optimization problem to maximize the long-term discounted cache hit rate while minimizing the delivery delay. For the solution, two multi-agent federated $Q$-learning algorithms are proposed. The first algorithm employs selective updates of the $Q$-values of popular files to minimize computational overhead. The second algorithm incorporates linear function approximation (LFA) and tensor completion (TC) to streamline the updating process further, reducing the required parameter number. Through the real-world MovieLens dataset and compared with various baseline algorithms, simulations demonstrate that our proposed algorithm can reduce the delay by around 2.60--21.29%, improve the cache hit rate by around 5.71--66.42%, and reduce the computational complexity by at most 97.91%.},

Meanwhile, the reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) has emerged as an important enhancing technology for both communication and localization. In this paper, we investigate a RIS-aided joint L&C system, where the localization and data transmission functions are integrated in a time-division pattern. Specifically, we aim to jointly optimize the covariance matrices of the localization signal and the communication signal, the RIS beamforming matrix and the time division ratio to simultaneously improve the localization and communication performance. An alternating optimization (AO) algorithm is proposed via jointly leveraging the successive convex approximation technique, the semidefinite relaxation method and the projected gradient descent with momentum algorithm, based on which we strike a compelling trade-off between the localization and communication performance. Considering the high computational cost in the large-scale array scenario, we also develop a low-complexity algorithm free of iterations. To analyze the optimality of our proposed AO algorithm, we further consider the special single-user line-of-sight (LoS) scenario and validate that our AO algorithm could achieve the beam alignment, implying its effectiveness. Finally, numerical simulations are carried out to demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed algorithm.},

Specifically, by exploiting the correlation of angle information during multiple consecutive channel coherence blocks, we estimate the full channel state information in the first coherence block (FCB) and only update the gain information in each subsequent block. Then, based on the ambiguity property, a low-pilot-overhead two-stage method is adopted in the FCB. In Stage 1, all users jointly transmit pilot to estimate the angles of arrival at the BS and the correlation factors between different paths of the common BS-RIS channel via introducing a set of matching matrices and a designed RIS phase shift matrix, which achieves a significant MU diversity gain. By exploiting the mmWave cascaded channels' ambiguity property, an ambiguous common BS-RIS channel is constructed with the estimated correlation factors. In Stage 2, each user independently transmits a limited number of pilots to estimate their individual ambiguous RIS-user channel, leading to a comprehensive cascaded channel estimation. For the remaining blocks, we adopt a straightforward least-squares method for rapid gain estimation. Simulation results confirm the method's effectiveness in providing accurate estimation with reduced pilot overhead, outperforming existing methods.},

  abstract     = {Extremely large-scale multiple-input-multiple-output (XL-MIMO) techniques are capable of boosting the throughput of next 6G networks. However, due to the large number of antennas in the wideband XL-MIMO systems, they suffer from the so-called near-field beam split effect, where beams at different frequencies are focused on different locations. This effect imposes a severe performance loss on near-field channel estimation. To address this issue, in this paper, we investigate the wideband near-field channel covariance estimation problem of XL-MIMO systems. Explicitly, we first propose a sophisticated polar-domain dictionary for the wideband near-field channel at different frequencies. Specifically, the proposed polar-domain dictionary consists of several sub-matrices. For each sub-matrix, the angle is sampled from a unique range while the distance is sampled from the same range. Meanwhile, considering the beam split effect, we construct the corresponding dictionaries for different frequencies that can beneficially adjust the grid of the sampled angles and distances. Then we propose an algorithm termed as the correlation coefficient sparsity adaptive matching pursuit relying on parameter refinement (CCSAMP-PR) to reconstruct the near-field channel without any prior knowledge of the channel sparsity. More explicitly, an iterative parameter refinement step is conceived for gradually refining the angles and distances per iteration. Furthermore, the proposed algorithm is capable of adaptively adjusting its step size for ensuring rapid convergence. Finally, numerical results are provided for demonstrating that both our proposed polar-domain dictionary and CCSAMP-PR algorithm outperform the family of existing schemes.},

  abstract     = {Mixed-numerology transmission is a flexible physical layer waveform technology to support different service. The coexistence of different numerologies causes inter-numerology interference (INI) and deteriorates the system performance. In uplink transmission, the detection of mixed-numerology signal is based on Least common multiple (LCM) symbols to ensure the integrity of symbol sampling for each numerology. However, the LCM symbol-based detection increases the latency for delay sensitive services, which adopt numerologies with short symbols. In this paper, we propose an active INI cancellation (A-INIC) algorithm at the transmitter and a soft iterative INI cancellation (soft I-INIC) algorithm at receiver for uplink mixed-numerology transmission. Based on the proposed algorithms, we construct an A-INIC transceiver which can pre-cancel the INI with multi-path fading channel. In the transmitter, the A-INIC module actively compensate for the INI generated by the user itself to adjacent subbands as well as the corresponding secondary INI in target subband, which facilitate symbol-based detection at receiver for latency reduction. In the receiver, a soft I-INIC module is applied to cancel the residual INI when the feedback channel state information (CSI) for INI pre-compensation is imperfect. Simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithms in block error ratio (BLER) performance even without any guard subcarrier.},

However, due to the limited time duration and frequency bandwidth of the transmitted OTFS signal, the occurrence of fractional delay and Doppler shifts becomes inevitable, causing both inter-delay interference (IDeI) and inter-Doppler interference (IDI). In this paper, an impulse-based channel estimation method is used, which takes advantage of the fact that the pilot impulse is a pulse tone (pulsone). A pulsone maintains its shape despite time delay and Doppler shift operations, as well as being self-dual between time and frequency domains. Exploiting these two features, a low-complexity algorithm is proposed to estimate the fractional delay and fractional Doppler channel. We derive the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) of the estimated fractional channel and show that the developed estimator is efficient. Then, we provide the computational complexity analysis of the proposed algorithm. After that, we show and stress that the proposed channel estimation scheme is better in terms of the channel normalized mean squared error (NMSE) and the bit-error rate (BER).

  abstract     = {Cognitive electronic warfare (CEW) has received increasing attention, and it is widely recognized that it will play a significant role. Cognitive jamming decision-making, as one of the critical technologies of CEW, dramatically impacts the global battlefield situation. In this paper, we introduce the A2C algorithm into cognitive jamming decision-making and propose a heuristic improved A2C algorithm. As a fusion algorithm of DQN and Policy Gradient, on the one hand, the Actor-Critic algorithm has the advantages of iterative updating of policies and high efficiency in complex spaces, compared to the DQN algorithm. On the other hand, compared with the Policy Gradient algorithm, it features fast convergence. But, it suffers from high variance, making convergence difficult. First, we establish a cognitive jamming decision-making model to address the above issues. Then, we develop an improved A2C algorithm by introducing a baseline and dueling networks. The baseline reduces the variance of the critic network, while dueling networks further decrease variance, enhancing the convergence of the A2C algorithm. Additionally, the improved A2C algorithm does not rely on prior information, and enhances the adaptive capability of the jammer when interacting with the target radar. We conducted numerical simulations based on the designed cognitive jamming decision-making model. The results demonstrated that compared with the four algorithms (DQN, Policy Gradient, Actor-Critic, A2C), the convergence speed of the improved A2C algorithm is improved by 50$\%$, 57.8$\%$, 34.5$\%$, and 13.64$\%$, respectively, and verified the excellent performance of the improved A2C. Finally, we introduce the heuristic reward function and propose the heuristic improved A2C algorithm. Compared with the improved A2C algorithm, the convergence speed of this algorithm is improved by 31.58$\%$. The simulation results prove that the algorithm can greatly improve our advantage in electronic countermeasures.},

  abstract     = {With the development of computing and communication technology, the popularity of Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) has promoted the research of advertising among vehicles. The problem of vehicle advertising communication is similar to the problem of Influence Maximization (IM) considered in social networks as both prioritize a set of candidate nodes as the initial seed nodes for the initial information dissemination to maximize the influence of the information in the global network. As user nodes in vehicle networks, vehicles have high mobility, which leads to the highly complex and unstable topology of vehicle networks. Therefore, we propose a practical solution to solve the problem of advertising dissemination among Intelligent Networked Vehicles (INVs). In our strategy, advertisements are first sent to a group of selected seed INVs and then spread among INVs. To encourage INVs to disseminate advertising actively, we propose an incentive scheme that combines online and offline to maximize profit. We propose a dynamic seed INVs replacement algorithm using the Deep Q-Network (DQN) algorithm to decide the update cycle of the seed INVs set. Simulation results show that the proposed strategy is superior to the existing methods in terms of delivery ratio of advertisement dissemination and expected profit of merchant.},

  abstract     = {Hybrid beamforming (HBF) transceiver architectures based on frequency-independent phase shifters (PSs) are sensitive to phases and physical directions, resulting in limited capability to compensate for the detrimental effects of the beam squint. Motivated by the fact that switches are phase-independent and more power/cost efficient than PSs, we consider the switch-based HBF (SW-HBF) for wideband large-scale multiple-input multiple-output systems in this paper. We first derive a closed-form expression of the beam squint ratio unveiling that the severity of beam squint linearly increases with the number of antennas, the antenna spacing distance, and the fractional bandwidth. We then focus on the SW-HBF designs to maximize the spectral efficiency (SE) in both single-user (SU) and multiuser (MU) systems. The formulated problems in both cases exhibit intractable non-convex and mixed-integer challenges. To address them, for the SU case, by combining the tabu search (TS) method and projected gradient ascend (PGA), we propose an efficient heuristic PGA-TS algorithm to design analog beamformers while the digital ones admit closed-form solutions. For the MU case, we develop a two-step algorithm based on fractional programming and the PGA-TS method. Simulation results show that the proposed SW-HBF schemes are efficient and can outperform PS-based HBF architectures in terms of both SE and energy efficiency in wideband systems.},

Our approach involves a hierarchical placement scheme during the placement phase, which efficiently leverages the cache resources of both fog access points (F-APs) and users while adhering to secrecy constraints. In the delivery phase, we employ an access points cooperation based delivery scheme that maximizes the cooperative transmission capability among multiple F-APs. By integrating the placement and delivery schemes, we propose an access points cooperation based secretive coded caching scheme that minimize the sum rate. We further derive a closed-form expression for the worst-case sum rate and obtain an information theretic lower bound on the sum rate by using cut-set arguments. Our analysis reveals that the proposed scheme achieves the information theoretic lower bound within a factor that depends on the number of F-APs. Additionally, we analyze the decodability and secrecy aspects of the proposed coded caching scheme. Simulation results demonstrate that when the cache capacity of each F-AP is large, the performance of our proposed scheme approaches the theoretical optimum.},

To achieve these objectives, a low complexity and cost-efficient hybrid NOMA-OMA-based resource allocation mechanism is introduced which can enhance network connectivity without aggravating interference. The hybrid successive-interference-cancellation (SIC) decoding method is utilized to improve transmission robustness. Additionally, a novel hybrid SIC decoding approach is specifically designed when the transmitted signals experience the same fading effects over a common channel transmission mode, i.e. the link between the relay and the base station (BS). We show that the FD relay-assisted vehicular communication system suffers from an outage probability error floor. Hence a modified zero-forcing (ZF) criterion-based transmit beamformer is designed to enhance the transmission robustness and eliminate the residual self-interference (SI) caused by FD operation. Moreover, a truncated Gaussian distribution is considered to model vehicle mobility. In order to minimize the line-of-sight (LoS) link obstruction phenomenon, the optimal vehicle speed is derived. Further, the exact and asymptotic outage probability expressions are derived, based on which the analysis of diversity order is provided. To validate the accuracy of our analytical results, Monte-Carlo simulations are conducted. Our results reveal that the hybrid SIC-based decoding scheme for SGF NOMA transmission provides a superior outage performance compared to the conventional NOMA transmission with the conventional SIC-based decoding scheme. Additionally, combining the hybrid SIC decoding method with the relay beamforming approach can eliminate the outage probability error floor while guaranteeing the quality of service (QoS) for the primary vehicle in the uplink FD cooperative vehicular communication system.},

Specifically, we concentrate on the joint optimization of the uplink offloading, downlink beam management for multi-device transmissions, downlink power splitting within each beam for computing result receiving and energy harvesting, and time allocation between uplink and downlink. We formulate the joint optimization problem to maximize the minimum residual device energy. As the problem is a mixed-integer non-convex optimization program, we design a heuristic algorithm with low computing complexity, by relaxing the integer constraint and exploiting the successive convex approximation method.

Then, the convergence, stability boundary and the stability analysis of the mean squared-deviation have been analyzed and presented in detail.

Using the explicit interference signal model with the standard MIMO-FMCW object signal model, we turn the interference mitigation into a spatial-domain object detection under incoherent MIMO-FMCW interference. By exploiting the structural property of the derived interference model at both transmit and receive steering vector space, we derive a detector via beamforming optimization to achieve good detection performance and further propose an adaptive version of this detector to enhance its practical applicability.

  abstract     = {Supporting massive access from Internet of Things (IoT) devices plays a pivotal role in the design of 6G networks. Nonetheless, concurrent massive access to the network deteriorates the quality of 6G communications. To overcome the challenge of massive access, our focus shifts to optimizing the age-critical frameless ALOHA (ACFA) random access protocol. The conventional ACFA suffers from high latency and unreliability when massive devices attempt to access the network. Consequently, we introduce an adaptive algorithm to address the transmission issues. This paper optimizes the random access channel (RACH) procedure by maximizing a long-term multi-objective function, which consists of the average age of information (AoI), normalized throughput, traffic load and the average number of successfully accessed machine-type communication devices. To achieve the optimal objective in ACFA, we apply deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms. In our algorithms, agents take action in both distributed and centralized manners. In the distributed approach, each device learns the choice of the access probability and the slot, guided by feedback from the base station (BS). Simultaneously, in the centralized approach, the BS restricts a specific number of devices from accessing the network and dynamically adjusts the frame length based on the transmission results of devices. Our simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme surpasses benchmark schemes and exhibits significant potential to minimize AoI performance.},

In light of the high cost associated with a vehicle's lateral speed sensor, this study focuses on estimating the lateral velocity of autonomous vehicles using the vehicle's longitudinal speed and yaw rate. The main difficulty is that the state estimation is affected by sampled and delayed sensor data measurements as well as unknown modeling uncertainties. To overcome these challenges, this article proposes a novel sampled data neural network observer. The proposed observer consists of two components: a continuous state observer and a compensating injector. The compensating injector is devised to offset the information loss during sampling by digital sensors. Additionally, a radial basis function neural network is employed to approximate the unknown dynamics and modeling uncertainties in the vehicle systems. The weights of the neural network are updated using a newly designed weight update law. Furthermore, to tackle the challenge of both sampling and delay measurement, an additional integrator is incorporated in the designed compensating injector. This additional integrator aims to mitigate the impact of sensor data delays on the estimation process. Finally, the stability of the proposed method is demonstrated using the Lyapunov technique. The effectiveness of the proposed sampled data neural network observer is verified through simulation and experiment performed on a full driving automation vehicle experimental platform.},

  abstract     = {Fuel cell hybrid electric vehicles (FCEVs) are considered an appealing option for heavy-duty and long-distance vehicles. However, they require the use of multiple power converters to manage power distribution among the fuel cell, battery or ultracapacitor, and AC motor, leading to increased power losses and a more complex system. To overcome this challenge, multi-port power converters have been proposed to combine two power sources and the AC motor into one conversion stage, boosting overall efficiency and power density in hybrid powertrains. However, these converters still rely on a high number of semiconductors and involve complex control systems. This paper introduces a three-port converter (TPC) for FCHEVs, using only one power stage with 6 semiconductors, achieving high performance control of an ac motor, a fuel cell and a battery. A multivariable optimal control (Finite-Control-Set Model Predictive Current Control) manages the power flows between the energy sources and drives the motor simultaneously. Additionally, the performance of the multiport converter is improved by replacing its three inductors with a custom coupled inductor designed to reduce circulating AC currents. This innovation contributes to improved efficiency and overall functionality of the FCHEV system. The proposed system was validated through an 0.5kW experimental test bench and simulations of an urban driving cycle. The system controlled the multiple variables of the hybrid system with proper operation and fast dynamics, meanwhile the coupled inductor decreases the current magnitude in 20$\%$ compared to the non-coupled configuration.},

  abstract     = {This paper proposes a prescribed performance function (PPF)-based constrained fractional-order model predictive controller (CFMPC) for the robust path following of the four-wheel-independent-drive autonomous ground vehicle (FWID-AGV) subject to the model mismatch and external disturbances. First, a PPF-based model predictive controller (MPC) is developed to guarantee the transient-state performance by dealing with the model mismatch. Second, a contraction constraint of the MPC is constructed with an adaptive neural network backstepping method, aiming to ensure the optimal control inputs fall into the region of attraction. Third, a fractional-order cost function of the MPC is discretized to reject the external disturbances and improve the robustness of the controller. Besides, a sufficient condition is given to prove the recursive feasibility of the PPF-based CFMPC, and a Lyapunov function candidate is derived for the asymptotic stability of the closed-loop path following system. The effectiveness and practicability of the proposed method are validated by hardware-in-the-loop tests, respectively.},

First, a variable steering ratio is developed considering the influence of the front and rear wheels' angles on the vehicle's steering characteristic. Then a hybrid feedforward controller combining with steady-state control, dynamic compensation, and oblique steering compensation is established to enhance vehicle dynamics stability in extreme driving conditions, taking into account the reference yaw rate and road adhesion constraints. Meanwhile, an adaptive linear quadratic regulator-based feedback controller with a piece-wise affine tire model is put forward to account for the influence of vertical load, road adhesion condition, and yaw rate tracking error. The controller adopts an adaptive weighting coefficient mechanism to satisfy various working conditions based on different steady-state gains of the front and rear wheel angles over the yaw rate. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed scheme is experimentally verified under comprehensive testing scenarios through Hardware-in-the-Loop tests. The results show that the proposed scheme has superior performance relative to the state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract     = {The uncertain driving and road conditions complicate the design of Energy Management System (EMS) of Electric vehicles (EVs). To improve the performance of Battery/Supercapacitor (SC) based EV, an adaptive EMS based on Pontryagin's Minimum Principle (PMP) considering actual road slope and velocity prediction through Artificial Neural Network (ANN) based method is proposed. An adaptive EMS is designed by considering the solution obtained from PMP based EMS. The solution obtained by PMP is based on a constant costate variable which cannot be applied to uncertain driving conditions. To solve this problem, the costate variable is adjusted in real time using a novel adaptation law which considers the future power demand of the vehicle, actual road slope and battery conditions. The integration of ANN based velocity prediction model with EMS results in an enhanced technique that can adapt automatically to changing road and vehicle conditions and thus improves the efficiency of the EV. The entire system is tested on three actual road slope conditions and different driving cycles. A Rule Based Strategy (RBS) and PMP based technique without velocity prediction are also studied to compare and analyse the performance of the proposed Adaptive EMS based on PMP (APMP). Simulation results show that the proposed Adaptive EMS based on PMP increases the participation of SC in the EMS and thereby improves battery health.},

  abstract     = {The field of intelligent connectivity in modern vehicles continues to expand, with vehicle functions becoming increasingly complex over time. This expansion has led to numerous vehicle safety issues, which can easily result in safety failures, leading to injuries and deaths. Therefore, it is particularly important to identify high-risk intelligent connected systems in vehicles, as it can inform safety personnel which systems are most susceptible to safety failures, enabling them to conduct more thorough inspections and tests. In this paper, we develop a new model for vehicle intelligent connected system risk assessment by combining Interval Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (I-FAHP) with Fuzzy Cluster Analysis (FCA), called VSRQ model. We extract crucial indicators related to vehicle safety, utilizing FCA in conjunction with the I-FAHP to identify vulnerable components in the vehicle intelligent connected system. Priority testing is then conducted on these components to mitigate risks and ensure vehicle safety. We evaluate the model on OpenPilot and provide experimental evidence of the VSRQ model's effectiveness in assessing the safety of vehicle intelligent connected systems. Our experiments fully adhere to the ISO 26262 standard, and our model exhibits a higher accuracy rate compared to other models. These results provide a promising new research direction for predicting the safety risks of vehicle intelligent connected systems and provide typical application tasks for VSRQ. The experimental results show that the accuracy rate is 94.36%, and the recall rate is 73.43%, which is at least 14.63% higher than all other known methods.},

To study the performance of the SEP braking system with the controller, the simulation model of the SEP braking system with a high fidelity to the static standard bench of 150-marshalling freight train is established based on the principle of Model-120 distribution valve, and extensive simulations for the SEP braking performance with the controller are carried out. The controller can realize an online adaptive tuning for the PID parameters by applying the GA to optimize the scaling factors and control rules of variable universe fuzzy inference, resulting in a great enhancement of control performance. The simulation and experiment results show that, compared with traditional pneumatic braking and SEP braking with FVUF-PID controller optimized by Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), the time difference of starting rise of the braking cylinder between the first and last car of a 150-marshalling freight train can be reduced by 78% and 15.3%, respectively. Also, the braking time and distance of the SEP braking system with the proposed controller are shorter by 20.9% and 23.03%, and 3.13% and 5.63%, respectively, compared with those of the traditional pneumatic braking system and SEP braking with FVUF-PID controller optimized by PSO at a pressure reduction of 140kPa. Furthermore, the maximum compressional forces of the coupler during traditional pneumatic braking are reduced by $18.11-62.83\%$ under different decompression pressures, demonstrating a significant improvement on the SEP braking performance by using the controller.},

  abstract     = {In the 2000s, the liberalization of the rail markets for freight and passenger travel opened up the competition. Nowadays, local, regional, and long-distance passenger rail are gradually following suit. As a consequence of the paradigm of realizing smart and sustainable cities, the operators of local railway infrastructures (i.e., metro, light railway, and commuter) are studying strategies to improve the energy efficiency of the overall system. The operators are thus involved in renewing technological infrastructures and examining new operation models for coordinating the motion of the trains fleet. With this regard, the present work proposes a timetable adjustment approach to reduce energy consumption in metro rail transit systems. In addition, a centralized control strategy to manage the output voltage of Traction Power Substations (TPSs), train regenerative power, and charge/discharge power profiles of off-board Energy Storage Systems (ESSs) is proposed. The approach is based on a two-step procedure aimed at optimally allocating the layover time among the train stops. This approach is formulated as an optimization problem, which consider the adopted control strategy, because of the correlation between control actions and timetable. Numerical examples have been carried out based on the real data from metro line 1 of Naples, (Italy). The results highlight the capability of the strategy to achieve relevant results in terms of energy saving. In addition, the advantages introduced by the proposed centralized control strategy are emphasized through a comparison with the conventional local control strategy.},

In this regard, the thermal management system (TMS) study is being broadened as it is in charge of battery packs' good performance and durability. New systems or adaptions of already employed ones are being studied to improve electric vehicle outcomes. In this context, the system presented in this work is a hybrid system between the current cold plates and the lately studied phase change materials (PCMs), which is incorporated into a real case electrification of a commercial vehicle. As a result, integrating the PCM buffer into the battery pack's base structure aims to improve mechanical strength while also improving thermal management. The operation analysis results under 6 C fast charge and motorway speed discharge showed the capability of the proposed TMS. The increase in the system's thermal capacitance by 31.9% when combining the use of cold plate with PCM enabled distributing the heat dissipation along the charge and discharge, despite the weight being increased by 10.14%. Hence, the auxiliary cooling system's peak power was reduced, allowing for size reduction and an energy consumption reduction of 21%. Moreover, the PCM delimits the maximum temperature reached by the system with a reduction at the end of fast charge of more than 10%, serving as a security element with the cold plate switched off. Therefore, the proposed system's weight demerits could be overcome with temperature and auxiliary consumption reductions, proving an effective system for a high-performance vehicle.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, the development of electric vehicle (EV) infrastructure and efforts to achieve more sustainable transportation systems have increased. The enhanced utilization of EVs will require fast charging systems, which will overload utility power grids and require high-cost additional installations and equipment. However, a significant amount of regenerative braking energy (RBE) is available in electric railway systems (ERSs), which needs to be properly stored and accommodated. The integration of ERSs and EV charging stations (EVCS) at strategic points, such as parking areas close to ERS stations or rail freight intermodal terminals where EVs are parked most hours of the day, can be a promising solution to save RBE in the dedicated internal EV batteries. In this article, a new method is proposed to charge EVs by transferring RBE from ERSs to EVCSs, taking advantage of a combined power management scheme based on stationary hybrid energy storage systems (HESSs) integrated with railway power flow controllers (RPFCs). A coordinated hierarchical control (CHC) method collaborating with an internal model predictive control (IMPC) strategy is presented to manage an optimal power flow paradigm for various operating system modes. The effectiveness of the proposed strategy is confirmed through simulations executed with the desired precision representing real system behavior.},

  abstract     = {Recently, multi-motor electric vehicles (EVs) gain much attraction from both academics and industry as they offer prospective advantages in performance and efficiency improvement thanks to the torque-split configuration. Such EVs can enhance the energy consumed throughout normal operation by using a suitable torque distribution system. However, researches on conventional energy management system regularly do not take into account the dynamics of the vehicle, particularly the loss caused by the slip phenomenon of the wheel on the road. Dealing with dual-motor all-wheel-driven EVs, we propose an efficiency-based optimal strategy considering longitudinal vehicle dynamics for improving energy consumption by formulating an energetic cost function that links the energy management and the motion control of EVs. For that, the proposed strategy optimally distributes the required total torque to the front and rear axles to maximize the efficiencies of traction motors in both acceleration and deceleration duration. Software simulation and experiment are carried out on multiple testing scenarios to validate the performance of the proposal. The results show that the proposed distribution strategy can save from 4.4% to 18.8% of consumed energy, compared to several other management strategies described in the article.},

In this article, specific attention is paid to the models of the vehicles, the traction power substation, and the rail supply network to enable an accurate estimation of the energy consumption. The energetic macroscopic representation formalism is used to organize the models of the subsystems so they have the right interactions. The developed model is validated by experimental tests on a real subway line. The error on the global energy consumption is lower than 2.2%. The model is then employed to examine the influence of the vehicle time interval on energy consumption. A 10-second adjustment in this time interval can result in a substantial 22% decrease in energy consumption for the analyzed real subway line.},

  abstract     = {Replacing the regular two-stage inverters with a Z-source inverter (ZSI), based on single conversion, has come under attention in fuel cell (FC) hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs). This substitution is to decrease the circuit complexity, cost, and required space. However, fulfilling these goals highly depends on the selection of a suitable topology. This paper performs a multi-criteria ranking to deeply analyze the impact of different ZSI topologies on the performance of a recreational FC-HEV, composed of FC stack and lithium-ion capacitor bank. First, the dual-energy sources are embedded into the Z-source network (ZSN). Subsequently, the Preference Ranking Organization METHod for Enrichment Evaluation (PROMETHEE) is utilized to rank different possible ZSI topologies based on four scenarios (standard, compactness, input current ripple, and compactness versus input current ripple). This analysis indicates that each scenario can have a suitable topology with respect to its requirements. Finally, the two highest-ranked ZSI topologies according to standard scenario are implemented by signal hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) to validate the effectiveness of the performed analysis. The results indicate that the use of the ZSI topologies lead to higher average efficiencies (1.98% and 4.07%), and smaller size and volume of passive components, compared to a conventional two-stage inverter.},

  abstract     = {In the field of fuel cells, early detection of faulty conditions can significantly improve the lifetime. Then, signal analysis techniques such as electrochemical impedance spectroscopy combined with machine learning algorithms can generate a representation of the system state of health space using data in known conditions. Although the onboard measurement of EIS can be done by controlling the harmonic content of the power converter at the output of the fuel cell, the implementation of in-vehicle diagnostic algorithms is still limited by the absence of a large database listing the evolution of performance throughout the life cycle. This paper presents a fast-diagnostic method able to consider the occurrence of new data to adapt the dimensional space representing the health state and compensate for the lack of data. Available measurements come from two low-temperature proton exchange membrane fuel cell technologies characterized by two laboratories. The results presented in the paper show that the automatic parameter selection provides performances as good as the ones obtained by an expert. The feasibility of the approach has also been demonstrated on a low-cost embedded platform.},

  abstract     = {Intelligent parking guidance systems (IPGSs) based on vacant parking space (VPS) availability predictions are highly effective to alleviate the increasingly serious parking difficulties in metropolis. The spatial-temporal correlation analysis of VPS information of multiple parking lots in a region shows that not only the number of VPS in each parking lot has a stable temporal correlation, but also there is obvious spatial correlation among different parking lots. Given this, this article takes full advantage of the space-time correlation and makes short-term (within 30 min) and long-term (over 30 min) predictions about the number of VPSs in multiple parking lots in an area parallelly. Specifically, this article develops a deep gated graph recurrent neural network (G$^{2}$RNN) model which has the ability to extract both spatial and temporal correlations concurrently between different parking lots. The advantages of the G$^{2}$RNN model are that, first, spatial and temporal correlations between different parking lots can be accurately obtained simultaneously, and second, there is no need to grid the raw data since it uses graph-structured data. For long-term predictions, two different approaches, namely the single-step and iterative predictions, are investigated. The performance of the G$^{2}$RNN based prediction method is extensively evaluated with practical data collected from eight public parking lots in Santa Monica. The results show that it can achieve considerably high accuracy in both short-term and long-term predictions.},

  abstract     = {Ensuring safety in autonomous driving remains a significant challenge. The safety of autonomous vehicles (AVs) is profoundly influenced by the driving behavior of different drivers, especially in complex and dynamic scenarios. To address these safety risks arising from various driving behavior, this study introduces a low-risk, high-efficiency motion planning approach based on a trajectory prediction model. Firstly, an unsupervised driving style recognition framework using real-world data information is developed to categorize vehicles into three distinct driving style: cautions, normal, and aggressive. Next, a trajectory prediction model incorporating different driving styles is established using the Transformer prediction network to predict the future trajectories of surrounding vehicles (SVs). Subsequently, a motion planning framework that incorporates driving intentions is constructed to generate candidate planning trajectory cluster. Moreover, based on trajectory prediction and driving style information of SVs, a personalized risk assessment model is established, while also comprehensively considering the impact of safety, efficiency and comfort. Finally, the proposed approach is verified through real datasets and comparative experiments. The results show that the proposed framework achieves high-precision trajectory prediction and attains a 99% success rate in closed-loop testing with real datasets, thereby providing safe motion planning for AVs in dynamic environments.},

  abstract     = {The widespread adoption of Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) has revolutionized high-precision positioning services. However, the accuracy of these systems is significantly compromised by Non-Line-of-Sight (NLOS) signals, especially in urban canyons. Specifically, Line-of-Sight (LOS) signals are obstructed, and the reflections lead to substantial errors. Machine learning has emerged as a promising tool for identifying NLOS signals. However, traditional methods often train models on extensive datasets from various environments and fine-tune them with new data to adjust to new scenarios. This fine-tuning can result in catastrophic forgetting, which impairs the models' generalization performance across different environments. To address the limitations of model fine-tuning, we introduce NICL, an approach for NLOS Identification with Continual Learning. NICL preserves performance on previously encountered scenarios while adapting to new environments by employing simple regularization techniques that do not require access to the data from the old scenarios. Specifically, our method incorporates Kullback-Leibler divergence regularization and explainability-based regularization to maintain the model's prior outputs and the logic behind those outputs, thus mitigating catastrophic forgetting. Experimental results on real-world GNSS datasets have shown that our NICL method outperforms existing baseline methods, achieving an absolute improvement of 5%-12% in NLOS identification accuracy.},

  abstract     = {Maximizing traffic flow at signalized intersections using adaptive signal control (ASC) strategy has proven highly effective in mitigating the risk of traffic congestion. However, existing ASC strategies typically consider the traffic conditions of a single downstream road at a time, limiting their overall effectiveness. To address this limitation and enhance ASC strategies, this paper proposes an improved adaptive signal control (IASC) which considers traffic conditions of multiple downstream roads during phase selection. Furthermore, with the emergence of vehicular ad hoc network (VANET) technologies, traffic light agents can now communicate with vehicle agents. By leveraging this connectivity, this paper proposes a unified framework called VR-IASC which combines vehicle rerouting strategy with the IASC strategy. First, the proposed IASC considers the intentions of the vehicles in the connected vehicle (CV) environment during the selection of the traffic light phases. Then, the road congestion levels are predicted by considering the vehicle flow affected by the selected traffic light phases. Upon detecting the congested roads, alternative routes based on travel time and remaining road capacity are assigned to the vehicles before they enter the congested roads. Based on simulation results, the proposed IASC outperforms the state-of-the-art ASC strategy by 38.1% and 12.3% in terms of percentage reduction in average travel time in a simple grid network and a real-life Kuala Lumpur (KL) network, respectively. Furthermore, by combining the proposed IASC strategy with vehicle rerouting strategy, the proposed VR-IASC framework achieves substantial reductions in average travel time of 42.26% and 34.74% in the grid network and the KL network, respectively.},

To accurately diagnose axle-box bearing surface defects, robust blind deconvolution (BD) methods are proposed to extract defect-induced repetitive impulses from axle-box vibration measurements in this article. Specifically, a unified theoretical framework for the BD methods using time-domain and frequency-domain generalized statistical indicators as objective functions is established respectively by converting the deconvolution problem into a generalized Rayleigh quotient-based generalized eigenvalue problem. On this basis, two new BD methods for extracting repetitive impulse features are presented by employing the robust power function-based Gini index as the objective function. They obtain optimal deconvolution filters by adaptively evaluating repetitive transient features in the squared envelope and squared envelope spectrum of the filtered signal, respectively. The developed methods are verified on bench experimental signals of manufactured and naturally occurring axle-box bearing faults. The results show that the presented BD methods can effectively enhance repetitive impulse features and diagnose various defects of railway vehicle axle-box bearings.},

While prior research has predominantly focused on employing a two-dimensional wheel profiles, it has overlooked the combined effects of circumferential and lateral wear. Furthermore, although there is evidence suggesting that interharmonics can influence wheel wear, existing studies have not thoroughly explored this aspect. Therefore, this paper examines the evolution characteristics of three-dimensional (3D) PW under the influence of interharmonics from the perspective of electromechanical coupling. Initially, an evolution model for 3D wheel PW is developed, integrating an electromechanical coupling model, a 3D wheel profile model, and the USFD wear function. Subsequently, 3D distribution characteristics of PW under multiple operating conditions are analyzed. The results reveal significant differences in the order and depth of PW across different lateral positions. Specially, on curved tracks, the order of PW is presented in distinct groupings. The dominant polygon of the locomotive running (70 km/h) on a straight track is 200 mm, attributed to $| {5f - 7{{f}_0}} |$ interharmonic effect, whereas on the curved track, it is 316 mm, attributed to P2 resonance. Moreover, as the curve radius increases, the ratio between PW depth of 316 and 200 mm significantly decrease.},

In view of this, this paper proposes a consensus based reinforcement learning method for differentiated formation control (DFC) of UAVs, to balance the obstacle avoidance flexibility and consistency. In this method, to promote obstacle avoidance flexibility of a UAV swarm, a consensus mechanism with differentiated formation control strategies is designed, it allows each UAV in a swarm changes its formation control strategy among aggregation, formation keeping and obstacle avoidance according to its local environment, and calculates its own current subgoal based on the selected strategy. Further, to improve the flight efficiency of the UAV swarm, a reinforcement learning model is provided to generate the optimal offset vector for each UAV according to its current subgoal. Moreover, to enhance the obstacle avoidance consistency of the UAV swarm, a collaborative obstacle avoidance algorithm is designed in the obstacle avoidance strategy, it requires UAVs to share their obstacle information and obstacle avoidance actions, and provides obstacle avoidance consensus rules to help UAVs to choose consistent obstacle avoidance directions. The experiment results show that the proposed method can combine obstacle avoidance flexibility and consistency of UAVs, thereby achieving higher flight efficiency and maintaining stable network connectivity.},

First, a general model of the MMLS is established. The coupling relationship between LPs is deduced considering the composite motion of the system centroid. Then, an ultra-local sliding mode controller (USMC) is designed, which eliminates the parameter dependency of an accurate system model and possesses excellent dynamic performance for each LP. Next, adjacent cross-coupling control (ACC) is integrated into USMC, effectively reducing tracking errors of each LP and synchronization errors between LPs. Last, comparative experiments with conventional PID and USMC demonstrate that the MMLS adopting the proposed USMACC possesses exceptional overall disturbance-resisting performance under various inconsistent external disturbances.},

Specifically, a novel performance index, estimation gain, is introduced to evaluate the benefit of scheduling one sensor for estimation error reduction. Then, sensor scheduling and data transmission are jointly optimized to minimize the time-accumulated estimation error, which is challenging to directly solve due to the unclear impact of imperfect transmission on estimation performance. To this end, an estimation gain-based algorithm is designed to determine the scheduled sensors. Besides, an iterative algorithm is designed to solve the adaptive cooperative transmission problem.

  abstract     = {A reachable area defines the potential end positions that a reusable vehicle can reach under its current flight state. The area comprises feasible flight trajectories and helps to sustainably regenerate trajectories through instantaneous computation. Thus, it is essential for online plan decisions, particularly in emergencies. However, computing end positions can be challenging when there is high degree of nonlinear coupling between the flight constraints, dynamics, objective functions, and thermal/load factors. To solve this issue, we propose a new flight profile that easily satisfies strict constraints. In addition, we devise a series of analytic dynamics to instantly predict the thermal/load factors and objective functions. The analytic models integrate Earth's perturbations and rotations and complex aerodynamic models, thus improving the accuracy of the derived reachable area. Based on a novel Mercator plane with minimum projection deformation, we devise a lateral profile using a cubic B-spline model that easily satisfies the extensively checked waypoints. Based on the results, the proposed algorithm mitigates nonlinear coupling to a significant extent and facilitates reachable area generation. In addition, we study and reveal the principles of evolutionary method improvements and convergence and devise a deep reinforcement learning-based multiobjective particle swarm optimization method to obtain the Pareto Set. The Set maximizes/minimizes the down/crossrange of a vehicle and comprises a series of end positions to define the reachable area. The reachable area is then employed to rapid vehicle trajectory recomputation. Finally, we validate our algorithm through numerical simulations analyze the results for future improvements.},

The start angle that integrates the motion direction of each given UAV and the safe separation constraint of the relevant pairwise conflict is defined.

  abstract     = {The automated emergency braking system is designed to prevent rear-end collisions. However, unexpected failures within this system during braking could potentially lead to accidents. To address this concern, we propose an integrated safe replanning and motion control framework to mitigate collision risks in the event of braking failures. Unlike previous fault-tolerant control works, the steering system is intervened to eliminate failure risks instead of re-configuring the braking torque; therefore, the longitudinal driving risks can be lessened from the lateral perspective. To achieve this approach, firstly, a risk assessment function with a failure factor is constructed to reconsider the driving target. Then, the driving target position and surrounding obstacle information are incorporated into one novel integral heuristic barrier Lyapunov function to reformulate the motion replanning and tracking problems as one yaw angle tracking problem. After, a novel barrier function-based sliding mode controller is introduced to ensure the yaw angle tracking performance within constraints. In this paper, decision-making, motion planning, and tracking tasks are incorporated into one analytical solution framework uniformly.Additionally, the prescribed time stability of our strategy ensures an upper bound setting time, indicating stability before the ego vehicle stop completly. Finally, numerous simulation results are carried out to confirm the effectiveness and superiority of our strategy in circumventing the troubles of braking system failures.},

We use average nonlinear age (ANA) to measure data freshness and study linear, squared and exponential penalty functions. We prove that the zero-wait sampling, the uniform quantization, and the ANA-optimal coding policies together provide an asymptotically optimal solution, in the sense that, as the average distortion approaches zero, the solution achieves the minimum ANA asymptotically, for the linear and squared penalty functions. When the probability density function (pdf) is weakly unimodal, we also prove that the zero-wait sampling, the K-L quantization which is asymptotically optimal for the quantization with Rényi entropy constraint, and the ANA-optimal coding policies are asymptotically optimal for the exponential penalty function. Furthermore, we prove that the optimal ANA is asymptotically linear with respect to the log MSE distortion with a slope of $-\frac{3}{4}$, $-\sqrt{\frac{7}{12}}$ and $-1$, corresponding to the linear, squared and exponential penalty functions, respectively.},

Intelligent vehicles, roadside devices, and open wireless communication networks collectively expand the vulnerability landscape of intelligent transportation system (ITS) security, thereby increasing the potential exposure to security risks. Nonetheless, mobile vehicles require frequent authentication with Roadside Units (RSUs), which in turn results in substantial computational and communication overhead. Consequently, this approach leads to performance bottlenecks in resource-constrained On-Board Units (OBUs). In this paper, we are concerned with a lattice-based certificateless secure data transmission scheme for the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) based on Blockchain. The proposed protocol incorporates identity authentication functionality and effectively integrates the cross-domain authentication characteristics of the Blockchain. Initially, the Trusted Authority (TA) uploads the registration information of vehicles onto the Blockchain to verify the authenticity of a vehicle's identity by examining the data stored in the Blockchain. When Roadside Units securely collect authenticated transactions and message transmission traffic, the integrity of the messages is ensured through the utilization of the lattice-based signcryption algorithm as part of a block. Subsequently, according to the data transmission algorithm, these partial blocks are transformed into complete blocks and disseminated across the entire network. The complete blocks were subsequently mined using a consensus algorithm that incorporated a voting mechanism. Furthermore, the security of the proposed protocol is rigorously proven by employing a random oracle model. Finally, the efficiency of the data transmission algorithm was rigorously evaluated under the Barabasi-Albert BA (3) and Erdos-Renyi ER (0,1) models, ensuring its effectiveness in various network topologies.},

In this paper, both Single-Input Single-Output (SISO) and polarized Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) channel measurements are conducted in an IIoT scenario at the less congested Wi-Fi band, i.e., 5.5 GHz. The purpose is to investigate wireless characteristics of communications between access points and terminals mounted on automated guided vehicles as well as those surrounding manufacturing areas. For SISO channel measurements, statistical properties including the delay Power Spectral Density (PSD), path loss, shadowing fading, delay spread, excess delay, K-factor, and amplitude distribution of small-scale fading are analyzed and compared with those observed in an office scenario. For MIMO channel measurements, results show that there are multiple Dense Multipath Component (DMC) processes in the delay PSD. An estimation algorithm based on the algorithm for a single DMC process is proposed to effectively process the multi-processes data. Moreover, delay, angular, power, and polarization properties of DMCs are investigated and compared with those of specular multipath components. Furthermore, effects of DMCs on Singular Values (SVs) and channel capacities are explored. Ignoring DMCs can overestimate SVs and underestimate channel capacities.},

However, the design of the receiver for 5G NR signals is challenging by the presence of multipath in indoor and urban environments, especially for time-of-arrival (TOA) tracking. In this paper, we propose a signal parameter estimation method for 5G NR that utilizes the estimation of signal parameters via rotational invariance techniques (ESPRIT) and the state space model to achieve signal parameter estimation. First, the ESPRIT is employed as the delay and phase discriminator, and a path selection criterion based on amplitude is proposed to avoid outliers in ESPRIT estimation caused by overestimating the channel order based on the minimum description length (MDL) criterion. Then, the state space model is used for carrier phase and Doppler frequency estimation, and the measurement matrix based on the phase error of the ESPRIT discriminator is derived. Finally, the performance of the proposed method is tested in an indoor environment containing a commercial small cell base station (BS). The results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the DLL and ESPRIT, with a pseudorange estimation root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.63m. Therefore, the proposed method in this article has essential reference significance for promoting and commercializing 5G indoor positioning.},

  abstract     = {Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) is considered as one of the revolutionary technologies for sixth-generation (6G) wireless communication as it can be adapted to assist communication systems by adaptively manipulating the propagation environment and greatly expanding network coverage. In this case, the aerial IRS (AIRS)-assisted communications have unique advantages, such as more flexible deployment and wider service coverage. However, accurate channel modeling of AIRS-assisted system is challenging due to mobility. In this paper, we propose a novel geometry-based three-dimensional (3D) wideband channel model for AIRS-assisted multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communication systems, where the rotational degrees of freedom in three directions and the arbitrary trajectory of AIRS in space are specially considered. Firstly, a novel geometry-based 3D channel model that considers the realistic motion trajectory of UAVs in reality is proposed. The scatterers in the environment are modeled as different clusters set to simulate the frequency-selective fading caused by multipath effects. Secondly, a space-time-related cluster visibility algorithm based on the birth-death process is developed to characterize the non-stationarity introduced by the mobility of AIRS. Based on the model, the channel impulse responses (CIRs) and the corresponding statistical characteristic functions are derived. Finally, we investigate and analyze the impacts of different AIRS trajectories on channel statistical characteristics, such as the space-time correlation function, Doppler power spectral density, and channel capacity. Meanwhile, the influence of non-ideal AIRS on the channel is discussed, including discrete phase design and discrete time reflection phase. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed model can accurately capture the channel properties, which therefore provides valuable insights for future development of AIRS for 6G systems.},

  abstract     = {As network and autonomous driving technologies rapidly advance, traffic flow prediction has become a crucial area of research. It plays a significant role in optimizing urban traffic management and enhancing road safety, drawing increasing attention from researchers. As a specific form of time-series data, traffic flow data is often used in prediction tasks utilizing large language models. Recent developments in graph data and improvements in graph neural networks have led researchers to employ methods like adjacency and Laplacian matrices for addressing relational issues among distant nodes. However, most existing methods focus on enhancing prediction performance through network architectures or using adaptive matrices to capture spatiotemporal relationships, with limited exploration into the impact of input embedding. This paper introduces an innovative approach to traffic flow prediction, the ASTRformer, which emphasizes the fusion of spatial and temporal information in historical data through an adaptive spatio-temporal relation learning mechanism. This mechanism integrates feature embedding with adaptive spatial and temporal embeddings. A learnable spatio-temporal fusion network then parameterizes these embeddings, producing the input representations. Subsequently, a transformer model captures these representations to predict future traffic flows. Experimental results on six datasets demonstrate that our method effectively captures spatio-temporal dependencies, achieving state-of-the-art performance across various prediction metrics.},

  abstract     = {The integration of video monitoring and intelligent applications in intelligent transportation and pedestrian navigation has sparked concerns regarding privacy protection. Person re-identification, a key application, utilizes deep learning models to manage traffic efficiently and guide pedestrians. However, this technology raises privacy issues. Existing de-identification methods, such as blurring or pixelation, compromise the realism of crucial pedestrian attributes for identification, and often overlook the importance of identity restoration and person attributes required by law enforcement. To address these challenges, this paper proposes the Attribute-Consistency Reversible Pedestrian De-Identification (ACRPD) framework. ACRPD comprises three main processes: attribute-level contrastive learning, cross-view pedestrian anonymization generation, and raw pedestrian image recovery. Attribute-level contrastive learning ensures consistency in attributes between anonymized pedestrian images, using a predictor trained on attribute labels like ID, gender, age, and clothing. The cross-view pedestrian anonymization generation module employs attribute transformation and adversarial training to generate anonymized images while preserving important attribute information and removing ID details. For reversibility, a raw pedestrian image recovery stage reconstructs original images from anonymized ones, ensuring compatibility with authorized scenarios. Extensive experiments on two person reidentification datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of ACRPD, achieving average 12.1% and 5.0% rank-1 accuracies on Market and MSMT17 datasets respectively. ACRPD successfully maintains attribute consistency while safeguarding privacy-sensitive ID information, offering a promising solution for privacy protection in intelligent transportation and pedestrian navigation applications.},

Vehicles use the 3D object detection algorithm to perceive their surroundings and share detection results with other vehicles using the internet of vehicles technology, improving the efficiency of intelligent transportation systems. Multimodal information fusion of LiDAR and cameras can improve the performance of 3D object detection. However, the different modality information is inhomogeneous, multimodal 3D object detection still has challenges, such as difficult semantic alignment of modal elements and inadequate fusion. To mitigate these challenges, we first propose the sparse interaction with centroid query (SICQ) for voxel-level features from different modalities, which aligns different modal semantic information through more precise and fine-grained interaction. Then, we propose the dense fusion with multi-scale masked attention (DFMMA), using multi-scale feature masks from bird's-eye-view (BEV)-level multimodal features to improve performance for small object feature perception. Finally, we propose the multimodal grid encoder with positional information (MGEPI), through positional information implicitly guiding and the transformer-based attention mechanism for grid-level features, improves the perception of detection scene context spatial information and enhances the robustness of the algorithm. Additionally, this paper performs comprehensive experiments on the popular KITTI dataset and demonstrates that our algorithm has superior 3D object detection performance.},

Given the diverse nature of waste types and the need to organize multiple vehicles to service collection points, congestion often arises due to simultaneous vehicle operations or queuing, posing a significant challenge. To address this, our study introduces asynchronous constraints on vehicle operations to mitigate congestion. Furthermore, building upon the separate loading and unified loading waste C&T models, a combined C&T model grounded in waste classification is devised. We propose an enhanced ant colony optimization algorithm to solve this intricate problem and validate its efficacy. Experimental findings reveal that, compared to both separate and unified schemes, the proposed combined model yields respective reductions of 5.38% and 2.75% in C&T costs. Meanwhile, the comprehensiveness of the combined model has been demonstrated through other experiments, providing a reference for the improvement and optimization of garbage classification C&T schemes.},

The EV-WPT system has a transmission power of 30 kW and a working frequency of 85 kHz. Fully considering the uncertainty of human exposure to the electromagnetic environment of the EV-WPT system, such as the distance between the human body and the EV-WPT system, the distance between the EV-WPT system coils, and the parameters of the compensation circuit, this article uses Bayesian Neural Networks to evaluate human electromagnetic safety. Bayesian neural networks can obtain accurate results with fewer training sets and have higher computational efficiency. The results showed that the probability of electromagnetic exposure levels significantly exceeding the standard limit in the human body with hip joint implants was almost 100%, while the probability of exceeding the standard limit in the human heart with coronary artery stents did not exceed 31.5%.

Internet of Vehicles (IoV) technology can provide a multitude number of communication services between vehicles and Roadside Units (RSUs), making vehicle cooperative caching a viable solution. Nevertheless, for new energy vehicles such as electric ones, how to reduce the energy consumption of the vehicle network system remains a formidable challenge. Additionally, the task delay of vehicle cooperative caching can also be further reduced. In this paper, a clustering caching model is proposed by considering constraints for tolerable delay of tasks and the residence time of vehicles, and the kinetic energy recovery scheme of vehicles and the Energy Harvesting (EH) mechanism of RSUs are designed to reduce the system energy consumption. Terahertz (THz) communication is employed in vehicle to vehicle (V2V) to accelerate the completion of tasks. Subsequently, the energy consumption optimization problem for the vehicle cooperative caching system is constructed. Furthermore, the continuity and high-dimensionality properties of the decision variables for the optimization problem are analyzed, and we propose the joint Download Size and Bandwidth Allocation (DSBA) algorithm to explore an approximate optimal solution for task decomposition and resource allocation in the high-dynamic environment. We also propose an algorithm named Vehicle Cache Content Recommendation (VCCR) to avoid the additional delay and the waste of energy caused by the vehicle user cache miss-hit problem.

  abstract     = {With the rapid growth of urban vehicles, it is necessary to use advanced traffic control technologies for traffic flow control and traffic diversion, and allocate road resources reasonably to ensure smooth urban traffic and maximize the transportation efficiency of the transportation network. Considering the spatial characteristics of urban road networks and the temporal information of traffic speeds, this article proposes a spatiotemporal dynamic deep network called GCN-LSTM, which is based on Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) neural network. The network utilizes a unique network structure to address the spatiotemporal dynamics, periodicity, and uncertainty of traffic flow. The proposed algorithm utilizes GCN to process the spatial correlation characteristics of traffic flow, and captures the temporal dynamic characteristics of traffic flow using LSTM and attention mechanism. Attention vectors are used as competitive selection to establish the correlation between the state of the next prediction step and the historical state. When predicting traffic fluctuations, this article considers the spatiotemporal correlation in the road network and extracts spatiotemporal correlation features from the fluctuations. Finally, the proposed algorithm uses LSTM to fit historical features and future traffic flow fluctuation momentum. Simulation experiments have demonstrated the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed model.},

  abstract     = {Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are widely used for commercial transportation and data collection in many applications. Recently, UAVs have been used as flying relays to support terrestrial cellular networks for enhancing coverage and connectivity. Multiple UAVs serve as data collectors at a common altitude in a UAV-aided Internet of Things (IoT) network. Data collected is processed by Federated Learning (FL) before being sent to central servers to protect users' privacy and reduce communication costs. Batteries in UAVs are tiny and efficient only for a short duration, making FL challenging to execute for many iterations. Therefore, a Multi-UAV Energy Efficient Coverage Deployment algorithm based on a Spatial Adaptive Play (MUECD-SAP) is proposed in this article. MUECD uses a modified Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) to optimize the accurate location of deployed UAVs based on the Signal-to-Interference Ratio (SINR) to increase the data collection rate. Also, to make the FL run for multiple iterations, SAP dynamically allocates resources using Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) to optimize the energy consumed and the link latency between the user and the UAV system. The proposed MUECD algorithm outperforms all the state-of-the-art algorithms by achieving an improved data rate and balanced SINR value. The proposed SAP resource allocation strategy has improved the FL execution by 66.67% and attains a very low latency and energy consumed compared to other resource allocation techniques.},

  abstract     = {The increased charging demand resulting from the rapid development of electric vehicles (EVs) poses various challenges to the stable operation of distribution networks and the smart grid. Due to stochastic EV charging behaviour, high charging demand at charging stations (CSs) elevates the load curve which may lead to a spatially imbalanced load demand. As such, forecasting the highly stochastic EV charging load considering an individual EV's unique charging behaviour can result in maintaining safe operation of the grid and distribution network. Therefore, in this work, we propose Block-FeDL, a blockchain-based Federated Learning (FL) approach for EV charging load forecasting considering private and sensitive charging information of each EV user. Thereafter, we use a Bidirectional Long Short Term Memory (BiLSTM) model within FeDL for predicting EV charging load patterns at each client. Moreover, instead of using a centralized server for global model aggregation, we use blockchain technology, where model aggregation is performed in a decentralized manner and local model parameters shared by FL clients can be validated and securely recorded. Lastly, the results show that Block-FeDL outperforms the second-best baseline method by 95%, 96%, and 77% in terms of mean square error (MSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and root mean square error (RMSE) for forecasting EV charging load.},

  abstract     = {Internet of Vehicles (IoV) is a promising technology to equip transportation management systems with digitalized ability. The deployed IoV devices allow traffic participants to generate and analyze the traffic information such as driving status and road condition. They can further share the collected traffic data through the centralized cloud service to improve road operation efficiency, safety and reduce economic losses. Storing sensitive traffic data in an untrusted cloud server, however, raises the requirement of data access control to protect valuable business issues. Unfortunately, using pure cryptographic access control schemes for traffic data faces several limitations. In this paper, we first develop a pure cryptographic construction to enforce attribute-based access control (ABAC) model in untrusted cloud for IoV system based on ciphertext policy-attribute based encryption (CP-ABE) and explore three limitations of it. By studying ABAC in the context of CP-ABE, we can effectively lower-bound the costs that would be incurred when using more advanced and more expensive predicate encryption schemes. We then propose a new attribute based access control system (AACS) for cloud-aided IoV system to overcome the barriers of CP-ABE by using trusted hardware (Intel Software Guard Extensions (SGX)). AACS uses a secure data division framework to achieve a small Trusted Computing Base (TCB) and integrates SGX with several cryptographic protocols as well as optimization techniques. We comprehensively evaluate AACS to show the design advantages of it.},

This article proposes a Superpixel Prior Cluster-level Contrastive (SPCC) clustering network for large-scale hyperspectral image clustering tasks. Instead of instance-level contrastive learning, SPCC retains the useful representations selectively under the guidance of the superpixel subregion. The proposed framework treats each sample as a view for its belonged cluster and learns cluster-level semantic representations. SPCC enhances the separability of samples by employing contrastive loss, which proves effective for vehicle detection tasks. Extensive experiments are designed to obtain competitive results for the popular clustering methods on three Hyperspectral image datasets. The experimental results indicate that SPCC performs well in both hyperspectral image clustering and vehicle recognition tasks.},

However, vehicle crossing paths in existing literature primarily followed conventional geometric design. The performance of unconventional intersections with alternative conflict layouts under signal-free control remains a knowledge gap. To address this problem, we model the operations of three unconventional (signal-free) autonomous intersections and compare their operational performance with one conventional autonomous intersection. Results show that unconventional vehicle crossing paths at intersections are likely to reduce vehicle delay and fuel consumption compared with conventional intersections in most scenarios. Three crucial intersection layout factors, i.e. the number of conflicts, the distance between conflicting points, and the conflict angle, are investigated, which provides new insights into the mechanism of the performance change of unconventional intersections under the CAV environment. Our analysis suggests vehicle path design offers new space for operational performance enhancement of autonomous intersections.},

These instructions serve as guidance for the generation of dispatching strategies within complex distributed network scenarios. According to this strategy, the proposed framework seamlessly integrates the decision-making capabilities of LLM with multiple D3PG models to generate a large number of candidate dispatching strategies and then uses the whale optimization algorithm to optimize these strategies to achieve better dispatching results. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework and show outperformance in comparison to some existing methods for power dispatching tasks with the random connection of EVs in SAGVNs.},

To tackle this issue, this research advances the proposition of employing an auxiliary vehicle (AV) for task offloading and introduces a novel Auxiliary Vehicle Algorithm (AVA). AVA integrates both federated learning and multi-agent reinforcement learning to fully utilize computing resources in the vehicular environment, and simultaneously achieves task delay reduction, energy consumption minimization, and task completion rate augmentation. Moreover, we establish a federated learning framework to judiciously determine the proportion of resource allocation of AV through the implementation of inventive mechanisms. Experiment results validate that our approach not only leads to the improvement of key system performance indicators, but also ensures the comprehensive exploitation of the computing resources of mobile vehicles.},

One of these scenarios can be formulated as an online continual learning (OCL) problem. That is, data come in an online fashion, and models are updated according to these streaming data. Two major OCL challenges are catastrophic forgetting and data imbalance. To address these challenges, in this paper, we propose an Analytic Exemplar-Free Online Continual Learning algorithm (AEF-OCL). The AEF-OCL leverages analytic continual learning principles and employs ridge regression as a classifier for features extracted by a large backbone network. It solves the OCL problem by recursively calculating the analytical solution, ensuring an equalization between the continual learning and its joint-learning counterpart, and works without the need to save any used samples (i.e., exemplar-free). Additionally, we introduce a Pseudo-Features Generator (PFG) module that recursively estimates the mean and the variance of real features for each class. It over-samples offset pseudo-features from the same normal distribution as the real features, thereby addressing the data imbalance issue. Experimental results demonstrate that despite being an exemplar-free strategy, our method outperforms various methods on the autonomous driving SODA10M dataset.},

Specifically, algorithms based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) are developed for distributed optimization of CAV trajectories. The synchronous ADMM and asynchronous ADMM algorithms enable parallelized coordination of large-scale CAV systems. Simultaneously, we propose a distributed training scheme where each CAV trains its cost and dynamics networks on simulators local to each vehicle.

Then, we introduce an innovative car-following model named the integrated velocity and acceleration fusion model that integrates state information from multiple lead and following vehicles to determine the optimal acceleration for the subject CAV.

Addressing the issue of point cloud sparsity will enhance the detection range in autonomous driving scenarios. Pseudo point clouds have been used to enhance the ability of deep learning models to detect distant points. However, this approach has several shortcomings. In this paper, a curbed fake point collector (CFPC), which addresses the three issues caused by pseudo points, is proposed to support 3D object detection for autonomous vehicles. First, for noise points with inaccurate coordinates, the dead pixel checker (DPC) calculates the depth map gradient using the Sobel operator. This approach enables the deep learning model to identify noise points. Second, because of the excessive quantity of points, sparse prioritized local sampling (SPLS) reduces the number of input point clouds to a lightweight level that can be accommodated by computing devices with limited memory. This is achieved through grid-based random sampling and real-point-prioritized farthest point sampling. This module effectively samples an appropriate pseudo point cloud based on the density of points in local space. Third, with respect to interference among channels, channel mask set abstraction (CMSA) isolates channels describing different information within the point cloud using GroupMLP, which is an MLP that separates channels into their respective groups. Group separation facilitates the extraction of features without mutual influence, allocating half of the output channels to color information and the other half to geometric information. The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated by the results of experiments conducted on the KITTI dataset. It is superior to the baseline in most situations, particularly in the categories of cars and riders.},

  abstract     = {The traditional vehicular ad hoc network (VANET) gradually evolved into the Internet of Vehicles (IoV), which has also become a potential target for attacks and faces security challenges in an open network environment. Intrusion detection systems (IDS) based on machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) are introduced to mitigate security threats. However, existing ML/DL-based IDS suffer from challenges in IoV environments. First, due to the limitations of ML/DL-based methods, classification performance is unsatisfactory when they extract only unidirectional contextual features or spatial characteristics. Second, existing research on in-vehicle network IDS often limits validation and testing to a static dataset of a single vehicle model. This approach may not adequately address diverse potential attacks in a dynamic environment. Third, few studies of hybrid IDS can simultaneously implement in-vehicle and extra-vehicle network intrusion detection. Large language models (LLM) have shown outstanding applications in fields such as natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision (CV). In particular, bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT) obtain new state-of-the-art results on eleven famous NLP tasks. Consequently, this paper introduces a hybrid network IDS in IoV utilising LLM, denoted as IoV-BERT-IDS. This framework encompasses four modules: semantic extractor (SE), input embedding, IoV-BERT-IDS pre-training, and IoV-BERT-IDS fine-tuning. To conform to the BERT model, the semantic extractor is introduced to transform traffic data devoid of apparent semantics into contextual semantics, comprising bidirectional and unidirectional SE. Through SE, controller area network (CAN) data is transformed into a CAN byte sentence (CBS), while extra-vehicle network traffic data is transformed into a traffic byte sentence (TBS). Additionally, two pre-training tasks, the masked byte word model (MBWM) and next byte sentence prediction (NBSP) are proposed to acquire bidirectional contextual features from contextual semantics. These features can be adapted to downstream tasks in both in-vehicle and extra-vehicle networks through fine-tuning. Experiments demonstrate that IoV-BERT-IDS outperforms in CICIDS, BoT-IoT, Car-Hacking, and In-vehicle network intrusion detection challenge (IVN-IDS) datasets and shows good generalisation capabilities to in-vehicle networks of different vehicles.},

  abstract     = {Artificial intelligence (AI) technologies have been applied to the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) to provide convenience services such as traffic flow prediction. However, concerns regarding privacy and security are on the rise as huge amounts of data are aggregated to form large models (LMs). Although federated learning (FL), which trains and updates a model without sharing the actual datasets, has been intensively researched to prevent privacy breaches, there are still potential security threats like a single point of failure and intentional tampering with malicious data. This is because of the vulnerability of a central curator and a lack of authentication. As participants, they (i.e., vehicles) may unintentionally update low-quality data caused by poor wireless connectivity, unstable availability, and insufficient training datasets. They may also intentionally update unreliable data to carry out poisoning attacks. The divergence among local models, trained on non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data, can slow convergence and diminish model accuracy when these models are aggregated. Therefore, it is important to carefully select trustworthy participants. In this paper, we propose a new reliable and secure federated learning for IoV based on decentralized blockchain and reputation management. To cope with a single point of failure, injection of malicious data, and lack of authentication while ensuring privacy and traceability, our scheme combines blockchain and a lightweight digital signature. Moreover, we employ the concept of the reputation of vehicles to select suitable participants with reliability, ultimately improving accuracy. Security analysis results, including comparisons with previous works, prove that the proposed scheme can address security concerns. The results of performance evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed scheme.},

  abstract     = {Vehicular networks have huge potential to improve road safety and traffic efficiency, especially in the context of large models. Cloud computing can significantly improve the performance of vehicular networks, and the concept of cloud-assisted vehicular networks comes into being. Reputation management plays a crucial role in vehicular networks, since it can help each vehicle evaluate the trustworthiness of the other vehicles and the received messages. Reputation updating is essential in reputation management and it is usually done by the Trusted Authority (TA) regularly after collecting, decrypting, and verifying a large number of reputation feedbacks, which leads to great computation and communication overheads on the TA side and even makes the TA become the bottleneck of reputation management system. In this paper, we propose a novel Privacy-Preserving Reputation Updating (PPRU) scheme for cloud-assisted vehicular networks based on the Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) and Paillier algorithms, in which the reputation feedbacks are collected and preprocessed by the honest-but-curious Cloud Service Provider (CSP) in a privacy-preserving manner, and the computation and communication overheads on the TA side can be dramatically reduced by about 88.36% and 83.88% as a result, respectively. Meanwhile, the proposed scheme can provide strong privacy preservation, strong security, and robust reputation management with acceptable computation and communication overheads. Furthermore, the comprehensive theoretical analysis and simulation evaluation are conducted, and the results demonstrate that the proposed scheme is significantly superior to the existing schemes in several aspects.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, concomitant with the rapid advancements in large models (LMs) technologies within the field of artificial intelligence (AI), the domain of intelligent Internet of Vehicles (IoV) network has also experienced swift progress. Those potential applications such as autonomous driving, intelligent driver assistance systems, personalized driver experience, and traffic flow and urban mobility management are dependent on the excellent IoV wireless communications system. However, there still exist many fundamental challenges when involving LMs into IoV network. How to provide effective coverage for intervening massive heterogeneous terminals in complex dynamic wireless network environments is a challenging problem. Besides, the generalization and robustness of beamforming within various scenarios are the fundamental for IoV applications mentioned above. To address the aforementioned issues, we in this paper formulate and integrate LMs to achieve excellent hybrid beamforming within IoV wireless communications system which is aided by reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) and base stations (BSs) to provide additional channels and coverage gains. Benefiting from RISs, wireless channels become complex and reconstructable, thus providing the possibility of creating LMs based hybrid beamforming. The proposed LMs are formulated by utilizing deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to effectively interact with environments so that robust beamforming can be maintained within RIS aided IoV network. Finally, we exploit the excellent performance of LMs enabled hybrid beamforming and investigate the impact of critical learning parameters. Comprehensive experimental results have consistently confirmed that the proposed LMs enabled hybrid beamforming for RIS aided IoV outperforms traditional schemes in the respect of system throughput and network coverage under dynamic wireless environments.},

Considering that the high mobility of vehicles causes rapid channel changes, we model the problem as a Markov decision process and propose a resource allocation optimization framework based on the Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning Algorithm (MARL-DDQN), in which a large-scale neural network model is built to train vehicular to learn the optimal resource allocation strategy for optimal communication performance and security performance. Simulation results show that the load successful delivery rate and confidentiality performance of the vehicular communication network are effectively improved compared to the baseline and MADDPG strategies while ensuring link security.

  abstract     = {The advancement of Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) significantly relies on the integration of Internet-of-Things technology for real-time data processing and decision-making. Object detection, a critical component of AVs, necessitates utilizing machine learning techniques. However, this poses challenges including data privacy and the inefficiency of transmitting large volumes of data to a central server. To overcome these challenges, we employ Federated Learning (FL), which allows local devices to train a global model without sharing their raw data. While effective, synchronous federated learning can be time-consuming due to stragglers and often encounter device dropout issues. In contrast, asynchronous federated learning provides faster updates but frequently yields sub-optimal models compared to its synchronous counterpart. Motivated by that, in this paper, we introduce a novel FL framework that combines the strengths of both synchronous and asynchronous methods. Further, by organizing devices into a hierarchical structure, we aim to optimize model convergence while mitigating straggler and dropout problems. Moreover, deploying large models on local edge devices is impractical due to limited computational capabilities, necessitating the adoption of lightweight models to mitigate prolonged training and prediction duration. To evaluate the performance of the proposed method, we conduct a series of experiments using publicly available datasets and subsequently compare the results. Our findings demonstrate that the proposed method significantly enhances the model convergence and performance in object detection for AVs.},

  abstract     = {Advanced in the proliferation of the Internet of Things (IoT), a plethora of functions have been integrated in vehicular networks and thereby transfered it into a smart network. However, the contradiction between the limited on-vehicle computing resource and the massive data collected by these IoT devices hinders the broader adoption of vehicular network as a vast variety of on-vehicle applications are latency-sensitive. To address this issue, vehicular edge computing has become a promising technology as it can offload a large number of tasks from its proximal vehicles. However, the offloading methods recently utilized are inefficient while dealing with multi-user vehicular networks under dynamic scenarios. To design a superior offloading method that can effectively and efficiently offload tasks from vehicles to servers, multiple objectives and constraints with various topologies should be considered. In this paper, instead of constructing a typical multi-user and multi-server vehicular edge computing scenario, a complex scenario with more uncertainties, i.e. urban scenario, is modeled. We propose a Hybrid Architecture Matching Algorithm (HAMA) to minimize the average time latency subject to the constraint on energy consumption and evaluate the proposed algorithm in the above two scenarios. Moreover, HAMA is constructed based on hybrid centralized-distributed architecture, which can process the centralized collected information on a distributed manner. Experimental results demonstrate that the matching algorithm can significantly reduce average time latency, achieving up to a 68% improvement compared to local execution.},

Meanwhile, the physical layer security (PLS) performance is analyzed, and expressions for secrecy outage probability (SOP) and average secrecy capacity (ASC) are obtained. The accuracy of the theoretical framework is validated by comparing numerical and simulation results. Furthermore, the upper bound on the ASC is obtained. Based on these performance metrics, the system's covert and secrecy performance are evaluated, and the verification results are plotted. The results indicate that the RS scheme can improve the covert performance of communication systems.},

  abstract     = {Cell-free (CF) massive multiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO) utilizes multiple distributed access points (APs) to achieve high spectral efficiency (SE). However, challenging propagation environments can degrade communication performance due to substantial penetration loss. Integrating a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) into CF mMIMO can mitigate these issues by adjusting the phase and amplitude of the incident signals and adjusting the coefficients of its elements, providing a cost-effective and energy-efficient solution. This paper focuses on optimizing the joint precoding design of RIS-aided CF mMIMO systems to maximize the sum SE. This involves refining the precoding matrix at the APs and the reflection coefficients at the RIS. We introduce a fully distributed heterogeneous-agent reinforcement learning (HARL) algorithm that incorporates trust region policy optimization (TRPO). Unlike conventional multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) methods that rely on centralized training and execution, our HATRPO algorithm uses only local channel state information, reducing the need for high backhaul capacity by 13%. Simulation results demonstrate that our HATRPO algorithm significantly improves the sum SE in various scenarios.},

  abstract     = {This paper investigates the downlink channel state information (CSI) acquisition in the frequency division duplex (FDD) massive multi-input multi-output (MIMO) systems, which is significantly challenged by low pilot overhead. Specifically, to fully exploit the inter-antenna and inter-subcarrier correlations, we formulate CSI acquisition as the compressed sensing (CS) problem in the angle-delay domain. Based on this model, we propose the angle-delay domain hybrid model-driven and data-driven (ADHMD) algorithm, in which the received signals are processed by the model-driven stage and data-driven stage serially. In the model-driven stage, the excellent hybrid message passing (HMP) algorithm is employed to perform initial estimation. However, this algorithm tends to produce noticeable deviations in the angle-delay tap positions, which results in significant space-frequency domain CSI acquisition performance degradation, especially under low pilot overhead. To address this issue, we present the angle-delay domain channel refinement network (ADCRN) based on multiple attention in the data-driven stage to refine the initial estimation produced by the model-driven stage. Then, the more accurate full bandwidth space-frequency channel is obtained by the Fourier transform of the refined angle-delay channel. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed ADHMD algorithm for CSI acquisition outperforms the state-of-the-art in various scenarios.},

Specifically, FL over wireless networks finds a broad spectrum of applications. However, they are often difficult to realize in practice primarily due to the challenges posed by wireless channels. In this paper, we propose an over-the-air (OTA) computation-based FL scheme suitable for time-varying wireless channels. An FL over time-varying wireless channel is challenging, therefore, the proposed scheme is designed based on orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) modulation to make it resilient to time-varying wireless channels. To perform OTA computation, we develop a novel precoding technique under an optimal transmit power allocation for each user. Since precoding requires channel state information (CSI) of all the devices involved in FL, frequent exchange of CSI may increase control overhead significantly and eventually affect the performance of the FL scheme. Therefore, we develop an extended Kalman filter based CSI estimation scheme to reduce control overhead due to CSI exchange. Numerical simulations reveal that the proposed scheme has a better convergence rate and prediction accuracy than the orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing based learning schemes.},

Due to the fixed positioning of the BS and RIS and the mobility of UE, these two channels generally exhibit different time-varying characteristics, which are challenging to identify and exploit for feedback overhead reduction, given the separate channel estimation difficulty. To address this challenge, this letter introduces an innovative deep learning-based framework tailored for cascaded channel feedback, ingeniously capturing the intrinsic time variation in the cascaded channel. When an entire cascaded channel has been sent to the BS, this framework advocates the feedback of an efficient representation of this variation within a subsequent period through an extraction-compression scheme. This scheme involves RIS unit-grained channel variation extraction, followed by autoencoder-based deep compression to enhance compactness.

  abstract     = {Thanks to their mobility and flexibility, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) could capture images from various angles, serving as training samples to enhance the accuracy of object detection tasks. As a distributed learning framework, federated learning (FL) can be applied to UAV networks to enable UAVs to collaboratively learn a shared model without transmitting raw data. However, the limited resources and mobility of UAVs pose stringent challenges for implementing FL, such as data drift among different UAVs and model aggregation under dynamic conditions. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose an online FL-based framework for UAV object detection tasks with misaligned over-the-air computation (AirComp) techniques. Specifically, we consider a multi-UAV scenario where each edge UAV performs local training while a central UAV is deployed for coordination and model aggregation. Considering the deviation of different viewpoints or data distribution of UAVs, we integrate the retraining-inference process into FL that retrains online collected samples to mitigate the impact of data drift. To further improve FL efficiency, we introduce the AirComp to perform fast uplink model aggregation and use maximum likelihood estimation to obtain estimated sequences to overcome the problems caused by dynamic channel conditions. Simulation results show that the proposed method improves 30% detection accuracy and reduces 52% convergence time compared to the baseline methods in UAV swarms.},

Deep learning provides a promising approach for wireless channel modeling with the help of environmental information. One important application is satellite image-based path loss prediction, which has attracted much attention recently. For path loss prediction, environmental characteristics play a crucial role, with the most intuitive manifestation on images being coverage and resolution, referred to as environmental granularity. By adopting absolute measurement metric m/pixel, this paper investigates the impact of environmental granularities on deep learning-based path loss prediction through extensive experiments. Results indicate that with increasing environmental granularity, network prediction error exhibits a non-monotonic change. When environment granularity is low, increasing image resolution helps reduce error. However, when environment granularity is high, further increasing resolution actually leads to reduced prediction accuracy. These insights offer guidance for designing deep learning based networks for wireless channel prediction.},

In the pre-training stage, we design an effective masking pattern in the antenna domain to learn the latent representation of CIR by utilizing a large number of unlabeled CIR samples. Besides, we introduce the channel attention mechanism to enhance the feature extraction ability in the S-MAE. In the fine-tuning stage, we use limited labeled CIR samples to fine-tune the pre-training model in a manner of supervised learning, where the long short term memory (LSTM) network is introduced to realize the mapping from CIR to user coordinates. Experiment results show that: 1) for the case of limited labeled samples, the proposed S-MAE model has superior positioning accuracy compared to conventional positioning models. 2) For the case of non-ideal CIR scenarios, the robustness performance of the S-MAE is better than that of other benchmark models. 3) The performance gain of the proposed S-MAE under different masking patterns/ratios on the CIR sample is presented, which verifies the effectiveness of the proposed masking strategy.},

Hence, we formulate the SBP gain maximization problem, considering also the constraints on the signal-to-interference and noise ratio (SINR) of the communication users (CUs), on the transmit power, and the constant modulus of the phase-shifters in the mmWave hybrid transceiver. To solve this non-convex problem, we propose a penalty-based triple alternating optimization algorithm to design the hybrid beamformer. Finally, simulation results are provided for demonstrating the efficacy of the proposed model.},

  abstract     = {In emergency communication scenarios without terrestrial base stations, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-mounted base stations offer an efficient solution for wireless transmission. This paper investigates the location planning for UAV base stations, focusing on UAVs equipped with horizontally placed dipole antennas. The study begins by analyzing the received signal strength at various ground locations with this specific antenna configuration, leading to the observation that the ground coverage area is not typical circular. An optimization problem is proposed to determine the positions and orientations of UAVs with the goal of minimizing the required number of UAVs. To avoid the exhaustive search for UAV positions, the coverage area is approximated as rectangular. The rotational tiling (RT) algorithm is presented to deploy UAVs in a grid formation with uniform orientation to cover all ground nodes (GNs). Subsequently, the rotated rectangle (RR) algorithm is introduced to enhance coverage by enabling UAVs to have different orientations. The study assessed the performance of the proposed schemes through simulations. The results indicate that the RT and RR schemes significantly reduce the number of required UAVs compared to the baseline scheme.},

Analog beamforming is a common technology to reduce the number of RF chains. However, existing near-field positioning algorithms cannot adapt to analog beamforming, resulting in the algorithm being unusable when the RF chains are limited. This paper addresses the near-field localization problem for a base station (BS) with an ELAA and limited RF chains. Following the array partitioning approach, we divide the subarrays into groups and use a linear function to approximate the angles of arrival (AoA) variation within each group. We propose a message-passing algorithm, called array-partitioning-based location estimation with AoAs block-wise linearization (APLE-ABL), to estimate the user position.

While Federated Learning (FL) and Meta-Learning (ML) address data privacy and adaptability, challenges like data heterogeneity, scarcity, model positioning, unauthorized data tampering, and cyber threats endure. To tackle these issues, this paper presents a Federated Meta-Learning (FML)-based secure data consolidation scheme, utilizing drones for data consolidation, especially in remote, poorly connected regions, followed by secure blockchain storage. It incorporates an Information Gain Ratio (IGR)-based feature selection method to manage data diversity, a two-phase authentication system merging XOR filtering and Chronological Nonce Authentication for entity validation, and secure model consolidation using Hampel filters and performance checks to validate model updates.

In the more realistic spectrum availability-heterogeneous environments, where secondary users (SUs) may suffer from typically varied spectrum availability across different geographical areas, the effectiveness of the global cooperative spectrum sensing (SS) diminishes. To address this challenge, this paper investigates local cooperative sensing in 3D spectrum availability-heterogeneous cognitive radio networks (CRNs), with AAVs acting as SUs. A local cooperative sensing framework is proposed to ascertain spectrum status in this paper. Specifically, this framework utilizes the energy attenuation characteristics of the primary signal alongside a clustering algorithm to estimate primary user (PU) location, thereby facilitating the consistent spectrum availability for cooperative SUs and reducing the impacts of chaotic pathloss distribution. Then an information geometry (IG)-based data fusion method is incorporated to enable effective data processing on manifolds. Moreover, by drawing inspiration from deep learning (DL), a novel convolutional neural network (CNN) classifier based on the coordinate attention (CA) mechanism is proposed to classify the fused samples, thus achieving the spectrum decision. Numerical simulations demonstrate the superiority of the proposed scheme.},

However, the openness and dependence of AI models on massive volumes of data render them subject to serious security vulnerabilities, such as adversarial attacks. This study investigates security issues in O-RAN's near real-time RAN intelligent controller (RIC), with an emphasis on deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based resource allocation. We introduce a novel attack manipulating environmental observations to mislead AI agents, resulting in erroneous allocations and decreased physical resource block (PRB) transmission rates for various vehicular communications. We also discover flaws where compromised users or signal jammers can fake signal power to trick the AI agent's state observation. This can lead to a policy infiltration attack that makes the network performance drop significantly. Evaluation results show up to a 40% decline in user data rates, a 77.74% reduction in packet delivery rates, and significant disruptions in ultra-reliable and low-latency communications (uRLLC) services such as remote driving and connected automated vehicles. The policy infiltration attack causes a 20% increase in packet losses and up to 150% delay overall. The attack efficiency emphasizes the need for adversarial training in protecting AI-driven applications, which should be addressed in future O-RAN security specifications and AI-powered vehicular networks.},

Through convergence analysis, we show that mobility influences the convergence speed by both fusing the edge data and shuffling the edge models. While mobility is usually considered as a challenge from the perspective of communication, we prove that it increases the convergence speed of HFL with edge-level heterogeneous data, since more diverse data can be incorporated. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a higher speed leads to faster convergence, since it accelerates the fusion of data.

  abstract     = {Change-point detection (CPD), also known as quickest detection, aims to detect an abrupt change in the environment according to its observations as quickly as possible. Its applications in networks, such as wireless sensor networks and vehicular networks, motivate the study of distributed CPD, also known as multi-sensor CPD. In this context, multiple sensors monitor the environment via observations, but only an unknown subset of sensors is affected by the abrupt change. In this paper, we propose a novel distributed CPD algorithm, which simultaneously enjoys the advantages of being free of a fusion center, having low energy cost, being robust to the number of affected sensors, and suitable for a general data model. In particular, the proposed algorithm incorporates the thresholding technique into the a decentralized variant of cumulative sum (CUSUM) procedure. Sensors exchange information only when a designed local statistic exceeds a threshold, thereby reducing the number of communications and the energy cost. In addition, the proposed algorithm approximates the sum-CUSUM procedure and achieves robustness to the number of affected sensors. Theoretical analysis guarantees that the proposed algorithm achieves an exponential relationship between two detection performance criteria, the average running length (ARL), which measures the false alarm rate, and the expected detection delay (EDD). This result holds regardless of the number of the affected sensors. Furthermore, the thresholding operation only has a mild influence on the detection performance. Finally, we conduct simulations to verify the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. We also apply it to distributed source detection task in multiple-antenna wireless networks as a potential application.},

The objective is to maximize the computation throughput by jointly optimizing UAV trajectory planning, beamforming design and computing resource allocation while satisfying sensing quality, power consumption as well as ultra-reliable low latency communications (URLLC) requirements. We then propose a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based algorithm named SAC-TPBD to dynamically modify the UAV trajectory and transmission beamformer according to real-time user queue backlogs and URLLC constraint deviations, thereby realizing URLLC awareness. Evaluations demonstrate that compared to the state-of-the-art methods based on convex approximation techniques, the proposed SAC-TPBD achieves comparable computation performance and beampattern gains with higher implementation efficiency, and the queue backlog can be significantly reduced thanks to the URLLC awareness.

In the proposed system, task packet messages can be computed locally through EDs and offloaded to the MEC server for edge computation; both computations are performed in parallel. Following the stochastic geometry theory, we adopt the homogeneous Poisson point process (PPP) to capture the randomness of the EDs' position and model the interference devices as PPP under the pure ALOHA. In this model, we consider both the interference caused by the same spreading factors (co-SF) and that caused by different spreading factors (inter-SF) during task offloading. Furthermore, we derive precise and approximated expressions of the computation offloading success probabilities for the proposed network, which are then verified by simulations. This is followed by the analysis of the impact of the power control on the network performance of the proposed network. The results reveal that power control can considerably improve the performance in the low-density EDs scenario, as well as slightly improve in the high-density EDs scenario. Finally, we investigate the performance of the proposed network by comparing three SF allocation schemes-namely, exponential windowing (EW), equal-interval-based (EIB), and equal-area-based (EAB) schemes. The results reveal that we can improve the performance by assigning a lower SF for a large number of EDs.},

Simultaneously, within intelligent transportation systems, the limited computing resources of vehicle users themselves fail to meet the computational demands of various new applications. Therefore, addressing the ever-increasing computational demands of vehicles is an urgent problem that needs resolution. Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) equipped with edge computing servers leverage their advantages of flexible deployment and high maneuverability to promptly alleviate issues such as high latency and narrow bandwidth associated with processing remote data in cloud computing. This paper focuses on the scenario of UAV-assisted vehicle platooning, conducting research on task offloading and resource allocation mechanisms within UAV-assisted vehicle platooning systems. We construct a joint optimization problem for decision-making on task offloading, transmission power allocation, and CPU computing frequency allocation in UAV-assisted vehicle platooning systems. The objective is to minimize system energy consumption while ensuring the stability of the task computation queue. Since the formulated joint optimization problem is a mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem, we decompose it into two sub-problems and simultaneously transform them into Markov decision processes. Subsequently, we proposed a continuous optimization algorithm based on Block Coordinate Descent (BCD) and deep deterministic policy gradient(DDPG). Simulation results validate the effectiveness of this method, demonstrating comparatively low energy consumption under different network environments and parameter settings.},

  abstract     = {In modern transportation systems, vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) provide a solid foundation for improving public transportation. To efficiently realize real-time and secure vehicle communication systems, many certificateless signcryption (CLSC) schemes are proposed in VANETs. However, existing relevant CLSC schemes still have security or efficiency drawbacks. In this paper, we first cryptanalyze Xie et al.’s CLSC scheme (IEEE Trans. Veh. Technol., vol. 72, no. 5, pp. 5642-5653, May. 2023) and demonstrate its vulnerability under public key replacement attacks. Then, we propose a pairing-free CLSC scheme for edge computing-based VANETs, with its security proven in the random oracle model. Our CLSC scheme not only achieves confidentiality and unforgeability in a single logical step, but also avoids costly certificate management and key escrow problems. Meanwhile, our construction leverages online/offline signature (OOS) and batch verification techniques, which significantly reduces communication time-delay and computational overhead. Moreover, our deployment resists multiple prevalent attacks in VANETs, including but not limited to collusion attacks and man-in-the-middle attacks, and provides pseudonym-based conditional privacy for vehicles. Finally, performance results show that our CLSC scheme outperforms existing ones, making it highly practical for VANETs.},

Contemporary research predominantly centers on crafting cooperative scheduling algorithms tailored for vehicular networks. Notwithstanding, the intricacies of orchestrating scheduling in vehicular social networks both effectively and efficiently remain a formidable task. This paper introduces an innovative learning-based algorithm for scheduling data transmission that prioritizes efficiency and security within vehicular social networks. The algorithm first uses a specifically constructed neural network to enhance data processing capabilities. After this, it incorporates a Q-learning paradigm during the data transmission phase to optimize the information exchange, the privacy of which is safeguarded by differential privacy through the communication process.

  abstract     = {Ensuring smooth mobility management while employing directional beamformed transmissions in 5G millimeter-wave networks calls for robust and accurate user equipment (UE) localization and tracking. In this article, we develop neural network-based positioning models with time- and frequency-domain channel state information (CSI) data in harsh non-line-of-sight (NLoS) conditions. We propose a novel frequency-domain feature extraction, which combines relative phase differences and received powers across resource blocks, and offers robust performance and reliability. Additionally, we exploit the multipath components and propose an aggregate time-domain feature combining time-of-flight, angle-of-arrival and received path-wise powers. Importantly, the temporal correlations are also harnessed in the form of sequence processing neural networks, which prove to be of particular benefit for vehicular UEs. Realistic numerical evaluations in large-scale line-of-sight (LoS)-obstructed urban environment with moving vehicles are provided, building on full ray-tracing based propagation modeling. The results show the robustness of the proposed CSI features in terms of positioning accuracy, and that the proposed models reliably localize UEs even in the absence of a LoS path, clearly outperforming the state-of-the-art with similar or even reduced processing complexity. The proposed sequence-based neural network model is capable of tracking the UE position, speed and heading simultaneously despite the strong uncertainties in the CSI measurements. Finally, it is shown that differences between the training and online inference environments can be efficiently addressed and alleviated through transfer learning.},

  abstract     = {Federated Learning (FL) is a distributed machine learning approach that allows multiple parties to collaboratively train a model without sharing raw data, thus protecting data privacy. With the rapid development of smart vehicles, vehicular edge federated learning (VEFL) has been proposed to leverage the abundant resources in the edge network. However, VEFL poses brand new challenges: 1) Data collected from different geographical regions exhibit heterogeneous statistical distributions, creating non-iid data in both time and space domains, severely downgrading the performance of FL models; 2) Mobility exacerbates the impact of statistical heterogeneity, demanding a higher convergence speed for FL training; 3) Limited but heterogeneous computation, communication, and storage configuration of vehicles hinder the efficient training. Despite existing works on adaptations for user mobility, few have addressed the statistical heterogeneity induced by mobility, which should be jointly accounted for delay-sensitive applications. Taking a data-centric approach, we propose an online training and application framework, namely, FedMG, which constructs multiple regional models, and dynamically adapts to diverse data distributions to mitigate the adverse effects of statistical heterogeneity. Moreover, based on the historical and predicted trajectories of vehicles, FedMG assigns corresponding training and application models to vehicles to adapt to real-time data streams, ensuring individual-level user experiences. Additionally, a sampling strategy is also designed based on mobility prediction and real-time resource status, which effectively speeds up the training process. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that FedMG achieves a much higher training efficiency and testing accuracy than classical FL solutions.},

  abstract     = {The sixth generation (6G) mobile communication system is expected to provide global seamless network coverages, where a satellite-ground integrated network (SGIN) is seen as one of the typical 6G networking paradigms. In this paper, a dynamic virtual network function (VNF) selection and chaining (DVSC) problem in an SGIN is investigated. We aim to balance the network resource provisioning and VNF migration costs with service performance gain to maximize the long-term network profit. Specifically, we formulate the DVSC problem as a Markov decision process (MDP), by taking into consideration the heterogeneity and time-varying nature of SGINs. A novel VNF selection and chaining scheme is proposed, where a deep Q-learning (DQL) algorithm is designed to dynamically determine a set of VNF selection and chaining policies (VSCPs) based on the evolving network states (e.g., network resources, network topology, and network traffic load). Furthermore, to elaborate the level of computing resource sharing of VSCP sets, a new sharing ratio (SR) is proposed. To efficiently allocate heterogeneous network resources, the action space is built by clustering the historical records of the network load and selecting the VSCP set for each cluster in a greedy manner. Extensive simulation results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework in comparison with the state-of-the-art schemes.},

Considering the stochastic packet arrivals from an MC user, we study three access schemes: orthogonal multiple access (OMA) with eMBB preemption (puncturing), non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA), and rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA), the latter two both with concurrent eMBB transmissions. Puncturing is found to reduce both average AoI and peak AoI (PAoI) violation probability but at the expense of decreased eMBB user rates and increased signaling complexity. Conversely, NOMA and RSMA offer higher eMBB rates but may lead to MC packet loss and AoI degradation. The paper systematically investigates the conditions under which NOMA or RSMA can closely match the average AoI and PAoI violation performance of puncturing while maintaining data rate gains. Closed-form expressions for average AoI and PAoI violation probability are derived, and conditions on the eMBB and MC channel gain difference with respect to the base station are analyzed. Additionally, optimal power and rate splitting factors in RSMA are determined to minimize MC outage probability. Notably, our results indicate that with a small loss in the average AoI and PAoI violation probability the eMBB rate in NOMA and RSMA can be approximately five times higher than that achieved through puncturing.},

For such a UAV trajectory-planning problem, how to timely collect data, avoid collisions with spatial obstacles, and complete DC with limited UAV onboard energy is a big challenge. To address this challenge, the investigated problem is formulated as an optimization problem aiming to minimize the UAV's total mission completion time subject to the time constraint of collected data, the avoidance of spatial obstacles, and the energy constraint of the UAV. To solve the formulated problem, the problem is decomposed into a visiting sequence optimization sub-problem, and a hovering position and flying path optimization sub-problem. Correspondingly, a genetic algorithm (GA) based algorithm, and a successive convex approximation (SCA) based algorithm are proposed to solve the sub-problems, respectively. Based on the two algorithms, a 3D trajectory optimization algorithm is further proposed to solve the main problem. Simulation results show that the UAV's trajectory planned with the proposed algorithm can effectively reduce the UAV's total mission completion time.},

  abstract     = {Low-altitude platform (LAP)-based aerial cells require frequent replacement due to periodic and aperiodic triggers, like low battery, variations in capacity demands, and mechanical malfunctions while in service. During a replacement event, the ongoing data sessions for all connected users should be transferred from the source LAP to the target LAP without interruptions. Protocols based on user handover and link management between the source and target LAPs are slow due to the overheads of signaling, causing a degradation in user data throughput during replacement. Recent literature on aerial cell cloning (ACC) proposes a much faster protocol by replicating link and location parameters from source to target LAP, but with the limitation that it is directly proportional to the number of user contexts. As a result, the latency and energy consumption for replacement are higher with increased users. Another recent scheme, dual active protocol stack (DAPS) handover, does not apply to aerial cell replacement scenarios due to high packet forwarding overhead. This paper, at the outset, proposes a novel low overhead aerial dual active protocol stack (aDAPS) handover with reduced packet forwarding, applicable to aerial cell replacement in ultra-reliability and low latency (URLLC) scenarios. Next, it proposes a novel adaptive aerial cell replacement (ACeR) mechanism. ACeR assists the network in selecting an appropriate session transfer protocol for each user based on predicted data traffic volume, traffic characteristics, and the trigger for the replacement. ACeR jointly optimizes the latency and energy optimality of the network. The system is modeled mathematically, and extensive system-level simulation results show that the proposed ACeR mechanism is efficient. ACeR reduces network energy consumption by up to 34.5% and around 14% to 18% on an average compared to the fixed protocol used during replacement in the available literature.},

Cache-aided STNs are acknowledged as a promising paradigm for accelerating content delivery to users and alleviating the load of backhaul links. However, the dynamic nature of low earth orbit (LEO) satellites and the complex interference among satellite beams and terrestrial base stations pose challenges in effectively managing limited edge resources. To address these issues, this paper proposes a method for dynamically scheduling caching and communication resources, aiming to reduce network costs in terms of transmission power consumption and backhaul traffic, while meeting user QoS demands and resource constraints. We formulate a mixed timescale problem to jointly optimize cache placement, LEO satellite beam direction, and cooperative multicast beamforming among satellite beams and base stations. To tackle this intricate problem, we propose a two-stage solution framework, where the primary problem is decoupled into a short-term content delivery subproblem and a long-term cache placement subproblem. The former subproblem is solved by designing an alternating optimization approach with whale optimization and successive convex approximation methods according to the cache placement state, while cache content in STNs is updated using an iterative algorithm that utilizes historical information. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithms, showcasing their convergence and significantly reducing transmission power consumption and backhaul traffic by up to 52%.},

  abstract     = {Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RISs) have demonstrated significant potential in securing mmWave communication from potential eavesdropping by configuring reflecting elements to enhance signal strength at desired locations and create nulls at potential eavesdropping locations. Acquiring perfect channel information is crucial for optimizing RIS configuration; however, obtaining such information is costly and, as a result, should be performed sparingly. This work explores the impact of the age of channel information on secrecy performance when a RIS-assisted mmWave network operates under statistical quality-of-service (QoS) constraints. Specifically, we optimize the QoS performance of a RIS-assisted mmWave network given only outdated channel estimates. To this end, we propose a technique for the joint optimization of transmit beamforming and RIS configuration, along with a closed-form solution for the optimal transmit power control policy. We investigate the impact of channel aging on the performance of these techniques. In our Monte-Carlo simulations, we first identify the factors influencing the aging process of a RIS-assisted mmWave channel in both the near and far fields of the RIS. Subsequently, we examine the impact of channel aging on secrecy capacity and demonstrate that adequate secrecy capacity can still be achieved even when channel information is outdated, reducing the need for frequent RIS configuration. Moreover, our optimal power control policy results reveal that operating in a high SNR regime does not necessarily increase the achievable effective secrecy capacity when the system operates under stricter QoS constraints. This finding allows system designers to adopt a more pragmatic system design approach that consumes less energy while maintaining the required QoS and secrecy performance.},

Analytical and simulation results show that the proposed NSMS decoder can achieve better performance than the state-of-the-art counterparts in terms of convergence speed, error rate and computational complexity.},

  abstract     = {Internet of vehicles (IoVs) will require massive high data rate connections with the base station (BS) to provide promising vehicular entertainment services, such as autonomous driving and traffic management. However, vehicles often encounter obstruction from buildings while traveling in urban areas, resulting in blocked direct links between the BS and the vehicle, thereby impacting the channel quality of vehicular links. To enhance the channel capacity of the IoV, reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) technology is introduced to assist vehicular networking scenarios in improving the signal propagation environment. Firstly, considering the maximum transmit power budget of the BS and the phase shift constraints of the RIS, we formulate a non-convex optimization problem to maximize the channel capacity of the vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) links by jointly designing the active beamforming at the BS and the passive beamforming matrix at the RIS. Then, we propose a RIS-assisted unsupervised beamforming (RAUB) algorithm with a two-phase transformer network architecture to design the active beamforming and the reflection phase shift. By utilizing the global feature extraction ability of the transformer network model in the two-phase network architecture, the learning performance of the network is further improved. Simulation results demonstrate that compared with the traditional block coordinate descent (BCD) algorithm based on alternating iterative optimization, the proposed RAUB algorithm can achieve comparable performance for the sum V2I capacity with lower computational complexity and better convergence performance.},

The ESC serves as a crucial metric for evaluating the influence of delay on the performance of secure communication. Specifically, we consider a multi-user downlink RIS-NOMA network that includes an internal eavesdropper and provide an analytical framework for the ESC. In the special case with two users, both the accurate expression and the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) asymptotic expression of the ESC are derived. The analytical results are corroborated by simulations, leading to several insightful conclusions: 1) the ESC tends to be a constant value in the high SNR region; 2) the RIS-NOMA network achieves higher ESC than the RIS-orthogonal multiple access counterpart; 3) strict latency constraints lead to smaller ESC, while more lenient constraints allow for greater ESC; 4) increasing the power allocation coefficient of the user and the number of RIS elements improves the ESC.},

This paper investigates the secure downlink transmission for an HAP network, where one unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) jammer is utilized against multiple mobile eavesdroppers (Eves) with imperfect location information. We aim to maximize the minimum average secrecy rate (MASR) by jointly optimizing subcarrier scheduling, subcarrier power allocation, UAV trajectory and HAP deployment. To address the formulated mixed-integer non-convex optimization problem, we first derive the optimal HAP deployment and utilize an estimation error model to resolve the locational uncertainty of the Eves. Subsequently, a low-complexity iterative algorithm is proposed, which decomposes the problem into three manageable subproblems and iteratively solves them to obtain a near-optimal solution. The convergence and complexity of the algorithm are further analyzed. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed scheme significantly improves not only the MASR but also the fairness between terminal devices, which outperforms the baselines without resource allocation and/or trajectory optimization.},

  abstract     = {Vehicular communications have become essential for functional and road safety purposes due to the development of vehicle fleets. However, these communications have made vehicles more vulnerable to cyber-attacks. The security of data exchanges in vehicular networks currently relies on a centralized architecture that is responsible for managing various security services such as authentication, confidentiality, non-repudiation, real-time misbehavior detection, certificate management and revocation. However, this centralized approach can be challenging and costly for authorities, and it may even weaken the network's overall security. In this paper, we propose a complementary solution that uses a decentralized security framework to help authorities better manage their network security by involving each vehicle in the overall security management. Our framework, TileChain, is blockchain based solution that use road information to manage the network's security dynamically. The architecture is designed to optimize any security service efficiently. To demonstrate the feasibility and performance of our proposed solution, we selected certificate revocation as a critical service and performed simulations using real vehicle traffic data provided by The French road operator DIR Nord. Our Smart Contract achieved an accuracy of 81.3% in misbehavior detection, leading to certificate revocation. Furthermore, the computation load for security management by authorities potentially reduced by a factor of 96.8%. In summary, our proposed solution, TileChain, offers a promising decentralized approach for managing vehicular network security that can potentially improve the overall security of the network while reducing the computational burden on authorities.},

External attackers and illegitimate data circulations are thwarted primarily through secure sharing and access controls.

This article provides an augmenting security approach for handling multi-vehicle resource access requests and sharing. The approach named as Dynamic Secure Multi-Access Scheme (DSMAS) that formulates access policies with amendments from the interacting infrastructure units. The amendments are identified from the resource access span and access success ratio observed in a series of intervals. Support vectors play a crucial role in the amendment decision-making process by effectively mitigating the risks associated with incorrect and delayed accesses. The intervals during which access is provided to vehicles are secured by the utilization of two-factor authentication keys for a specified period. In this process, the key validity relies on the interval time for which the access is granted. The dynamic nature of the system enables the adaptation of connection handovers and resource availability to comply with the access policies of the cloud infrastructure. The efficacy of the proposed scheme is assessed by the evaluation of access time, success rate, authentication time, and disconnection ratio, revealing its superiority over existing approaches.},

To address these limitations, we present AutoSense, the first mobility mode detection system to provide high accuracy using signals from the serving tower only while being robust to phone placement variations. AutoSense proposes a novel domain-specific deep learning-based model to perform automatic feature extraction and temporal processing, improving mode estimation accuracy compared to available solutions. Furthermore, AutoSense integrates a denoising autoencoder into its model to learn salient features robust to changing phone placements. As part of its design, AutoSense addresses several challenges, including cellular data sparsity, absence of motion information, and information decay in long-term dependencies. We conduct extensive evaluations using a real-world public dataset comprising different phone placements. Our results show that AutoSense significantly outperforms state-of-the-art systems, achieving up to 20% and 19% higher average precision and recall, respectively. In addition, AutoSense exhibits remarkable resilience to unseen placements, giving up to 60% better robustness on average compared to the state-of-the-art.},

To achieve this objective, a state-space model is developed, capable of accommodating any information flow topology and any number of vehicles within the platoon. To estimate the internal states of each vehicle, an Unknown Input Observer (UIO) is proposed.

Furthermore, an Identification UIO is designed to identify compromised parameters of the attacked vehicle and mitigate the attacks by replacing the compromised parameters with their estimated authentic values.

Routing design in FANET is a major challenge due to its inherent characteristics, including dynamic network topology and network self-organization. Coding-aware routing based on network coding improves the performance of the network by selecting paths with more coding opportunities. However, current methods are mostly used in networks with relatively fixed topologies, which are difficult to adapt to the FANET environment. To address these issues, we propose an adaptive coding-aware routing algorithm via deep reinforcement learning (DRL-AdCAR). First, we transform the routing problem into a Markov decision model. Then, coding opportunities, coding gains, and link quality are considered simultaneously in the reward function to avoid the drawbacks of coding-aware routing algorithms that simply aim to increase coding opportunities while greatly affecting other aspects of network performance. In addition, we present an improvement of the deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithm for FANET, combining the gated recurrent unit (GRU) and long short-term memory networks (LSTM) algorithms to replace the traditional neural network structure, which ensures prediction accuracy and improves the training efficiency. The experimental results showed that DRL-AdCAR can adaptively select the transmission paths with the most suitable coding opportunities according to environmental changes in FANET, improving coding performance and enhancing the network throughput and packet delivery rate.},

Under the transmission power constraints, the secrecy data rate is maximally improved by the joint optimization of bandwidth allocation and transmission power. To get the optimal ant-jamming response policy, a decision making of the bandwidth allocation and transmission power is formalized as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) optimization.

Initially, we propose a cooperative coded caching scheme which utilizes cooperation between fog access points (F-APs) to facilitate efficient multicasting. In this scheme, to achieve a higher caching gain, we design the tiered placement strategy; to reduce the multicasting gain losses as well as the delay and energy costs of multicasting, we propose the differential encoding based delivery strategy. Moreover, in order to better fully utilize the edge-computing capabilities of F-RANs, neighboring F-APs are clustered to enable multiple F-APs to utilize the mixed caching scheme to collaboratively serve one user, thereby leveraging the potential gains in the physical layer cooperation. The inter-cluster cooperative coded caching scheme and the inner-cluster mixed caching scheme compose the comprehensive caching scheme that is analyzed and optimized in terms of delay and energy efficiency (EE). Simulation results show that our proposed cooperative coded caching scheme can provide up to 46% savings in the transmission cost compared to the conventional group-based coded caching scheme, and the comprehensive caching scheme can achieve significant flexibility in delay-sensitive and EE-sensitive scenarios.},

  abstract     = {The integrity and reliability of the positioning information are crucial for applications, including safety-critical ones, that rely on cellular network users' locations. Release 18 of the Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) broadens the notion of integrity, which was initially applied only to positioning based on Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS), to include positioning based on Radio Access Technology (RAT). This paper presents a general 3GPP-compliant framework to assess 5G positioning integrity. The framework is based on uncertainty quantification and is applied to classical time-difference-of-arrival positioning algorithms and to more advanced positioning methods that rely on machine learning. If an integrity alert is raised, error mitigation techniques are also proposed to enable resilient positioning through the selection of reliable network nodes. Results obtained by using a 3GPP-compliant dataset of position estimates in an indoor open-office scenario demonstrate promising detection and resilience capabilities in the presence of integrity breaches.},

  abstract     = {The Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication, as the fundamental part of intelligent transport system, has the potential to increase road safety and traffic efficiency. However, conventional static infrastructures like roadside units (RSUs) often encounter overload issues due to the uneven spatiotemporal distribution of vehicles. Although the line-of-sight (LoS) propagation characteristics and high mobility of autonomois aerial vehicles (AAVs) have brought about UAV-assisted vehicular communication. The scarce spectrum resources, complex interference, restricted energy budgets, and the mobility of automobiles still pose significant challenges. In this paper, we combine mean-field game (MFG) theory with multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) to allocate resources for RSUs and UAVs in non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) V2X communication networks. To find rational and reasonable global solutions for infrastructures under power and QoS constraints, a joint sub-band scheduling and transmit power allocation problem is addressed. The MARL technique is utilized to endow agents with the capability of self-learning. MFG theory is employed to tackle the tremendous overhead in agent interactions. The integration of MFG and MARL enables infrastructures to act as agents, engaging in mutual interactions and considering the impact of the surrounding environment, to achieve maximum global energy efficiency. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of UAV-assisted V2X communication and prove that the proposed method outperforms a state-of-the-art resource allocation scheme in both average energy efficiency and probability of failure.},

They offer advantages such as low cost, low energy consumption, and compliance with green communication requirements. However, the static deployment of IRS restricts the network's ability to adapt to emergency coverage requirements and dynamic environments. To address this issue, we propose a flexible IRS-aided cell-free network, where network capacity and signal coverage are substantially improved by utilizing reflected signals from an aerial IRS. Our objective is to maximize the weighted transmission rate for users by jointly optimizing the active beamforming of the base stations (BSs), passive beamforming of the IRS, and the location of the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). Due to the non-convex and intractable nature of this problem, we decompose it into three subproblems. For the optimization problems of BSs' active beamforming and IRS's passive beamforming, we transform the log-sum problem into a quadratically constrained quadratic programming (QCQP) problem by employing the lagrangian dual principle and multi-ratio fractional programming. Furthermore, for the more challenging location optimization, we further transform it into a convex problem using the successive convex approximation (SCA) technique to obtain a high-quality suboptimal solution. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme can significantly improve the weighted transmission rate and effectively enhance the network coverage as compared to other benchmarks.},

Although passive reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) has emerged as a promising technology for enhancing the EE of the ISAC system, the multiplicative fading feature hinders its effectiveness. This paper proposes the use of active RIS with its amplification gains to assist the ISAC system for EE improvement. Specifically, we formulate an EE optimization problem in an active RIS-aided ISAC system under system power budgets, considering constraints on user communication quality of service and sensing signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). A novel alternating optimization algorithm is developed to address the highly non-convex problem by employing the generalized Rayleigh quotient optimization, semidefinite relaxation (SDR), and the majorization-minimization (MM) framework. Furthermore, to reduce computational complexity, we derive a semi-closed form for eigenvalue determination.

  abstract     = {Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) enhances signal quality by adjusting the phase of electromagnetic waves in wireless communication. Spatial modulation (SM), a prominent index modulation (IM) technique, provides high spectral efficiency and low energy consumption. In this article, a new wireless communication system is proposed by combining capacity-optimized antenna selection (COAS), antenna correlation antenna selection (ACAS), and Euclidean distance-optimized antenna selection (EDAS)-supported RIS-empowered receive SM (RIS-RSM) system (AS-RIS-RSM) in a single-input multiple-output (SIMO) structure. The proposed AS-RIS-RSM schemes (COAS-RIS-RSM, ACAS-RIS-RSM, and EDAS-RIS-RSM) provide better error performance compared to the traditional RIS-RSM system. Also, they offer higher spectral and energy efficiency compared to traditional wireless communication systems without IM. Integrating COAS, ACAS, and EDAS techniques into the system enables the selection of the channel with the best conditions, thus increasing the error performance of the proposed system. Also, using RIS increases the error performance of the system by controlling the transmitted signal to a certain extent. The analytical average bit error rate results of the proposed AS-RIS-RSM systems are derived and shown to overlap with simulation results. For the proposed systems, an optimal maximum likelihood (ML) detector and a sub-optimal low-complexity greedy detector (GD) are offered. Also, capacity analyses of the proposed AS-RIS-RSM systems are derived and it is observed that they have higher capacity compared to RIS-QAM/PSK and RIS-RSM systems. Then, computational complexity analyses of the proposed COAS-RIS-RSM, ACAS-RIS-RSM, and EDAS-RIS-RSM systems are presented. Moreover, the impact of imperfect channel state information on the error performance of the proposed AS-RIS-RSM systems is investigated, and throughput analysis is performed. The proposed systems have been compared to counterpart wireless communication systems including RIS-RSM, RIS-QAM, and RIS-PSK under equivalent conditions, demonstrating that the proposed systems achieve better error performance.},

  abstract     = {Scalability presents a formidable challenge in traditional Cell-Free (CF) massive Multiple Input Multiple Output (mMIMO) networks, driven by escalating computational demands on access points (APs) and the reliance on a single central processing unit (CPU). To address this, the study proposes a dynamic cooperative clustering (DCC) method, tailored for both backhaul (CPUs-APs) and fronthaul (APs-Users). In the backhaul phase, DCC strategically pairs APs with CPUs using the Kuhn-Munkres algorithm, ensuring equitable resource allocation by considering distance matrices, channel statistics, APs traffic load, and available CPU resources, thereby fairly balancing the distribution of computational load across the CPUs. Subsequently, in the fronthaul phase, the focus is on optimizing the selection of APs for user-centric clusters, using Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). This optimization aims to maximize the overall sum rate while intelligently managing the inclusion and exclusion of APs within each user-serving cluster. Through extensive simulations, the study highlights the potential of the proposed approach to address scalability concerns in CF-massive MIMO systems, promising improved performance in wireless communication networks. The comparative analysis demonstrates the superiority of the proposed scheme over conventional clustering schemes, consistently delivering better sum rates across various scenarios, with an 18.23% improvement in sum rate and a 30% enhancement in Load Balancing Index (LBI), indicating significantly improved resource distribution and network efficiency.},

  abstract     = {In a massive machine-type communication (mMTC) scenario, there are large number of devices that may establish links to receivers, which causes a great burden to the system for signaling overhead, thereby reducing the communication efficiency. One potential approach involves refraining from assigning signaling overhead to users, with active users opportunistically transmitting data messages within time slots. The receiver only needs to recover these independent data messages without identifying the source of these messages, named unsourced random access (URA). In this paper, suitable URA schemes are proposed for cellular massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) and cell-free massive MIMO systems. In the cellular scenario, the system completes the transmission and estimation of the number of active users and the corresponding channel large-scale fading coefficients (LSFCs) in stage one. Utilizing the channel information obtained in stage one, the receiver in stage two applies the sparse-correction-based bilinear generalized approximate message passing (SCB-BiG-AMP) algorithm proposed in this paper to restore the original data sequences sent by active users. In a cell-free scenario, active users won't transmit LSFC information similar to that in stage one of cellular scenario for the properties of massive distributed antennas. Instead, the central limit theorem (CLT) is used to estimate the average channel LSFC of all active users, which is substituted into the SCB-BiG-AMP algorithm as the equivalent channel variance. Then, the original data sequences sent by active users can be restored. According to the simulation results, the proposed URA communication scheme can achieve good bit error performance. Moreover, as a result of the small uplink user-AP distance, the system performance in the cell-free scenario is much better than that in the cellular scenario.},

Unlike prior works that focused mainly on a single type of jamming attack (e.g. RF jamming), our proposed plan can protect the entire network against multiple types of jamming at the same time. We formulate a joint optimization problem of power allocation (PA) and Field-of-View (FoV) tuning strategy to maximize the RF uplink sum rate, subject to capacity and security constraints for both FSO and RF systems. To address this non-convex optimization problem, at first, we derive a closed-form expression of the optimal FoV angle. Then, the optimal FoV angle solution is computed to solve the PA problem. Since the PA problem has a non-convex form, we use an advanced technique of first-order Taylor approximation with the difference of convex functions method to solve it. The obtained solution of the optimization problem is then used for training a machine learning model that optimizes the system in real-time. Based on the Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning (MADRL) method, we develop a MADRL-based jamming alleviation algorithm to obtain the optimized solution of PA in near real-time. The numerical results show that the performance of the proposed MADRL-based jamming alleviation algorithm with low computational complexity is close to that of the optimization method.},

  abstract     = {Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) is a promising waveform candidate for future joint sensing and communication systems. It is well known that the OFDM waveform is vulnerable to in-phase and quadrature-phase (IQ) imbalance, which increases the noise floor in a range-Doppler map (RDM). A state-of-the-art method for robustifying the OFDM waveform against IQ imbalance avoids an increased noise floor, but it generates additional ghost objects in the RDM (Bourdoux et al., 2018). A consequence of these additional ghost objects is a reduction of the maximum unambiguous range. In this work, a novel OFDM-based waveform robust to IQ imbalance is proposed, which neither increases the noise floor nor reduces the maximum unambiguous range. The latter is achieved by shifting the ghost objects in the RDM to different velocities such that their range variations observed over several consecutive RDMs do not correspond to the observed velocity. This allows tracking algorithms to identify them as ghost objects and eliminate them for the follow-up processing steps. Moreover, we propose complete communication systems for both, the proposed waveform as well as for the state-of-the-art waveform, including methods for channel estimation, synchronization, and data estimation that are specifically designed to deal with frequency selective IQ imbalance. The effectiveness of these communication systems is demonstrated through bit error ratio (BER) simulations.},

  abstract     = {Digital twin (DT) technology has a high potential to satisfy different requirements of the ever-expanding new applications. Nonetheless, the DT placement in wireless digital twin networks (WDTNs) poses a significant challenge due to the conflict between unpredictable workloads and the limited capacity of edge servers. In other words, each edge server has a risk of overload when handling an excessive number of tasks or services. Overload risks can have detrimental effects on a network's sustainability, yet this aspect is often overlooked in the literature. In this paper, we aim to study the sustainability-aware DT placement problem for WDTNs from a cost minimization perspective. To this end, we formulate the DT placement-driven cost optimization problem as a chance-constrained integer programming problem. For tractability, we transform the original non-deterministic problem into a deterministic integer linear programming (ILP) problem using the sample average approximation (SAA) approach. We prove that the transformed problem remains NP-hard and thus finding a global optimal solution is very difficult. To strike a balance between time efficiency and performance guarantee, we propose an improved local search algorithm for this ILP by identifying high-quality starting states from historical search data and enhancing the search process. Numerical results show a lower cost and higher efficiency of our proposed method compared with the previous schemes.},

  abstract     = {This paper focuses on moving source localization using frequency difference of arrival (FDOA) measurements from multiple spatially distributed sensors. Two methods are proposed to address the high nonlinearity in the FDOA equations, namely, the two-step weighted least squares (TSWLS) method and the semidefinite relaxation (SDR) method. The FDOA equations are pseudo-linearized first in both methods. The TSWLS method has a closed-form solution and is efficient for small noise conditions. It obtains a coarse estimate of the unknowns in its first step and then refines them using the first-order perturbation analysis in the second step. On the other hand, the SDR method has good noise tolerance. It constructs a constrained problem according to the relations among all variables and then applies the SDR technique to solve the resultant non-convex optimization problem. Theoretical analysis validates that the proposed TSWLS method can reach the Cramér-Rao lower bound (CRLB) at small noise levels. The simulation results demonstrate the performance of the proposed algorithms.},

  abstract     = {This paper investigates the long-term average age of information (AoI)-minimal problem in an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted wireless-powered communication network (WPCN), which consists of a static hybrid access point (HAP), a mobile UAV, and many static sensor nodes (SNs) randomly distributed on multiple islands. The UAV first is fully charged by the HAP, and then flies to each island to charge SNs and receive data from them. Before running out the energy in battery, the UAV flies back to the HAP to offload the received data and be fully charged again. Due to the finite battery capacity of the UAV, it is impossible for the UAV to traverse all the islands to collect all the data from SNs for once flight. We are thus inspired to divide islands into multiple clusters so that the UAV could traverse all the islands in each cluster, and formulate the long-term average AoI-minimal problem by jointly optimizing the transmit power of SNs, clustering of islands, and UAV's flight trajectory. To tackle the NP-hard problem, we decouple it into two subproblems: the power allocation subproblem for SNs, and the joint clustering of islands and UAV's flight trajectory design subproblem. To solve the first subproblem, we propose a hybrid TDMA and NOMA (HTN) protocol that takes advantage of the two protocols. To solve the second subproblem, we propose a clustering-based dynamic adjustment of the shortest path (C-DASP) algorithm. Simulations verify the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed HTN protocol and C-DASP algorithm.},

However, the extensive transmission of video data in IoVT poses challenges in terms of delay and power consumption. Intelligent reconfigurable surface (IRS), as an emerging technology, can enhance communication quality and consequently improve system performance by reconfiguring wireless propagation environments. Inspired by this, we propose a multi-IRS aided IoVT system that leverages IRS to enhance communication quality, thereby reducing power consumption while satisfying delay requirements. To fully leverage the benefits of IRS, we jointly optimize power control for IoVT devices and passive beamforming for IRS to minimize long-term total power consumption under delay constraints. To solve this problem, we first utilize Lyapunov optimization to decouple the long-term optimization problem into each time slot. Subsequently, an alternating optimization algorithm employing successive convex approximation and fractional programming is proposed to solve the optimization problems at each time slot. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms benchmark algorithms in terms of long-term total power consumption. Moreover, a trade-off between the number of IRS elements and system performance is also proved.},

In these applications, differentiating and estimating the position of ground Radio Frequency (RF) emitters is pivotal. In order to achieve this, we define an experimental setup based on Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) collected by a single UAV at different points of a predefined trajectory. The experimental setup is evaluated for the two unlicensed frequency bands of $\mathbf {2.4}\,$GHz and $\mathbf {865}\,$MHz with and without interference, respectively. We show that the application of the maximum likelihood algorithm to the RSSI measures collected in experiments conducted in rural areas gives a mean absolute localization error of about $5\,$m and $4\,$ m for a single transmitter with and without interference, respectively. A threshold-based technique is proposed to improve the accuracy in the presence of interference. For multiple transmitters, the RSSI data are divided into clusters and fed into a localization algorithm. A k-means clustering algorithm eliminates user intervention and identifies the number of RF emitters in the area. As a further contribution of the paper, we performed a validation phase where the UAV flight path and data collection are simulated using the QuaDRiGa realistic radio impulse channel model.},

As vehicles act as workers in many traffic-oriented crowdsourcing systems, there's a growing focus on how to get high-quality reports when some vehicles may be malicious or selfish. Some researchers assign reputation values to vehicles and select high-reputation vehicles to complete tasks, but these efforts still have shortcomings. In model design, guaranteeing the objectivity of reputation calculation, suppressing malicious and selfish behaviors, and maximizing the utilities of honest vehicles and service providers should be considered simultaneously. In system construction, reputation verification service in multi-party intelligent transportation scenarios and reputation management system performance should be satisfied. In this paper, we propose $\mathcal {R}$-manager, a consortium blockchain-based vehicle reputation management scheme. Firstly, we design a reputation model that uses confirmed results to update reputation and suppress malicious and selfish behaviors based on reputation deposit forfeit and a tax mechanism. Besides, the model maximizes the utilities of crowdsourcing participants by reaching the game equilibrium. Secondly, we design a reputation management system based on a consortium blockchain to abstract management activities as transactions and verify them by executing smart contracts, which meet multi-party management and reputation verification needs. Moreover, we design a half-committee endorsement strategy to improve system performance. Finally, our model is verified by simulation, and it can better suppress malicious and selfish behaviors compared with three different reputation models. We implement a prototype system and evaluate its performance. $\mathcal {R}$-manager outperforms two state-of-the-art blockchain-based schemes.},

In the considered system, legitimate users (LUs) aim to transmit secret signals under the threat of eavesdroppers (EVs). There exists TCUs rationally selecting to form coalitions with LUs or EVs, strategically enhancing the secrecy transmission rates for LUs or increasing eavesdropping rates for EVs to obtain rewards. Due to the unpredictability of wireless systems (e.g., time-varying channel conditions, user mobility), coalitions among the three parties may be unfixed and dynamically changing. A hierarchical game integrating a matching subgame with a coalition formation subgame is formulated to model the interactions among LUs, EVs, and TCUs. In order to derive the optimal long-term strategies while solving the equilibrium of the hierarchical game, we first introduce a constrained Gale-Shapley algorithm which determines the optimal power, mode, and channel selections of TCUs with the known coalition partition, and then propose a coalition selection algorithm for reaching the stability of coalition partitions. Moreover, we develop a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based solution to concatenate the aforementioned algorithms, producing the long-term optimal strategies for LUs, EVs and TCUs over multiple time slots.

Millimeter wave (mmWave) communication, known for its large bandwidth is an effective way to address performance bottlenecks in cellular network based HST wireless communication systems. However, mmWave signals suffer from significant path loss when traversing carriage, posing substantial challenges to cellular networks. To address this issue, reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) have gained considerable interest for its ability to enhance cell coverage by reflecting signals toward receiver. Ensuring communication reliability, a core performance indicators of ultra-reliable and low-latency communications (URLLC) in fifth-generation systems, is crucial for providing steady and reliable data transmissions along railways, particularly for delivering safety and control messages and monitoring HST signaling information. In this paper, we investigate a refracting RIS-assisted multi-user multiple-input single-output URLLC system in mmWave HST communications. We propose a sum rate maximization problem, subject to base station beamforming constraint, as well as refracting RIS discrete phase shifts and reliability constraints. To solve this optimization problem, we design a joint optimization algorithm based on alternating optimization method. This involves decoupling the original optimization problem into active beamforming design and packet error probability optimization subproblem, and discrete phase shift design subproblems. These subproblems are addressed exploiting Lagrangian dual method and the local search method, respectively. Simulation results demonstrate the fast convergence of the proposed algorithm and highlight the benefits of refracting RIS adoption for sum rate improvement in mmWave HST networks.},

  abstract     = {In-Band Full Duplex (IBFD) communication in wireless networks is one of the promising technology to improve the spectral efficiency. Due to practical hardware limitations in IBFD to cancel the self interference, only base stations (BSs) are capable of Full Duplex (FD) communication while users remains Half Duplex (HD). Thus, only one user is capable to use the subcarrier for uplink (UL) while the other can use it for downlink (DL), resulting in intracell interference between UL and DL user. However, in case of multicell cellular system, by assigning same subcarrier to UL, DL communication results in Inter Cell Interference (ICI). In this paper, we form a subcarrier and power allocation problem in a multicell full duplex OFDMA cellular system which is non convex and very difficult to solve. In case of single cell systems, we provide an approach for subcarrier allocation by using the Hungarian Algorithm (HA) and then with a low-complexity subcarrier assignment scheme. Later, we employ the concepts of cell sectorization, and frequency reuse (FR) to address the proposed subcarrier and power allocation problem for multicell wireless networks to minimize the ICI on each transmission that should maximize the over all sum rate performance in a multicell system. Our numerical results for a single cell reveal that the suggested algorithms outperform the currently used techniques, while in a multicell the suggested subcarrier allocation algorithms perform better under various scenarios.},

  abstract     = {A novel asymmetrical massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system has recently emerged as a crucial solution for reducing hardware complexity and alleviating the data processing pressure. However, the absence of channel reciprocity in this system presents unique challenges when directly applying traditional channel estimation methods, inevitably leading to performance loss. Deep learning approaches hold promise for achieving improved channel estimation performance by implicitly learning channel features. Unfortunately, deep learning approaches are often designed empirically. It is critical to utilize prior knowledge to develop an efficient deep neural network (DNN), especially for wireless communication systems. This paper explores a knowledge-driven DNN design approach and introduces a deep learning-based channel estimation framework for asymmetrical transceivers. The channel estimation problem is decoupled into channel denoising and information inference problems. Two novel DNNs are proposed to eliminate noise and exploit correlative features for reconstructing the missing channel information, respectively. Extensive simulations demonstrate that our proposed channel estimation framework can significantly eliminate noise effects, even in low signal-to-noise ratio regimes, and outperform traditional estimators and other deep learning-based methods. Moreover, ablation studies also validate the effectiveness of our knowledge-driven network structure design approach.},

  abstract     = {Point cloud, as a 3D representation, finds wide applications in domains such as autonomous driving, virtual reality (VR), and augmented reality (AR). However, traditional communication systems are not well-suited for large-scale point cloud data transmissions, as such systems operate at the bit level without leveraging the inherent semantic information of the point cloud. This paper introduces a point cloud-based semantic communication system (PCSC) that leverages AI-based encoding techniques to extract semantic information from the point cloud. Furthermore, joint source-channel coding (JSCC) technology is employed to overcome noise channel distortion and address the “cliff effect” prevalent in traditional communication methods. Additionally, the proposed system achieves controllable coding rates without requiring extensive network fine-tuning. By analyzing the significance of the encoded semantic vector, the method discards semantically-unimportant information, enhancing transmission efficiency. Moreover, the PCSC is integrated with the recently proposed model division multiple access (MDMA) technology, resulting in a multi-user point cloud MDMA transmission system (M-PCSC). Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method surpasses traditional approaches by 10 dB under the PSNR D1 and PSNR D2 metrics while effectively mitigating the “cliff effect” in transmission.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents an optimization approach for cooperative Medium Access Control (MAC) techniques in Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks (VANETs) equipped with multiple Roadside Units (RSUs) to enhance network throughput. We propose a distributed cooperative MAC scheme based on the Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance (CSMA/CA) protocol. It integrates selective multi-RSUs probing and adaptive transmission, using a dual timescale channel access framework accounting for vehicle positions and channel fading. This framework divides the channel access into two phases: a large-scale phase that accounts for gradual changes in vehicle locations and a small-scale phase that adapts to rapid channel fluctuations. In each large-scale phase, we examine the MAC problem with a snapshot of vehicle locations, treating the multi-RSU VANET as a sequential planned decision process. We formulate the Multi-RSUs Probing and Cooperative Access (MRPCA) strategy, organized as a multi-stage approach with a multi-level threshold structure. We rigorously prove its optimality for maximizing average system throughput per large-scale phase using optimal sequential planned decision theory. We develop a distributed MAC algorithm with periodic location updates, adjusting thresholds based on inter-vehicle and vehicle-RSU distances in large-scale phases. In small-scale phases, multiple vehicles access channels following the MRPCA strategy with updated thresholds. Simulation results confirm the effectiveness and efficiency of our algorithm, offering insights into cooperative MAC in VANETs with multiple RSUs and practical implementation.},

  abstract     = {This work investigates the problem of simultaneously positioning and orientating (SPAO) the user equipment (UE) with reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted visible light communications (VLCs). In the proposed system model, the utilization of RISs effectively helps to address the SPAO problem of the UE in situations when there are insufficient light-emitting diode (LED) transmitters. Firstly, the channel gain between LED and UE and the one between RIS and UE are obtained through signal separation, followed by formulating an objective optimization function for the SPAO problem. A closed-form Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) is then derived, representing the theoretical lower limit of positioning and orientating errors. Consequently, using CRLB as a benchmark for the SPAO performance, a fuzzy distance-based particle swarm optimization (FDPSO) is proposed to minimize the deviations between SPAO estimation errors and CRLBs. The proposed FDPSO algorithm adaptively adjusts the parameters and mutation operations to balance local exploitation and global exploration. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed FDPSO algorithm achieves an asymptotic tightness with CRLB and performs better than the other five related iterative algorithms in terms of the cumulative distribution functions (CDFs) of positioning errors (PEs) and orientating errors (OEs).},

  abstract     = {In the last years, the number of applications for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) has increased. Among them, the possibility to deploy them as flying base stations, namely Unmanned Aerial Base Stations (UABSs), has attracted the attention of industry and researchers. The unmatched mobility of UAVs, together with the unique quality of air-to-ground radio links, allow a boost in the capacity and coverage of existing mobile networks. In this paper, the use of UABSs is studied to assist a terrestrial mobile network aiming at serving moving connected vehicles, denoted as Ground User Equipments (GUEs), implementing Vehicle-To-Anything (V2X) extended sensing applications. To this aim, techniques are presented to tackle two important problems: trajectory design for the UABS allowing for tracking GUEs moving in a complex urban scenario and the scheduling of radio resources used to serve them. The former is solved by leveraging a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithm, Double Dueling Deep Q-Network (3DQN), whereas the latter is modelled via Integer Linear Program (ILP). Since we assume radio resources are all shared among GUEs, Macro Base Stations (MBS) and the UABS, the positioning of the UABS deeply affects interference, that is the radio resource management (RRM) algorithm; therefore, the two problems must be considered and solved jointly, choosing the reward function of the DRL algorithm properly. Two different scenarios are addressed: a coverage limited and a capacity limited one. Performance metrics shown are both machine learning related, delivering the training outcome of the agent, and network related, such as the percentage of satisfied GUEs for different application requirements.},

  abstract     = {Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) and Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) communications play crucial roles in Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks (VANETs), enabling real-time data exchange and enhancing road safety. These communication methods necessitate robust authenticated key exchange (AKE) mechanisms to protect user privacy and prevent unauthorized access. Recent research has introduced lightweight V2I AKE schemes that operate without relying on complex asymmetric cryptography. These schemes offer advantages in terms of reduced computational overhead and minimal communication latency. However, their exclusive dependence on long-term secrets compromises forward secrecy, a critical security feature. In response, a novel multi-party V2I AKE protocol based on the ASCON cryptographic algorithm is proposed. Pre-shared keys between entities are dynamically updated at the end of each communication session, achieving forward secrecy while maintaining computational efficiency compared to existing solutions. Additionally, a cross-phase and dual-layer encryption strategy is employed to implement conditional privacy. Building upon this foundation, a fog-enabled and intra-group V2V AKE framework is proposed. Specifically, fog servers are introduced to manage vehicle grouping and distribute group keys. During the V2V AKE phase, fog servers encrypt and forward ephemeral secrets, ensuring resistance against the intra-group impersonation attack with minimal computational overhead. A comprehensive performance analysis of the proposed scheme demonstrates the superiority over existing solutions across various evaluation metrics.},

To obtain an efficient beam hopping and resource allocation policy for accommodating the stochastic traffic data arrival and the dynamic topology of NGSO satellites, we first formulate a stochastic optimization problem with the objective of minimizing the long-term system cost given the queue stability constraints. Due to the complicated coupling among decisions and the lack of future network state information, the formulated stochastic optimization problem cannot be directly solved. Therefore, we leverage Lyapunov optimization to transform the stochastic optimization problem into a deterministic one to minimize the system cost and the capacity-demand gap. Moreover, an online beam hopping and resource allocation algorithm is proposed to solve the deterministic problem, and thereby dynamically determining the beam hopping, bandwidth allocation, and power control solutions. The theoretical analysis shows that there is an $ [ {{\mathcal O}({{1 / V}}),{\mathcal O}(V)} ]$ trade-off between the system cost and the system data backlog with control parameter $V$. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can effectively match the non-uniform demands. Compared with the benchmarks, the proposed algorithm can effectively reduce the backlog of data queues and the energy consumption of satellites.},

The proposed scheme comprises simplifying and rounding operations, where the simplifying operation transforms the complex pilot assignment into an intuitive optimization problem. Similar to other schemes, the proposed simplifying operation transforms the pilot assignment into a max p-cut problem belonging to NP-hard using graph theory. However, due to the persistent challenges of the NP-hard problem, this paper further reduced the max p-cut to a tractable convex problem by adopting the semidefinite relaxation technique. Subsequently, the rounding process, including two rounding techniques, is designed to convert the optimal solution of the convex problem into a practical pilot assignment. The first stage rounding proposes a stochastic optimization technique that provides a reliable and efficient assignment, while the second stage uses a low-complexity reassignment to ensure the utilization of all planned pilots. We demonstrate that the proposed rounding process has a favorable approximation ratio while ensuring the usage constraint. Experimental results indicate advancements in the proposed scheme.},

We first explore a novel covert transmission strategy. Specifically, Alice exploits the channel uncertainties in Willie's links to hide Bob's wireless transmission. Obeying this, the minimum probability of detection error (PDE) of Willie is derived under the Saleh-Valenzuela channel fading. To gain more insight into Willie's signal detection, we extend the above work to another general Rayleigh channel fading, and the result shows that the minimum PDE is determined merely by the ratio of the power of the covert signal to that of the sensing signal, which is quite different from the one studied above. Furthermore, we propose a robust beamforming design in which the transmit beamforming at Alice and the transmission&reflection beamforming at STAR-RIS are jointly optimized to maximize the covert rate. To solve this highly non-convex problem, we use the S-procedure and general sign-definiteness to convert it into a tractable form, and then develop an effective overall iterative algorithm by invoking the successive convex approximation and penalty convex-concave procedure methods. Finally, numerical results confirm the covertness superiority of the studied network over baseline schemes.},

Addressing this, our research explores training a WIR network using multiple, distributed datasets that are constrained in size and challenging to share due to privacy concerns. We introduce a federated learning-based WIR method that trains multiple local networks and aggregates them for enhanced global optimization. This method contrasts with traditional centralized learning by only exchanging model weights between local clients and the server, significantly mitigating the risk of data leakage. To bolster the performance of local training with limited samples, we incorporate data augmentation and regularized training. Furthermore, we integrate a semi-random mechanism into the regularized training process, enabling a more comprehensive and effective feature learning from samples. Simulation results affirm that our proposed WIR method outperforms other advanced methods in recognition accuracy. Additionally, it confirms the semi-random mechanism's efficacy in improving training robustness and recognition accuracy, marking a significant advancement in DL-based WIR methodologies under constrained training conditions.},

To maximize the system throughput, we jointly optimize the three-dimensional (3D) trajectories of UAVs, the power allocation strategy, and the phase shift of the RIS.

Extensive simulations are conducted, and results demonstrate that: (1) the TM-TDPAPO algorithm is effective in improving the system throughput, especially, the proposed approach achieves approximately 57$\%$ higher throughput gain compared to the conventional DQN algorithm; (2) by applying the imperfect SIC at each UE, the proposed scheme yields 23$\%$ performance gain than orthogonal multiple access (OMA) case; (3) the considered system with the deployment of RIS benefits from 29$\%$ throughput gain over the system without RIS.},

  abstract     = {This paper studies issues that arise with respect to the joint optimization for convergence time in federated learning over wireless networks (FLOWN). We consider the criterion and protocol for selection of participating devices in FLOWN under the energy constraint and derive its impact on device selection. In order to improve the training efficiency, age-of-information (AoI) enables FLOWN to assess the freshness of gradient updates among participants. Aiming to speed up convergence, we jointly investigate global loss minimization and latency minimization in a Stackelberg game based framework. Specifically, we formulate global loss minimization as a leader-level problem for reducing the number of required rounds, and latency minimization as a follower-level problem to reduce time consumption of each round. By decoupling the follower-level problem into two sub-problems, including resource allocation and sub-channel assignment, we achieve an optimal strategy of the follower through monotonic optimization and matching theory. At the leader-level, we derive an upper bound of convergence rate and subsequently reformulate the global loss minimization problem and propose a new age-of-update (AoU) based device selection algorithm. Simulation results indicate the superior performance of the proposed AoU based device selection scheme in terms of the convergence rate, as well as efficient utilization of available sub-channels.},

  abstract     = {Ground networks are facing severe challenges posed by the conflict between the increasing number of terminals and limited coverage and network resources. The space-air-ground integrated network (SAGIN) is a promising solution due to its global coverage and multi-dimensional heterogeneous resources. In this paper, we investigate a scenario, where the terminals are served by networks in SAGIN with hybrid orthogonal multiple access (OMA)/non-OMA (NOMA) transmission. According to the network characteristics in SAGIN, such as communication link, movement, and communication resources, we build up an utility function. We further formulate the problem of joint hybrid OMA/NOMA mode selection and resource allocation to maximize the system utility. Due to the non-convexity of the formulated problem, we decompose the original problem into two subproblems, which can be solved by the successive convex approximation, Lagrange dual method, and deep Q-network (DQN) learning, respectively. Moreover, to guarantee the constraints, an efficient reward function is further designed in DQN. Finally, simulation results show that compared with the benchmark schemes, the proposed algorithm can achieve better performance in terms of the achievable sum rate, the average achievable rate, and outage probability. Compared with the existing algorithms, the proposed algorithm can always facilitate terminals to flexibly select the suitable transmission mode according to the characteristics of the connected network, achieving better system performance.},

Specifically, by exploiting the statistical channel state information and using large-system approximation theory, the ergodic sum-rate is approximated by a deterministic expression. Then the optimization problem of designing transmit covariances for the strong and weak user is formulated under the constraints of total transmit power budget for base station and minimum rate requirement for the weak user. Since the variables to be optimized are highly correlated with each other, we resort to the alternate optimization method by breaking the problem into two subproblems. For the weak user, the optimal covariance can be acquired by water-filling strategy, while the subproblem for strong user is non-convex. To overcome this, we further adopt the Taylor series approximation on the objective function and the reformulated problem can be efficiently solved with generalized singular value decomposition. After acquiring the covariances, the power allocation is also optimized by bisection search. Finally, the numerical simulation validates the accuracy of derived approximate expression and also the effectiveness of proposed transmission scheme, which significantly outperforms other schemes.},

  abstract     = {Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS) can enhance spectral efficiency in Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) communication systems. A specific challenge in this context involves codesigning the nonconvex phase shifts for RIS and a precoding matrix with a complex sphere constraint, where these coupled variables are used to formulate the nonconvex objective of maximizing spectral efficiency. Most existing methods do not directly address the maximization of spectral efficiency problem but instead relax it into a sum-path-gain-maximization (SPGM) problem before solving it, which may degrade spectral efficiency due to large relaxation gap. We propose an efficient Unified Manifold Optimization (UMO) framework to directly solve the problem. This is achieved through utilizing the inherent constant modulus characteristic of the RIS and the complex sphere characteristic of the precoding matrix constraint. Specifically, we construct a unified manifold space (UMS) that can simultaneously satisfy the RIS and the precoding matrix constraints, enabling the problem to be rephrased as an unconstrained Riemannian problem over the UMS. Based on the UMS, we derive a parallel conjugate gradient algorithm for simultaneous optimization of a precoding matrix and RIS phase shifts. Simulation outcomes indicate that the proposed method excels when compared to current approaches in achieving spectral efficiency enhancement. Furthermore, our algorithm has lower computational cost than several existing techniques.},

We leverage the notion of meta-distribution in order to capture the reliability requirement of URLLC. The packet transmission process is divided into two phases: a beam training phase, during which exhaustive beam sweeping is adopted, and a data transmission phase. The paper investigates the misalignment error distribution resulting from an imperfect training phase, due to the finite codebooks resolution and the fast variation of the channel. For the data transmission phase, closed-form expressions for all the moments of the conditional rate coverage probability are derived, and the meta-distribution is approximated using the beta approximation. The study evaluates the overall network performance through the effective rate meta-distribution, which accounts for the training overhead and beam misalignment errors. The results show the detrimental impact of misalignment errors when URLLC requirements are stringent and highlight the trade-off between the training overhead and the gain brought by multiple antennas. Insights are provided for optimally and jointly choosing the codebook size and tbe number of antennas.},

Integrating intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRS) into WP-MEC systems introduces new opportunities by enhancing transmission channel quality while addressing challenging resource management issues. To tackle these challenges, this paper proposes a collaborative transmission and resource management scheme to facilitate differentiated computation capabilities. Specifically, a novel performance metric called energy cost-effectiveness is introduced to comprehensively assess the performance of IRS-aided coupling. Subsequently, a collaborative transmission mechanism is developed, incorporating communication, energy transmission, and edge computing considerations with adaptive IRS association. To further optimize system performance, two adaptable resource management strategies are devised to maximize energy cost-effectiveness by jointly optimizing IRS, communication, energy, and computation resources, tailored for both unlimited and limited computation capabilities. Comparative analysis with benchmark schemes demonstrates the superiority of the proposed collaborative transmission and resource management approach in enhancing transmission quality and reducing energy consumption. Moreover, the benefits of IRS integration, in terms of energy cost-effectiveness improvement through appropriate quantity and configuration, are highlighted, underscoring its potential to shape the future landscape of industrial Internet-of-Things.},

An alternating optimization (AO) algorithm based on semi-definite relaxation (SDR) and majorization-minimization (MM) is applied to solve the SR-maximization problem by alternately optimizing the beamforming matrix and the reflecting coefficients. Specifically, we first apply the SDR and successive convex approximation (SCA) methods to transform the two subproblems into more tractable forms, then the MM method is applied to derive a concave surrogate function and iteratively solve the subproblems. Finally, simulation results indicate that the active RIS can better confront the impact of “multiplicative fading” and outperforms traditional passive RIS in terms of both secure data rate and radar sensing performance.},

Nevertheless, the performance of RA is still constrained by the limited availability of orthogonal preambles and channel resources. To overcome this limitation, we propose to consider the angle-of-arrival (AOA) and time-of-arrival (TOA) information of the transmitted preambles as additional signatures of an active user. To facilitate this signature assignment, a joint signature estimation (JSE) method with effectively suppressed complexity is proposed. Additionally, to enhance the availability of channel resources, we design an angular domain channel reuse (ADCR) scheme that leverages the estimated AOA signature to improve uplink channel efficiency. By applying the JSE and ADCR to a grant-based RA (GBRA) scenario, we demonstrate that our proposed scheme effectively addresses the preamble limitation problem and contributes new channel reuse to the spatial domain, thereby improving RA performance.},

The cooperative transmission scheme is implemented in two communication phases. In the first phase, the reverse power allocation method is used, in which the higher power is allocated to the data transmitted to the near user, and the far user is introduced as a cooperative jammer to send the artificial noise (AN), so as to improve the security when the base station sends data. Considering the situation that the near user decodes its data, two information forwarding processes are designed in the second phase. If the near user can decode its data, it will employ the amplify-and-forward (AF) protocol to forward the remaining signal after removing its own data. Otherwise, two relay selection (RS) strategies are explored to improve reliability of the considered system. In this case, the selected relay adopts the physical-layer network coding (PNC) technique, and the AN sent by the far user is regarded as the key to participating in the bit-level exclusive-or (XOR) operation, which ensures the absolute security of the data transmitted to the far user. The exact closed-form expressions of the outage probability (OP) and intercept probability (IP) are derived respectively, and the approximate results are also given under high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Furthermore, the influence of relevant system parameters is discussed concretely. The numerical simulation results indicate that substantial performance gain is achieved over orthogonal multiple access (OMA) and other schemes, and the two RS strategies involved in this paper have the same reliability.},

To boost the quality and reduce the latency of AIGC generation, prompt engineering and edge computing are introduced, demanding a multi-dimensional resource allocation approach. Thus, we use the generative diffusion model (GDM) and contract theory to design a two-stage, multi-dimensional resource allocation framework. In the first stage, we employ an approximation approach to quantitatively assess the relationship between the level of prompt optimization, the number of diffusion denoising steps, and the quality of AIGC generation. Based on the quality function, we formulate models for the utilities of an AI-generated content Service Provider (ASP) and users, leading to a non-convex quality-based contract problem optimizing the level of prompt optimization and the number of diffusion denoising steps. To address the time-consuming process of solving the non-convex problem due to variable cost of the ASP and gain preferences of the users, a GDM-based scheme is proposed to optimize quality-based contract items. In the second stage, for each group of users who choose the same quality-based contract items, a non-convex latency-based contract problem optimizing the CPU cycle frequency and network transmission rate is formulated, then the GDM-based scheme is also applied to find the optimal latency-based contract items. Numerical results show that the proposed GDM-based contract generation scheme is very advantageous in improving the quality of AIGC generation and decreasing the latency of AIGC generation, compared to other standard schemes.},

  abstract     = {The ultra-reliable and low-latency communication (uRLLC) plays a vital role in road safety and traffic management of intelligent transportation systems (ITS). Integrating unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) has become a prospective strategy for uRLLC by separately establishing line-of-sight (LoS) link and simultaneous transmissions. The confidentiality and security of information transmission in the context of uRLLC faces serious challenges, due to the openness nature of the wireless medium. Different from traditional encryption methods, featured by high computing complexity and serious processing delay, physical layer security (PLS) exploits the inherent properties of the wireless medium to prevent transmitted messages from being eavesdropped. In addition, NOMA-UAV systems pose unique challenges for secure transmission due to potential stronger LoS channels between the source and the eavesdroppers. Therefore, in this paper, we investigate the confidentiality and security of a NOMA-UAV uRLLC system, under which an UAV serves two types of users with different requirements, i.e., secret users (both security and reliability) and public users (only reliability). Based on the tools of stochastic geometry, we address the challenges of secure communications caused by the mobility of UAV, and derive the closed-form expression of secrecy rate maximization, a key metric for observing the key system parameters on the security and reliability. Furthermore, joint design of UAV trajectory and transmit power is proposed to enhance the system security. Finally, compared with popular PLS scheme empowered by UAV trajectory design, the proposed scheme is evaluated by numerical simulations for theoretical analyses and effectiveness in practice.},

  abstract     = {Hybrid beamforming is an emerging technique for massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems due to the advantages of lower complexity, cost, and power consumption. Recently, intelligent reflection surface (IRS) has been proposed as the cost-effective technique for robust millimeter-wave (mmWave) MIMO systems. Thus, it is required to jointly optimize a reflection vector and hybrid beamforming matrices for IRS-aided mmWave MIMO systems. Due to the lack of RF chain in the IRS, it is unavailable to acquire the TX-IRS and IRS-RX channels separately. Instead, there are efficient methods to estimate the so-called effective (or cascaded) channel in the literature. In the large-system limit, we for the first time derive a near-optimal solution of the joint optimization, where it becomes an optimal solution under high signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) and well-conditioned channels. Based on our theoretical analysis, we construct the practical reflection vector and hybrid beamforming matrices by enforcing the modulus constraints to the asymptotic solutions. Via simulations, it is demonstrated that the proposed method can outperform the state-of-the-art (SOTA) method, while the latter even requires the knowledge of the TX-IRS and IRS-RX channels separately. Furthermore, our construction can provide robustness against inevitable channel estimation errors in practical massive MIMO systems.},

  abstract     = {This article presents a wideband millimeter-wave (mmWave) phased array with a large beam-scanning angle for the communication of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). The proposed array is composed of 8 shorted patch antenna elements. The shorted patch operates in TM1/2,1 mode. A T-shaped slot with dual resonance modes is etched on the radiating shorted patch. By combining the hybrid operating modes together, a wideband performance is realized. The beamwidth of the shorted patch can be increased by coupling with neighboring elements. The inherent wide-beam characteristic of the slot is fully utilized. Thus, the antenna element achieves a wide beamwidth of about 140° in a broad frequency band. A wide-angle beam-scanning phased array is achieved using wide beamwidth of the proposed elements. The measured result demonstrates that the proposed array can cover a beam-scanning angle of more than ±75° in a broad operating frequency band from 24 to 30 GHz. To validates its effectiveness for UAV communication, the proposed array is also simulated and measured on the model of an UAV.},

  abstract     = {The integration of photovoltaic (PV) system into electrified railways holds promising prospects. However, with the integration of PVs, traction power supply system (TPSS) has transformed into complex hybrid system with multiple sources and loads, including both AC and DC converters. Traditional small-signal stability enhancement methods designed for vehicle-network system are challenging to apply in multiple converter configurations. To address this challenge, virtual impedance control with adaptive damping gain is proposed. The damping gain adaptively adjusts with the fluctuation of the vehicle DC voltage. The damping gain decreases as the fluctuation decreases, which reduces the impact on the dynamic characteristics of the control system. This adaptive control approach extends the applicability of virtual impedance control. In addition, a comprehensive modeling method for the hybrid system is provided, including components such as the DC impedance of the PV, the AC and DC impedances of the railway power conditioner (RPC), and the AC impedance of the vehicle. AC–DC impedance coupling is considered in the modeling process. This approach solves the difficulties in analyzing the coupling between the DC impedances of the PV and RPC, as well as the AC impedances of the vehicle and RPC. On this basis, the impacts of the circuit and control parameters on system stability, as well as the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy, are quantitatively analyzed. The proposed modeling and control methods are validated through the construction of a hardware-in-the-loop test platform.},

However, their high-frequency switching-mode operation will cause electromagnetic interference (EMI) problems. Spread spectrum techniques are often used to solve the EMI problems but will cause baseband distortions in amplifiers. In this article, an all-digital spread spectrum method with distortion correction is proposed to make filterless digital CDAs achieve low EMI emissions and high signal to noise and distortion ratio (SNDR). This method mainly utilizes the random numbers generated by a pseudo-random number generator to randomize the pulse position and pulse repetition frequency (PRF) of the uniform-sampling pulse width modulation (UPWM) generator output signal to achieve the effect of spread spectrum. Moreover, the high open-loop gain characteristic of the digital sigma-delta modulator in the baseband and the state-space reconstruction technique are utilized to correct the baseband distortions caused by UPWM and spread spectrum. The feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method are verified by simulation and experimental results.},

  abstract     = {This paper intends to address the long-time coherent integration (LTCI) of high maneuvering unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) in low SNR environment with the idea of sparse reconstruction. Due to the small radar cross section (RCS), high maneuverability and micro-Doppler (m-D) effect, the robust detection of weak UAV target is a challenging problem. Both of the across range unit (ARU) effect and Doppler frequency migration (DFM) will be introduced in UAV returns due to high maneuverability. Furthermore, m-D effect induced by the rotation of rotor blades will also disturb the LTCI performance. To address these problems, a LTCI method called KT-BCS-LSM is proposed for high maneuvering UAV detection. To mitigate the disturbance of m-D effect, the null space pursuit (NSP) with third-order differential operator is constructed to separate the m-D signal from UAV returns. Then, the keystone transform (KT) is applied for range walk correction. Motion parameters estimation, including velocity, acceleration and jerk, is modeled as a sparse representation problem and solved by Bayesian compressive sensing (BCS) with Laplacian scale mixture (LSM) prior. Compared with the searching-based method, like generalized RFT (GRFT), the proposed method has significant higher computational efficiency. Compared with transform-based methods, like fractional Fourier transform (FrFT) and Lv's distribution (LVD), the proposed algorithm is able to compensate the DFM induced by jerk motion and has higher estimation accuracy and noise robustness. The effectiveness of proposed method is validated by numerical simulations and real-measured data of a DJI UAV.},

Firstly, an event-triggered mechanism is designed to assess whether measurement data is lost, and it is fused with the cubature Kalman filtering to construct an ETCKF for processing sensor data. Subsequently, these processed data are fed into a nonlinear tire model to compute normalized tire forces. Next, an EKFNet, composed of an EKF and a four-layer neural network, utilizes the tire force information and vehicle model for the estimation of TRFC. Multiple virtual experiment results demonstrate that the estimation performance of the model-based learning framework outperforms conventional extended Kalman filter and unscented Kalman filter.

Our study utilizes simulations to analyze vehicle behavior under such extreme conditions and proposes a novel control system that coordinates front-wheel drive torque with steering adjustment for path tracking. This system incorporates an observer that detects changes in tire forces resulting from alterations in road adhesion coefficient. A stability index, derived from the lateral dynamics model and the Lyapunov function, is employed to determine the optimal times for activating or deactivating the control system. The front-wheel drive torque controller is designed with three cascading feedback loops to enhance path tracking precision. We evaluated the effectiveness of this controller through integrated simulations using CarMaker and Simulink.

With the emergence of the next-generation train control system–Train Autonomous Circumambulation System (TACS), the transportation environment manifests obvious intricate correlations with strong couplings, multiple constraints, and rapid evolution. Most of the existing works focus on low-dimensional passenger flow prediction and independent train adjustment optimization, while the potential of network-level situation assessment and generalized experience across multi-tasks are neglected. In this paper, we propose a novel cloud-edge-end collaboration empowered TACS intelligent train regulation optimization scheme with situation awareness at end layer, arithmetic provision at edge layer, and intelligent fusion at cloud layer. Specifically, a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN)-based passenger flow prediction model is introduced to enable accurate assessment of the urban rail transit operation situation at the network level. Moreover, the Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)-based train dynamic adjustment algorithm is proposed to ensure efficient matching of passenger and traffic flows. In addition, a Actor-Mimic based multi-task and transfer reinforcement learning method is implemented in TACS to facilitate generalizing the trained experience across multiple tasks and accelerate the ability to adapt to new environments. Extensive simulation results illustrate that the proposed scheme can effectively improve the transportation capacity matching of TACS and enhance the generalization of train dynamic adjustment strategies.},

Hence, an ameliorative Kalman filter is adopted to fuse the information about camera and vehicle dynamics to accurately estimate the road curvature. To ensure lateral control performance, dynamic constraints are defined by the estimated road curvature to guarantee comfort and safety. In the control domain of model predictive control (MPC), the model can be approximated as a linear time-invariant model (LTIM) to reduce the computational complexity. The MPC problem can be transformed into a standard quadratic programming (QP) problem with dynamic constraints of guaranteed comfort and safety.

Specifically, the study explores the implementation of the Pulse and Glide (PnG) driving strategy with the aim to exploit its potential in energy-saving while limiting the typical negative effects on passengers' comfort. A numerical model of a B-class BEV is developed and validated using open-access data. The model is employed to determine the optimal driving style for achieving minimum energy consumption during cruising at different speeds. Passengers' comfort is taken into account by limiting the maximum longitudinal jerk. A genetic algorithm (GA) is employed for the definition of the optimal throttle input. Results show that the PnG strategy can save up to 5% energy with respect to a constant speed (CS) strategy if passengers' comfort is disregarded. If comfort is also included in the optimisation process a reduction of about 1% of the energy saving is found. A subjective-objective comfort correlation is performed on the optimised driving strategies by using the DriSMi dynamic driving simulator at Politecnico di Milano. The numerical results of the optimisation process have been correlated to passengers' subjective comfort perception under realistic driving conditions. The proposed approach shows that without proper comfort constraints eco-driving strategies are not accepted by passengers. Also, the dynamic driving simulator is a viable way for a fast and reliable subjective evaluation of the perceived comfort.},

Human sensitivity to delays is the main reason for the performance degradation of a ground vehicle teleoperation system. The proposed framework extracts human intention from eye-movement and combines it with contextual constraints to generate an intention-compliant guidance trajectory, which is then employed to control the vehicle directly. Using eye-movement contributes to more accurate steering intention and trajectory prediction, which is critical for trajectory guidance control. A human-in-loop simulation platform is designed to evaluate the teleoperation performance of the proposed method at different delay levels. The results are analyzed by repeated measures ANOVA, which shows that the proposed method significantly improves maneuverability and cognitive burden at large delay levels (>200 ms). The overall performance is also much better than the PTGC which does not employ the eye-movement feature.},

  abstract     = {In the evolving domain of autonomous vehicles, the importance of decision-making cannot be overstated. Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) emerges as a pivotal tool in this landscape. However, existing DRL algorithms suffer from inaccurate Q-value estimation, predominantly due to system noise and function approximation errors. This coupled with real-world unpredictabilities, often misdirects autonomous vehicles, leading to sub-optimal actions and safety hazards. This work introduces a novel DRL algorithm tailored for uncertainty and noise-aware decision-making in autonomous vehicles. Our approach harnesses Bayesian Neural Networks and skew-geometric Jensen-Shannon divergence, to rectify the aforementioned limitations. Evaluated on the OpenAI gymnasium environment, our algorithm has clear advantages over existing methods in terms of cumulative rewards and convergence speed.},

  abstract     = {Effective path tracking control plays a pivotal role in Autonomous Ground Vehicles (AGVs). However, AGVs systems face difficulties in fast convergence and overshooting when subject to actuator communication burden and execution wear. To improve the actuator wear and achieve fast convergence, this paper proposed a fast natural logarithmic sliding mode (FLnSM) control scheme based on the dynamic event-triggered (DET) mechanism. First, a novel FLnSM is developed to enhance convergence speed and reduce chatter. By employing the fast natural logarithmic function, it is possible to achieve high gains at the equilibrium point of the AGVs system. This method exhibits enhanced tracking accuracy and higher convergence speeds compared to other SMC methods. Secondly, a DET mechanism with an adjustable threshold is introduced to mitigate the communication burden and reduce actuator execution loss. Furthermore, as the update frequency of the controller is reduced, the chatter of the sliding mode surface is effectively diminished. Compared to most existing event-triggering methods with a static threshold, the proposed DET mechanism adaptively updates the triggering threshold online to achieve enhanced resource efficiency and avoid the Zeno phenomenon. With only a few parameters requiring tuning, and given that the natural logarithm function is easy to integrate into many AGVs systems, implementing the proposed DET-FLnSM in AGVs systems becomes effortless. Finally, a composite control scheme that integrates DET with FLnSM is proposed to achieve fast convergence, suppress chattering phenomenon, and reduce communication resource consumption of the AGVs system. The excellent performance of the proposed DET-FLnSM control strategy is demonstrated through numerical simulations and experimental results.},

This paper proposes a lane change trajectory prediction framework, referred to as LCT-DPP, which incorporates driver personality parameters to improve the acceptance of the lane change trajectories of autonomous vehicles. In order to identify the lane-changing styles of the drivers, a clustering algorithm Autoencoder (AE) -Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) is first proposed to cluster the historical lane-changing trajectories and vehicle interaction parameters of the vehicles and classify the lane-changing styles of the driver into aggressive, normal, and conservative according to the clustering results. The encoder module and the fully connected layer are then used to predict the lane change style of the driver, and the output is a vector holding the lane change style features of the driver. Finally, the encoder-decoder model is developed for lane change trajectory prediction by fusing lane change style feature vectors and time series features and using them as inputs to the model. The proposed model is then validated through experiments. The obtained results show that the root mean square errors (RMSEs) of the TCN-LSTM-Attention based encoder-decoder model are respectively 0.312, 0.568, and 0.734 m for the time intervals of 1, 2, and 3 s, which indicates a very high prediction accuracy.},

  abstract     = {An accurate estimation of State of Charge (SoC) depletion is crucial for Electric Vehicle (EV) users. It alleviates range anxiety by ensuring drivers are confident in reaching their destinations with the available SoC, thereby enhancing the widespread acceptance of EVs. However, algorithms estimating SoC depletion using battery cell voltage, current, and temperature may exhibit lower accuracy when applied to EVs with different types of batteries. Thus, this paper proposes a driving behavior-based SoC depletion estimation algorithm for EV users undertaking urban city trips. The proposed algorithm uses real-time velocity, acceleration/deceleration, and distance as inputs, offering greater practical applicability to EVs with various battery types. It employs the Global False Nearest Neighbor (GFNN) method to determine an optimal sliding window length to accommodate unpredictable variations in driving behavior across different trips. The output from GFNN is then utilized in a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to estimate SoC depletion. The proposed methodology improves the algorithm's resiliency, adaptability, and learning capability of long-term dependencies towards abrupt driving behaviors of EV drivers. This estimation framework is trained and validated on EV drivers' real-world urban city driving behaviors from “Blu Smart Mobility” cabs in India, ensuring the algorithm's reliability. The results show that it outperforms other state-of-the-art algorithms, achieving an overall accuracy of 99.75%, calculated using three metrics: Mean Square Error (MSE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and Mean Absolute Error (MAE).},

  abstract     = {3D object detection from LiDAR data for autonomous driving has been making remarkable strides in recent years. Among the state-of-the-art methodologies, encoding point clouds into a bird's eye view (BEV) has been demonstrated to be both effective and efficient. Different from perspective views, BEV preserves rich spatial and distance information between objects. Yet, while farther objects of the same type do not appear smaller in the BEV, they contain sparser point cloud features. This fact weakens BEV feature extraction using shared-weight convolutional neural networks (CNNs). In order to address this challenge, we propose Range-Aware Attention Network (RAANet), which extracts effective BEV features and generates superior 3D object detection outputs. The range-aware attention (RAA) convolutions significantly improve feature extraction for near as well as far objects. Moreover, we propose a novel auxiliary loss for point density estimation to further enhance the detection accuracy of RAANet for occluded objects. It is worth to note that our proposed RAA convolution is lightweight and compatible to be integrated into any CNN architecture used for detection from a BEV. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes and KITTI datasets demonstrate that our proposed approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods for LiDAR-based 3D object detection, with real-time inference speed of 16 Hz for the full version and 22 Hz for the lite version tested on nuScenes lidar frames.},

It has broad application prospects in large-scale intelligent surveillance and reconnaissance tasks. However, AAV cannot finish a large-scale task in one flight due to its limited power. Therefore, the points need to be partitioned into several subsets. AGV provides charging and limited distance communication for AAV. During the flight, AAV needs enough power to visit the points, each of which needs to be located in the communication range. In existing work, K-means is used to partition points. However, its partition results are determined by a preset number of subsets and the distribution of points. The generated subsets may contain too many or too few points such that the efficiency of one flight is reduced. The points in a subset may also be out of the communication range such that AAV cannot reach it directly., thus requiring extra charging and transportation. This work transforms a traditional target point partition into a bin packing one. A point is chosen to be packed only if AAV has enough power to visit it and falls into its communication range. The objective of bin packing is to pack all the points with the minimum number of bins. Thus, the number of flights is minimized such that AAV can visit as many points as possible in one flight. Simulations illustrate that the proposed method significantly reduces extra charging and transportation needs than the state of the art.},

However, the dynamic behavior of a vehicle is time-varying and uncertain, especially during high mobility driving. For the data-driven end-to-end trajectory generation and control approach, the transferability and robustness of the trained neural network cannot easily be guaranteed. In this paper, a combined model- and learning-based trajectory generation and control framework for automated overtaking maneuver is presented. Unlike the model-driven approach and end-to-end learning approach, the proposed framework blends the single-track vehicle model of the automated vehicle with time-series driving data to generate safe and high-quality overtaking motions. Specifically, an efficient vectorized implementation of multivariate Gaussian process regression (MGPR) is applied to learn the unmodeled dynamics in hopes of shortening the deviation between the single-track dynamic model and the true vehicle dynamics. A hierarchical nonlinear model predictive control with MGPR is designed for realizing local trajectory generation and control in the overtaking maneuvers. Multi-phases automated overtaking maneuvers at different speed ranges are conducted on roads with different friction coefficients to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed trajectory generation and control framework.},

However, the potential of this cooperative driving system to enhance driving safety under extreme conditions remains underexplored. This paper presents a game-theoretic shared steering control (SSC) strategy, which takes nonlinear vehicle dynamics as well as state and input constraints into consideration, for driver-automation cooperative collision avoidance under extreme conditions. Firstly, a novel Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy Koopman operator approach for vehicle system modeling is introduced. This approach ensures the accuracy of the Koopman-based vehicle model in the presence of changing external conditions, such as road adhesion coefficient and vertical load. The resulting vehicle model maintains a simple linear structure while preserving system nonlinearity. Then, based on the T-S fuzzy Koopman vehicle model, we design a game-theoretic SSC strategy that considers state and input constraints. The state constraints are further approximated through artificial potential field functions and second-order Taylor series expansions, enabling the derivation of analytical Nash equilibrium solution using the distributed model predictive control approach. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed SSC strategy is validated through both numerical and driver-in-the-loop (DiL) experiments. The results indicate that the proposed SSC strategy significantly improves the vehicle's collision-avoidance performance while reducing the driver's workloads.},

Secondly, the distributed non-linear model predictive control is used to realize the longitudinal control of platoon, and the alternating direction method of multipliers algorithm is utilized to obtain the desired speed under different unidirectional communication topologies.

Finally, simulation results in real coal mine transportation scenarios show that the proposed framework can achieve fast and effective planning of transportation paths. The platoon layer meets the requirement of a secure and stable following under each unidirectional communication and improves fuel economy by 5.02%.

This paper presents a human-machine shared line-of-sight (LOS) path following control method of under-actuated ISVs in complex sea environments with dynamic and static obstacles. At the kinematics level, a human-machine shared LOS guidance law is presented based on a dynamic authority mechanism determined by a shared weighted coefficient. The proposed guidance law not only preserves the simplicity and interpretation of the LOS guidance, but also enables the ISVs to combine the complementary strengths of the captain and the automated system. At the kinetic level, an adaptive extended state observer (AESO) is developed to estimate model uncertainties and environmental disturbances, and a model-free kinetic control method is constructed based on the AESO. By using the input-to-state stability theory, uniformly and ultimately bounded of the closed-loop system is analyzed. The simulation results are provided to validate the effectiveness of the human-machine shared LOS path following control method.},

However, the growing number of vehicular applications poses challenges for embedded systems that need to perform tasks efficiently despite network fluctuations. To solve this problem, we have developed a Vehicular Edge Computing (VEC) system with a task offloading algorithm adapted to the Internet of Vehicles (IoV). Our solution uses a four-stage Stackelberg game and a reinforcement learning model. The approach consists of analyzing the vehicle state in real time to determine computational requirements and cost functions, implementing communication methods and cost functions, and using multi-agent reinforcement learning to design an experience-based offloading strategy. Through simulations, our algorithm demonstrates a balanced optimization of time, expense, work vehicle utility and service vehicle utility, while improving the probability of task success under various constraints.},

Then, an actor-critic-disturbance structure for adaptive optimal learning is proposed to solve the ZSG issue online while assuring safety and stability. Furthermore, based on experience replay technique, novel learning rules for network weights are presented, which not only enable the convergence process of network weights to be more stable, but also accelerate the convergence speed.

  abstract     = {Concealed moving target imaging is an important task in the fields of autonomous driving, urban combat, city anti-terrorism, etc. However, existing radar imaging techniques mainly focus on line-of-sight (LOS) targets and struggle to sense non-line-of-sight (NLOS) moving targets. In this paper, a joint NLOS model and inverse synthetic aperture radar (ISAR) algorithm, dubbed corner motion target imaging (CMTI), is proposed for moving target imaging via millimeter-wave (MMW) radar. In this scheme, initially, to separate hidden motion target echoes and background clutter, we utilize a low-frequency filtering method to suppress the clutter and an NLOS echo extraction method based on OTSU to extract the target echoes. Subsequently, to solve the problem of focusing and imaging difficulties, a novel NLOS imaging method based on the polar format algorithm (PFA) and the prominent point processing (PPP) autofocus algorithm is exploited. The method consists of a cross-correlation method and a minimum variance algorithm for envelope alignment and phase adjustment, the minimization entropy autofocusing (MEA) method and PPP for residual phase error and target rotational speed estimation, and PFA for 2-D high-resolution imaging. Eventually, to obtain the real target image, we present a reconstruction algorithm based on the mirror symmetry criterion. Near-field experiments are set up to verify CMTI. The experimental results demonstrate that CMTI can provide high-resolution images of the NLOS moving targets.},

In reality, due to the unreliability of data transmission and the volatility of storage devices, data sparsity limits the stability and prediction performance of existing methods that rely on high-quality observed data. To achieve robust sparse traffic prediction, we first investigate two findings as our motivation: the influence of external geographical features on shaping traffic distribution and the coupling dependence of multi-source urban data. Specifically, we develop a condition-guided collaborative learning network for traffic prediction with sparse data. The core idea is to exploit both the informative external geographic features and multiple urban data as auxiliary information to cooperatively learn mobility patterns from sparse data. First, we design an attention-based bilateral filter, which explicitly models the influence of external geographic features on spatial-temporal targets, and exploits such patterns as conditions to further estimate the missing elements. Secondly, a collaborative-learning framework, including a graph fusion module and a memory-preserved mechanism is devised to adaptively extract and aggregate fragments of similar spatial-temporal sequences from multiple urban data, helping the model to learn comprehensive mobility patterns from sparse data. We verify the excellent effectiveness of our model on multi-source traffic datasets collected in modern urban transportation systems.},

In the leader-follower framework, each follower is controlled to track its leader and achieve the prescribed formation configuration by maintaining a desired relative distance and a desired bearing angle with its leader. To ensure the convergence of formation errors to a preassigned steady-state zone within an appointed time frame, a novel piecewise continuous performance constraint function is proposed instead of the conventional exponential decay approach used in traditional prescribed performance control (PPC). In addition, an improved obstacle avoidance algorithm is designed to avoid static and moving obstacles on the path and to solve the problem of collision avoidance with unconnected vehicles within the formation. On this basis, combined with sliding-mode control (SMC) technology and fuzzy logic system (FLS) technology, a distributed appointed-time prescribed performance control (APPC) strategy is developed, which can not only achieve the designed formation within an appointed time, but also maintain connectivity and avoid collisions both within the formation and with the obstacles. Finally, simulation experiments are carried out to illustrate the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed control strategy and algorithm.},

Firstly, a distributed adaptive event-triggered control (ETC) is proposed to adjust the transmission frequency by adaptively tuning the event-triggered threshold according to the preceding vehicle's jerk, which could be a tradeoff between improving transmission efficiency and reducing bandwidth occupation. Under such communication mechanism, a control scheme is proposed to obtain the safety platoon performance by adaptively tuning the cost function. Then, some sufficient conditions of the strictly $\mathcal {L}_{2}$ string stability and controller design method are provided under the distributed adaptive ETC and the safety control scheme. Further, an optimization algorithm for the controller gains is proposed to reduce on-line computation and improve the control performance by introducing an additional degree of design freedom into control input.

However, the traditional synchronous FEEL mechanism suffers from limited resources, leading to bottleneck nodes when the FEEL tasks are conducted in a wireless network. In this paper, we present a novel semi-asynchronous FEEL algorithm designed for application over wireless multi-access channels, particularly in scenarios involving data and devices with inherent heterogeneity. In this context, we embrace the concept of over-the-air computation (AirComp) to facilitate simultaneous processes of local model uploading and global model aggregation. We analyze the theoretical convergence performance of the proposed algorithm called PAOTA and formulate the upper bound of the expected optimal gap between the expected and optimal global loss values. Considering the staleness and divergence of local updates from edge devices, we minimize the convergence upper bound of the FEEL global model by optimizing the uplink transmit power of edge devices at each aggregation period. The simulation results demonstrate the robust performance of PAOTA using synthetic and real data in wireless networks. Furthermore, with the same target accuracy, the training time required for PAOTA is less than that of synchronous-based FEEL algorithms.},

Recent results show that GPS is vulnerable to spoofing attacks, and it is not clear whether the current localization is secure enough against advanced GPS spoofing attacks. In this paper, a systematic study regarding the security of the localization under GPS spoofing is explored for safe and reliable AD. First, a novel and robust GPS adversarial attack design method is proposed to defeat the principle of the multi-sensor fusion algorithm and lead to wrong position. It can cheat the widely used Chi-squared detector in Kalman filter and cause the vehicle to drive off the road, posing greater challenge on safe driving. Second, a real-time Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) attack detector is developed to detect the serious attack effectively. When the attack is detected, a multi-information fusion method based on the lateral direction localization from camera and map using Unscented Kalman filter is proposed to defend against the GPS attack and provide accurate position estimation for automated vehicles to drive on roads safely. The proposed method is validated in various scenarios in Carla simulator and a real-word driving dataset to demonstrate its effectiveness in timely GPS attack detection and secure position estimation. The results show that the LSTM-based detection method has best performance compared to the state-of-the-art detection approaches. The position estimation for attack defense is effective and robust in different driving scenarios, ensuring safe and reliable AD in closed-loop form.},

  abstract     = {In drone wireless charging, the performance is highly affected by imperfect landing of drones on the charging pad. To enhance the lateral misalignment tolerance, a novel mortarboard-shaped receiver (Rx) antenna for the drone is proposed. The antenna comprises of five coils and employs a hybrid combining topology integrated with the rectifying circuits to amalgamate the harvested voltages from the individual Rx coils. The design is analytically optimized to efficiently exploit the three orthogonal H-field components generated by the transmitter coil antenna to maximize the Rx misalignment region within which a uniform voltage is received. A low-cost PCB technology is employed to realize the proposed Rx antenna. The analytically optimized design of the proposed antenna is experimentally validated and demonstrates a 90.25% uniformity achieved in the load voltage, which is 276% higher than the conventional Rx coil of the literature. This means that the drone can land anywhere on the $\sim 90\%$ (measured 94%) region of the Tx antenna area without degrading the power transfer performance. The wide tolerance range proves that the proposed Rx can potentially eliminate the lateral misalignment problem to a greater extent for realizing a misalignment tolerant wireless charging system for drones.},

Then, the data rate of 5G SD-LDPC processing is remarkably improved by introducing SIMD-aware algorithm-level innovations, e.g., parallel efficient encoding, minimizing branch instructions, approximate check-node processing, and latency-oriented optimization. Compared with the state-of-the-art approaches, experimental results show that the proposed techniques successfully enhance the speed of encoding and decoding operations by 8.1 and 1.5 times, respectively, leading to the high-speed and fully-flexible software-defined radio (SDR) solutions for 5G systems.},

  abstract     = {Due to the range-angle two-dimensional beam control ability of frequency diverse array multiple-input–multiple-output (FDA-MIMO) radar, it has a wide range of application prospects in mainlobe interference suppression. Several robust beamforming methods for FDA-MIMO radar have been proposed in recent years. However, most of these methods require sufficient independent and identically distributed snapshots, which is difficult to satisfy for FDA-MIMO radar, especially in dynamic environments. Therefore, the problem of FDA-MIMO robust beamforming in sample-starved scenarios is considered in this paper, especially for an extreme case where only a single snapshot can be used for beamforming. This work proposes an improved single-snapshot robust beamforming method for FDA-MIMO radar. We eliminate the desired target component by forward-backward spatial smoothing, expand the number of samples, and construct a robust beamforming problem based on the worst-case performance optimal (WCPO) criterion. To reduce the computational complexity, the original problem can be divided into two convex optimization subproblems using the Kronecker product (KP) structure of the steering vector. The optimal weight vector can be obtained by iteratively solving the two convex optimization subproblems. In addition, the Shrinkage method is introduced to alleviate the mismatch of the covariance matrix caused by the lack of snapshots. Numerical examples show that the proposed method has better performance than the existing competitive algorithms in terms of output signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR), robustness, and computational complexity.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a geometrical framework for the polarimetric modeling of mobile fading channels. Such a framework is formulated upon a spherical-wave propagation paradigm that allows to account for two important factors pertaining to wave polarization that are not jointly considered in the state of the art, namely: the anisotropic radiation characteristics of practical antennas, and the variations in time and space of the channel depolarization effects. The joint characterization of these two factors is important, e.g., for the analysis of mobile communication systems that rely on highly dynamic radio links, such as vehicular networks. The channel depolarization function is modeled by a linear transformation in the form of a simple rotation matrix that is transparent to the antenna polarization and to the geometry of the propagation scenario. The effects of multipath depolarization on the average power, the first-order envelope distribution, the average per-path Doppler shift, and the mean Doppler shift of mobile fading channels are analyzed mathematically and numerically. An open geometrical configuration of the propagation scenario is considered for the mathematical analysis, whereas a particular configuration given by a new geometrical street model with reflecting surfaces is adopted for the numerical analysis. The obtained results show that the aforementioned statistical quantities are strongly influenced by the anisotropic antenna pattern characteristics and by the time-space variations of multipath depolarization, demonstrating the importance of incorporating both factors into the modeling of mobile fading channels.},

  abstract     = {Millimeter-wave channel modeling for airplanes, trains, and other in-vehicle environments can be considered jointly as different variations of a general site, namely an indoor dense space (IDS). In this work, by using ray-tracing (RT) simulations, we compare the effect of frame material, user density, and geometry on the channel characteristics at 28, 39, and 60 GHz bands. We observe that temporal and spatial parameters in IDS have unique distributions some depending on the transmitter (TX)-receiver (RX) separation in comparison to the indoor office (IO) channel model. The frame material is the main determining factor of the channel characteristics, while variations in frequency bands and geometries have only a minor impact. We extend our channel modeling effort to MIMO deployment analysis to compare the validity of the proposed model in terms of coverage and spectral efficiency with the IO model. Several dominant angular intervals in the channel cause five times higher spectral efficiency gained by digital beamforming (BF) in comparison to analog BF. We observe that the path loss in IDS is more severe compared with IO, resulting in at least a 50% reduction in the coverage area.},
