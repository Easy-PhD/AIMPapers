  abstract     = {Multi-agent systems often require agents to collaborate with or compete against other agents with diverse goals, behaviors, or strategies. Agent modeling is essential when designing adaptive policies for intelligent machine agents in multi-agent systems, as this is the means by which the controlled agent (ego agent) understands other agents' (modeled agents) behavior and extracts their meaningful policy representations. These representations can be used to enhance the ego agent's adaptive policy which is trained by reinforcement learning. However, existing agent modeling approaches typically assume the availability of local observations from modeled agents during training or a long observation trajectory for policy adaption. To remove these constrictive assumptions and improve agent modeling performance, we devised a Contrastive Learning-based Agent Modeling (CLAM) method that relies only on the local observations from the ego agent during training and execution. With these observations, CLAM is capable of generating consistent high-quality policy representations in real time right from the beginning of each episode. We evaluated the efficacy of our approach in both cooperative and competitive multi-agent environments. The experiment results demonstrate that our approach improves reinforcement learning performance by at least 28% on cooperative and competitive tasks, which exceeds the state-of-the-art.},

  abstract     = {Motion expressions guided video segmentation is aimed to segment objects in videos according to the given language descriptions about object motion. To accurately segment moving objects across frames, it is important to capture motion information of objects within the entire video. However, the existing method fails to encode object motion information accurately. In this paper, we propose an effective motion information mining framework to improve motion expressions guided video segmentation, named EMIM. It consists of two novel modules, including a hierarchical motion aggregation module and a box-level positional encoding module. Specifically, the hierarchical motion aggregation module is aimed to capture local and global temporal information of objects within a video. To achieve this goal, we introduce local-window self-attention and selective state space models for short-term and long-term feature aggregation. Inspired by that the spatial changes of objects can effectively reflect the object motion across frames, the box-level positional encoding module integrates object spatial information into object embeddings. With two proposed modules, our proposed method can capture object spatial changes with temporal evolution. We conduct the extensive experiments on motion expressions guided video segmentation dataset MeViS to reveal the advantages of our EMIM. Our proposed EMIM achieves a $ \mathcal {J \&amp; F}$ score of 42.2%, outperforming the prior approach, LMPM, by 5.0%.},

This paper proposes a data-cleaning method to achieve robust classification against noisy labels. A chance-constrained abnormal data cleaning approach is proposed based on chance-constrained optimization, in which a polynomial sublevel set for the data of each class is generated. The data outside the polynomial sublevel set is abnormal and has a low probability of belonging to the labeled class. The classification method only uses normal data to establish the estimated classifiers. We show the convergence of the proposed abnormal data-cleaning approach. Furthermore, we give the algorithm for classification with abnormal data cleaning. Experimental data-based validations have been implemented to validate the proposed classification algorithm. The results show that the proposed approach can correctly clean the abnormal noisy labels and improve the performance of Supervised classification methods.},

The automated design of metaheuristic algorithms provides an attractive path to relieve manual design effort and gain enhanced performance beyond human-made algorithms. However, the specific algorithm prototype and linear algorithm representation in the current automated design pipeline restrict the design within a fixed algorithm structure, which hinders discovering novelties and diversity across the metaheuristic family. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a general framework, AutoOpt, for automatically designing metaheuristic algorithms with diverse structures. AutoOpt contains three innovations: (i) A general algorithm prototype dedicated to covering the metaheuristic family as widely as possible. It promotes high-quality automated design on different problems by fully discovering potentials and novelties across the family. (ii) A directed acyclic graph algorithm representation to fit the proposed prototype. Its flexibility and evolvability enable discovering various algorithm structures in a single run of design, thus boosting the possibility of finding high-performance algorithms. (iii) A graph representation embedding method offering an alternative compact form of the graph to be manipulated, which ensures AutoOpt's generality. Experiments on numeral functions and real applications validate AutoOpt's efficiency and practicability.},

  abstract     = {In minimally-invasive brain surgeries with indirect and narrow operating environments, 3D brain reconstruction is crucial. However, as requirements of accuracy for some new minimally-invasive surgeries (such as brain-computer interface surgery) are higher and higher, the outputs of conventional 3D reconstruction, such as point cloud (PC), are facing the challenges that sample points are too sparse and the precision is insufficient. On the other hand, there is a scarcity of high-density point cloud datasets, which makes it challenging to train models for direct reconstruction of high-density brain point clouds. In this work, a novel model named stereoscopic-aware graph generative adversarial network (SG-GAN) with two stages is proposed to generate fine high-density PC conditioned on a single image. The Stage-I GAN sketches the primitive shape and basic structure of the organ based on the given image, yielding Stage-I point clouds. The Stage-II GAN takes the results from Stage-I and generates high-density point clouds with detailed features. The Stage-II GAN is capable of correcting defects and restoring the detailed features of the region of interest (ROI) through the up-sampling process. Furthermore, a parameter-free-attention-based free-transforming module is developed to learn the efficient features of input, while upholding a promising performance. Comparing with the existing methods, the SG-GAN model shows superior performance in terms of visual quality, objective measurements, and performance in classification, as demonstrated by comprehensive results measured by several evaluation metrics including PC-to-PC error and Chamfer distance.},

  abstract     = {The sparse reward problem widely exists in multi-agent deep reinforcement learning, preventing agents from learning optimal actions and resulting in inefficient interactions with the environment. Many efforts have been made to design denser rewards and promote agent exploration. However, existing methods only focus on the breadth of action exploration, neglecting the rationality of action exploration in deep reinforcement learning, which leads to inefficient action exploration for agents. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose a novel curiosity-based action exploration method in incomplete information competition game environments, namely IGC, to improve both the breadth and rationality of action exploitation in multi-agent deep reinforcement learning for sparse-reward environments. Particularly, to enhance the capability of action exploration for agents, the distance reward is designed in our IGC method to increase the density of rewards in action exploration, thereby mitigating the sparse reward problem. In addition, by integrating the Intrinsic Curiosity Module (ICM) into DQN, we propose an enhanced ICM-DQN module, which enhances the breadth and rationality of subject action exploration for agents. By doing this, our IGC method can mitigate the randomness of the existing curiosity mechanism and increase the rationality of action exploration of agents, thereby enhancing the efficiency of action exploration. Finally, we evaluate the effectiveness of our IGC method on an incomplete information card game, namely Uno card game. The results demonstrate that our IGC method can achieve both better action exploration efficiency and greater winning-rate in comparison with existing methods.},

  abstract     = {This study addresses the challenges of learning from long-tailed class imbalances in deep neural networks, particularly for image recognition. Long-tailed class imbalances occur when a dataset's class distribution is highly skewed, with a few head classes containing many instances and numerous tail classes having fewer instances. This imbalance becomes problematic when traditional classification methods, especially deep learning models, prioritize accuracy in the more frequent classes, neglecting the less common ones. Furthermore, these methods struggle to maintain consistent boundary fidelity—decision boundaries that are sharp enough to distinguish classes yet smooth enough to generalize well. Hard boundaries, often caused by overfitting tail classes, amplify intra-class variations, while overly soft boundaries blur distinctions between classes, reducing classification accuracy. We propose a dual-branch network with a shared feature extractor to overcome these challenges. This network uses instance and median samplers for head and medium classes and a reverse sampler for tail classes. Additionally, we implement a specialized loss function as a feature regularizer to reduce the model's sensitivity to irrelevant intra-class variations during classification. This loss function dynamically modulates feature representation alignment, promoting cohesive intra-class structures and clear inter-class separations. To achieve this, our framework incorporates two key components: Dual-Branch Sampler-Guided Mixup (DBSGM) and Adaptive Class-Aware Feature Regularizer (ACFR), which work together to balance class representation and refine decision boundaries. Integrating DBSGM and ACFR during training helps shape decision boundaries that align with class semantics. To ensure class boundaries are appropriately defined, we propose the temperature-adaptive supervised contrastive loss (TASCL) within the ACFR module, achieving the right balance between smoothness and sharpness. Our single-stage, end-to-end framework demonstrates significant performance improvements, offering a promising solution to the challenges of long-tailed class imbalances in deep learning.},

  abstract     = {The increasing variety of energy conversion units and storage equipment connected to the multi-energy system, along with the uncertain factors posed by distributed wind and photovoltaic power generation, have made the energy flow structure of the system more complex. This complexity has created significant challenges for the frequency regulation of traditional energy hub systems. One of the characteristics of a microgrid (MG) is the use of combined heat and power (CHP) systems to generate both electrical and thermal energy at the same time. This can boost the system's dependability, efficiency, and economic performance. As a CHP's ramping capability makes it a useful tool for monitoring and controlling the MG's frequency, it will be employed in this research to achieve this goal. The complexity of the system's dynamics and set tasks throughout the course of the performance period necessitates advanced control structures for the MG with CHP systems. To address the challenges of controlling in MG with CHP systems, this research introduces a novel control structure based on deep reinforcement learning and single input interval type-2 fuzzy fractional-order proportional integral (SIT2-FFOPI) for this system. The SIT2-FFOPI serves as the main controller, with its fundamental parameters established through the utilization of the Improved Salp Swarm Algorithm (ISSA) optimization technique. An adaptive deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG)-based actor-critic system has been developed to enhance the main controller's learning potential, thereby enabling it to more effectively address control challenges in the isolated MG. The efficacy of the suggested approach in real-time was evaluated through simulations carried out utilizing an OPAL-RT-based Hardware-in-the-Loop (HiL) configuration. As a result of this study, it was determined that the proposed controller for load disturbance, renewable energy sources (RES) power changes, and contingency circumstances in MG outperforms other controllers in terms of performance.},

  abstract     = {The evolutionary neural architecture search for generative adversarial networks (GANs) has demonstrated promising performance for generating high-quality images. However, two challenges persist, including the long search times and unstable search results. To alleviate these problems, this paper proposes a sampling and clustering-based neural architecture search algorithm for GANs, named SCGAN, which can significantly improve searching efficiency and enhance generation quality. Two improved strategies are proposed in SCGAN. First, a constraint sampling strategy is designed to limit the parameter capacity of architectures, which calculates their architecture size and discards those exceeding a reasonable parameter threshold. Second, a clustering selection strategy is applied in each architecture iteration, which integrates a decomposition selection mechanism and a hierarchical clustering mechanism to further improve search stability. Extensive experiments on the CIFAR-10 and STL-10 datasets demonstrated that SCGAN only requires 0.4 GPU days to find a promising GAN architecture in a vast search space including approximately 10$^{15}$ networks. Our best-found GAN outperformed those obtained by other neural architecture search methods with performance metric results (IS = 9.68$\pm$ 0.06, FID = 5.54) on CIFAR-10 and (IS = 12.12$\pm$ 0.13, FID = 12.54) on STL-10.},

  abstract     = {Few-shot learning (FSL) aims to learn novel concepts with very limited labeled data. The popular FSL methods typically rely on metric learning to measure image similarity in a learned feature space. However, existing approaches often overlook the synergy between the similarity metric and feature representation, and fail to fully exploit the combination of global and local features for effective similarity measurement. In this work, we propose a novel FSL method, AdptGL-CA, which adaptively uses global and local features to boost the discrimination capability of similarity metric, while improving feature representation and generalization through attention mechanism and contrastive learning, respectively. Specifically, we design a learnable adaptive fusion strategy that uses global similarity to represent task-specific status to adaptively determine the fusion weight of local similarity, thus effectively fusing the dual similarities for better classification. Besides, the salient parts of features are highlighted using channel and spatial attentions to improve feature representation while adjusting the importance of local descriptors. As the input to the similarity metric, these more informative features further boost its discriminative ability. Moreover, a contrastive learning loss is introduced to overcome the potential overfit to base classes and learn more generic features. Additionally, we extend the PAC-Bayes-Bernstein bound to FSL setting, introducing a theoretically grounded measure for assessing generalization. Theoretical analysis validates the generalization improvement of AdptGL-CA. Comprehensive experiments indicate that AdptGL-CA achieves competitive performance with few extra parameters on multiple standard and fine-grained few-shot benchmarks, showing the effectiveness.},

  abstract     = {In Big Data-based applications, high-dimensional and incomplete (HDI) data are frequently used to represent the complicated interactions among numerous nodes. A stochastic gradient descent (SGD)-based latent factor analysis (LFA) model can process such data efficiently. Unfortunately, a standard SGD algorithm trains a single latent factor relying on the stochastic gradient related to the current learning error only, leading to a slow convergence rate. To break through this bottleneck, this study establishes an SGD-based LFA model as the backbone, and proposes six proportional-integral-derivative (PID)-incorporated LFA models with diversified PID-controllers with the following two-fold ideas: a) refining the instant learning error in stochastic gradient by the principle of six PID-variants, i.e., a standard PID, an integral separated PID, a gearshift integral PID, a dead zone PID, an anti-windup PID, and an incomplete differential PID, to assimilate historical update information into the learning scheme in an efficient way; b) making the hyper-parameters adaptation by utilizing the mechanism of particle swarm optimization for acquiring high practicality. In addition, considering the diversified PID-variants, an effective ensemble is implemented for the six PID-incorporated LFA models. Experimental results on industrial HDI datasets illustrate that in comparison with state-of-the-art models, the proposed models obtain superior computational efficiency while maintaining competitive accuracy in predicting missing data within an HDI matrix. Moreover, their ensemble further improves performance in terms of prediction accuracy.},

  abstract     = {Optical neural networks (ONNs) have emerged as a promising solution for energy-efficient deep learning. However, their resource-intensive manufacturing process necessitates efficient methods to streamline ONN architectures without sacrificing their performances. Weight pruning presents a potential remedy. Unlike the conventional neural networks, the pruned weights in ONNs are not necessarily zero in general, thereby making most traditional pruning methods inefficient. In this paper, we propose a novel two-stage pruning method tailored for ONNs. In the first stage, a first-order Taylor expansion of the loss function is applied to effectively identify and prune unimportant weights. To determine the shared value for the pruned weights, a novel optimization method is developed. In the second stage, fine-tuning is further applied to adjust the unpruned weights alongside the shared value of pruned weights. Experimental results on multiple public datasets demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed approach. It achieves superior model compression with minimum loss in accuracy over other conventional pruning techniques.},

This paper introduces TUCA-HER for robot manipulation skill learning via Trajectory Utility and Conservative Advantage. We start by computing trajectory utility for experience samples collected in the early stages of training, which allows for dynamic relabeling and significantly enhances sample efficiency. Furthermore, we integrate conservative advantage learning into the actor-critic framework, reshaping rewards to construct TUCA-HER. Finally, we apply TUCA-HER to robot manipulation skill learning tasks, providing details on algorithmic implementation and complexity analysis. Evaluations conducted on OpenAI Fetch and Hand environments demonstrate TUCA-HER's superior performance in sample efficiency and task success rate compared to other algorithms. Notably, in the FetchPickAndPlace task, TUCA-HER showcases a remarkable 46% improvement over the Double experience replay buffer Adaptive Soft Hindsight Experience Replay (DAS-HER).

However, existing methods primarily focus on estimating depth from immediate visual features, leading to severe foreground-background adhesion, which poses challenges for achieving precise depth estimation. In this paper, we propose a depth estimation method called LOEDepth, which can implicitly distinguish foreground objects from the background. In LOEDepth, a latent object embedding module is introduced, which leverages a set of learnable queries to generate latent object proposals from both immediate visual features extracted by the encoder and sparse object features derived through multi-scale deformable attention. These latent object proposals are utilized to perform soft classification on the decoded features to distinguish foreground objects from the background. Additionally, as depth boundaries do not always align with semantic boundaries, we propose a novel deep decoder to provide decoding features with rich spatial location retrieval and semantic information. Finally, two mask strategies are utilized to conceal pixels violating the scene's static assumption, so as to mitigate disruptions caused by abnormal pixels during self-supervised training. Experimental results on the KITTI and Make3D datasets demonstrate significant performance improvements and robust fine-grained scene depth estimation capabilities of the proposed method.},

Existing VFL methods exhibit tightly coupled participant parameters, resulting in substantial interdependencies among clients during the prediction phase, which significantly hampers the model's usability. To tackle these challenges, this paper studies a VFL approach with low coupling of parameters between clients. Drawing inspiration from federated cooperation and teacher-supervised learning, we propose a low-coupling vertical federated learning with privileged information paradigm (VFL+), allowing participants to make autonomous predictions. Specifically, VFL+ treats information from other clients as privileged data during the training phase rather than the testing phase, thereby achieving independence in individual model predictions. Subsequently, this paper further investigates three typical scenarios of vertical cooperation and designs corresponding cooperative frameworks.

To overcome this limitation, this research introduces an effective appearance-enriched neural network (AE-Net) with foreground enhancement based on generative adversarial nets (GANs) and an attention mechanism to enrich the appearance of person images while suppressing the influence of the background. Specifically, a channel-grouped convolution and squeeze weighted (CGCSW) module is first proposed to extract the powerful feature representation of individuals. Secondly, a foreground-enhanced and background-suppressed (FEBS) module is proposed to enhance the foreground of individual samples while weakening the impact of the background. Thirdly, A stage-wise consistency loss is presented to enable our model maintain consistent foreground-enhanced and background-suppressed stages. Finally, this study evaluates the proposed method and compares it with state-of-the-art approaches on three public datasets.

In this work, we suggest rethinking the Image Forgery Detection and Localization (IFDL) task from a regression perspective and propose the CatmullRom Splines-based Regression Network (CSR-Net) to address these issues. Specifically, we first design an adaptive CutmullRom splines fitting scheme to predict coarse forged regions. Subsequently, we develop a novel rescoring mechanism that filters out samples with no response in both the classification and instance branches to reduce false positives. Besides, a learnable texture extraction module decouples horizontal and vertical forgery features, extracting more robust contour representations to further refine boundaries and suppress false detections. Compared to segmentation-based methods our method is simple but effective due to the unnecessity of post-processing. Extensive experiments conducted on several challenging benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods qualitatively and quantitatively. Particularly, CSR-Net achieves optimal performance on three real-world datasets, indicating the applicability of our method to real scenarios such as social media and multi-tampered regions.},

However, due to the commonly limited dataset scale and reliance on hard labels (one-hot vectors) in medical image segmentation, deep learning models often overfit, which reduces segmentation performance. To mitigate the problem, we propose an uncertainty driven adaptive self-knowledge distillation (UAKD) model for medical image segmentation that regularizes the training process through self-generated soft labels. The innovation of UAKD is to integrate uncertainty estimation into soft label generation and student network training, ensuring accurate supervision and effective regularization. In detail, UAKD introduce teacher network ensembling to reduce semantic bias in soft labels caused by the teacher networks' fitting biases. An adaptive knowledge distillation mechanism is also proposed, which utilizes uncertainty to generate adaptive weights for soft labels to compute the loss function, thereby efficiently transferring reliable knowledge from the teacher network to the student network while suppressing unreliable information. Finally, we introduce a gradient ascent based cyclic ensemble method to reduce teacher network overfitting on the training data, further enhancing the aforementioned teacher ensembling and uncertainty estimation. Experiments on three medical image segmentation tasks show that UAKD outperforms existing regularization methods and demonstrates the effectiveness of uncertainty estimation for assessing soft label reliability.},

Long short-term memory and convolutional neural networks, in particular, have revolutionized human activity recognition systems by effectively extracting semantic information directly from raw sensor data. However, the acquisition of large, well-annotated human activity datasets remains a considerable challenge due to privacy concerns, as well as the time and cost associated with labeling. To address this, unsupervised semantic representation learning, which bypasses the need for manual annotations, is crucial for utilizing the vast pool of unlabeled sensor data. In this study, we present a novel self-supervised learning network that extracts meaningful representations from sensor data without relying on predefined semantic labels. To address class imbalances, we enhance the synthetic minority oversampling technique, introducing an improved version called iSMOTE, which accurately labels synthetic samples. Additionally, we propose a random masking technique that removes identity mapping from input data, enabling the construction of generic semantic representations for downstream tasks. By utilizing balanced unlabeled data, our network significantly improves human activity recognition while reducing reliance on annotated data. We conducted extensive evaluations and comparisons of our proposed network against various supervised and self-supervised models using datasets from smart environments and wearable sensors. Remarkably, our network outperforms several existing methods across 12 public datasets. For instance, with just 25% of labeled data, our self-supervised network achieved an accuracy of 93.87% on the Ordonez Home A dataset, surpassing the performance of fully supervised methods such as DeepConvLSTM + Attention (84.97%), HAR + Attention (88.55%), and DCC + MSA (90.78%).},

Inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) methods provide the opportunity to recover such reward functions from existing expert demonstrations. However, current IRL methods require intensive computation and excessive memory storage when the state space increases. To this end, we propose a computationally efficient inverse reinforcement learning (e-IRL) approach to 1) simplify the gradient algorithm for the reward network; 2) implement the loss function with feature expectation instead of state visiting frequency; and 3) enable fast, accurate, and automatic feature processing. Specifically, we design a new featurization network to accommodate trajectories and automatically output the aligned feature vectors without human intervention. In addition, this proposed approach derives simplified algorithm formulas to obtain a gradient of loss function to update weights for the reward network. This approach eliminates repeated calculation and excessive storage of gradient parameters from demonstrated trajectories in literature. The feature expectation computation for both the expert (one-shot) and learner (streamlined) is employed to efficiently obtain the important gradient parameters.

  abstract     = {This paper investigates the multi-robot adversarial search (MuRAS) problem, which requires coordinating a team of mobile robots to search for one adversarially moving target in discrete environments. One unique challenge that MuRAS poses to the multi-robot search community in comparison to the canonical multi-robot efficient search (MuRES) problem is that the target adapts its motion model to avoid being detected by the robot team, rendering the environment non-stationary and degrading the performance of most MuRES solutions. In this paper, we first formulate MuRAS as a minimax optimization problem, i.e., the zero sum game, and then propose an algorithm, namely SMC-Searcher, a signal mediated coordination method for decentralized adversarial moving target search. SMC-Searcher enhances the canonical multi-robot search strategy by injecting a global coordination signal that prompts different and thus diversified search strategies for each robot. We demonstrate that SMC-Searcher achieves the best performance, in terms of the target's expected capture time when compared to existing multi-robot search strategies, with a simple yet illustrative example, and further compare its performance with state-of-the-art multi-robot search strategies in two canonical multi-robot search environments, namely OFFICE and MUSEUM. Additionally, SMC-Searcher is integrated into a real multi-robot system for moving target search in a self-constructed indoor environment.},

  abstract     = {Accurate pupil localization is a crucial requirement in gaze estimation, which can be employed to enhance the performance of human-computer interactions. Due to the complexity of practical scenarios, as well as the real-time and accuracy requirements of calculation, accurate pupil localization with robustness and real-time is still a challenging pattern recognition task. This study proposes a new pupil localization method based on Multi-directional Pixel Array Computation (MPAC), together with several optimization strategies including rotation transformation and pixel-array rotation similarity index. These strategies can further improve the localization accuracy by regulating pixel array distribution and fine-tuning the initial localization, respectively. For the application in gaze estimation, the proposed pupil localization method is encapsulated as a light-weight module and integrated into the gaze estimation model. To assess the accuracy and real-time performance of the proposed pupil localization method and compare it with the currently available methods, experiments on the BioID benchmark dataset were implemented. Furthermore, the training and test experiments of gaze estimation models were carried out to verify the contribution of the pupil localization module in improving the performance of gaze estimation. Experimental results show that the proposed method for robust and efficient pupil localization can be employed to achieve comparable performance with state-of-the-art learning-free methods. It has less computational complexity and achieves nearly real-time pupil localization with around 60 frames per second on the BioID benchmark dataset. Moreover, the proposed pupil localization method can be encapsulated as a callable module to improve the test accuracy of the gaze estimation models.},

  abstract     = {Learning-based navigation is a prominent topic in the fields of robotics and Embodied AI. To enhance long-term optimized navigation decisions for robots, an important approach is to incorporate memory mechanisms into policy networks, enabling the construction of scene understanding from historical observations. However, existing memory structures typically store and process raw perceptual features directly, leading to significant inefficiencies in computation and storage due to the inclusion of numerous irrelevant areas, redundant details, and noise. This hampers the robot's ability to learn effective scene cues. This paper introduces a novel memory structure that avoids directly storing perceptual features, opting instead to store lightweight historical self-motion data of the robot. Our navigation system consists of three key stages: estimating inter-frame poses using visual odometry, aggregating these into a global memory feature (since individual frame poses lack explicit cognitive meaning), and utilizing the aggregated memory for navigation decision-making. Our proposed pipeline is end-to-end, ensuring efficient utilization of memory information and close integration with the policy network. Quantitative experiments in photorealistic simulation environments demonstrate that our proposed memory structure can achieve over a 30% increase in environment coverage compared to competitive baselines, with path redundancy reduced to as low as 60% of the baseline. Additionally, computational and storage efficiency are significantly enhanced. Ablation and interpretability experiments further confirm that our system improves the robot's understanding of spatial exploration states, thereby enhancing navigation performance and efficiency. We also validate the system in real-world scenarios.},

  abstract     = {Semi-supervised learning (SSL) is a popular solution to alleviate the high annotation cost in medical image classification. As a main branch of SSL, consistency regularization engages in imposing consensus between the predictions of a single sample from different views, termed as Absolute Location consistency (AL-c). However, only AL-c may be insufficient. Just like when diagnosing a case in practice, besides the case itself, the doctor usually refers to certain related trustworthy cases to make more reliable decisions. Therefore, we argue that solely relying on AL-c may ignore the relative differences across samples, which we interpret as relative locations, and only exploit limited information from one perspective. To address this issue, we propose a Sample Consistency Mean Teacher (SCMT) which not only incorporates AL-c but also additionally enforces consistency between the samples’ relative similarities to its related samples, called Relative Location consistency (RL-c). AL-c and RL-c conduct consistency regularization from two different perspectives, jointly extracting more diverse semantic information for classification. On the other hand, due to the highly similar structures in medical images, the sample distribution could be overly dense in feature space, making their relative locations susceptible to noise. To tackle this problem, we further develop a Sample Scatter Mean Teacher (SSMT) by utilizing contrastive learning to sparsify the sample distribution and obtain robust and effective relative locations. Extensive experiments on different datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method.},

Despite numerous proposed methods, research on representing proteins from multiple views and features remains limited. Moreover, effectively selecting and fusing this information remains an unresolved issue, which hampers prediction accuracy. In this paper, the Multi-View Multi-Feature Evolutionary Deep Fusion (MVMF-EDF) method, which consists of two stages, is proposed to address this challenge. First, a multi-view multi-feature (MVMF) strategy is introduced to construct protein representations from various views and features. Notably, MVMF-EDF incorporates semantic information from a pre-trained language model to enhance protein representation. Second, an evolutionary deep fusion (EDF) approach is employed to automatically select and fuse the extracted features. Experimental results on four benchmark datasets show that MVMF-EDF outperforms baseline models in predicting protein secondary structure. This approach leverages deep neural networks for feature extraction and evolutionary algorithms for feature integration, achieving high accuracy without requiring manual feature fusion design.},

Specifically, SFE highlights defect semantic information of multi-level features by exploiting spatial similarities between the features and high-level features. CFE adaptively selects important defect information and suppresses redundant information through the mutual interaction of cross-level features. The mutual interaction enlarges the difference between foreground and background and facilitates learning more discriminative defect features for complex defects. Extensive experiments on three publicly available defect datasets, magnetic tile (MT), NEU-Seg, and Road defect dataset demonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance.},

  abstract     = {To solve the labor shortage, robots have dramatically changed the world by combining powerful deep learning (DL) technology. Certainly, DL technology has become the key point of the widespread robot application. Efficient DL models depend on high-quality datasets and optimized architectures. However, some open datasets contain anomalous data that degrade model performance. Moreover, complex structures and high computational costs limit the adoption of DL models. This study proposes a dataset purification-based lightweight DL model construction strategy to solve these challenges. Initially, a dataset purification method is developed to filter out the anomaly data in a newly created dataset, which utilizes a lightweight cross-scale DL model OGNet to detect the anomaly data to achieve dataset purification. Subsequently, a highly efficient lightweight OGNet-based object detection (OD) model family, YOLO-OG, is presented to train the purified dataset. To evaluate the proposal, the strategy is implemented on the Empty-dish Recycling Robot. Experiments show that OGNet achieves excellent accuracy with only 0.68 M parameters and 0.35 GFLOPs. On purification Dish-10 dataset, the mean Average Precision (mAP) of YOLO-OG increases a maximum of 4.28% than original Dish-10 dataset. Meanwhile, YOLO-OG outperforms other advanced OD models, achieving the best accuracy of 99.20% mAP and the smallest 1.60 M parameters. YOLO-OG also reaches 99.86% mAP on the Dish-20 open dataset. On three other open datasets, YOLO-OG also shows excellent performance and surpasses most of the other OD models, which confirms the strong generalization ability of YOLO-OG.},

  abstract     = {Graph neural networks (GNNs) are widely utilized in recommender systems because they can produce effective embeddings by incorporating high-order collaborative information from neighbors. However, traditional GNN-based recommendation approaches face limitations in the new item cold-start scenario. This is because new items typically have limited or no neighbors, resulting in incomplete or complete cold-start scenarios. In such cases, traditional GNNs struggle to generate high-quality embeddings due to limited neighbor information. To this end, we propose a Knowledge-Enhanced Graph Learning (KEGL) approach, which ensures the quality of embeddings for new items and further enables effective recommendations under cold-start scenarios. KEGL initially leverages semantic information from knowledge graph to parameterize each node and relation as vector representations. Then, KEGL introduces a knowledge-enhanced guaranteed embedding generator to produce a guaranteed embedding for each entity, which guarantees the embedding quality for each node during the convolution process, especially for cold-start items and their neighbors. Moreover, KEGL employs a knowledge-enhanced gated attention aggregator to capture high-order collaborative information and semantic representations based on the specific characteristics of each node, which guarantees the generation of distinctive embeddings for different types of nodes. Finally, the top $N$ un-interacted items with the highest predicted interaction probability are recommended to target users. Experimental results on two public datasets under cold-start scenarios demonstrate that KEGL outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in terms of new item cold-start recommendations.},

  abstract     = {Electroencephalogram (EEG) is most favorable in epilepsy analysis, but suffered from inconvenient recording and ease in disturbation. Contrastively, the vision-based seizure detection is more feasible in real applications for 24/7 monitoring. However, most vision-based seizure detections follow the supervised training scheme, that is usually tedious and time-consuming in data annotations. With these regards, an effective instance-level based spatio-temporal memory autoencoder, called STMemAE, is proposed for unsupervised vision-based seizure detection in this paper. In STMemAE, YOLOv5 object detection algorithm is first applied to build an instance-level based memory AE since the frame-level based AE cannot well adapt to new scenarios. A convolutional encoder is then used to extract both the posture and motion features of the subjects. A two-stream memory net aiming to generate both spatial and temporal memory-augmented features is further developed to linearly combine the memory items. Finally, the outputs of two streams are delivered to decoder for detection. Moreover, the gradient loss is used together with the intensity loss in the training stage for better future frame generation on interictal data, which can also speedup the network training. The performance is evaluated on the video dataset recorded in Children's Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine (CHZU), consisting video sequences of 15 childhood epilepsy patients. Results show that STMemAE can achieve 98.16% of Area Under Curve (AUC), and outperforms several popular deep learning models as well as many unsupervised vision-based seizure detection methods.},

  abstract     = {Multi-label feature selection is an emerging topic that focuses on selecting the relevant and informative features (attributes or variables) from a dataset when dealing with multi-label classification (MLC) problems. In the context of MLC, where feature interactions can vary significantly, evolutionary computation (EC) techniques might provide a more adaptive and flexible feature selection mechanism. Despite this potential, there is a noticeable scarcity of applications employing EC in the existing literature. In this paper, we introduce an ABC variant for multi-label feature selection (called LNABC_ES) that incorporates logic operators and a natural survivor selection, along with a filter-based elimination strategies. The LNABC_ES approach begins by narrowing down the potential feature pool using a filter-based pre-elimination strategy. The LNABC_ES algorithm then searches for an optimal feature subset within this refined space. Experimental results underscore the superior performance of LNABC_ES in comparison to various EC and traditional approaches. To the best of our knowledge, this study represents the first application of the ABC algorithm in the domain of multi-label feature selection, marking a significant advancement in the field.},

  abstract     = {Classification of incomplete data remains a challenging task since the distribution of training and test sets may be inconsistently caused by missing values. To address such a problem, this paper investigates an incomplete data transfer calibration classification (IDTC) method based on Dempster-Shafer theory to improve the accuracy by modeling uncertainty and imprecision due to missing values. The proposed IDTC method consists of three aspects. First, incomplete samples are imputed by complete neighbors, and the trained basic classifier then classifies the test sample to obtain the preliminary result. Second, a data transfer framework is presented to map the test sample to the training set. Afterward, the mapped training samples optimize multiple calibration matrices to calibrate the preliminary classification result. The calibration matrix is learned by minimizing the deviation between the classification results of mapped training samples and the truth. Third, each calibrated classification result is considered as a piece of evidence under Dempster-Shafer theory. As a result, these pieces of evidence with different discounting factors are fused to make the final decision. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed IDTC is widely validated on real datasets by critically comparing to other typical methods.},

  abstract     = {Neuromorphic computing represents hardware and software paradigms that emulate neural brain functionalities. Spiking neural networks (SNNs) are a promising brain-inspired computing approach to achieve power efficiency through event-driven processing using discrete asynchronous spikes, making them particularly effective for spatiotemporal data processing. The complex computational nature of SNNs requires intensive calculations and specialized algorithms to ensure accurate performance across different tasks. Hardware accelerators for neuromorphic computing, particularly for SNN implementations, have emerged primarily through field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) and application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs). FPGAs are especially attractive for neuromorphic computing due to their flexibility, stability, programmability, reconfigurability, and rapid time to market. This research explores top-tier and well-known journal articles from the IEEE Xplore digital library and the Google Scholar databases including IEEE, ACM, Frontiers, Elsevier, Springer, MDPI, Wiley, arXiv, and Nature publishers. In this survey, various energy-efficient and high-performance FPGA implementations of spiking neurons and SNNs are reviewed. The accuracy rates of the implemented SNNs on different applications are investigated. Also, digital hardware optimization techniques for reconfigurable implementations are discussed. The synthesis results from the presented implementations are reported and compared in terms of cost (referring to utilized resources such as Registers/FFs, LUTs, Multipliers, DSP blocks, and Block RAMs), speed, and power/energy consumption. The survey concludes with recommendations for future research directions in FPGA-based neuromorphic computing.},

The existing literature on FL mainly focuses on optimizing learning to enhance convergence time and accuracy. However, the need for developing incentivisation strategies to motivate clients to actively participate in training is a highly relevant area of research within FL.Considering the relevance of the problem,the need for a comprehensive review of incentive mechanism development and working in FL is really high. Initially, this survey provides a basic introduction into FL and incentive mechanisms. Secondly, the fundamental aspects of incentivisation are covered, including formally defining incentivisation, the rationale behind incentivisation, benefits of incentivising clients, implementation methods, and aspects of bias. Next, different types of incentive distribution mechanisms, auction theory, contract theory, and game theory are introduced and discussed in detail, citing methodologies and limitations. Following this, the survey presents contribution evaluation mechanisms, discussing the detailed workings of Shapley value and reputation-based systems. Motivated by the inferences generated, studies on fairness during incentivisation are also presented. Lastly, some of the major considerations in incentivized FL related to cross-silo applications, free-riders, straggler mitigation, and blockchain systems are presented, followed by a discussion on open research problems and prospective research directions. Collectively, the study provides readers with a state-of-the-art and comprehensive perspective on incentivisation in FL, hoping to be a benchmark for future researchers studying fundamental aspects and applications across various domains.},

  abstract     = {The rise of Deepfake technology poses a formidable threat to the credibility of both judicial evidence and intellectual property safeguards. Current methods lack the ability to integrate the texture information of facial features into CNNs, despite the fact that fake contents are subtle and pixel-level. Due to the fixed grid kernel structure, CNNs are limited in their ability to describe detailed fine-grained information, making it challenging to achieve accurate image detection through pixel-level fine-grained features. To mitigate this problem, we propose a Pixel Difference Convolution (PDC) to capture local intrinsic detailed patterns via aggregating both intensity and gradient information. To avoid the redundant feature computations generated by PDC and explicitly enhance the representational power of a standard convolutional kernel, we separate PDC into vertical/horizontal and diagonal parts. Furthermore, we propose an Ensemble Dilated Convolution (EDC) to explore long-range contextual dependencies and further boost performance. We introduce a novel network, Pixel Difference Convolutional Network (PDCNet), which is built with PDC and EDC to expose Deepfake by capturing faint traces of tampering hidden in portrait images. By leveraging PDC and EDC in the information propagation process, PDCNet seamlessly incorporates both local and global pixel differences. Comprehensive experiments are performed on three databases, FF++, Celeb-DF, and DFDC to confirm that our PDCNet outperforms existing approaches. Our approach achieves accuracies of 0.9634, 0.9614, and 0.8819 in FF++, Celeb-DF, and DFDC, respectively.},

However, supervised learning deeply relies on large-scale annotated data, which is expensive, time-consuming, and even impractical to acquire in medical imaging applications. Moreover, effective utilization of annotation resources might not always be feasible during the annotation process. To optimize the utilization of annotation resources, a proposed active learning framework is introduced that is applicable to both 2D and 3D segmentation and classification tasks. This framework aims to reduce annotation costs by selecting more valuable samples for annotation from the pool of unlabeled data. Based on the perturbation consistency, we apply different perturbations to the input data and propose a perturbation consistency evaluation module to evaluate the consistency among predictions when applying different perturbations to the data. Subsequently, we rank the consistency of each data and select samples with lower consistency as high-value candidates. These selected samples are prioritized for annotation. We extensively validated our proposed framework on three publicly available and challenging medical image datasets, Kvasir Dataset, COVID-19 Infection Segmentation Dataset, and BraTS2019 Dataset. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed framework can achieve significantly improved performance with fewer annotations in 2D classification and segmentation and 3D segmentation tasks. The proposed framework enables more efficient utilization of annotation resources by annotating more representative samples, thus enhancing the model's robustness with fewer annotation costs.},

  abstract     = {The growing complexity of modern network systems has increased the need for efficient multi-objective routing (MOR) algorithms. However, existing MOR methods face significant challenges, particularly in terms of computation time, which becomes problematic in networks with short-lived tasks where rapid decision-making is essential. The Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II) offers a promising approach to addressing these challenges. Nevertheless, directly applying NSGA-II in dynamic network environments, where states frequently change, is impractical. This paper presents GAMR, an enhanced non-dominated sorting Genetic Algorithm II-based dynamic multi-objective QoS routing algorithm, which leverages QoS metrics for its multi-objective function. Introducing novel initialization and crossover strategies, our approach efficiently identifies optimal solutions within a brief runtime. Implemented within a Software-defined Network controller for routing, GAMR outperforms existing multi-objective algorithms, exhibiting notable improvements in performance indicators. Specifically, enhancements range from 3.4% to 22.8% on the Hypervolume metric and from 33% to 86% on the Inverted Generational Distance metric. In terms of network metrics, experimental results demonstrate significant reductions in forwarding delay and packet loss rate to 41.25 ms and 3.9%, respectively, even under challenging network configurations with only 2 servers and up to 100 requests.},

To this end, we propose a novel framework, the Aspect-aware Graph Interaction Attention Network (AGIAN), which concentrates on aspect-related information implicitly in sentences and identifies its corresponding sentiment polarity. Specifically, first, we introduce an aspect-aware graph to represent potential associations between the implicit aspect category and the sentence. Then, we utilize two types of graph neural networks to extract rich relational semantics. Finally, we design a graph interaction mechanism to integrate sentiment features specific to the aspect category for sentiment classification. We evaluate the performance of the proposed framework on six publicly available benchmark datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate that, compared to some competitive baseline methods, AGIAN can effectively improve accuracy and achieve state-of-the-art performance on the F1-score.},

  abstract     = {In real-world applications, class-imbalanced datasets pose significant challenges for machine learning algorithms, such as support vector machines (SVMs), particularly in effectively managing imbalance, noise, and outliers. Fuzzy support vector machines (FSVMs) address class imbalance by assigning varying fuzzy memberships to samples; however, their sensitivity to imbalanced datasets can lead to inaccurate assessments. The recently developed slack-factor-based FSVM (SFFSVM) improves traditional FSVMs by using slack factors to adjust fuzzy memberships based on misclassification likelihood, thereby rectifying misclassifications induced by the hyperplane obtained via different error cost (DEC). Building on SFFSVM, we propose an improved slack-factor-based FSVM (ISFFSVM) that introduces a novel location parameter. This novel parameter significantly advances the model by constraining the DEC hyperplane's extension, thereby mitigating the risk of misclassifying minority class samples. It ensures that majority class samples with slack factor scores approaching the location threshold are assigned lower fuzzy memberships, which enhances the model's discrimination capability. Extensive experimentation on a diverse array of real-world KEEL datasets demonstrates that the proposed ISFFSVM consistently achieves higher F1-scores, Matthews correlation coefficients (MCC), and area under the precision-recall curve (AUC-PR) compared to baseline classifiers. Consequently, the introduction of the location parameter, coupled with the slack-factor-based fuzzy membership, enables ISFFSVM to outperform traditional approaches, particularly in scenarios characterized by severe class disparity.},

This study proposes an Enhanced FGL framework based on K-core Structure Feature Encoding (FedKcore) to utilize various heterogeneous graphs efficiently. The nested chain structure containing rich information and linear encoding time make K-core structural attributes highly suitable for graph enhancement and aggregate sharing on edge devices. Client personalization capabilities are enhanced by combining original features with K-core attributes for local training. To improve convergence speed and overcome the non-IID challenge, we aggregate and share only the learnable parameters related to K-core attributes. Upon this, the introduced Circle Loss function optimizes feature space and boundaries, enhancing the performance of K-core attributes. Extensive experiments on heterogeneous graphs show that, compared to the state-of-the-art FedStar, FedKcore improves accuracy by over 1.3% and speeds up convergence by 1.3 times.},

  abstract     = {In this article, a novel event-sampled adaptive fuzzy control solution is developed for the tracking issue of maritime autonomous surface ships (MASS) under a cyber environment. In the control design, the network resources constraint, internal/external uncertainties and input saturations are involved. To save the issue of network resources, only the intermittent position data is transmitted for the control design of MASS, and an event-sampled adaptive fuzzy state observer (ESAFSO) that only depends on the intermittent position data is designed to recover the untransmitted velocity. The designed ESAFSO is independent of the design of control law, which can coordinate the network resource-saving and uncertainty compensation. In addition, to accommodate the effect resulting from the event sample, which makes the signal discontinuous required by control design, a new design method is developed by using the backstepping design framework with a multivariable dynamic surface control technique. Furthermore, a dynamic event triggering mechanism is established in the controller-actuator (C-A) channel, and a novel adaptive fuzzy output feedback control solution is developed. Under Lyapunov theory, it is indicated that, under the proposed event-sampled adaptive fuzzy control solution for the MASS only intermittent position data, all signals of the closed-loop control system are proved to be bounded. The effectiveness of the developed control solution is illustrated by simulations.},

  abstract     = {Traffic flow prediction is crucial in smart cities and traffic management, yet it presents challenges due to intricate spatial-temporal dependencies and external factors. Most existing research relied on a traditional data selection approach to represent temporal dependence. However, only considering spatial dependence in adjacent or distant regions limits the performance. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end Parallel Convolution Residual network (PCR) for grid-based traffic flow prediction. First, we introduce a novel data selection strategy to capture more temporal dependence, and then we implement an early fusion strategy without any additional operations to obtain a lighter model. Second, we propose to extract external features with feature embedding matrix operations, which can represent the interrelationships between different kinds of external data. Finally, we build a parallel residual network with concatenated features as input, which is composed of a standard residual net (SRN) to extract short spatial dependence and a dilated residual net (DRN) to extract long spatial dependence. Experiments on three traffic flow datasets TaxiBJ, BikeNYC, and TaxiCQ exhibit that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art models with the most minor parameters.},

However, due to the lack of benchmark datasets, evaluating the capabilities of medical LLMs remains challenging, particularly in highly specialized fields such as anesthesiology. To address this gap, we introduce a comprehensive anesthesiology benchmark dataset in Chinese, known as the Chinese Anesthesiology Benchmark (CAB). This benchmark facilitates the evaluation of medical LLMs for anesthesiology across three crucial dimensions: knowledge, application, and safety. Specifically, the CAB provides more than 8 k questions collected from examinations and books for knowledge-level evaluation; more than 2 k questions collected from online anesthesia consultations and hospitals for application-level evaluation; and 136 tests from seven anesthesia medical care scenarios for safety-level evaluation. With the proposed CAB dataset, we conducted a thorough evaluation of six medical LLMs, such as Bianque-2 and HuatuoGPT-13B, and eleven general LLMs, such as Qwen-7B-Chat and GPT-4. The evaluation results revealed that there are still clear gaps in the capacities of medical LLMs for anesthesiology compared with those of medical students in the field of anesthesia. We hope that the proposed CAB dataset can facilitate the development of medical LLMs for anesthesiology.},

VSI-IoT has significant features, including sensing, computing, analyzing, and storing, to address the issues of bearing failures, such as unplanned outages, increased downtime, and reduced operational efficiency. By contrast, providing privacy to the IIoT environments is a challenging task. Thus, this paper presents a novel privacy-preserving learning (PPL) mechanism that senses the defect rate of bearing failures using lightweight model aggregation at edge computing systems to preserve the privacy features. This convergence model synthesizes shape features comprehensively to transform the feature vectors into predictive functions that examine the categorization models using a two-dimensional convolution neural network (2D-CNN). Using security analysis, we demonstrate that the proposed PPL can achieve better privacy protection and model accuracy to preserve the learning features without additional verifiability. Further, the examination results showed that the proposed 2D-CNN with BN and LN consumed less computation complexity to achieve better detection accuracy $(\approx 87.91.9\%$ to $\approx 99.98\%)$ and communication cost $ (\approx 21.09MB$ to $ 23.92MB)$ over three bearing datasets (i.e., IMS-Rexnord, CWRU, and Paderborn) than other state-of-the-art approaches. Above all, the privacy preserving based AlexNet was implemented using CryptoNet and LoLa to show different sets of efficiencies such as processing time, privacy, and integrity checks to preserve system performance following time-sensitive application scenarios like supply-chain optimization.},

  abstract     = {Video-based violence recognition has become a crucial research topic with the wide usage of surveillance cameras. However, recognizing violent behavior from video data is challenging because of the additional temporal dimension, the lack of a precise range of violent behavior, and the complex backgrounds that make recognizing the interaction between objects difficult. Previous works have ambiguous reasoning of temporal features and insufficient understanding of action relationships. To address these issues, we propose a hierarchical temporal excitation network, which is effective for learning deep object interactions in spatio-temporal information and utilizing the interaction to robustly identify violent behaviors even in complex scenarios. The model we proposed comprises of two modules for temporal excitation, namely the shift temporal adaptive module (STAM) and the sparse object interaction transformer module (SOI-Tr). STAM extracts coarse-grained temporal information by fusing the shift component with the temporal adaptive modeling component. Furthermore, considering that deep-layer temporal features are more conducive to network understanding, SOI-Tr is introduced to excite fine-grained temporal representation reasoning by critical object attention. We conduct extensive experiments on mainstream violence datasets and a new constructed multi-class violence (MCV) dataset. The results show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art works and is superior in understanding the object interaction in violent behavior recognition.},

While learning-based control offers intriguing real-time control properties and generalization, it has shortcomings when it comes to long offline training requirements. To address this limitation, this paper introduces a real-time optimal navigation control approach based on Broad Learning (BL) for the trajectory planning problem of Automatic Guided Vehicle (AGV) in the presence of obstacle constraints. The proposed framework fully leverages the optimality achieved through traditional optimal control methods and the novel BL approach. To achieve this, the optimal control problem (OCP) is first constructed and then solved offline for the long-term trajectory planning problem for an AGV working within obstacle constraints. After that, an optimal state-control dataset is acquired with the task information embedding. Subsequently, the BL architecture is meticulously designed and trained offline using the dataset to acquire proficiency in the optimal state-control mapping, and a secondary improvement based on the spectral norm constraint is introduced into the original BL architecture. Consequently, this well-trained BL-based controller is proficiently employed to provide feedback control based on the AGV's current state. The numerical simulation section provides a comparative analysis of the network training time consumption for the BL method and the Deep Neural Network (DNN) method, and the impact of different feature representation methods on the BL-based controller is discussed. Additionally, a local re-planning framework for scenario alterations is proposed based on favourable performances. It further showcases the method's ability to mitigate the excessively long offline training times typically associated with learning-based approaches.},

  abstract     = {Many learning scenarios involve non-Euclidean data. For instance, in electroencephalogram (EEG) or image classification, the input can be characterized by symmetric positive-definite (SPD) matrices. These matrices live on the curved Riemannian manifold instead of the flat Euclidean space. In such situations, classical Euclidean learning methods may fail due to the non-Euclidean nature of the data. This article proposes to generalize robust soft learning vector quantization (RSLVQ) targeted for Euclidean data to cope with such data in the log-Euclidean framework. Log-Euclidean metric learning (LEML) is incorporated into the RSLVQ framework, jointly learning the prototypes on the manifold and the distance metric tensor of the tangent map that projects the original tangent space to a more discriminative one. Two methods are subsequently proposed to learn the distance metric tensor. It is firstly confined to have full rank and treated as an SPD matrix, which is learned using the log-Euclidean framework. Then, this constraint is removed letting it become a symmetric positive semidefinite (SPSD) matrix, which is learned using the quotient geometry. In addition, we propose to adapt the variance parameter introduced in the probabilistic modelling during the training course of the classifier by the minimization of the negative log likelihood function with respect to this parameter. Experiments on multiple data sets with different properties show the proposed methods have good classification performances and low computational complexities.},

To address this issue, we propose a novel multi-scale efficient graph convolutional network (MSE-GCN) for skeleton-based SLR.

To address these problems, an image enhancement network based on multi-scale residual feature integration (IEN-MRFI) is proposed, which includes two modules: a shallow feature extraction module (SFEM) and a multi-scale feature integration module (MFIM). First, the SFEM is constructed for extracting multi-scale shallow features through three-scale convolutional layers and smooth convolution residual blocks (SCRBs). The constructed SCRB runs through the entire network to extract features and avoid gridding artifacts. Then, the MFIM is constructed by cascading multiple feature integration residual blocks to fuse the shallow and deep features of the same scale. Finally, the fused features are passed through a convolutional layer to obtain an enhanced result. In addition, to improve the generalization ability of our network, this study constructs an outdoor dataset for the training of the low-light image enhancement network. Experiments on indoor and outdoor images show that the enhancement results of our method can provide more accurate color saturation and richer details than those of some state-of-the-art methods.

However, the oversight of inter-view correlations has led to suboptimal outcomes. Furthermore, the conventional method of constructing an $N \times N$ graph in multi-view clustering imposes a substantial time burden when dealing with large-scale scenarios. To address these challenges, this paper presents an efficient multi-view clustering approach via Essential Tensorized Bipartite Graph Learning (ETBGL). Specifically, ETBGL utilizes the low-rank tensor Schatten $p$-norm to capture inter-view similarity, effectively capturing high-order correlation information embedded in multiple views. Simultaneously, by incorporating bipartite graph learning, ETBGL efficiently mitigates the computational demands and spatial complexity associated with tensor operations. Additionally, we introduce the $\ell _{2,1}$-norm of tensor as a sparse penalty to the error term, with the aim of filtering out noise and preserving shared information, thus enhancing clustering robustness. We solve our objective by an efficient algorithm that is time-economical and has good convergence.

Our study focuses on the utilization of EDL, composed of auto-encoders (AEs) for out-of-distribution (OoD) detection. EDL offers straightforward interpretability and valuable practical insights. Conventionally, employing multiple AEs in an ensemble requires regular training for each model whenever substantial changes occur in the data, a process that can become computationally expensive, especially when dealing with large ensembles. To address this computational challenge, we introduce an innovative strategy that treats ensemble UQ as a regression problem. During initial training, once the uncertainty distribution is established, we map this distribution to one ensemble member. This approach ensures that during subsequent trainings and inferences, only one ensemble member and the regression model are needed to predict uncertainties, eliminating the need to maintain the entire ensemble. This streamlined approach is particularly advantageous for systems with limited computational resources or situations that demand rapid decision-making, such as alert management in cybersecurity. Our evaluations on five benchmark OoD detection data sets demonstrate that the uncertainty estimates obtained with our proposed method can, in most cases, align with the uncertainty distribution learned by the ensemble, all while significantly reducing the computational resource requirements.},

  abstract     = {Time-series anomaly detection uncovers rare errors or intriguing events of interest that significantly deviate from normal patterns. In order to precisely detect anomalies, a detector needs to capture intricate underlying temporal dynamics of a time series, often in multiple scales. Thus, a fixed-designed neural network may not be optimal for capturing such complex dynamics as different time-series data require different learning processes to reflect their unique characteristics. This paper proposes a Prediction-based neural Architecture Search for Time series Anomaly detection framework, dubbed PASTA. Unlike previous work, besides searching for a connection between operations, we design a novel search space to search for optimal connections in the temporal dimension among recurrent cells within/between each layer, i.e., temporal connectivity, and encode them via multi-level configuration encoding networks. Experimental results from both real-world and synthetic benchmarks show that the discovered architectures by PASTA outperform the second-best state-of-the-art baseline by around 13.6% in the enhanced time-series aware $F_{1}$ score on average, confirming that the design of temporal connectivity is critical for time-series anomaly detection.},

In this paper, we studied the problem of recovering the router-level topologies of networks with mobile crowdsourcing and proposed a method based on graph embedding (called GE) for accurate identification of anonymous network routers from traceroute measurement data. We first use the graph embedding method to capture the connection characteristics of different interfaces of anonymous routers from the traceroute data and then, evaluate the distances between interfaces based on the extracted connection characteristics. Finally, we identify the interfaces that belong to the same anonymous router by using a heuristic maximum likelihood estimation algorithm that we have developed. Compared to the existing methods, GE is more felxible in ITS because it identifies anonymous network routers without requiring manually predefined subgraphs (or patterns). In the evaluation, we simulated a variety of scenarios to generate the measurement data and compared GE to two state-of-the-art methods (the neighborhood matching method and the graph induction-based method). The results suggest that GE can significantly improve the accuracy of anonymous router identification (with an average improvement of over 20%) at a slight identification rate loss (less than 4%).},

  abstract     = {In this study, we address the challenges of non-convex optimization in neural networks (NNs) by formulating the training of multilayer perceptron (MLP) NNs as a difference of convex functions (DC) problem. Utilizing the basic convex–concave algorithm to solve our DC problems, we introduce two alternative optimization techniques, DC-GD and DC-OPT, for determining MLP parameters. By leveraging the non-uniqueness property of the convex components in DC functions, we generate strongly convex components for the DC NN cost function. This strong convexity enables our proposed algorithms, DC-GD and DC-OPT, to achieve an iteration complexity of $O\left(\log \left(\frac{1}{\varepsilon }\right)\right)$, surpassing that of other solvers, such as stochastic gradient descent (SGD), which has an iteration complexity of $O\left(\frac{1}{\varepsilon }\right)$. This improvement raises the convergence rate from sublinear (SGD) to linear (ours) while maintaining comparable total computational costs. Furthermore, conventional NN optimizers like SGD, RMSprop, and Adam are highly sensitive to the learning rate, adding computational overhead for practitioners in selecting an appropriate learning rate. In contrast, our DC-OPT algorithm is hyperparameter-free (i.e., it requires no learning rate), and our DC-GD algorithm is less sensitive to the learning rate, offering comparable accuracy to other solvers. Additionally, we extend our approach to a convolutional NN architecture, demonstrating its applicability to modern NNs. We evaluate the performance of our proposed algorithms by comparing them to conventional optimizers such as SGD, RMSprop, and Adam across various test cases. The results suggest that our approach is a viable alternative for optimizing shallow MLP NNs.},

  abstract     = {Federated learning (FL) is revolutionizing mobile computing and IoT development by enhancing data privacy. However, restricted computational and communication resources and the statistical variability of data stored on devices present substantial obstacles to ongoing progress in FL. We introduce EarlyBirdFL, a novel FL framework that leverages an Early-Bird Ticket-inspired pruning and masking technique for efficient training and communication in federated settings. EarlyBirdFL enables each client to achieve fast local training by identifying efficient subnetworks early in the training process, communicating only these pruned networks between the server and the client. Unlike classical personalized FL, in which the client-side model learns differences, EarlyBirdFL allows each client to identify these efficient subnetworks using a mask metric quickly. Experimental results demonstrate that EarlyBirdFL outperforms traditional computation time and accuracy methods, achieving a 1.53-4.98 times speedup and 1.01-1.15 times higher accuracy. Furthermore, EarlyBirdFL remains stable even when its parameters are adjusted and performs well in different non-IID environments, maintaining or surpassing the performance of other methods. This approach combines elements of early efficient subnetwork identification, pruning, masking, and personalized federated learning to address the unique challenges of FL.},

Although the introduction of such techniques has made operating the system easier, it has also made the internal process difficult to interpret. It makes difficult for the operator to solve any issues raised due to any fault in the model design. Designing demand response strategies that are simple to comprehend is crucial for this reason. Hence, the consumer demand response model will exhibit the much-needed system behavior of transparency, trust, and objectivity. The fundamental goal of this research is to introduce an explainable artificially intelligent (XAI) demand response (DR) model based on machine learning (ML) that assures supply-demand equilibrium across the power system network. The proposed methodology combines an integrated load forecasting approach with a DR model based on Jaya optimization. Subsequently, the effectiveness of the DR program is illustrated in relation to the accuracy of the load forecasting model. The operation of this integrated ML-based technique was shown using an XAI-based model architecture. The proposed technique was modelled and tested in the MATLAB interface utilizing a database of 24 end-user energy usage.},

To address the limitations of current DNN-based IML algorithms in accessing global features and segmenting tampered edges, we propose a Dual-shallow Feature Pyramid Fusion (DFPF) module. The DFPF module integrates semantic and texture features through a bidirectional pathway, forming RGB Feature Pyramids (RGBFP) and Local Textual Feature Pyramids (LTFP) using dual Hybrid ResNet50s in a ’Siamese' configuration. These feature pyramids are merged via multi-scale fusion to enhance global pyramid features for decoding. The LTFP branch includes a Pre-processing Block, Parallel Multi-Scale Convolution (PMSC), or Channel Split High-frequency Convolution (CSHC) to capture local textual features and subtle manipulation traces. The Encoder employs Transformer layers for robust global representations. At the same time, the Decoder uses Cascaded Boundary Context Inconsistent Enhancement (BCIE) Blocks to reconstruct a coarse-to-fine binary mask, enhancing texture inconsistencies at manipulated region boundaries. Additionally, we introduce an automated method for generating a large-scale forgery dataset via Photoshop Scripting, reducing labor costs. Our model effectively locates tampered regions of various shapes and sizes, improving boundary anomaly detection. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art models.},

  abstract     = {Domain adaptation (DA), as an emerging computational intelligence technology, is crucial for industrial time-series prediction, since various operating environments and tasks of industrial equipment will lead to variants in the distribution of monitoring data. Recently, many DA methods have been proposed to adapt to cross-domain industrial scenarios with data distribution shifting. However, due to privacy preserving concerns, data owners are reluctant to share their data, resulting in inaccessible source data. The artificial intelligence (AI) model trained by the inaccessible source data can be only applied as a blackbox. This makes it difficult to transfer source domain knowledge to the target domain. To solve this issue, we propose a two-stage source-free domain adaptation method for unsupervised knowledge transfer for industrial time-series prediction. At the first stage, an adversarial training method is proposed to improve the model's ability to represent data in the target domain, which may significantly differ from the source distribution. At the second stage, an unsupervised feature alignment method based on mean-teacher is proposed to align the target domain data with source knowledge. Additionally, we defined two contrastive loss functions to strengthen the consistent representation of target data. Experiments conducted on datasets N-CMAPSS and FEMOTO-ST demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {The Split Delivery Vehicle Routing Problem with Three-Dimensional Loading Constraints (3L-SDVRP) integrates routing and packing problems, aiming to maximize the vehicle load efficiency and minimize the total travel distance. Solving 3L-SDVRP is critical for logistics and transportation industries. However, achieving an appropriate balance between exploration (searching for new solutions) and exploitation (refining known solutions) in metaheuristic algorithms for 3L-SDVRP, especially under limited computational resources, remains challenging. Furthermore, the application of multi-objective optimization algorithms to the 3L-SDVRP remains a largely unexplored area, particularly when considering the inherent trade-offs between the two conflicting objectives. To address these challenges, this paper introduces a new Pareto-based Evolutionary Algorithm with Concurrent crossover and Hierarchical Neighborhood Filtering mutation (PEAC-HNF), distinguished by its novel Hierarchical Neighborhood Filtering (HNF) mutation. The HNF mutation uses diverse neighborhood structures to generate offspring, adopts a hierarchical strategy prioritizing individuals with higher nondomination ranks, and incorporates an offspring filtering process to save computational resources. HNF allows PEAC-HNF to improve its exploitation capabilities while maintaining exploration strengths, achieving a balanced performance. Comparisons with state-of-the-art algorithms across various problem instances (242 instances in total) demonstrate the effectiveness of PEAC-HNF. Further analysis highlights the critical role of the HNF mutation in enhancing algorithmic performance. The utilization of the HNF mutation can extend beyond PEAC-HNF to other complex optimization problems.},

Specifically, we adopt secret sharing and homomorphic encryption to ensure the privacy of graph data, where the user can get the final inference, and the server holds nothing except the model parameters. Moreover, in order to prevent malicious users from interfering with the accuracy of the model, an adversarial example detection mechanism on the ciphertext is designed to identify local embedding submitted by malicious users. During the whole process, both local and global embedding are both protected. The experimental results show that the model accuracy is about 69% and 66% with malicious samples on Cora and Citeseer in the domain of ciphertext respectively and they are nearly same as 70% and 69% in the domain of plaintext, which shows the effectiveness of our protocol.},

Existing literature on semi-supervised learning randomly sample a limited number of data points for labelling. All these labelled samples are then used along with the unlabelled data throughout the training process. In this work, we ask two important questions in this context: 1) does it matter which samples are selected for labelling? 2) does it matter how the labelled samples are used throughout the training process along with the unlabelled data? To answer the first question, we explore a number of unsupervised methods for selecting specific subsets of data to label (without prior knowledge of their labels), with the goal of maximizing representativeness w.r.t. the unlabelled set. Then, for our second line of inquiry, we define a variety of different label injection strategies in the training process. Extensive experiments on four popular datasets, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, SVHN, and STL-10, show that unsupervised selection of samples that are more representative of the entire data improves performance by up to $\sim$2% over the existing semi-supervised frameworks such as MixMatch, ReMixMatch, FixMatch and others with random sample labelling. We show that this boost could even increase to 7.5% for very few-labelled scenarios. However, our study shows that gradually injecting the labels throughout the training procedure does not impact the performance considerably versus when all the existing labels are used throughout the entire training.},

  abstract     = {The increasing number of actions in the real world makes it difficult for traditional deep-learning models to recognize unseen actions. Recently, pretrained contrastive image-based visual-language (I-VL) models have been adapted for efficient “zero-shot” scene understanding. Pairing such models with transformers to implement temporal modeling has been rewarding for zero-shot action recognition (ZSAR). However, the significance of modeling the local spatial context of objects and action environments remains unexplored. In this work, we propose a ZSAR framework called LoCATe-GAT, comprising a novel Local Context-Aggregating Temporal transformer (LoCATe) and a Graph Attention Network (GAT). Specifically, image and text encodings extracted from a pretrained I-VL model are used as inputs for LoCATe-GAT. Motivated by the observation that object-centric and environmental contexts drive both distinguishability and functional similarity between actions, LoCATe captures multi-scale local context using dilated convolutional layers during temporal modeling. Furthermore, the proposed GAT models semantic relationships between classes and achieves a strong synergy with the video embeddings produced by LoCATe. Extensive experiments on four widely-used benchmarks – UCF101, HMDB51, ActivityNet, and Kinetics – show we achieve state-of-the-art results. Specifically, we obtain relative gains of 3.8% and 4.8% on these datasets in conventional and 16.6% on UCF101in generalized ZSAR settings. For large-scale datasets like ActivityNet and Kinetics, our method achieves a relative gain of 31.8% and 27.9%, respectively, over the previous methods. Additionally, we gain 25.3% and 18.4% on UCF101 and HMDB51 as per the recent “TruZe” evaluation protocol.},

To efficiently assess and manage the images, in this paper, a content-based medical image retrieval (CBMIR) system is suggested as a clinical tool. A global medical image database is established through a collection of data from more than ten countries and dozens of sources, schools and laboratories. The database has more than 536 294 medical images, including 14 imaging modalities, 40 organs and 52 diseases. A multilevel convolutional neural network (MLCNN) using hierarchical progressive feature learning is subsequently proposed to perform hierarchical medical image retrieval, including multiple levels of image modalities, organs and diseases. At each classification level, a dense block is trained through a labeled classification. With the epochs increasing, four training stages are performed to simultaneously train the three levels with different weights of the loss function. Then, the trained features are used in the CBMIR system. The results show that using the MLCNN on a representative dataset can achieve a mAP of 0.86, which is higher than the 0.71 achieved by ResNet152 in the literature. Applying the hierarchical progressive feature learning can achieve a 12%-16% performance improvement in CNNs and outperform vision Transformer with only 63% of the training time. The proposed representative image selection and multilevel architecture improves the efficiency and precision of retrieving large-scale medical image databases.},

  abstract     = {Sparse learning-based feature selection is an emerging topic, acclaimed for its potential in delivering promising performance and interpretability. Nevertheless, the task of determining a suitable regularization parameter to strike a balance between the loss function and regularization is a challenging endeavor, where existing methods encounter great difficulties. Moreover, the ranking mechanism in most sparse learning-based feature selection methods requires a predefined number of selected features, which is usually dataset-dependent and not known in advance. It is of great importance to automatically balance the loss function and sparse regularization and determine the appropriate number of selected features. To this end, this paper proposes formulating the sparse learning-based feature selection problem as a bi-objective optimization problem, which takes the loss term and the $\ell _{2,0}$-norm regularization as two objectives, to automatically identify the optimal number of selected features and obtain a set of trade-off solutions between the loss term and the number of selected features. To solve such a non-convex problem, a novel solution representation, an initialization strategy, and an environmental selection operator are proposed. Compared with seven feature selection methods, extensive experiments on 16 practical classification datasets demonstrate that the proposed method attains highly competitive classification accuracy with a small number of selected features, and the features selected by the proposed method have low redundancy.},

  abstract     = {Low-light Small Salient Object Detection (LS-SOD) focuses on small salient objects in low light, a crucial and realistic problem for nighttime automatic driving and surveillance. However, relatively few efforts have been put toward LS-SOD due to the challenge of collecting and precisely annotating massive LS-SOD data. To advance the research and evaluation in this area, we elaborately collect the first new real LS-SOD dataset, termed Low light Salient Pedestrian/Vehicle (LSPV) dataset. LSPV comprises 3,100 low-light small pedestrians/vehicles images and covers diverse, challenging cases (e.g., low-light, non-uniform illumination environment, and small objects). Meanwhile, to mitigate the large-scale training data scarcity and avoid laborious manual labeling, we proposed a Scale-Illumination (SI) data augmentation method to easily create infinite LS-SOD samples with diverse illumination and salient object scale sizes. Another reason for the under-exploration of LS-SOD is the technical difficulty posed by partially low contrast and limited visual information of small objects in low light, which hinders existing SOD methods from accurately locating and segmenting salient objects. To this end, we propose a baseline LS-SOD network named Illumination and Edge-Driven Network (IEDNet), which explicitly learns illumination and edge features to guide saliency detection. Furthermore, a practical Crop-Fusion (CF) post-processing strategy is further proposed to refine the initial saliency maps. Extensive experiments show that our SI and CF strategies significantly improve current SOD models' performance on the LS-SOD dataset. Moreover, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on both the real LS-SOD and DUTS-TE datasets.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, significant advancements have been made in the domain of image restoration, particularly in the context of repairing damaged images and super-resolution reconstruction, primarily owing to the emergence of deep learning techniques. However, during the course of transmission across various media devices, the original image quality may deteriorate due to factors such as the network environment, hardware constraints, and related conditions. Moreover, the restoration process becomes increasingly challenging when the original image quality is low or compromised. Presently, prevailing methods involve repairing the image prior to performing super-resolution reconstruction. However, this methodology typically relies on the utilization of multiple autonomous models, where the efficacy and time efficiency are not optimal. In light of this, we propose a novel neural network model based on GAN, termed ISRnet, designed to repair damaged compressed images. Our method is the first to leverage GAN networks specifically for compressed image restoration. ISRnet integrates the principles of image inpainting and super-resolution reconstruction, enabling the transformation of low-resolution images into high-resolution counterparts during the restoration process, thereby achieving superior restoration outcomes. Despite the partial increase in bias, this approach counteracts the variability inherent in a singularly trained neural network model. Compared to a single neural network model trained on the same dataset, our model demonstrates reduced variance and diminished sensitivity to data, thereby achieving optimal restoration quality and expedited repair speeds for damaged compressed images. Consequently, our proposed methodology presents a promising avenue for the utilization of neural networks in repairing damaged compressed images.},

In this study, we develop an adaptative scaler-moment crystal graph attention neural network (SM-CGANN) for predicting crystal material properties. The graph neural network is enhanced using scalar moment aggregation functions and attention mechanism, controlling chemical information exchange between the central atom and its neighbors. Graph pooling increases the information transmission rate by maximizing mutual information between the pooled and input graphs. In addition, we incorporate the multi-objective Bayesian optimization method to quickly find the best hyperparameters and network architecture, ensuring an adaptive balance between the prediction accuracy and spatial complexity of SM-CGANN. This method is superior to state-art-of models in terms of accuracy performance for different material properties in density function functional theory calculation datasets (Materials Project and Open Quantum Materials Database). Moreover, it provides highly accurate performance of end-user scenarios involving the classification of metal/nonmetal and high-/weak-magnetic materials using the Open Quantum Materials Database dataset.},

These existing tracking methods focus on designing the strategies of target association, based on the predictions of object detectors. Since the detection and association phases are independent, many duplicate calculations may occur in the feature extraction procedure, which is time-consuming. Aiming to effectively combine these two phases, an integrated network architecture is proposed in this work to extract the common features for object detection and the differentiating features for target association simultaneously. The multi-task head structure and the specific loss function of this integrated network have been designed to avoid coupling issues in the model training procedure. Furthermore, sample groups of adjacent frames are used to enhance the processing capacity of the personal gradual variance of these tracked targets. Background modeling and a Kalman filter are used to improve tracking accuracy. In the simulation, the proposed tracker achieves better performance than other state-of-the-art trackers on the tested publicly available databases.},

In the first phase, we use a novel boundary optimization module to leverage rich semantic information and boundary details to integrate multiscale local and global features captured and weighted by a backbone network and channel attention. Then, we use the optimized boundary features in a cross-scale feature fusion module to further improve the scene parsing accuracy in the second phase. Finally, a cross-scale feature fusion module is adopted aiming at integrating convolutional neural network features in the foreground region.

  abstract     = {Semi-supervised learning (SSL) is emerging as the dominant paradigm in medical image analysis, which can leverage abundant unlabeled data under the assumption of the same distribution with labeled data. However, out-of-distribution (OOD) unlabeled data are ubiquitous in clinical practice, often originating from diverse populations, devices, and settings. Most of current SSL methods leverage unlabeled data in a uniform way, which deteriorates the model performance caused by: 1) the unreliable knowledge derived from OOD unlabeled data, and 2) the confirmation bias induced by unreliable pseudo labels. In this work, we propose a unified reliability-aware SSL framework (RSSL), which integrates automatic identification of reliable unlabeled data with pseudo-label self-refinement schemes to tackle the above challenges. Specifically, we introduce a weight network to automatically assess the reliability of unlabeled data. This allows us to capture the reliable knowledge derived from the unlabeled data and safely blend it into the downstream tasks. Additionally, we introduce a pseudo-label self-refinement scheme to alleviate the negative effect of confirmation bias on model training. The synergistic learning between reliable unlabeled data identification and pseudo-label self-refinement during the training process enhances the robustness and generalizability of the model. Extensive experiments conducted on three public medical image datasets demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {Recurrent neural networks (RNN) have been extensively used to address the problem of Bayesian inference of a hidden Markov model (HMM). However, such artificial neural architectures are prone to computationally exhaustive training procedures and high energy dissipation. Spiking neural networks (SNNs) are recently explored for performing similar tasks. An interesting problem on Bayesian inference of hidden Markov models (HMM) on SNN paradigm is addressed in this paper. A population based stochastic temporal encoding (PSTE) scheme has been introduced to establish that a spiking neuron behaves as a probabilistic Boolean operator. Using this property the posterior of a hidden state is mapped to probability of firing a logic $HIGH$ by a spiking neuron. Two new algorithms are presented for fixing synaptic strengths denoted by a random variable $q$. The first algorithm uses a sigmoidal relationship from pre-statistical analysis to select the values of $q$ such that the probability of a neuron producing a logic HIGH becomes equal to the posterior probability of a hidden state. The second algorithm considers data for appropriately determining $q$ through in-network-training. It has been demonstrated that Bayesian inference of both two-state HMMs as well as multi-state HMMs are implementable using the concept of PSTE. Two examples are presented, one on inferring the trend of a time series and the other related to deciphering the correct digit of a seven segment LED display with noisy bits. Our framework has performed very closely with traditional Bayesian inference (difference in accuracy $&lt; 2\%$) and traditional RNNs.},

  abstract     = {Nowadays, the deployment of intelligent networks on hardware devices for real-time applications is gaining popularity in both academia and industry. However, on-chip resources and power consumption are usually limited, making quantization a crucial step due to its ability to reduce the computational footprint. To this point, mixed-precision bit-width allocation for weights is an effective way to reduce the overall memory footprint while maximizing model accuracy, which can generally be divided into two schemes: per-layer quantization and per-channel quantization. However, the latter has a large searching space, making it hard to obtain optimal solutions, so currently most research focuses on the former scheme. Additionally, there is almost no research targeting the design and optimization of FPGA accelerator structures for per-channel quantization. Motivated by these considerations, this paper first proposes a mixed-precision bit allocation method, called Hierarchical Bit Programming (HBP), which reduces the magnitude of the search space by applying group optimization on channel dimension and consequently reduce the computational complexity of the solving process. Then a loop optimization strategy is presented based on quantization manner, and models are established to evaluate FPGA performance and resource requirement, enabling the evaluation and analysis of accelerator performance bottlenecks and optimization boundaries in the early phase of system design. Based on the optimization results, a hardware accelerator design structure is presented. Several mainstream CNN models are used for evaluation, and on-board tests are conducted on the Zynq MPSoC XCZU15EG FPGA platform. The experiment results show that our HBP method could achieve an improvement of more than 2% on accuracy compared with other related methods. Compared with CPU and GPU, the proposed FPGA accelerator yields speedups of 28.8%, 46.2%, 31.0%, and 35.9% in energy efficiency on VGG-16, ResNet18, ResNet34, and ResNet50, respectively, and the processing latency could be 25% lower than state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract     = {Panoptic segmentation requires the prediction of a pixel-level mask with a category label in an image. In recent years, panoptic segmentation has been gaining more attention since it can help us understand objects and the environment in many fields, such as medical images, remote sensing images, and autonomous driving. However, existing panoptic segmentation methods are usually challenging for multi-scale object segmentation and boundary localization. In this paper, we propose a Polymerized Feature Panoptic Segmentation (PFPS) to enhance the network's feature representation ability by polymerizing the extracted stage features. Specifically, we propose a Generalization-Enhanced Stage Feature Generation Module (GSFGM) to extract and enhance the stage features. In the GSFGM, a novel Sampled and Concated Feature Generation (SCFG) is designed as an individual component, which polymerizes the convoluted backbone features to enhance multi-scale feature representation. Thereafter, we propose a Stage Feature Re-weight Module (SFRM) to ensure the network can learn efficient information from the massive channels. Moreover, we further propose a Unified Encoder Module (UEM) to provide spatial information and compress the high-dimensional features by coordinating convolution operations and channel attention. To demonstrate the superiority of the proposed PFPS, we conduct experiments on the COCO-2017 and the Cityscapes validation datasets.

  abstract     = {Traditional exercise recommendation algorithms generate exercise groups according to the features of exercises for all students. However, as different students may have different knowledge proficiencies, this article focuses on the personalized exercises group assembly (PEGA) to select exercises for each student based on their knowledge proficiencies, which is formulated as a constrained multi-objective problem. In order to solve the constrained multi-objective PEGA problem efficiently, this paper proposes a two archives evolutionary algorithm (TAEA) with three novel designs. Firstly, as the number of exercises is very large in PEGA, the traditional binary-number encoding method will result in high consumption in both memory and computation. To this end, a new integer-number encoding (INE) method is designed for solution representation. It saves memory for exercise subset representation, speeds up evaluations, and generates solutions that satisfy some constraints. Secondly, based on the INE method, the TAEA adopts two archives name convergence-oriented archive (CA) and diversity-oriented archive (DA). The CA ensures the convergence, driving force, and feasibility of the solutions. The DA aims to provide as diverse a solution as possible, including exploration of infeasible regions. Thirdly, a classification-based offspring co-reproduction strategy is proposed to solve the issue of too much infeasible space exploration. Experimental results show that our INE method can help to reduce the running time and improve the optimization results. The effectiveness of the TAEA is demonstrated by comparing it with some recent existing algorithms.},

  abstract     = {In this paper we propose a novel model-data jointly driven (MDJD) method from a single picture for airborne particulate matter (APM) monitoring, towards assisting the decision-making for government and reducing the health risks for individuals. The MDJD method is mainly composed of three steps. First, we create a vector of .distance. as the model driven natural scene statistic (NSS) features through comparing the sparsity features that are extracted from one picture in five transform domains with their corresponding benchmark features that are derived by using a huge number of pictures with the extremely low APM concentrations in advance. Second, we produce a vector of .distance. as the data-driven NSS features through comparing the contrast-sensitive features that are chosen from hundreds of deep features with their associated benchmark features that are derived based on the same feature generation method as used in model-driven NSS features. Lastly, we fuse the aforesaid model- and data-driven NSS features by introducing a nonlinear regressor to estimate the APM concentration. Extensive experiments conducted on two large-size APM picture datasets validate the superiority of our proposed MDJD method over the state-of-the-art model-driven methods and data-driven methods by a sizable gain of 7.4% in terms of peak signal to noise ratio. Via a series of ablation studies, we can observe that fusing model- and data-driven NSS features is beneficial to improving the model's generalization and fitting abilities and leads to the gains of over 15.1% compared with using either type of features in isolation.},

  abstract     = {Federated learning (FL) is an innovative privacy-preserving machine learning paradigm that enables clients to train a global model without sharing their local data. However, the coexistence of category distribution heterogeneity and quantity imbalance frequently occurs in real-world FL scenarios. On the one side, due to the category distribution heterogeneity, local models are optimized based on distinct local objectives, resulting in divergent optimization directions. On the other side, quantity imbalance in widely used uniform client sampling of FL may hinder the active participation of clients with larger datasets in model training, and potentially make the model get suboptimal performance. To tackle this, we propose a framework that incorporates heterogeneity-aware clustering and intra-cluster uniform data sampling. More precisely, we firstly do heterogeneity-aware clustering that performs clustering on clients based on category distribution vectors. Then, we implement intra-cluster uniform data sampling, where local data from each client within a cluster is randomly selected based on a predetermined probability. Furthermore, to address privacy concerns, we incorporate homomorphic encryption to protect clients' category distribution vectors and sample sizes. Finally, the experimental results on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed framework validate the superiority of our approach.},

  abstract     = {The Visual Internet of Things (VIoT) is a next-generation key component to smart cities as it provides more clues for backend analysis. However, the VIoT needs to preliminarily screen/tag data before dispatching them to edge nodes. Moreover, when incomplete data are present, e.g., continuously occluded images, mislabeling may occur, not to mention detecting multilabels accurately. Another challenge is that although pairwise similarities via graph regularization/embedding strengthen label estimation, it is hard to determine the weights/locality between pairwise samples. Besides, static weighting may create rigid topologies owing to fixed distances, which hardly reflect data locality and subsequently cause fitting biases. In view of such, this work presents a discrete signature generation method that can analyze and convert corrupted data into robust signatures, thereby maintaining VIoT recognition functionalities. In this study, half quadratic lifting functions are introduced to accommodate fitting biases caused by data corruption which cannot be effectively solved by $\ell _{2}$, $\ell _{1}$, and $\ell _{2,1}$ norms. To avoid rigid distances among pairwise samples and to enable flexible automatic weighting, self-topological graph embedding/regularization is proposed, where data locality can be dynamically adjusted/learned from data. Additionally, semirelaxation on discrete signatures is devised to avoid quadratic unconstrained binary optimization caused by self-topological graphs and to enable efficient discrete cyclic coordinate descent (DCCD) algorithms for discrete signature optimization. Finally, decorrelation and balancing constraints corresponding to the proposed method are developed. Experiments on open datasets showed that the proposed method yielded better mean average precision (mAP) than the baselines. The outcomes revealed improvements in mAP for distinct noise types, including continuous occlusion, missing values, and sample-specific outliers, with respective increases of $\mathbf {10.97}\boldsymbol{\%}$, $\mathbf {8.05}\boldsymbol{\%}$, and $\mathbf {9.72}\boldsymbol{\%}$, individually. Such findings verified the effectiveness of the proposed idea.},

  abstract     = {The demand for adaptable approaches to analyze extensive fMRI data is growing, focusing on capturing population patterns while preserving individual uniqueness. Independent component analysis (ICA) is increasingly used to uncover spatio-temporal patterns in brain imaging but struggles with separating correlated sources in multivariate data like fMRI. For that, we propose an ICA-based multivariate generalized Gaussian mixture model combined with the constrained ICA to form the cICA-MGGMM. This model relaxes the independence assumption of ICA. Also, we propose the adaptive constrained ICA-MGGMM (acICA-MGGMM) to adaptively control the association between reference signals and estimated sources. Independent vector analysis (IVA) calculates global spatial and temporal patterns from multi-subject fMRI data while preserving individual variability but performs poorly with large datasets and weak component correlations. This paper proposes integrating reference signals into the formulation to address the problem and provide guidance in high-dimensional situations. For that, we propose cIVA-MGGMM to address ICA limitations for multivariate data, offering a framework for references but relying on user-defined constraint parameters to enforce reference-estimated sources associations. To tackle these limitations, we introduce the adaptive cIVA-MGGMM (acIVA-MGGMM) to adapt and separate the activated brain sources. This model employs a full covariance matrix, which consider the feature correlation. Our four constrained methods incorporate prior information about the sources into the ICA and IVA models to address the limitations of ICA and IVA in high-dimensional data. We validate our models on simulation, Alzheimer's, Schizophrenia, EEG, and ADHD datasets, demonstrating superior performance over base models.},

  abstract     = {Electroencephalogram (EEG)-based emotion recognition has gradually become a research hotspot with extensive real-world applications. Differences in EEG signals across subjects usually lead to the unsatisfactory performance in subject-independent emotion recognition. To handle this challenge, many researchers have paid attention to the development of transfer learning techniques, which yield promising results. Currently, most researchers focus on transfer learning between subjects within one single dataset. However, cross-dataset transfer learning presents a great challenge, because, in this case, the data collected from different environments and equipments have much more severe variations. Domain Generalization (DG) has great potential to handle the unseen data without involving them in training. Besides, Knowledge Distillation (KD), which can transfer the knowledge learned from the teacher to the student model, has shown promise in generalization for the student model. Inspired by DG and KD, we propose a novel and effective method, Distillation-Based Domain Generalization (DBDG), for cross-dataset EEG-based emotion recognition. Specifically, DBDG contains the modules of feature extraction, online distillation and self-distillation. The feature extraction module can learn the discriminative emotional features from EEG signals; the online distillation and self-distillation modules can enhance the method generalizability. Experimental results on three public benchmark datasets, SEED, SEED-IV and DEAP, have demonstrated the effectiveness of our method for cross-dataset EEG-based emotion recognition.},

To address this issue, we propose a dual-feature extraction network-based open-set domain adaptation method (DFEN). Specifically, we design a dual-feature extraction network model, comprising a local feature extractor and a global feature extractor. The local feature extractor is primarily used to capture local distinctive features from images to enhance the discriminative ability of the model for similar categories and improve its resistance to interference in multi-object images. By contrast, the global feature extractor focuses on extracting semantic correlations that are independent of image style and target scale to improve the model's understanding and generalization ability for scene categories. Besides, to boost the classification accuracy for unknown categories in open environments, we introduce an adaptive unknown class weighting mechanism based on the similarity between samples and known classes. By comprehensively measuring across the entire classification space and individual categories, samples with high weights are considered as unknown class. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves promising performance in various open and cross-domain scenarios.},

  abstract     = {Underwater object detection is of great significance for various applications in underwater scenes. However, class imbalance issue is still an unsolved bottleneck for current underwater object detection algorithms. It leads to large discrepancies in the detection precision among different classes that the dominant classes with more training data achieve higher precision while the minority classes with less training data achieve much lower precision. In this paper, we propose a balanced underwater object detection network (BAUODNET) to address the class imbalance issue by exploiting two techniques, i.e., the style augmentation technique and the example re-weighting technique. Firstly, we propose a class-wise style augmentation (CWSA) algorithm to augment the training data for the minority classes that generates different colors, textures and contrasts for the minority classes whilst preserving geometry. The augmented dataset possesses more balanced data distribution; Secondly, we exploit the the focal loss to re-weight the examples during the training of the deep detector, it down-weights the loss assigned to the well-detected examples from the dominant classes and focuses on learning undetected hard examples from the minority classes. Extensive experiments show the effectiveness of CWSA and focal loss for addressing the class imbalance problem in underwater scenes, BAUODNET obtains 49.5% mAP on URPC2017 and 66.8% mAP on URPC2018, achieving state-of-the-art or comparable performance on URPC2017 and URPC2018.},

CIM utilizes channel and spatial attention mechanisms to process the feature information from both modalities. By encouraging cross-modal information exchange, the CIM facilitates the integration of complementary information and improves the overall segmentation performance.

  abstract     = {Market making (MM) is a crucial trading problem, where a market maker stands ready to buy and sell the asset at a publicly quoted price to provide market liquidity continuously. The primary challenges in market making include position risk, liquidity risk, and adverse selection. Emerging research works investigate applying reinforcement learning (RL) techniques to derive automatic MM strategies. However, existing methods mainly focus on addressing inventory risk using only single-level quotes, which restricts the trading flexibility. In this paper, we shed light on the optimization of market makers' returns under a smaller risk while ensuring market liquidity and depth. This paper proposes a novel RL-based market-making strategy Predictive and Imitative Market Making Agent (PIMMA). First, to ensure adequate liquidity, we design an action space to enable stably allocating orders of multi-level volumes and prices. Beyond that, we apply queue position information from these multi-price levels to encode them in the state representations. Second, aiming at alleviating adverse selection, we draw auxiliary signals into state representation and design a representation learning network structure to catch implicit information from the price-volume fluctuations. Finally, we develop a novel reward function to earn a fortune while avoiding holding a large inventory. With a provided expert demonstration, our method augments the RL objective with imitation learning and learns an effective MM policy. Experiments are conducted to evaluate the proposed method based on realistic historical data, and the results demonstrate PIMMA outperforms RL-based strategy in the perspectives of earning decent revenue and information by adopting the multi-risk aversion strategy.},

  abstract     = {Face detection is a fundamental task in computer vision, yet remains challenging in educational settings due to the presence of objects of various sizes. Subpar detection can significantly impede subsequent tasks' performance. To address this, we present a novel framework, Small Object Detection Super Resolution (SODSR), inspired by super resolution (SR) techniques for feature-level images. SODSR comprises three stages: (1) Constructing a 3D model evaluation matrix to select optimal model combinations based on detection accuracy and image quality metrics. (2) Employing Double-thread FDN in the first stage to preprocess images, enhancing feature resolution for potential facial objects. (3) Leveraging Multi-head HyperNet in the second stage to augment face feature detection and improve accuracy. Finally, in the third stage, we introduce AFPGAN, a facial prior feature enhancement network, coupled with StyleGAN2 for texture and contour detail enhancement. Experimental results demonstrate that SODSR outperforms existing small object detection (SOD) models in both accuracy and visual fidelity.},

However, most of the consequences only focused on ideal communication cases without input delay. Distinguished from the existing optimal control mechanisms, the paper concentrates on the event-triggered optimal tracking control problem for nonlinear multi-agent systems with unmeasurable states and input delay. A state observer taking into account the universal approximation capability of neural networks is proposed to tackle the unmeasurable state variables which are often encountered in practical engineering scenarios. Subsequently, the optimal backstepping control mechanism is developed according to the reinforcement learning method, where the actor-critic networks are utilized to obtain the modified control parameters. Finally, an event-triggered strategy, which relies both on the latest sampled state and a non-negative threshold, is presented to relieve the communication frequency of the control signals with guaranteed performance requirements. The illustrated simulations are presented to confirm the feasibility of the proposed optimal tracking control algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Multi-layer networks effectively describe and model complex systems in nature and society, with each layer corresponding to a different type of interaction relationship. Community detection in multi-layer networks aims to identify modules with strong connectivity in all layers, thus revealing interactions in complex systems. However, current algorithms have been criticized for failing to adequately quantify the underlying structure and extract discriminative features. To tackle these issues, we propose Multi-graph Contrastive Learning with Consistency and Diversity for clustering of multi-layer networks (MCLCD), which includes feature extraction, feature decomposition, contrastive learning, and feature fusion. Specifically, MCLCD utilizes joint nonnegative matrix decomposition to extract features from each layer of the network. To quantify the underlying structure, the features are decomposed into consistent and diverse parts. The former characterizes consistency in each layer, reflecting the community structure, while the latter models the specificity and noise in each layer. Then, MCLCD performs multi-graph contrastive learning with negative samples constructed from neighbor information, which enhances the discriminative properties of consistent parts. These parts are integrated into an objective function and an optimization process is derived. Extensive experiments on both artificial networks and real-world networks show that MCLCD surpasses state-of-the-art methods in terms of various metrics, highlighting the excellence of our proposed approach.},

  abstract     = {Recent rapid advances in pre-trained language models, such as BERT and GPT, in natural language processing (NLP) have greatly improved the efficacy of text classifiers, easily surpassing human level performance in standard datasets like GLUE. However, most of these standard tasks implicitly assume a closed-world situation, where all testing data are supposed to lie in the same scope or distribution of the training data. Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is the task of detecting when an input data point lies beyond the scope of the seen training set. This is becoming increasingly important as NLP agents, such as chatbots or virtual assistants, have been being deployed ubiquitously in our daily lives, thus attracting more attention from the research community to make it more accurate and robust at the same time. Recent work can be broadly categorized into two orthogonal approaches – data generative/augmentative methods and threshold/boundary learning. In this work, we follow the former and propose a method for the task based on prompting, which is known for its zero and few-shot capabilities. Generating synthetic outliers in terms of prompts allows the model to more efficiently learn OOD samples than the existing methods. Testing on nine different settings across three standard datasets used for OOD detection, our method with adaptive decision boundary is able to achieve competitive or superior performances compared with the current state-of-the-art in all cases. We also provide extensive analysis on each dataset as well as perform comprehensive ablation studies on each component of our model.},

In an effort to deal with these challenges, we introduce a novel heterogeneous graph representation learning with optimized structures to optimize heterogeneous graph structures and utilize semantic aggregation mechanism to alleviate semantic indistinguishability while learning node embeddings. To address the heterogeneity of relations within heterogeneous graphs, the proposed algorithm employs a strategy of generating distinct relational subgraphs and incorporating them with node features to optimize structural learning. To resolve the issue of semantic indistinguishability, the proposed algorithm adopts a semantic aggregation mechanism to assign appropriate weights to different meta-paths, consequently enhancing the effectiveness of captured node features. This methodology enables the learning of distinguishable node embeddings by a deeper HetGNN model.

This paper proposes a cross-domain recommendation model based on asymmetric vertical federated learning and heterogeneous representation. This model can improve the accuracy and diversity of recommendations under the premise of privacy protection. Firstly, we propose a privacy set intersection model based on data augmentation. This model improves the data imbalance among participants by introducing obfuscation sets. It can conceal the true data volumes of each party, thereby protecting the sensitive information of weaker parties. Secondly, we propose a heterogeneous representation method based on a walking strategy incorporating interaction timing. This method combines users' recent interests to generate node sequences that reflect the characteristics of user preferences. Then we use the Skip-Gram model to represent the node sequence in a low-dimensional embedding. Finally, we propose a cross-domain recommendation model based on vertical federated learning. This model uses the federated factorization machine to complete the interest prediction and protect the privacy data security of each domain. Experiments show that on the real data set, the model can further guarantee the data security of each participant in the asymmetric federated learning. It can also improve the recommendation accuracy on the target domain.},

  abstract     = {Neural networks are often designed for closed environments that are not open to acquisition of new knowledge. Incremental learning techniques allow neural networks to adapt to changing environments, but these methods often encounter challenges causing models to suffer from low classification accuracies. The main problem faced is catastrophic forgetting and this problem is more harmful when using incremental strategies compared to regular tasks. Some known causes of catastrophic forgetting are weight drift and inter-class confusion; these problems cause the network to erroneously fuse trained classes or to forget a learned class. This paper addresses these issues by focusing on data pre-processing and using network feedback corrections for incremental learning. Data pre-processing is important as the quality of the training data used affects the network's ability to maintain continuous class discrimination. This approach uses a generative model to modify the data input for the incremental model. Network feedback corrections would allow the network to adapt to newly found classes and scale based on network need. With combination of generative data pre-processing and network feedback, this paper proposes an approach for efficient long-term incremental learning. The results obtained are compared with similar state-of-the-art algorithms and show high incremental accuracy levels.},

  abstract     = {Image emotion recognition, which aims to analyze the emotional responses of people to various stimuli in images, has attracted substantial attention in recent years with the proliferation of social media. As human emotion is a highly complex and abstract cognitive process, simply extracting local or global features from an image is not sufficient for recognizing the emotion of an image. The psychologist Moshe proposed that visual objects are usually embedded in a scene with other related objects during human visual comprehension of images. Therefore, we propose a two-branch emotion-recognition network known as the combined visual relationship feature and scene feature network (CVRSF-Net). In the scene feature-extraction branch, a pretrained CLIP model is adopted to extract the visual features of images, with a feature channel weighting module to extract the scene features. In the visual relationship feature-extraction branch, a visual relationship detection model is used to extract the visual relationships in the images, and a semantic fusion module fuses the scenes and visual relationship features. Furthermore, we spatially weight the visual relationship features using class activation maps. Finally, the implicit relationships between different visual relationship features are obtained using a graph attention network, and a two-branch network loss function is designed to train the model. The experimental results showed that the recognition rates of the proposed network were 79.80%, 69.81%, and 36.72% for the FI-8, Emotion-6, and WEBEmo datasets, respectively. The proposed algorithm achieves state-of-the-art results compared to existing methods.},

  abstract     = {With the rapid development of deep learning, supervised training methods have become increasingly sophisticated. There has been a growing trend towards semi-supervised and weakly supervised learning methods. This shift in focus is partly due to the challenges in obtaining large amounts of labeled data. The key to semi-supervised semantic segmentation is how to efficiently use a large amount of unlabeled data. A common practice is to use labeled data to generate pseudo labels for unlabeled data. However, the pseudo labels generated by these operations are of low quality, which severely interferes with the subsequent segmentation task. In this work, we propose to use the iterative self-matching strategy to enhance the self-training strategy, through which the quality of pseudo labels can be significantly improved. In practice, we split unlabeled data into two confidence types, i.e., reliable images and unreliable images, by an adaptive threshold. Using our iterative self-matching strategy, all reliable images are automatically added to the training dataset in each training iteration. At the same time, our algorithm employs an adaptive selection mechanism to filter out the highest-scoring pseudo labels of unreliable images, which are then used to further expand the training data. This iterative process enhances the reliability of the pseudo labels generated by the model. Based on this idea, we propose a novel semi-supervised semantic segmentation framework called SISS-Net. We conducted experiments on three public benchmark datasets: Pascal VOC 2012, COCO, and Cityscapes. The experimental results show that our method outperforms the supervised training method by 9.3%. In addition, we performed various joint ablation experiments to validate the effectiveness of our method.},

However, GNNs relying on information aggregation mechanisms typically face limitations in achieving superior representation performance because of deep feature oversmoothing. Inspired by the broad learning system, in this study, we attempt to avoid the feature oversmoothing issue by expanding the width of GNNs. We propose a broad graph attention network framework with a multikernel mechanism (BGAT-MK). In particular, we propose the construction of a broad GNN using multikernel mapping to generate several reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHSs), where nodes can wander through different kernel spaces and generate representations. Furthermore, we construct a broader network by aggregating representations in different RKHSs and fusing adaptive weights to aggregate the original and enhanced mapped representations. The efficacy of BGAT-MK is validated through experiments on conventional node classification and light detection and ranging point cloud semantic segmentation tasks, demonstrating its superior performance.},

However, the disparity-resolution gap between the HR central view and the LR side views poses a challenge for local high-frequency transfer. To address this, we introduce a novel framework with an adaptive feature transfer strategy. Specifically, we propose dynamically sampling and aggregating pixels from the HR central feature to effectively transfer high-frequency information to each LR view. The proposed strategy naturally adapts to different disparities and image structures, facilitating information propagation. Additionally, to refine the intermediate LF feature and promote angular consistency, we introduce a spatial-angular cross attention block that enhances domain-specific feature by appropriate weights generated from cross-domain feature. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method over state-of-the-art approaches on both simulated and real-world datasets.

  abstract     = {Multimodal image fusion is a vital technique that integrates images from various sensors to create a comprehensive and coherent representation, with broad applications in surveillance, medical imaging, and autonomous driving. However, current fusion methods struggle with inadequate feature representation, limited global context understanding due to the small receptive fields of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and the loss of high-frequency information, all of which lead to suboptimal fusion quality. To address these challenges, we propose the Multi-Scale Diffusion Transformer (MSDT), a novel fusion framework that seamlessly combines a latent diffusion model with a transformer-based architecture. MSDT uses a perceptual compression network to encode source images into a low-dimensional latent space, reducing computational complexity while preserving essential features. It also incorporates a multiscale feature fusion mechanism, enhancing both detail and structural understanding. Additionally, MSDT features a self-attention module to extract unique high-frequency features and a cross-attention module to identify common low-frequency features across modalities, improving contextual understanding. Extensive experiments on three datasets show that MSDT significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods across twelve evaluation metrics, achieving an SSIM score of 0.98. Moreover, MSDT demonstrates superior robustness and generalizability, highlighting the potential of integrating diffusion models with transformer architectures for multimodal image fusion.},

  abstract     = {Reconstructing the structure of causal graphical models from observational data is crucial for identifying causal mechanisms in scientific research. However, real-world noise and hidden factors can make it difficult to detect true underlying causal relationships. Current methods mainly rely on extensive expert analysis to correct wrongly identified connections, guiding structure learning toward more accurate causal interactions. This reliance on expert input demands significant manual effort and is risky due to potential erroneous judgments when handling complex causal interactions. To address these issues, this paper introduces a new, expert-free method to improve causal discovery. By utilizing the extensive resources of static knowledge bases across various fields, specifically knowledge graphs (KGs), we extract causal information related to the variables of interest and use these as prior constraints in the structure learning process. Unlike the detailed constraints provided by expert analysis, the information from KGs is more general, indicating the presence of certain paths without specifying exact connections or their lengths. We incorporate these constraints in a soft way to reduce potential noise in the KG-derived priors, ensuring that our method remains reliable. Moreover, we provide interfaces for various mainstream causal discovery methods to enhance the utility of our approach. For empirical validation, we apply our approach across multiple areas of causal discovery. The results show that our method effectively enhances data-based causal discovery and demonstrates its promising applications.},

  abstract     = {Multi-view clustering aims at exploiting complementary information contained in different views to partition samples into distinct categories. The popular approaches either directly integrate features from different views, or capture the common portion between views without closing the heterogeneity gap. Such rigid schemes did not consider the possible mis-alignment among different views, thus failing to learn a consistent yet comprehensive representation, leading to inferior clustering performance. To tackle the drawback, we introduce an alternating adversarial learning strategy to drive different views to fall into the same semantic space. We first present a Linear Alternating Adversarial Multi-view Clustering (Linear-A$^{2}$MC) model to align views in linear embedding spaces. To enjoy the power of feature extraction capability of deep networks, we further build a Deep Alternating Adversarial Multi-view Clustering (Deep-A$^{2}$MC) network to realize non-linear transformations and feature pruning among different views, simultaneously. Specifically, Deep-A$^{2}$MC leverages alternate adversarial learning to first align low-dimensional embedding distributions, followed by a mixture of latent representations synthesized through attention learning for multiple views. Finally, a self-supervised clustering loss is jointly optimized in the unified network to guide the learning of discriminative representations to yield compact clusters. Extensive experiments on six real world datasets with largely varied sample sizes demonstrate that Deep-A$^{2}$MC achieved superior clustering performance by comparing with twelve baseline methods.},

However, PPFL is prone to be disrupted by poisoning attacks for the server being forbbiden from accessing users' updates. The existing protocols focusing on poisoning attacks in PPFL generally use two servers to interactively execute protocols to defend against poisoning attacks, while the other ones using a single server require multiple rounds of server-user interactions, both of which incur significant communication overheads. We propose PurifyFL, a privacy-preserving poisoning attacks defense strategy. PurifyFL only relies on a single server while most of the previous works depend on two non-colluding servers, which are impractical in reality. Moreover, We also achieve non-interactivity between the users and the server.

  abstract     = {In biomedical vision research, a significant challenge is the limited availability of pixel-wise labeled data. Data augmentation has been identified as a solution to this issue through generating labeled dummy data. While enhancing model efficacy, semi-supervised learning methodologies have emerged as a promising alternative that allows models to train on a mix of limited labeled and larger unlabeled data sets, potentially marking a significant advancement in biomedical vision research. Drawing from the semi-supervised learning strategy, in this paper, a novel medical image segmentation model is presented that features a hierarchical architecture with an attention mechanism. This model disentangles the synthesis process of biomedical images by employing a tail two-branch generator for semantic mask synthesis, thereby excelling in handling medical images with imbalanced class characteristics. During inference, the k-means clustering algorithm processes feature maps from the generator by using the clustering outcome as the segmentation mask. Experimental results show that this approach preserves biomedical image details more accurately than synthesized semantic masks. Experiments on various datasets, including those for vestibular schwannoma, kidney, and skin cancer, demonstrate the proposed method's superiority over other generative-adversarial-network-based and semi-supervised segmentation methods in both distribution fitting and semantic segmentation performance.},

Second, a Q-learning-based operator adaptation strategy is adopted to guide the evolutionary direction of factory assignment to reduce the makespan. Then, the proposed destructive-construction strategy builds an archive set to share historical knowledge with different stages of search, ensuring exploration capability. Local search effectively combines the parallel computing power of multi-threading with the inherent exploitation capability of LTMIG, and fully utilizes the information of elite solutions. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that LTMIG is significantly better than the comparison algorithms mentioned in the paper, and it turns out that LTMIG is the most suitable algorithm for solving DPFCSP-SDST.},

Feature selection, a key facet of dimensionality reduction techniques, has advanced considerably to address this challenge. One such advancement is the Boruta feature selection algorithm, which successfully discerns meaningful features by contrasting them to their permutated counterparts known as shadow features. Building on this, this paper introduces NeuroBoruta, that extends the traditional Boruta approach by integrating neural networks and calibration metrics to improve prediction accuracy and reduce model uncertainty. By augmenting shadow features with noise and utilizing neural network-based perturbation for importance evaluation, and further incorporating calibration metrics alongside accuracy this evolved version of the Boruta method is presented. Experimental results demonstrate that NeuroBoruta significantly enhances the predictive performance and reliability of classification models across various datasets, including medical imaging and standard UCI datasets.

  abstract     = {Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is one of the leading causes of visual impairment and blindness in diabetic patients worldwide. Accurate Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD) systems can aid in the early diagnosis and treatment of DR patients to reduce the risk of vision loss, but it remains challenging due to the following reasons: 1) the relatively low contrast and ambiguous boundaries between pathological lesions and normal retinal regions, and 2) the considerable diversity in lesion size and appearance. In this paper, a Cross-Scale Fuzzy Holistic Attention Network (CSFHANet) is proposed for DR grading using fundus images, and it consists of two main components: Fuzzy-Enhanced Holistic Attention (FEHA) and Fuzzy Learning-based Cross-Scale Fusion (FLCSF). FEHA is developed to adaptively recalibrate the importance of feature elements by assigning fuzzy weights across both channel and spatial domains, which can enhance the model's ability to learn the features of lesion regions while reducing the interference from irrelevant information in normal retinal regions. Then, the FLCSF module is designed to eliminate the uncertainty in fused multi-scale features derived from different branches by utilizing fuzzy membership functions, producing a more comprehensive and refined feature representation from complex DR lesions. Extensive experiments on the Messidor-2 and DDR datasets demonstrate that the proposed CSFHANet exhibits superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.},

Recent advancements in machine learning technologies have showcased their efficacy in discerning authentic profit signals within the realm of stock trend forecasting, predominantly employing temporal data derived from historical stock price patterns. Nevertheless, the inherently volatile and dynamic characteristics of the stock market render the learning and capture of multi-scale temporal dependencies and stable trading opportunities a formidable challenge. This predicament is primarily attributed to the difficulty in distinguishing real profit signal patterns amidst a plethora of mixed, noisy data. In response to these complexities, we propose a Multi-Scale Temporal Memory Learning and Efficient Debiasing (MTMD) model. This innovative approach encompasses the creation of a learnable embedding coupled with external attention, serving as a memory module through self-similarity. It aims to mitigate noise interference and bolster temporal consistency within the model. The MTMD model adeptly amalgamates comprehensive local data at each timestamp while concurrently focusing on salient historical patterns on a global scale. Furthermore, the incorporation of a graph network, tailored to assimilate global and local information, facilitates the adaptive fusion of heterogeneous multi-scale data. Rigorous ablation studies and experimental evaluations affirm that the MTMD model surpasses contemporary state-of-the-art methodologies by a substantial margin in benchmark datasets.},

However, these methods still suffer from insufficient proximity and poor diversity towards the true Pareto front. In this paper, following the “Learning to Improve” (L2I) paradigm, we propose weight-related policy network (WRPN), a learning-based improvement method for solving MOCOPs. WRPN is incorporated into multiobjective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA) frameworks to effectively guide the search direction. A shared baseline for proximal policy optimization is presented to reduce variance in model training. A quality enhancement mechanism is designed to further refine the Pareto set during model inference. Computational experiments conducted on two classic MOCOPs, i.e., multiobjective traveling salesman problem and multiobjective vehicle routing problem, indicate that our method achieves remarkable results. Notably, our WRPN module can be easily integrated into various MOEA frameworks such as NSGA-II, MOEA/D and MOGLS, providing versatility and applicability across different problem domains.},

  abstract     = {Long-tailed (LT) classification is an unavoidable and challenging problem in the real world. Most existing long-tailed classification methods focus only on solving the class-wise imbalance while ignoring the attribute-wise imbalance. The deviation of a classification model is caused by both class-wise and attribute-wise imbalance. Due to the fact that attributes are implicit in most datasets and the combination of attributes is complex, attribute-wise imbalance is more difficult to handle. For this purpose, we proposed a novel long-tailed classification framework, aiming to build a multi-granularity classification model by means of invariant feature learning. This method first unsupervisedly constructs Coarse-Grained Leading Forest (CLF) to better characterize the distribution of attributes within a class. Depending on the distribution of attributes, one can customize suitable sampling strategies to construct different imbalanced datasets. We then introduce multi-center loss (MCL) that aims to gradually eliminate confusing attributes during feature learning process. The proposed framework does not necessarily couple to a specific LT classification model structure and can be integrated with any existing LT method as an independent component. Extensive experiments show that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on both existing benchmarks ImageNet-GLT and MSCOCO-GLT and can improve the performance of existing LT methods.},

  abstract     = {Constrained multi-objective evolutionary algorithms have been extensively used for solving real-world problems. However, most algorithms struggle to efficiently find feasible solutions when the problem involves massive decision variables and decision space constraints. To tackle this issue, an efficient sampling approach is suggested to guide the offspring generation, where three types of directions are utilized according to the status of the current population, including the feasibility-preferred direction, the convergence-preferred direction, and the diversity-preferred direction. Specifically, the proposed approach adopts the feasibility-preferred direction to guide solutions towards constraint satisfaction when most solutions are infeasible, whereas the convergence-preferred direction is utilized to guide solutions to approach the optimal set when most solutions are dominated, and the diversity-preferred direction is employed to spread solutions to cover the optimal set when most solutions are non-dominated. Besides, a reinforcement learning approach is proposed to automatically determine the constraint handling technique in each iteration. With the proposed approaches, a large-scale constrained multi-objective evolutionary algorithm is also developed. The experiment is conducted on 31 benchmark problems with 1000 dimensions and five real-world problems with dimensions varying from 1170 to 2610, and experimental results reveal the competitive effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.},

Failure to identify side effects before submission to regulatory groups can cost millions of dollars and months of additional research to the companies. Failure to identify side effects during the regulatory review can also cost lives. The complexity and expense of this task have made it a candidate for a machine learning-based solution. Prior approaches rely on complex model designs and excessive parameter counts for side effect predictions. Reliance on complex models only shifts the difficulty away from chemists rather than alleviating the issue. Implementing large models is also expensive without prior access to high-performance computers. We propose a heuristic approach that allows for the utilization of simple neural networks, specifically the GRU recurrent neural network, with a 98+% reduction of required parameters compared to available large language models while obtaining near identical results as top-performing models.},

However, most existing distributed clustering techniques require manual tuning of several parameters or hyperparameters, which can pose challenges for practical applications. This paper introduces a novel parameter-free distributed clustering framework known as distributed torque clustering (DTC). When dealing with data or subdata distributed across various sites, DTC predominantly executes two steps. The first step is a data reduction at each site using torque clustering, and the second step involves performing global clustering with weighted torque clustering. We compare DTC against six state-of-the-art distributed clustering algorithms and automatic centralized clustering techniques on ten large-scale or medium-scale datasets. The results show that the average rank of DTC is at least three times better than those of the other algorithms across all the datasets. Additionally, DTC can accurately predict the ground-truth number of clusters in nine out of ten datasets, further demonstrating its competitive performance and practical potential.},

In order for patients to be identified to make better decisions and receive the appropriate treatment that can save their lives, rapid and accurate diagnosis of pulmonary infections is critical. In this study, we propose a multi-task deep learning algorithm to quickly and effectively determine the severity of pulmonary infection in patients with COVID-19 or similar pulmonary diseases. The main contributions are as follows. First, we propose a multi-task network based on a dual transformer encoder followed by a feature fusion module feeding two MLP regression heads. Second, we introduce an online combination of region and score for image augmentation. The resulting network quantifies CXR images with two scores that characterize two types of infection. One score is based on the spread of infection in the lung, while the other measures how opaque the infected sites are. The proposed approach is evaluated using chest radiographs (CXR) from the public RALO dataset. Compared to prediction models in the literature, our multi-task technique outperforms them. At the time of inference, the proposed model has the highest Pearson correlation coefficient and the lowest mean absolute error. Our results show that accurate diagnosis of lung severity can be achieved by generating two assessment scores in a multi-tasking model.},

Existing FL algorithms mostly focus on addressing the problem of non-independently and identically distributed (Non-IID) data in supervised scenarios. However, in practical settings, a considerable amount of unlabeled data exists, posing an urgent challenge of how to fully utilize such data. In this paper, we propose an exploitation maximization method of unlabeled data for federated semi-supervised learning (FSSL). Specifically, we adjust the optimization objective of high-confidence samples by considering both the predicted results and the class distribution of pseudo-labels. This adjustment enables the resolution of severe class imbalance issues. Additionally, we propose a diversity sampling strategy for low-confidence samples. The strategy aims to increase the diversity of training samples by sampling samples that are less similar to high-confidence samples, thereby improving the generalization ability of the model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method not only outperforms other state-of-the-art FSSL methods in non-IID scenarios but also exhibits superior scalability and robustness.},

In contrast, this work proposes a concise and effective Triplet Bridge (TriBri) framework to clear these obstacles fundamentally. Specifically, we use InfoNCE as the core to construct cross-modal representations between images and sketches, which can increase the margin between feature clusters with different categories in the representation space and improve the generalization of the model. Furthermore, we introduce text with abstract properties into the framework to construct a ternary relationship, and the three heterogeneous gaps between text, image, and sketch modalities are connected by InfoNCE. In this process, the common abstract visual cues in both images and sketches can be captured by the feature extractor with the guiding of text abstract information. Ultimately, comprehensive experiments on three commonly used datasets (i.e., TU-Berlin, Sketchy, and QuickDraw) validate that our framework can effectively solve these obstacles in a simple yet powerful manner. Furthermore, compared to state-of-the-art methods, the proposed TriBri exhibits comprehensive performance superiority.},

  abstract     = {Researchers have recently become interested in analysing lightweight block ciphers using Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques. Security against differential cryptanalysis is considered to be a necessary design criterion for block ciphers. In Crypto 2019, Gohr demonstrated that deep learning based neural differential distinguishers (NDDs) for round-reduced versions of SPECK 32/64 yield better accuracy than the traditional differential distinguishers. The present work focuses on building neural differential distinguishers for three families of round-reduced versions of lightweight block ciphers, SPECK (32/64, 64/128), SIMON (32/64, 48/96, 64/128), and PRESENT 64/80, to perform round-reduced neural differential cryptanalysis. We have introduced a novel data fusion technique to leverage possible synergistic interaction between ciphertexts of rounds $(r - 1)$ and round $r$, with an aim to enhance the performance of the NDDs. This fused data, organized in a particular manner, serve as the input for constructing convolutional neural differential distinguishers to differentiate between real pairs and random pairs of ciphertexts. The fusion of the ciphertexts of two successive rounds is done to leverage the merits of not only the ciphertexts of individual rounds but also the synergistic (cooperative) interaction between the ciphertexts of two successive rounds which result in boosting of the performance of the NDDs. The proposed NDDs achieve significantly higher accuracy and can break higher rounds as compared to existing works reported in the literature. Our results demonstrate the presence of synergistic interaction between the ciphertexts of two successive rounds. Specifically, we report results of NDDs on the round-reduced version of SPECK 32/64 upto round 9, SPECK 64/128 upto round 8, SIMON 32/64 with round upto 11, SIMON 48/96 upto round 12, SIMON 64/128 upto round 14 and PRESENT 64/80 upto round 9.},

However, the existing works merely consider the explicit auxiliary signals, and intent may contribute to the refinement of basket representations but bring some uncertain bias.To deal with the problems mentioned above, this paper proposes a knowledge-aware intent-guided contrastive learning method called KICL for NBR. Specifically, we construct a collaborative bipartite graph to learn basket representations and item representations, while at the same time, a knowledge graph is constructed based on items and their attributes to capture implicit auxiliary signals. Furthermore, the item attributes within a basket are weighted and summed up to extract the corresponding intent. To reduce the uncertainty bias brought from item diversity, a contrastive regularizer is designed for better basket representation refinement. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of KICL, where the maximum improvement can reach 15.91% in terms of F1@10 on Dunnhumby.},

  abstract     = {Cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has emerged as an effective tool for addressing complex control tasks. However, sparse team rewards present significant challenges for MARL, leading to low exploration efficiency, slow learning speed, and homogenized behaviors among agents. To address these issues, we propose a novel Leader-Collaborator (LC) MARL framework inspired by human social collaboration. The LC framework introduces parallel online knowledge distillation for policy networks (KDPN). KDPN extracts knowledge from two policy networks with different training objectives: one aims to maximize individual rewards, while the other aims to maximize team rewards. The extracted knowledge is utilized to construct team leaders and collaborators. By effectively balancing individual and team rewards, our approach enhances exploration efficiency and promotes behavioral diversity among agents. This addresses the issue of low learning efficiency caused by the lack of objectives early in the agent's learning process and facilitates the development of more effective and differentiated team interaction policies. Additionally, we present the Self-Repairing Strategy (SRS) and Self-Augmenting Strategy (SAS) to facilitate team policies learning while preserving the initial team goal. We evaluate the effectiveness of the LC framework by conducting extensive experiments on the Multi-Agent Particle Environment (MPE), the Google Research Football (GRF), and StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge (SMAC) with varying levels of difficulty. Our experimental results demonstrate that LC significantly improves the efficiency of the agent's exploration, achieves state-of-the-art performance, and accelerates the learning of the optimal policy. Specifically, in the SMAC scenarios, our method increases the winning rate by 21.9%, increases the average cumulative reward by 12%, and reduces the training time by 57% to achieve optimal performance.},

However, there is no intelligent system that can diagnose more lesion types, handle multiple tasks simultaneously, and be more accurate in clinical work. Therefore, we present an innovative Multi-Task deep learning architecture named Attention Gating Pyramid Vision Transformer (AGPVT), which provides a solution for the accurate classification and precise segmentation of lesion types and regions simultaneously. The proposed AGPVT combines the benefits of cutting-edge deep learning model designs with Multi-Task Learning (MTL) in order to advance the field. Furthermore, a patch-wise multi-head attention gating method alongside a hybrid design MTL decoder, is employed as the core driving architecture of the AGPVT. Comprehensive experiments are conducted on a multicenter dataset which contains esophageal cancer, Barrett's esophagus, esophageal protruded lesions, esophagitis, and normal esophagus.

  abstract     = {Meta-learning, a rapidly advancing area in computational intelligence, leverages prior knowledge from related tasks to facilitate the swift adaptation to new tasks with limited data. A critical challenge in meta-learning is the quantification of model uncertainty. In this paper, we propose a novel meta-learning method, Generative Probabilistic Meta-Learning (GPML), designed for few-shot image classification. GPML extends the Probably Approximately Correct-Bayes (PAC-Bayes) framework, initially formulated for single-task scenarios, to meta-learning across multiple tasks. This extension not only provides theoretical generalization guarantees for meta-learning but also effectively captures model uncertainty through variational parameters. To enhance the expressiveness of approximated posteriors in Bayesian inference, GPML incorporates implicit modeling, which defines probability distributions over task-specific parameters in a data-driven manner. This is achieved by designing a generative model structure that integrates task-dependent prior knowledge into the model inference process. We conduct extensive multidimensional performance evaluations on few-shot image classification tasks across various benchmarks, demonstrating that GPML outperforms existing state-of-the-art meta-learning methods. Additionally, ablation studies focusing on model components, the PAC-Bayes framework, and implicit modeling validate the performance improvements attributed to the proposed generative model structure, learning framework, and modeling approach.},

In this new approach, speaker change detection is biased around detected quasi-silences, which reduces the severity of the trade-off between the missed detection and false detection rates.

The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed training method in the presence of non-IID speech data. It also shows a considerable improvement in the reduction of false and missed detection at the segmentation stage, while reducing the computational overhead.

  abstract     = {Dangerous road surface covering objects such as wet slippery, ice and snow will directly affect the safety performance. Therefore, the detection and visualization of road surface covering objects' status under complex weather and road conditions are of great significance to the safety of human driving and unmanned driving. However, the complex road conditions (vehicles and pedestrians blocking the road surface, the area of the measured coverage is small, and the ambient light changes drastically) limit the accuracy of road surface coverage objects' state detection in the natural environment. Given the above problems, this paper reconstructs the image prepossessing process in road ice and snow cover segmentation by introducing background extraction before image segmentation, and then proposes a road surface coverage objects segmentation method based on Convolutional Block Attention Module UNet++ (CBAM UNet++). First, through the performance comparison of different background extraction algorithms, the Content-adaptive Resizing Framework (CARF) background extraction algorithm is used to eliminate the interference of vehicles, pedestrians and other objects in complex road conditions. Then, the CBAM UNet++ model is established to segment the four types of road surface coverings objects in the outfield to improve detection accuracy under conditions of small area coverage objects and severe illumination changes. Experimental results indicate, after introducing background extraction, the segmentation accuracy under different lighting conditions can be improved by 5.6%--17.7%; Compared with traditional methods for segmenting objects on road surfaces, the CBAM UNet++ method demonstrates an average segmentation accuracy improvement of at least 6.5% under six different lighting conditions.},

  abstract     = {Traffic flow prediction is a non-negligible part of intelligent transportation and mobility. Unfortunately, the unique non-linearity and complex spatial-ST-correlation of transport flow data suggest considerable challenges in prediction. The dynamic interaction of multiple spatial relations greatly influences traffic flow prediction. However, the existing spatial-temporal prediction algorithms are based on graph convolution to capture global or heterogeneous relationships, and simpler graph convolution models cannot accurately capture complex dynamic spatial relationships. To address the issues as mentioned above, this study proposes an attention-based multi-graph dynamic spatial-temporal prediction model ADMSTGCN to capture a variety of dynamic interaction relationships in traffic flow. First, we use a distance graph to explore the relationships between adjacent distances and use a semantic graph to mine spatial relationships between nodes that are far apart but have similar relationships, then fuse these two graphs to obtain a fusion graph with multiple spatial interaction relationships. The correlations between different neighbors are then further learned through a dynamic multi-graph spatial-temporal learning module that aggregates the features of different neighbors through gated graph convolution and attention mechanisms to capture various dynamic and complex spatial-temporal interactions. Experimental evaluations show that the framework proposed outperforms existing methods with better results in the analysis performed with publicly available datasets and also demonstrates the importance of capturing multiple interactions of spatial-temporal relationships.},

  abstract     = {Brain science research has entered the era of connectomics, characterized by a significant increase in published articles investigating brain structure and functional connections. Automatically and accurately extracting scientific evidence from these articles has become an urgent concern. Unlike early brain mechanism studies at the functional area level, brain connectomics studies feature more intricate experimental designs and yield complex findings. Traditional neuroimaging text mining techniques, operating at the term level, are insufficient for effectively extracting scientific evidence from brain connectomics articles. This paper addresses a key challenge in event-level neuroimaging text mining, i.e., event causal relation extraction in brain connectomics. We introduce a novel model named Brain Connectomics Event Relation Miner (BCERM), leveraging weighted joint constrained learning. By integrating a bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) network with a multi-layer perceptron (MLP), we develop a lightweight model for jointly extracting multiple event causal relations from brain connectomics articles. Given the scarcity of annotated brain connectomics corpora, we propose a weighted joint constrained learning framework. This framework integrates double consistency constraints, encompassing common sense and domain constraints, and combines them with adaptive weight learning to enhance the model's few-shot learning capability. Experimental evaluations on a real brain connectomics article dataset demonstrate that our method achieves an F-score of 70%, outperforming state-of-the-art event relation extraction methods in the low-resource environment.},

To tackle this challenge and improve disease detection efficiency, deep learning methods have been employed to accurately classify and identify plant diseases. In recent times, manual inspection of maize fields for disease detection has been the standard practice in many parts of Zambia. However, this approach is not only time-consuming but also impractical for large-scale agricultural operations. Hence, the development of precise and automated classification models has become crucial in modern agriculture. In this study, we propose a novel deep-learning model called DenseSwin, specifically designed for maize disease classification in both the early visible stage and late indisputable stage of the disease. DenseSwin combines the strengths of densely connected convolution blocks with a shifted windows-based multi-head self-attention mechanism. This unique fusion of techniques enables the model to effectively capture intricate patterns and features in maize plant images, thereby enhancing disease classification performance. Through extensive experimentation and evaluation, DenseSwin achieves an impressive accuracy of 97.18%. These results highlight the model's remarkable ability to accurately detect and classify maize diseases, offering promising potential for real-world applications in agricultural settings, particularly in Zambia.},

Consequently, the traditional “weapon-target” assignment mode has turned into a “ship-weapon-target” assignment mode in the multi-ship dynamic weapon-target assignment (MS-DWTA) problem we proposed, with a larger solution space. In this problem, different ships possess distinct attributes, such as defense duties, weapon types, and loaded missile quantities. To solve this problem, we proposed an Attention enhanced multi-agent Distributional reinforcement learning method with Dynamic Reward (ADDR). Different from standard reinforcement learning method, ADDR learns to estimate the distribution, as opposed to only the expectation of future return, enabling better adaptation to air defense scenarios with significant randomness. The multi-head attention network integrates both the ship situation and the target situation to appropriately adjust the output of each agent, which explicitly considers the agent-level impact of ships to the whole fleet. Moreover, due to the missile fight time, ships may not immediately receive rewards after executing actions. To address this delayed phenomenon, we designed a dynamic reward mechanism to accurately adjust the delayed rewards. Through extensive simulation experiments, ADDR has demonstrated superior performance over multiple evaluation metrics.},

  abstract     = {The density peaks clustering algorithm is one of the density-based clustering algorithms. This algorithm has several advantages, including not requiring a preset number of clusters, requiring fewer parameters, and being able to achieve clustering of any shape. However, it also has limitations, such as poor clustering performance on datasets with uneven density, the need to manually select cluster centers on the decision graph, and a chain reaction that can lead to a large number of point misallocations due to incorrect allocation of individual points. To overcome the shortcomings of the density peaks clustering algorithm, we propose a density peaks clustering algorithm based on label propagation and k-mutual-nearest neighbors. First, the local density and the distance are defined by incorporating the concept of k-mutual-nearest neighbors to enhance clustering performance on datasets with uneven-density clusters. Second, an adaptive method for selecting cluster centers is proposed to avoid the manual selection of cluster centers. Third, an improved label propagation algorithm is used to assign all remaining points to solve the chain reaction problem. The experimental results show that our algorithm can accurately identify cluster centers and obtain high-quality clustering results on synthetic datasets with different characteristics, including datasets with uneven cluster density, convex datasets, manifold datasets, and datasets with inter-cluster contact. On different types of UCI datasets, including small datasets, high-dimensional datasets, and large datasets, our algorithm outperforms other comparative algorithms.},

  abstract     = {As the increasing heterogeneous data, mining valuable information from various views is in demand. Currently, deep matrix factorization (DMF) receives extensive attention because of its ability to discover latent hierarchical semantics of the data. However, the existing multi-view DMF methods have the following shortcomings: (1). Most of multi-view DMF methods exploit Frobenius norm as the reconstruction error measure, which is easily affected by noises and outliers. (2). A $k$NN-based graph keeps the geometric structure of the representation similar to the raw data, which fails to consider the higher-order relationships between instances. To solve these issues, in this research, a novel robust multi-view hypergraph regularized deep non-negative matrix factorization is proposed. Concretely, $l_{2, 1}$-norm is adopted to measure the factorization error for enhancing the robustness. A hypergraph regularization is designed to discover the higher-order relationships between the instances. Additionally, a pair-wise consistency learning term is utilized to mine consistency information in multi-view data. An optimization algorithm based on iterative updating rules is developed for solving the proposed model, which makes the objective function value monotonically non-increase until convergence. Moreover, the convergence of the proposed optimization algorithm is validated theoretically and experimentally. Finally, abundant experiments are performed on six real world and two synthetic multi-view datasets to evaluate the performance of the proposed method and the comparison methods.},

  abstract     = {Medical knowledge graph (KG) is sparse KG that contains insufficient information and missing paths. Multi-hop reasoning is an effective approach of medical KG completion, since it offers logical insights of the underlying KG and shows more direct interpretability. However, existing methods based on reinforcement learning focus on the use of historical and current state information but ignore the importance of evaluating the quality of candidate nodes in sparse KGs. Especially, it is difficult for the agent to select the correct search actions in sparse KGs. Occasionally, the agent will be at a dilemma state (i.e., state trap), where few actions can be selected. To address the above issue, we propose an effective relation-based node quality evaluation (RNQE) model for multi-hop reasoning. This model has two merits: (1) it reduces the impact of insufficient information in sparse KGs by synthesizing the reasoning quality information (i.e., the potential reasoning contribution) of candidate nodes; (2) it avoids the state trap by encouraging the agents to explore the path along a set of nodes with more relations. Experiments on both benchmark and real-world medical knowledge graphs demonstrate the promising ability of our proposed method to improve the reasoning performance for KGs.},

  abstract     = {Weakly supervised object detection (WSOD) aims at learning precise object detectors with only image-level tags. In spite of intensive research on deep learning (DL) approaches over the past few years, there is still a significant performance gap between WSOD and fully supervised object detection. Existing WSOD methods only consider the visual appearance of each region proposal but ignore the useful context information in the image. This paper proposes an interactive end-to-end WSDO framework called JLWSOD with two innovations: i) two types of WSOD-specific context information (i.e., instance-wise correlation and semantic-wise correlation) are proposed and introduced into WSOD framework; ii) an interactive graph contrastive learning (iGCL) mechanism is designed to jointly optimize the visual appearance and context information for better WSOD performance. Specifically, the iGCL mechanism takes full advantage of the complementary interpretations of the WSOD, namely instance-wise detection and semantic-wise prediction tasks, forming a more comprehensive solution. Extensive experiments on the widely used PASCAL VOC and MS COCO benchmarks verify the superiority of JLWSOD over alternative SOTA and baseline models (improvement of 3.0%$\sim$23.3% on mAP and 3.1%$\sim$19.7% on CorLoc, respectively).},

  abstract     = {With the rapid growth of medical imaging data, radiologists must dedicate a significant amount of time to report writing. Automated generation of radiology reports not only alleviates the heavy workload of physicians but, more importantly, can reduce mistakes and oversights caused by insufficient experience. However, due to substantial data bias in medical data, prior studies using typical cross-entropy loss in encoder-decoder architectures often result in generalized descriptions of normal tissues and may overlook crucial clinical abnormalities. Therefore, we propose a clustering enhanced contrastive learning model named CECL to generate more diverse radiology reports, and it is worth noting that our method is end-to-end trainable. Specifically, an adaptive alignment fusion encoder-decoder network (AAF) is constructed by fusing the image features and text semantic features from the transformer decoder, eliminating information redundancy across different modalities. Moreover, a label-guided contrastive learning (LCL) module is proposed. In detail, clustering is performed on the fused features using Gaussian competition. Supervised contrastive learning is conducted based on the clustering results to enhance feature representation ability. We evaluate the CECL on two widely used publicly available datasets, IU X-ray and MIMIC-CXR, using NLG and CE metrics. The experimental results demonstrate that CECL can produce fluent reports with more descriptions of anomalies, outperforming other state-of-the-art methods with higher clinical correctness.},

However, the existing approaches can be further improved with the following considerations: (1) They congenitally suffer from the high cross-channel correlation loss for color image processing tasks since they usually treat each color channel independently, not in a whole perspective. (2) They only build up a single reconstruction dictionary learning model to directly approximate images using several single dictionary atoms, which cannot make full use of the representative ability of the model. In this paper, we propose a simultaneously learning deep quaternion reconstruction and noise convolutional dictionary model. To fully explore the cross-channel correlation, we use the quaternion method to process the color image in a holistic way. An adaptive attentional weight of reconstruction and noise learning module is also developed for the optimal combination between reconstruction and noise learning.

Various automated sleep staging methods have been developed to streamline this task, however, they commonly need extensive labeled clinical sleep data. ActiveSleepLearner is proposed to address this challenge, a transfer learning framework that leverages active learning techniques to achieve weakly supervised sleep staging across various settings, devices, and populations. On one hand, a selection algorithm that identifies the most informative samples for manual labeling is introduced, considering factors like sample representativeness, diversity, and complexity. On the other hand, during the fine-tuning phase with limited samples, model training efficiency is improved by introducing a novel joint loss function, implementing well-designed data augmentation techniques, and adopting layer-wise and multi-step learning rate strategies. Our approach reduces the manual annotation budget required from clinicians, enabling them to label only a small portion of the sizeable unlabeled dataset while the system handles the rest. Across the four datasets evaluated, our method consistently outperforms baselines and other partial-label methods. Especially, even with 5% labels, ActiveSleepLearner reaches 97.5% of the accuracy achieved by the model explicitly trained on this dataset. More importantly, ActiveSleepLearner fosters collaboration between humans and machines, reducing the clinician's burden by requiring them to label only a part of epochs instead of all recordings.},

The complex text recommendation is an important problem that remains largely unsolved. In order to overcome the aforementioned challenges, by taking the technology commercialization as an example, which aims to recommend demands to researchers, we propose a novel complex text recommendation model called Multi-order Attention and Semantic Enhanced Representation (MASER). By integrating additional information into text vector representationsuch as structural relationship information for extended keywords, and semantic information for entity description texts the proposed model enhances complex text recommendation effectiveness significantly. Extensive experiments have been conducted on real datasets, confirming the advantages of the MASER model and the attention mechanism's effectiveness on complex text recommendation.},

  abstract     = {Tensor-oriented multi-view subspace clustering has achieved significant strides in assessing high-order correlations of multi-view data. Nevertheless, most of existing investigations are typically hampered by the two flaws: (1) Self-representation based tensor subspace learning usually induces high time and space complexity, and is limited in perceiving nonlinear local structure in the embedding space. (2) The tensor singular value decomposition model redistributes each singular value equally without considering the diverse importance among them. To well cope with the above issues, we propose a hyper-Laplacian regularized concept factorization (HLRCF) in low-rank tensor space for multi-view clustering. Specifically, HLRCF adopts the concept factorization to explore the latent cluster-wise representation of each view. Further, the hypergraph Laplacian regularization endows the model with the capability of extracting the nonlinear local structures in the latent space. Considering that different tensor singular values associate structural information with unequal importance, we develop a self-weighted tensor Schatten $p$-norm to constrain the tensor comprised of all cluster-wise representations. Notably, the tensor with smaller size greatly decreases the time and space complexity in the low-rank optimization. Finally, experimental results on eight benchmark datasets exhibit that HLRCF outperforms other multi-view methods, showing its superior performance.},

Despite that, it is still quite challenging to design the EAs for high-dimensional feature selection (HDFS), since the increasing number of features causes the search space of EAs grows exponentially, which is known as the “curse of dimensionality”. To tackle the issue, in this paper, a Subspace Merging based Evolutionary Method, termed SMEM is suggested. In SMEM, to avoid directly optimizing the large search space of HDFS, the original feature space of HDFS is firstly divided into several independent low-dimensional subspaces. In each subspace, a subpopulation is evolved to obtain the latent good feature subsets quickly. Then, to avoid some features being missed, these low-dimensional subspaces merge in pairs, and the further search is carried on the merged subspaces. During the evolving of each merged subspace, the good feature subsets obtained from previous subspace pair are fully utilized. The above subspace merging procedure repeats, and the performance of SMEM is improved gradually, until in the end, all the subspaces are merged into one final space. At that time, the final space is also the original feature space in HDFS, which ensures all the features in the data is considered. Experimental results on different high-dimensional datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and the efficiency of the proposed SMEM, when compared with the state-of-the-arts.},

To reduce the computational burden of the controller, an event-triggered mechanism is integrated into the adaptive learning process. To overcome the limitations of static triggering, the dynamic variable is introduced to utilize past triggering information. The theoretical proof demonstrates the asymptotic stability of the system and a numerical example validates the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.

  abstract     = {Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) has been successful in solving many cooperative challenges. However, classic non-hierarchical MARL algorithms still cannot address various complex multi-agent problems that require hierarchical cooperative behaviors. The cooperative knowledge and policies learned in non-hierarchical algorithms are implicit and not interpretable, thereby restricting the integration of existing knowledge. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical MARL model called Hierarchical Cooperation Graph Learning (HCGL) for solving general multi-agent problems. HCGL has three components: a dynamic Extensible Cooperation Graph (ECG) for achieving self-clustering cooperation; a group of graph operators for adjusting the topology of ECG; and an MARL optimizer for training these graph operators. HCGL's key distinction from other MARL models is that the behaviors of agents are guided by the topology of ECG instead of policy neural networks. ECG is a three-layer graph consisting of an agent node layer, a cluster node layer, and a target node layer. To manipulate the ECG topology in response to changing environmental conditions, four graph operators are trained to adjust the edge connections of ECG dynamically. The hierarchical feature of ECG provides a unique approach to merge primitive actions (actions executed by the agents) and cooperative actions (actions executed by the clusters) into a unified action space, allowing us to integrate fundamental cooperative knowledge into an extensible interface. In our experiments, the HCGL model has shown outstanding performance in multi-agent benchmarks with sparse rewards. We also verify that HCGL can easily be transferred to large-scale scenarios with high zero-shot transfer success rates.},

  abstract     = {Hypercomplex graph convolutions with higher hypercomplex dimensions can extract more complex features in graphs and features with varying levels of complexity are suited for different situation. However, existing hypercomplex graph neural networks have a constraint that they can only carry out hypercomplex graph convolutions in a predetermined and unchangeable dimension. To address this limitation, this paper presents a solution to overcome this limitation by introducing the FFT-based Adaptive Fourier hypercomplex graph convolution filtering mechanism (FAF mechanism), which can adaptively select hypercomplex graph convolutions with the most appropriate dimensions for different situations by projecting the outputs from all candidate hypercomplex graph convolutions to the frequency domain and selecting the one with the highest energy via the FFT-based Adaptive Fourier Decomposition. Meanwhile, we apply the FAF mechanism to our proposed hypercomplex high-order interaction graph neural network (HHG-Net), which performs high-order interaction and strengthens interaction features through quantum graph hierarchical attention module and feature interaction gated graph convolution. During convolution filtering, the FAF mechanism projects the outputs from different candidate hypercomplex graph convolutions to the frequency domain, extracts their energy, and selects the convolution that outputs the largest energy. After that, the model with selected hypercomplex graph convolutions is trained again. Our method outperforms many benchmarks, including the model with hypercomplex graph convolutions selected by DARTS, in node classification, graph classification, and text classification. This showcases the versatility of our approach, which can be effectively applied to both graph and text data.},

  abstract     = {Visibility challenges such as atmospheric haze, water turbidity, etc. are imposed while capturing images in various mediums like aerial, outdoor, underwater, etc. Such reduction in visibility affects the functioning of high-level computer vision applications like object detection, semantic segmentation, military surveillance, earthquake assessment, etc. The existing methods either rely on incorporating additional prior information during the training process or yield less than optimal results when analysed on images with varying levels of degradation, reason being the absence of both local and global dependencies within the extracted features. This paper presents a generalized transformer based architecture for aerial, outdoor and underwater image enhancement. We propose a novel space aware deformable convolution based multi-head self attention containing spatially attentive offset extraction. Here, the deformable multi-head attention is introduced to reconstruct fine level texture in the restored image. Additionally, we introduce a spatially attentive offset extractor within the deformable convolution to prioritize relevant contextual information. Further, we propose an edge enhancing feature fusion block for restoring the edge details in the image along with learning enriched features from multi-stream information. Finally, we propose a global context aware channel attentive feature propagator having a dual functionality of global information extraction and provision of channel attention. Comprehensive experimentation conducted on both synthetic and real-world datasets, along with thorough ablation study, showcases that the proposed approach performs optimally when compared with the existing methods on aerial, outdoor, and underwater image enhancement.},

  abstract     = {Despite the significant advancements in single-agent evolutionary reinforcement learning, research exploring evolutionary reinforcement learning within multi-agent systems is still in its nascent stage. The integration of evolutionary algorithms (EA) and reinforcement learning (RL) has partially mitigated RL's reliance on the environment and provided it with an ample supply of data. Nonetheless, existing studies primarily focus on the indirect collaboration between RL and EA, which lacks sufficient exploration on the effective balance of individual and team rewards. To address this problem, this study introduces game theory to establish a dynamic cooperation framework between EA and RL, and proposes a multi-agent evolutionary reinforcement learning based on cooperative games. This framework facilitates more efficient direct collaboration between RL and EA, enhancing individual rewards while ensuring the attainment of team objectives. Initially, a cooperative policy is formed through a joint network to simplify the parameters of each agent to speed up the overall training process. Subsequently, RL and EA engage in cooperative games to determine whether RL jointly optimizes the same policy based on Pareto optimal results. Lastly, through double objectives optimization, a balance between the two types of rewards is achieved, with EA focusing on team rewards and RL focusing on individual rewards. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms its single-algorithm counterparts in terms of competitiveness.},

It is crucial to explore strategies for enhancing system stability and preventing critical transitions, a process known as re-stabilization. This paper aims to provide a theoretical basis for re-stabilization using HDLSS data by proposing a computational method to approximate pole placement for re-stabilizing large-scale networks. The proposed method analyzes HDLSS data to extract pertinent information about the network system, which is then used to design feedback gain and input placement for approximate pole placement. The novelty of this method lies in adjusting only the diagonal elements of the system matrix, thus simplifying the re-stabilization process and enhancing its practicality. The method is applicable to systems experiencing either saddle-node bifurcation or Hopf bifurcation. A theoretical analysis was performed to examine the perturbation of the maximum eigenvalues of the system matrix using the proposed approximate pole placement method. We validated the proposed method via simulations based on the Holme-Kim model.},

To address this issue, we theoretically analyze the weighted mutual information relationships between the class variable and its causal features through feature relevance, redundancy, and complementarity, and propose a Weighted-Causal Feature Selection algorithm (W-CFS). Specifically, W-CFS uses weighted mutual information to discriminate between minority and majority classes, to accurately discover the Markov blanket of the class variable with imbalanced data. The comprehensive experimental results on imbalanced benchmark Bayesian networks datasets and imbalanced real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed algorithm has better accuracy and comparable efficiency in comparison to State-of-the-Art competitors.},

  abstract     = {This paper focuses on a distributed nonsmooth composite optimization problem over a multiagent networked system, in which each agent is equipped with a local Lipschitz-differentiable function and two possibly nonsmooth functions, one of which incorporates a linear mapping. To address this problem, we introduce a synchronous distributed algorithm featuring uncoordinated relaxed factors. It serves as a generalized relaxed version of the recent method TriPD-Dist. Notably, the considered problem in the presence of asynchrony and delays remains relatively unexplored. In response, a new asynchronous distributed primal-dual proximal algorithm is first proposed, rooted in a comprehensive asynchronous model. It is operated under the assumption that agents utilize possibly outdated information from their neighbors, while considering arbitrary, time-varying, yet bounded delays. With some special adjustments, new asynchronous distributed extensions of existing centralized methods are obtained via the proposed asynchronous algorithm. Theoretically, a new convergence analysis technique of the proposed algorithms is provided. Specifically, a sublinear convergence rate is explicitly derived by showcasing that the iteration behaves as a nonexpansive operator. In addition, the proposed asynchronous algorithm converges the optimal solution in expectation under the same step-size conditions as its synchronous counterpart. Finally, numerical studies substantiate the efficacy of the proposed algorithms and validate their performance in practical scenarios.},

The proposed method comprises a cross attention generator, self Attention discriminator, and feature fusion module. The cross attention generator captures temporal relationships in input action sequences, generating discriminative unobserved action information. The self attention discriminator adds global attention to the input sequence, capturing global context information for accurate evaluation of consistency in generated unobserved feature from cross attention generator. Finally, the feature fusion module helps the model obtain richer and more comprehensive feature representations. The proposed method is evaluated through experiments on the HMDB51, UCF101 and Something-Something v2 datasets.

This paper proposes consistent dimensional reduction (CDR), which automatically identifies a shared informative input subspace for the rule antecedents and consequents via gradient backpropagation, and thus performs well-generalizable end-to-end consistent feature extraction. Integrating CDR with our previously proposed MBGD-RDpA (mini-batch gradient descent with regularization, DropRule, and Powerball AdaBelief) leads to CDR-GRDpA for grid partition based TSK fuzzy system optimization, and CDR-FRDpA for fuzzy c-means clustering based TSK fuzzy system optimization. Experiments demonstrated that CDR-FRDpA almost always obtained the smallest root mean squared error, with high computational efficiency and strong parameter robustness. Further integrating CDR-FRDpA with adaptive rule pruning or adaptive group LASSO leads to two variants with better generalization, albeit slightly increased computational cost.},

However, developing the most suitable DNN model for each on-device task is nontrivial, due to data governance of these tasks and data heterogeneity across them. Existing approaches tackle this issue by learning task-specific models on the device, but this requires substantial computational resources, exacerbating the computational and energy demands on edge devices. This research strives to enhance the deployment efficiency of advanced models on edge devices, with a specific focus on reducing the on-device learning cost. In pursuit of this goal, we propose a category-specific but task-agnostic evolutionary neural architecture search (CSTA-ENAS) method. This method can utilize the available datasets from multiple other tasks in the same category as on-device tasks to design a transferable architecture on the server. Then, this architecture only requires light on-device fine-tuning to satisfactorily solve all different on-device tasks, significantly reducing the on-device learning time and related energy consumption. To improve the search efficiency of our method, a supernet-based partial training strategy is proposed to reduce the evaluation cost for candidate architectures. To showcase the effectiveness of CSTA-ENAS, we build transferable DNN models and evaluate their accuracies on a set of new image classification tasks.

Currently, publicly available datasets for research in this field are lacking, and state-of-the-art algorithm models can only identify individual pavement elements with specificity. Based on this, we constructed the ME-Seg dataset for pavement multi-element semantic segmentation, which comprises three training labels: drivable areas, lane lines, and road traffic signs. This dataset captures various traffic, lighting, and weather conditions. Next, we propose a real-time semantic segmentation algorithm model for autonomous driving on road surfaces called DLS-Net based on visual sensors. This network adopts a dual-branch network structure and can accurately identify drivable areas, lane lines, and road traffic signs simultaneously. Within the network, we designed a Multi-Scale Fusion Module (MSFM) to expand the receptive field and include large objects within the field of view. Additionally, we designed a Cross-Guided Aggregation Module (CGAM) to provide guidance information for deep and shallow feature maps while compensating for information loss in small objects. The experimental results based on ME-Seg demonstrate that the mIoU of the proposed network reaches 75.61% at an inference speed of 49.5 fps. The results of real-world vehicle experiments demonstrate that the model exhibits good performance and robustness in actual autonomous driving scenarios.},

  abstract     = {A quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) approach using single-orientation imaging data is proposed in this study. The proposed method generates local field maps at five predefined orientations via deep learning from single-orientation local field maps, followed by physical dipole inversion using the analytical Calculation of Susceptibility through Multiple Orientation Sampling (COSMOS) algorithm. We termed the method pseudo COSMOS (pCOSMOS). By isolating the physical dipole inversion process from deep learning, training of the neural network model becomes greatly accelerated. Brain imaging data from 10 healthy subjects (7 training and 3 testing) acquired at 3T with five different orientations relative to the main magnetic field were included to evaluate the reconstruction quality. Results compared against two iterative (Morphology Enabled Dipole Inversion or MEDI, and Structural Feature-based Collaborative Reconstruction or SFCR) and two deep learning QSM approaches (QSMnet and Learned Proximal Convolutional Neural Network or LPCNN) using COSMOS as the reference standard revealed that the susceptibility maps obtained from pCOSMOS yielded global quantitative performance comparable to QSMnet and LPCNN, while being prominently superior to MEDI and SFCR. Estimation errors in magnetic susceptibility were between 0.01 and 0.02 ppm voxel-wise, and 0.006 ± 0.004 ppm for five selected gray matter areas. Visual inspection further suggested better preserved tissue boundaries in pCOSMOS than QSMnet and LPCNN. Training time was reduced from 2 days for LPCNN and 12 hours for QSMnet to 3.2 hours for pCOSMOS. It is concluded that the proposed pCOSMOS method is an alternative deep learning QSM approach when computational efficiency is essential.},

  abstract     = {Crowdsourcing provides an effective way to collect labeled data and train models for machine learning. However, crowd workers performing data collection may expose them to the risk of privacy breaches, which lowers their willingness to participate in the tasks. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel incentive mechanism for a federated learning paradigm, namely TiFedCrowd, which mitigates the risk of privacy breaches for crowd workers and obtains high-quality crowdsourcing data and learning models at the minimum cost. TiFedCrowd allows clients to keep privacy-related data locally, just needing to upload trained models (parameters) to the server. The server then aggregates local models into a global model. TiFedCrowd models the federated crowdsourcing process as a two-stage Stackelberg game and motivates more workers to complete tasks with high quality and efficiency. It also provides a time control mechanism to manage the quality of the submitted outcomes, the range of data freshness, and the waiting time. TiFedCrowd requires the client to complete the federated crowdsourcing task within a specified time interval while globally maximizing the utility of both clients and the server by solving the Nash equilibrium. We also extended TiFedCrowd to the multiple heterogeneous federated crowdsourcing scenario. Extensive simulation shows that TiFedCrowd not only ensures the fairness of the incentive but also has significant effects on accelerating convergence speed, selecting data/model quality, and saving the budget. Moreover, we also confirm the effectiveness of TiFedCrowd in real-world crowdsourcing tasks.},

  abstract     = {Environmental monitoring has become a serious topic of discussion and is gaining mass attention. The reason is the severe consequences of environmental depletion, which has led to circumstances like climate change, rise in floods and droughts, changed rainfall patterns, etc. So, various measures are being taken to protect the environment, like shifting to renewable and pollution-free energy alternatives, like solar energy, and handling the after-effects of disasters, like flood management and oil spill accident management. However, their identification still remains a huge challenge, which is laborious and extensive. Thus, this work proposed a lightweight and efficient segmentation model, SA U-Net++, for the automatic identification of solar panels and their associated defects, flood affected-areas and oil spill accident regions. The model's novel blend of level-wise self-attention modules is embedded with the revised bridge connections and the dropouts. It has helped in better efficient global context understanding and feature extraction from the inputs, besides maintaining the integrity of the training process and avoiding some major learning and run-time issues, like overfitting and memory exhaustion. Our detailed experiments demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art models. The results confirm its high generalizability, cost-effectiveness, and robustness.},

  abstract     = {Adversarial training enhances the robustness of deep networks at the cost of reduced natural accuracy. Moreover, networks fortified struggle to simultaneously defend against both sparse and dense perturbations. Thus, achieving a better trade-off between natural accuracy and robustness against both types of noise remains an open challenge. Many proposed approaches explore solutions based on network architecture optimization. But, in most cases, the additional parameters introduced are static, meaning that once network training is completed, the performance remains unchanged, and retraining is required to explore other potential trade-offs. We propose two dynamic auxiliary modules, CBNI and CCNI, which can fine-tune convolutional layers and BN layers, respectively, during the inference phase, so that the trained network can still adjust its emphasis on natural examples, sparse perturbations or dense perturbations. This means our network can achieve an appropriate balance to adapt to the operational environment in situ, without retraining. Furthermore, fully exploring natural capability and robustness limits is a complex and time-consuming problem. Our method can serve as an efficient research tool to examine the achievable trade-offs with just a single training. It is worth mentioning that CCNI is a linear adjustment and CBNI does not directly participate in the inference process. Therefore, both of them don't introduce redundant parameters and inference latency. Experiments indicate that our network can indeed achieve a complex trade-off between accuracy and adversarial robustness, producing performance that is comparable to or even better than existing methods.},

  abstract     = {Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) use discrete spike sequences to transmit information, which significantly mimics the information transmission of the brain. Although this binarized form of representation dramatically enhances the energy efficiency and robustness of SNNs, it also leaves a large gap between the performance of SNNs and Artificial Neural Networks based on real values. There are many different spike patterns in the brain, and the dynamic synergy of these spike patterns greatly enriches the representation capability. Inspired by spike patterns in biological neurons, this paper introduces the dynamic Burst pattern and designs the Leaky Integrate and Fire or Burst (IF&B) neuron that can make a trade-off between short-time performance and dynamic temporal performance from the perspective of network information capacity. IF&B neuron exhibits three modes, resting, Regular spike, and Burst spike. The burst density of the neuron can be adaptively adjusted, which significantly enriches the characterization capability. We also propose a decoupling method that can losslessly decouple IF&B neurons into equivalent LIF neurons, which demonstrates that IF&B neurons can be efficiently implemented on neuromorphic hardware. We conducted experiments on the static datasets CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and ImageNet, which showed that we greatly improved the performance of the SNNs while significantly reducing the network latency. We also conducted experiments on neuromorphic datasets DVS-CIFAR10 and NCALTECH101 and showed that we achieved state-of-the-art with a small network structure.},

Since the QUAV attitude dynamic is modeled by a second-order nonlinear differential equation, the optimized backstepping (OB) technique can be competent for this control design. To derive the optimized leader-follower attitude consensus control, the critic-actor reinforcement learning (RL) is performed in the final backstepping step. Different with the attitude control of single QUAV, the case of multi-QUAV is composed of multiple intercommunicated QUAV attitude individuals, so its control design is more complex and thorny. Moreover, the traditional RL optimizing controls deduce the critic or actor updating law from the negative gradient of approximated Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman (HJB) equation' square, thus it leads to these algorithms very complexity. Hence the traditional optimizing control methods are implemented to multi-QUAV attitude system difficultly. However, since this optimized scheme deduces the RL training laws from a simple positive function of equivalent with HJB equation, it can obviously simplify algorithm for the smooth application in the multi-QUAV attitude system. Finally, theory and simulation certify the feasibility of this optimized consensus control.},

  abstract     = {Deep learning models are widely used in medical image-guided disease recognition and have achieved outstanding performance. Voxel-based models are typically the default choice for deep learning-based MRI analysis, which require high computational resources and large data volumes, making them inefficient for rapid disease screening. Simultaneously, the existing Alzheimer's disease (AD) recognition model is primarily comprised of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) structures. With the increasing of the network depth, the fine-grained details of global features tend to be partially lost. Therefore, we propose a Multi-scale spatial self-attention Network (MssNet) that effectively captures both coarse-grained and fine-grained features. We design to select the target slice based on image entropy to achieve efficient slice-based AD recognition. To capture multi-level spatial information, a novel spatial attention mechanism and spatial self-attention attention are designed. The former is utilized to collect critical spatial information and identify areas that are likely to be lesions, the latter investigates the relationship between features in different image regions through spatial interaction by pure convolutional blocks. MssNet fully utilizes multi-scale information at different granularities for spatial feature interaction, providing it with strong modeling and information understanding capabilities. It has achieved excellent performance in the recognition tasks of Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) and Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS) datasets. Moreover, MssNet is a lightweight model involving lower scale parameters against the Voxel-based ones, while demonstrating strong generalization capability.},

To address these challenges, we propose an Adaptive Federated Meta Learning Framework with Multi-Objectives and Context-Awareness (AdaFML). This framework aims to achieve multiple objectives, including improving the performance of the FL global model, optimizing time efficiency, and enabling local model adaptation in dynamic and heterogeneous environments. Specifically, AdaFML extracts contextual information from each device, including its data distribution, computation, and communication conditions, to train a multimodal model that optimizes the FL task and time cost estimation, enhancing global model performance and time efficiency. Moreover, AdaFML fine-tunes two critical meta-learning parameters: the mixture ratio between local and global models and the selection weights for model aggregation. This enables adaptive local model updates across different devices while improving global model performance. Experimental results demonstrate that AdaFML boosts the effectiveness, efficiency, and adaptability of FL task execution in dynamic and heterogeneous environments.},

However, caused of complex correlations between happiness factors, there is inconsistency in case-by-case explanations provided by different models. In response, we propose a novel and trustworthy explanation solution for happiness prediction that can identify a broadly acceptable key factor set to improve explanation consistency across various models. First, the factor decorrelation is employed to ensure competitively high prediction accuracy. Second, we utilized a happiness prediction model pool that includes trained models with competitive accuracy, contributing to consistent explanations. The factor contribution is then computed using a post-hoc method based on the Shapley value with theoretical properties. The final key factor set is determined by the intersection of sets across different models. Experimental results using the Chinese General Social Survey (CGSS) and the European Social Survey (ESS) datasets validate the 2-fold increase in explanation consistency. Represented by specific citizen groups built on age, comprised of young group ($\leq$40) and elder group ($&gt;$40), and health, comprised of bad health (1-3) and good health (4-5), we demonstrate how these demographics exhibit different contributions in terms of factors.

  abstract     = {High-dimensional and incomplete (HDI) data commonly arise in various Big Data-related applications, e.g., recommender systems and bioinformatics. Representation is a learning paradigm to map HDI data into low-dimensional latent space for attracting valuable knowledge and patterns. Currently, deep neural network (DNN) is one of the most popular and successful approaches to represent HDI data due to its powerful nonlinear learning ability. However, previous DNNs-based approaches primarily focused on advancing the sophisticated model structure, neglecting the potential adverse effects of outliers. Unfortunately, outliers usually exist in the collected HDI data. For example, HDI data collected from recommender systems inevitably contain many outlier ratings due to some malicious users. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel outlier-resilient autoencoder (termed ORA). Its core idea is to design an adaptive Cauchy loss strategy to measure the difference between the observed and predicted data for an autoencoder in representing the HDI data. This strategy leverages a more aggressive Cauchy loss to impose a higher penalty on outlier data with large deviation, while utilizing a smoother Cauchy loss to capture the nuanced, deeper features of HDI data. As such, ORA can dynamically adjust the smoothness of the Cauchy loss during training to handle different levels of data deviation. To evaluate the proposed ORA, extensive experiments are conducted on five benchmark HDI datasets. The results validate that: (1) ORA achieves significantly better representation accuracy than State-of-the-Art DNN- and non-DNN-based models, and (2) ORA possesses higher robustness to outlier data than its peers.},

Conventional evaluation methods of their robustness rely on adversarial accuracy, which measures the model performance under a specific perturbation intensity. However, this singular metric does not fully encapsulate the overall resilience of a model against varying degrees of perturbation. To address this issue, we propose a new metric termed as the adversarial hypervolume for assessing the robustness of deep learning models comprehensively over a range of perturbation intensities from a multi-objective optimization standpoint. This metric allows for an in-depth comparison of defense mechanisms and recognizes the trivial improvements in robustness brought by less potent defensive strategies. We adopt a novel training algorithm to enhance adversarial robustness uniformly across various perturbation intensities, instead of only optimizing adversarial accuracy. Our experiments validate the effectiveness of the adversarial hypervolume metric in robustness evaluation, demonstrating its ability to reveal subtle differences in robustness that adversarial accuracy overlooks.},

  abstract     = {Dynamic constrained multiobjective optimization problems include irregular and discontinuous feasible regions, segmented true Pareto front, and dynamic environments. To address these problems, we design a dynamic constrained multiobjective optimization algorithm based on dual-population evolution. This algorithm includes two populations, P1 and P2, based on the feasibility of solutions. It utilizes valuable information from infeasible solutions to drive the populations toward the feasible regions and the true Pareto front. At the same time, we propose a mating selection operator to facilitate information exchange between populations and generate promising offspring solutions. To respond to environmental changes, we design a strategy that combines new solutions obtained by the sampling-selection-resampling method and updated old ones, rapidly generating a promising population in a new environment. Additionally, we also design a test suit that can effectively present the discontinuous feasible regions and the irregular changes of true Pareto front in practical appcation problems. The results from experiments demonstrate the efficacy of the test suit, and the proposed algorithm exhibits competitiveness compared to other algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Knowledge distillation aims to transfer knowledge from a large teacher model to a lightweight student model, enabling the student to achieve performance comparable to the teacher. Existing methods explore various strategies for distillation, including soft logits, intermediate features, and even class-aware logits. Class-aware distillation, in particular, treats the columns of logit matrices as class representations, capturing potential relationships among instances within a batch. However, we argue that representing class embeddings solely as column vectors may not fully capture their inherent properties. In this study, we revisit class-aware knowledge distillation and propose that effective transfer of class-level knowledge requires two regularization strategies: separability and orthogonality. Additionally, we introduce an asymmetric architecture design to further enhance the transfer of class-level knowledge. Together, these components form a new methodology, Class Discriminative Knowledge Distillation (CD-KD). Empirical results demonstrate that CD-KD significantly outperforms several state-of-the-art logit-based and feature-based methods across diverse visual classification tasks, highlighting its effectiveness and robustness.},

Further, to enhance exploration, a diversity-driven exploration strategy, which leverages redundant individuals from convergence regions to explore the solution space, is introduced. Additionally, an adaptive local search operation, in which the probability of applying local search and corresponding sampling area are dynamically determined based on the potential of solutions as well as the stage of evolution, is developed to fine-tune promising solutions.

Currently, population-based computational intelligence methods have attracted attention on BACAPs, but on small-scale cases and simplified problem models. In this paper, we propose a novel swarm optimization with intra- and inter-hierarchical competition (I2HCSO) for addressing large-scale BACAPs, which is a major challenge in container terminals. First, we construct a hierarchical model with better particles at the higher hierarchy, and the populations at different hierarchies are divided into several sub-swarm. Then, we design an intra- and inter-hierarchical competitive mechanism to balance the exploration and exploitation of the population, in which intra-hierarchical competition is carried out within sub-swarm at any hierarchy, whereas inter-hierarchical competition occurs in different sub-swarms of neighboring hierarchies. Third, we consider optimizing the priorities of vessels for efficient use of resources berth and crane for the first time in BACAPs and employ $\varepsilon$-constraints to search for feasible regions. Additionally, we develop a local search operator as a repair strategy to improve the quality of the solution. Finally, we test I2HCSO in a set of cases consisting of 25 BACAPs. Compared with the several typical optimizers with experimental results, I2HCSO is more competitive on BACAPs with different scales.},

However, current methods struggle to find suitable subgoals for ensuring a stable learning process. To address the issue, we propose a general hierarchical reinforcement learning framework incorporating human feedback and dynamic distance constraints, termed MENTOR, which acts as a “mentor”. Specifically, human feedback is incorporated into high-level policy learning to find better subgoals. Furthermore, we propose the Dynamic Distance Constraint (DDC) mechanism dynamically adjusting the space of optional subgoals, such that MENTOR can generate subgoals matching the low-level policy learning process from easy to hard. As a result, the learning efficiency can be improved. As for low-level policy, a dual policy is designed for exploration-exploitation decoupling to stabilize the training process. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MENTOR uses a small amount of human feedback to achieve significant improvement in complex tasks with sparse rewards.},

  abstract     = {Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a devastating neurological condition affecting a significant portion of the world's aging population. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been widely adopted to visualize and analyze the structural atrophies and other brain deformities caused by AD. Due to the differences in brain anatomy, brain sub-regions such as grey matter (GM), white matter (WM), and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) deteriorate. Research shows that changes in GM, WM, and CSF are among the earliest detectable AD markers, supporting their use in early diagnosis and monitoring disease progression. In this paper, GM, WM, and CSF have been extracted from the T1-weighted MRI scan acquired from the ADNI database. A fine-tuned DL model has been implemented for automated and all levels of feature extraction. For classification, the data points from the input space are explicitly translated into a randomized feature space using a neural network with randomly generated weights for the hidden layer. After feature projection, the extended features train classification models, where two non-parallel hyperplanes are optimized, with all associated parameters undergoing fuzzification to enhance model robustness. The proposed classifier, a randomized vectored fuzzy least square twin support vector machine, adeptly manages the challenges of uncertain, imbalanced, and nonlinear data commonly found in medical imaging. It integrates fuzzy membership functions to systematically address data uncertainty and employs a least squares formulation to optimize the model efficiently, ensuring high accuracy and scalability. The performance of the proposed model is tested and compared with popular state-of-the-art models, showing significant improvements in effectiveness.},

In this context, density-based methods have emerged as the preferred choice for the clustering mechanism within the framework of deep feature clustering. However, as the performance of these clustering algorithms is primarily effective on the low-dimensional feature data, deep feature learning models play a crucial role here. With far infrared (FIR) thermal imaging systems working in real-world scenarios, the images captured are largely affected by blurred edges, background noise, thermal irregularities, few details, etc. In this work, we demonstrate the effectiveness of granular computing-based techniques in such scenarios, where the input data contains indiscernible image regions and vague boundary regions. We propose a novel adaptive non-homogeneous granulation (ANHG) technique here that can adaptively select the smallest possible size of granules within a purview of unequally-sized granulation, based on a segmentation assessment index. Proposed ANHG in combination with deep feature learning helps in extracting complex, indiscernible information from the image data and capturing the local intensity variation of the data. Experimental results show significant performance improvement of the density-based deep feature clustering method after the incorporation of the proposed granulation scheme.},

Renowned for its minimal control parameters and straightforward implementation, the SSA algorithm has swiftly emerged as one of the most proficient and attractive optimization methodologies. Despite its significant accuracy in solutions and rapid convergence, the SSA is hampered by its underperformance in tackling intricate optimization challenges and an imbalanced distribution between exploration and exploitation capabilities. Consequently, this paper proposes a dynamic two-factor sparrow search algorithm based on an enhanced differential evolution operator (DSSADE). Initially, to harmonize both the global and local search capabilities and enhance the convergence speed of the SSA algorithm, a dynamic two-factor mode is put forward. Subsequently, a tolerance mechanism is devised to gauge the algorithm's likelihood of gravitating towards local optima. Furthermore, an embedded enhanced differential evolution operator (EDE) fortifies the SSA's capacity to escape local optima. Notably, experimental results obtained from both classical and CEC2017 benchmark functions exhibit substantial confirmation and endorse the superior efficacy of DSSADE compared to various SSA variants and other cutting-edge swarm intelligent algorithms.},

These scenarios are categorized as multiparty multiobjective optimization problems (MPMOPs). For MPMOPs, the goal is to find a solution set that is as close to the Pareto front of each DM as much as possible. This poses challenges for evolutionary algorithms in terms of searching and selecting. To better solve MPMOPs, this paper proposes a novel approach called the multiparty immune algorithm (MPIA). The MPIA incorporates an inter-party guided crossover strategy based on the individual's non-dominated sorting ranks from different DM perspectives and an adaptive activation strategy based on the proposed multiparty cover metric (MCM). These strategies enable MPIA to activate suitable individuals for the next operations, maintain population diversity from different DM perspectives, and enhance the algorithm's search capability. To evaluate the performance of MPIA, we compare it with ordinary multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) and state-of-the-art multiparty multiobjective optimization evolutionary algorithms (MPMOEAs) by solving synthetic multiparty multiobjective problems and real-world biparty multiobjective unmanned aerial vehicle path planning (BPUAV-PP) problems involving multiple DMs. Experimental results demonstrate that MPIA outperforms other algorithms.},

The introduction of a novel end-to-end Cumulative Learning Strategy (CLS) and Multi-Weighted New Loss (MWNL) function reduces the impact of unevenly distributed datasets. In the suggested framework, the DCNN model is incorporated with regularization, such as DropOut and DropBlock, to mitigate the problem of over-fitting. Furthermore, the suggested augmentation approach, Modified RandAugment, successfully deals with the issue of limited availability of data. Finally, the employment of K-nearest neighbor (KNN) improves the classification performance since it retains the benefits of both deep learning and machine learning.

  abstract     = {Person text-image matching, also known as text-based person search, aims to retrieve images of specific pedestrians using text descriptions. Although person text-image matching has made great research progress, existing methods still face two challenges. First, the lack of interpretability of text features makes it challenging to effectively align them with their corresponding image features. Second, the same pedestrian image often corresponds to multiple different text descriptions, and a single text description can correspond to multiple different images of the same identity. The diversity of text descriptions and images makes it difficult for a network to extract robust features that match the two modalities. To address these problems, we propose a person text-image matching method by embedding text-feature interpretability and an external attack node. Specifically, we improve the interpretability of text features by providing them with consistent semantic information with image features to achieve the alignment of text and describe image region features. To address the challenges posed by the diversity of text and the corresponding person images, we treat the variation caused by diversity to features as caused by perturbation information and propose a novel adversarial attack and defense method to solve it. In the model design, graph convolution is used as the basic framework for feature representation and the adversarial attacks caused by text and image diversity on feature extraction is simulated by implanting an additional attack node in the graph convolution layer to improve the robustness of the model against text and image diversity. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of text-pedestrian image matching over existing methods.},

Furthermore, we delve into the impact of larger patch strategies and channel interaction strategies on Transformer's performance, specifically Long Sub-sequence Division (LSD) and Multi-channel Separation and Interaction (MSI). These strategies collectively constitute a novel model termed PETformer. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that PETformer achieves state-of-the-art performance on eight commonly used public datasets for LTSF, surpassing all existing models. The insights and enhancement methodologies presented in this paper serve as valuable reference points and sources of inspiration for future research endeavors.},

  abstract     = {Compressed Sensing Magnetic Resonance Imaging (CS-MRI) enables high-quality image reconstruction from a small set of the k-space data, thereby accelerating the efficiency of MRI. Existing deep unrolling-based CS-MRI algorithms predominantly utilize Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures with fixed-size convolutional kernels to extract single-scale features from k-space data, resulting in the loss or blurring of important information in the reconstructed magnetic resonance (MR) image. Moreover, due to the inherent local feature dependency within CNN architectures, these methods may possess inherent limitations in capturing the global structural information present in MR data. To address the aforementioned challenges, we propose an Attention-Enhanced Convolutional Iterative Unrolling Network for CS-MRI reconstruction, called ACIU-Net, which can obtain high-quality MR reconstruction images. Specifically, we design a Multi-Scale Convolutional Feature Extractor (MFE) module to adequately capture multi-scale features of k-space data, and use convolutional blocks with residual concatenation to learn the nonlinear transformation process of the Proximal Gradient Descent (PGD) algorithm. Meanwhile, we introduce the customized Global Feature Aggregation Attention (GFA) modules within the MFE to strengthen the feature representation capability, which can adjust the importance of each sub-feature by generating distinct attention factors of the MR data, thereby enabling the capture of its global characteristics. Experimental results on the Brain, Cardiac and FastMRI datasets show that our proposed ACIU-Net significantly outperforms the current state-of-the-art CS-MRI methods.},

Content caching in Edge Computing is a promising solution to cope with this exponential rise in video traffic. The most popular videos are typically stored in the local caches of edge servers to provide fast and continuous access to videos. However, various edge caching strategies fail to cope with the dynamic request patterns of the users. Most learning-based caching models are generally trained in a centralized way, which overconsumes the network resources during training and transmission of video requests. Therefore, we propose a Federated Learning-based Reinforcement Learning caching framework called FedCache in this work. In FedCache, the training is decentralised on the end-user devices with its local data. The trained parameters from the end users are aggregated at the central server. A comprehensive set of experiments were performed, and FedCache outperformed existing state-of-the-art caching strategies concerning cache hit rate, access delay and backhaul traffic significantly.},

  abstract     = {Supervised classification problems from the real world typically face a challenge characterized by the scarcity of samples in one or more target classes compared to the rest of the majority classes. In response to such class imbalance, we propose an oversampling technique based on clustering, aiming to populate the minority class with synthetic samples. This approach capitalizes on the notion of “Cluster Cores,” representing locally dense regions within clusters. These Cluster Cores act as central, densely crowded areas that capture intricate topological properties of the corresponding clusters, especially in complex datasets with a non-convex spatial orientation in the feature space. By concentrating on these high-density regions, our clustering-based oversampling technique generates synthetic samples within the convex hull region of minority class instances in the formed clusters. This strategy ensures the creation of points that align with the data space and considers each minority instance within a specific cluster, thereby averting the problems encountered due to the generation of artificial samples by mere linear combination of the minority class data points, as is encountered in SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique)-based algorithms. To assess the efficacy of our proposal, we conducted experimental comparisons against several cutting-edge algorithms, considering an array of evaluation metrics on well-known datasets used in the literature for both binary and multi-class classification. Additionally, we undertook a detailed ablation study, scrutinized existing algorithms in our context, delineated their strengths and limitations, and contemplated potential research directions in this domain.},

This paper develops a novel Q-learning based model-free $H_{\infty }$ control scheme for nonlinear CT systems, where the adaptive critic and actor continuously and simultaneously update each other, eliminating the need for iterative steps. As a result, a hybrid structure is avoided and there is no longer a requirement for an initial stabilizing control policy. To obtain the $H_{\infty }$ control of the CT nonlinear system, the Q-learning strategy is introduced to online resolve the $H_{\infty }$ control problem in a non-iterative approach, where the system dynamics are not required. In addition, a new learning law is further developed by utilizing a sliding mode scheme to online update the critic neural network (NN) weights. Due to the strong convergence of critic NN weights, the actor NN used in most $H_{\infty }$ control algorithms is removed. Finally, numerical simulation and experimental results of an adaptive cruise control (ACC) system based on a real vehicle effectively demonstrate the feasibility of the presented control method and learning algorithm.},

The traditional pipeline methods are to divide the extraction into two separate subtasks, which misses the potential interactio between the two subtasks and may lead to error propagation. In this work, we propose an effective cascade dual-decoder method to extract overlapping relational triples, which includes a text-specific relation decoder and a relation-corresponded entity decoder. Our approach is straightforward and it includes a text-specific relation decoder and a relation-corresponded entity decoder. The text-specific relation decoder detects relations from a sentence at the text level. That is, it does this according to the semantic information of the whole sentence. For each extracted relation, which is with trainable embedding, the relation-corresponded entity decoder detects the corresponding head and tail entities using a span-based tagging scheme. In this way, the overlapping triple problem can be tackled naturally. We conducted experiments on a real-world open-pit mine dataset and two public datasets to verify the method's generalizability. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and competitiveness of our proposed method and achieve better F1 scores under strict evaluation metrics.},

However, existing methods commonly utilize ${{\mathbf{L}}_1}$ or ${{\mathbf{L}}_2}$ loss to calculate the posterior average, thus heavily suffering from the over-smoothing problem. To address this, we propose a diffusion model-based method, named DiffDose, to automatically predict radiotherapy dose distribution for cancer patients. Specifically, our DiffDose model contains a forward process and a reverse process. In the forward process, DiffDose gradually adds small noise to dose distribution maps via multiple steps until converting them to pure Gaussian noise, and a noise predictor is simultaneously trained to estimate the noise added in each step. In the reverse process, DiffDose iteratively removes the noise from a pure Gaussian noise leveraging the well-trained noise predictor and finally outputs the predicted dose distribution maps. Concretely, to provide the model with essential structure information, we design a structure encoder to learn the anatomical knowledge from patients’ anatomy images, guiding the noise predictor to generate dose distribution maps that are aware of personalized structures. Considering the latent continuity and similarity among sliced anatomy images, an inter-slice interaction transformer (I2T) block is embedded in the structure encoder to capture such long-range dependency. Extensive experiments on an in-house dataset involving 130 rectum cancer cases validate the superiority of our method.},

  abstract     = {Inspired by the great success of the Transformer in computer vision, some works have started to explore the use of the Transformer for super-resolution (SR). However, with regard to stereoscopic SR, which aims to recover details from input pairs, how to efficiently integrate cross-view interactions into the Transformer architecture is still an ongoing development. Additionally, most existing stereoscopic SR methods only adopt a parallax mechanism in the middle of the network, and another issue is that the feature correlation from different viewpoints inevitably weakens as the network depth increases. To address these issues, we first utilize an efficient residual transformer block (ERTB) as the backbone for long-range intra-view feature extraction. Subsequently, we propose a novel multi-Dconv cross attentive block (MCAB) to enhance the cross-view interactions at the rear part of the Transformer architecture. Notably, the proposed MCAB promotes feature fusion from two viewpoints by employing bidirectional cross-attention, as opposed to an unidirectional flow from left to right or vice versa. This approach results in an efficient cross-view interaction from both branches. By leveraging the advantages of the proposed ERTB and MCAB, we introduce an efficient cross-view interaction Transformer (CVIformer) for stereoscopic SR. This architecture is capable of incorporating long-range intra-view and cross-view information with an acceptable computational overhead. Without excessive complexity, extensive experiments conducted on four public datasets demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art results using only 1.17 million parameters, with approximately a 40% reduction in parameters compared to leading methods like iPASSR.},

However, existing approaches mainly focus on designing advanced network architectures that map feature differences to change maps, overlooking the impact of feature difference quality. In this paper, we approach CD from a different perspective by exploring how to optimize feature differences to effectively highlight changes and suppress background regions. To achieve this, we propose a novel module called the iterative difference-enhanced transformers (IDET). IDET consists of three transformers: two for extracting long-range information from the bi-temporal images, and one for enhancing the feature difference. Unlike previous transformers, the third transformer utilizes the outputs of the first two transformers to guide iterative and dynamic enhancement of the feature difference. To further enhance refinement, we introduce the multi-scale IDET-based change detection approach, which utilizes multi-scale representations of the images to refine the feature difference at multiple scales. Additionally, we propose a coarse-to-fine fusion strategy to combine all refinements. Our final CD method surpasses nine state-of-the-art methods on six large-scale datasets across different application scenarios. This highlights the significance of feature difference enhancement and demonstrates the effectiveness of IDET. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our IDET can be seamlessly integrated into other existing CD methods, resulting in a substantial improvement in detection accuracy.},

Firstly, an AFC that blends the fuzzy logic system and the input constraint is proposed, where a disturbance observer is constructed to estimate the compounded disturbance. To improve the fuzzy approximation performance, a fractional-order serial parallel estimation model that combines with a fuzzy logic system and a disturbance observer is exploited to generate prediction errors, and both tracking errors and prediction errors are utilized simultaneously to construct parameter update laws, so that a composite learning fuzzy controller (CLFC) is implemented. In addition, a compound disturbance observer is proposed based on the system state and the prediction error while the disturbance estimation error is ensured to remain inside a bounded closed set. The proposed CLFC can not only assure the stability of the closed-loop system but also achieve an accurate estimation of function uncertainties and unknown compounded disturbances.

The power of Transformers, along with many other innovative features, also lies in the integration of word embedding techniques, traditionally used to represent words in a text and to build classification systems directly. This study delves into the comparison of text representation techniques for classifying users who generate medical topic posts on Facebook discussion groups. Short and noisy social media texts in Italian pose challenges for user categorization. The study employs two datasets, one for word embedding model estimation and another comprising discussions from users. The main objective is to achieve optimal user categorization through different pre-processing and embedding techniques, aiming at high generalization performance despite class imbalance. The paper has a dual purpose, i.e., to build an effective classifier, ensuring accurate information dissemination in medical discussions and combating fake news, and to explore also the representational capabilities of various LLMs, especially concerning BERT, Mistral and GPT-4. The latter is investigated using the in-context learning approach. Finally, data visualization tools are used to evaluate the semantic embeddings with respect to the achieved performance. This investigation, focusing on classification performance, compares the classic BERT and several hybrid versions (i.e., employing different training strategies and approximate Support Vector Machines in the classification layer) against LLMs and several Bag-of-Words based embedding (notably, one of the earliest approaches in text classification). This research offers insights into the latest developments in language modeling, advancing in the field of text representation and its practical application for user classification within medical discussions.},

  abstract     = {A long-standing problem remains with the heterogeneous clients in Federated Learning (FL), who often have diverse gains and requirements for the trained model, while their contributions are hard to evaluate due to the privacy-preserving training. Existing works mainly rely on single-dimension metric to calculate clients' contributions as aggregation weights, which however may damage the social fairness, thus discouraging the cooperation willingness of worse-off clients and causing the revenue instability. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel incentive mechanism named FedLaw to effectively evaluate clients' contributions and further assign aggregation weights. Specifically, we reuse the local model updates and model the contribution evaluation process as a convex coalition game among multiple players with a non-empty core. By deriving a closed-form expression of the Shapley value, we solve the game core in quadratic time. Moreover, we theoretically prove that FedLaw guarantees individual fairness, coalition stability, computational efficiency, collective rationality, redundancy, symmetry, additivity, strict desirability, and individual monotonicity, and also show that FedLaw can achieve a constant convergence bound. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets validate the superiority of FedLaw in terms of model aggregation, fairness, and time overhead compared to the state-of-the-art five baselines. Experimental results show that FedLaw is able to reduce the computation time of contribution evaluation by about 12 times and improve the global model performance by about 2% while ensuring fairness.},

  abstract     = {This article proposes a feature self-selection and sequence integration network, namely FASSI-Net, for medical image classification, which can extract representative deep features and contextual semantic information. In this network, FASSI-Net uses a new feature selection and integration module (FSIM) to compress the depth features, which uses a sequence model to replace the Flatten layer. This strategy introduces two sets of multi-scale convolutions, where a cross-attention mechanism assigns two sets of weights (i.e., vertical and horizontal weights) to each convolution. We then calculate the Euclidean distance between different scale feature points to measure the correlation between them. Specifically, the feature points are divided into useful features and redundant features. In addition, a feature dimension compression (CRI) module is constructed to reconstruct the redundant feature structure, and the residual structure is used to extract the representative features from the redundant features. Meantime, a sequence model is introduced to compress the deep features and obtain the context relationship between feature points. Experimental results on three datasets show that the proposed method significantly outperforms previous methods.},

  abstract     = {Over the past decades, evolutionary multi-objective algorithms have proven their efficacy in feature selection. Nevertheless, a prevalent approach involves addressing feature selection tasks in isolation, even when these tasks share common knowledge and interdependencies. In response to this, the emerging field of evolutionary sequential transfer learning is gaining attention for feature selection. This novel approach aims to transfer and leverage knowledge gleaned by evolutionary algorithms in a source domain, applying it intelligently to enhance feature selection outcomes in a target domain. Despite its promising potential to exploit shared insights, the adoption of this transfer learning paradigm for feature selection remains surprisingly limited due to the computational expense of existing methods, which learn a mapping between the source and target search spaces. This paper introduces an advanced multi-objective feature selection approach grounded in evolutionary sequential transfer learning, strategically crafted to tackle interconnected feature selection tasks with overlapping features. Our novel framework integrates probabilistic models to capture high-order information within feature selection solutions, successfully tackling the challenges of extracting and preserving knowledge from the source domain without an expensive cost. It also provides a better way to transfer the source knowledge when the feature spaces of the source and target domains diverge. We evaluate our proposed method against four prominent single-task feature selection approaches and a cutting-edge evolutionary transfer learning feature selection method. Through empirical evaluation, our proposed approach showcases superior performance across the majority of datasets, surpassing the effectiveness of the compared methods.},

  abstract     = {In Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN), intelligent techniques are urged to achieve the automation of the computing resource allocation, so as to save computing resources and increase their utilization rate, as well as decrease the network delay. However, the existing formulation of this problem as an optimization problem defines the capacity utility of resource in an inappropriate way and it tends to cause much delay. Moreover, the only algorithm proposed to solve this problem is a greedy search algorithm, which is not ideal as it could get stuck into local optima. To overcome these issues, a new formulation that better describes the problem is proposed. In addition, an evolutionary algorithm (EA) is designed to find a resource allocation scheme to proactively and dynamically deploy the computing resource for processing upcoming traffic data. A multivariate long short-term memory model is used in the proposed EA to predict future traffic data for the production of deployment scheme. As a global search approach, the EA is less likely to get stuck in local optima than greed search, leading to better solutions. Experimental studies carried out on real-world datasets and artificially generated datasets with different scenarios and properties have demonstrated the significant superiority of our proposed EA over a baseline greedy algorithm under all parameter settings. Moreover, experimental studies with all afore-mentioned datasets are performed to compare the proposed EA and two variants under different parameter settings, to demonstrate the impact of different algorithm choices.},

  abstract     = {Split learning (SL) aims to protect user data privacy by distributing deep models between the client-server and keeping private data locally. Only processed or ‘smashed’ data can be transmitted from the clients to the server during the SL process. However, recently proposed model inversion attacks can recover original data from smashed data. To enhance privacy protection against such attacks, one strategy is to adopt differential privacy (DP), which involves safeguarding the smashed data at the expense of some accuracy loss. This paper presents the first investigation into the impact on accuracy when training multiple clients in SL with various privacy requirements. Subsequently, we propose an approach that reviews the DP noise distributions of other clients during client training to address the identified accuracy degradation. We also examine the application of DP to the local model of SL to gain insights into the trade-off between accuracy and privacy. Specifically, the findings reveal that introducing noise in the later local layers offers the most favorable balance between accuracy and privacy. Drawing from our insights in the shallower layers, we propose an approach to reduce the size of smashed data to minimize data leakage while maintaining higher accuracy, optimizing the accuracy-privacy trade-off. Additionally, smashed data of a smaller size reduces communication overhead on the client side, mitigating one of the notable drawbacks of SL. Intensive experiments on various datasets demonstrate that our proposed approaches provide an optimal trade-off for incorporating DP into SL, ultimately enhancing the training accuracy for multi-client SL with varying privacy requirements.},

Monitoring machines using fixed-length time windows faces challenges in accommodating the varying characteristics of anomaly events. The lengthy and imbalanced sequence data associated with anomaly events further complicates the resolution of these challenges. Additionally, the inherent trade-off between accurate prediction and timely alarm is a crucial concern, posing difficulties in decision-making. This study puts forward a novel framework for early anomaly prediction, named early time series Anomaly Prediction with Neighbor Over-sampling and Multi-objective Optimization (APNOMO), pronounced as ‘abnormal’. The framework employs three key techniques: 1) sliding windows that divide long input sequences into segments for prediction at proper intervals, 2) over-sampling and proposed neighbor over-sampling that handle imbalanced data in a novel way, and 3) multi-objective optimization that searches optimal thresholds to balance accurately prediction and timely alarm the abnormal. Experiments on a real-world dataset demonstrate APNOMO's superior performance over some state-of-the-art designs, with higher recall, F1 score, and more suitable earliness. It can predict anomalies 0.78–3.56 hours in advance, showcasing excellent early anomaly prediction capabilities for enabling predictive maintenance.},

This article designs a DDI prediction model DualC based on the layer attention mechanism of Graph Convolutional Network and 1 Dimensional-Convolutional Neural Network to extract topological and structural information of drugs. First, the DDI network is obtained from the drug relationship data in the database and the drug similarity network is calculated with the help of drug target features, then they are constructed into a heterogeneous network. Next, the layer attention mechanism and Graph Convolutional Network are used to learn the topological information. Subsequently, the structural information is acquired from the chemical substructure similarity matrix utilizing 1 Dimensional-Convolutional Neural Network. Finally, use the sigmoid function for DDI prediction. The experimental results show advantages of DualC which AUC reaches 0.965 and ACC reaches 0.973.

This study introduces a novel two-stream model to analyze both temporal and spatial representations of EEG for learning motor characteristics. Temporal representations are extracted with a set of convolutional neural networks (CNN) treated as dynamic filters, while spatial representations are learned by graph neural networks (GNN) using learnable adjacency matrices. At each stage, a res-block is designed to integrate temporal and spatial representations, facilitating a fusion of temporal-spatial information. Finally, the summarized representations of both streams are fused with fully connected neural networks to learn motor characteristics. Experimental evaluations on the Physionet, OpenBMI, and BCI Competition IV Dataset 2a demonstrate the model's efficacy, achieving accuracies of $73.6\%/70.4\%$ for four-class subject-dependent/independent paradigms, $84.2\%/82.0\%$ for two-class subject-dependent/independent paradigms, and 78.5% for a four-class subject-dependent paradigm, respectively.

However, effectively handling feature data extracted from deep models without succumbing to the challenges of feature dimensionality remains a formidable task. In response to this complex issue, we propose a novel two-stage deep feature selection (FS) method utilizing the voting differential evolution (VDE) algorithm. In this approach, a dimension adaptive search strategy is meticulously devised to ensure robust feature selection while concurrently reducing the dimension. To expedite the optimization process, we devise a CR adaptive adjustment method to enhance the efficiency of the algorithm. Notably, an important aspect of our approach is the introduction of a novel DE algorithm that integrates a voting mechanism. This synergistic fusion allows a comprehensive analysis of crucial feature relationships to mitigate the risk of algorithmic entrapment in local optima. Additionally, we propose a dynamic feature evaluation function to avert the oversight of feature sets with optimal classification accuracy during later stages of the algorithm, thereby preserving discriminative features. The method is verified on an open Chest X-Ray Images dataset, achieving 99.04% average precision, 98.67% average accuracy, 99.13% average recall, and 19.93% average feature dimension reduction ratio.

Existing typical GNNs exploit the neighborhood message passing scheme that subtly aggregates feature messages from neighbor nodes to update the node representations. Despite the effectiveness of this scheme, its complex computational model heavily relies on the graph structure, which hinders their scaling to realistic large-scale graph applications. Although several custom accelerators have been proposed to speed up GNNs, these hardware-specific optimization techniques fail to address the fundamental problem of high computational complexity in GNNs. To tackle this challenge, we propose a dedicated algorithm-architecture co-design framework, dubbed MePa, which aims to improve GNN execution efficiency by coordinating algorithm- and hardware-level innovations. Specifically, with an in-depth analysis of GNN message-passing algorithms and potential speedup opportunities, we first propose an efficient message-passing algorithm that can dynamically prune task-irrelevant graph data at multiple granularity, including channel/edge/node-wise. This approach significantly reduces the overall complexity of GNN with negligible accuracy loss. A novel architecture is designed to support dynamic pruning and translate it into performance improvements. Elaborate pipelines and specialized optimizations jointly improve performance and decrease energy consumption.

However, most existing studies focus on global structural balance, and little work has considered local structural balance. In this study, an optimization model is proposed based on the weak definition of structural balance theory. The model incorporates both the global imbalance and maximum cluster imbalance as the criterion of structural balance in a signed network. Furthermore, a priority strategy based memetic algorithm, called PSMA, is presented to calculate the structural balance based on this model. In PSMA, a network-specific genetic operation is applied to explore the solution space. A multi-level greedy method is deployed to exploit the optimal solution as the local search. The priority strategy, which aims to recognize the severe unbalanced vertices or clusters as prior objectives and execute search operations on them, is inserted into each level of the local search to make it more efficient. Extensive experiments are conducted on 11 real-world network datasets. The results demonstrate that the proposed model can avoid clusters with over-concentration of unbalanced relationships at the expense of a slight increase in global imbalance and confirm that the proposed PSMA can achieve better global and cluster structural balance compared with the state-of-the-art algorithms.},

However, such kind of data pre-processing is vulnerable to be exploited to launch an attack called image-scaling attack, which can generate attack images presenting entirely different appearances after scaling. In this paper, we develop the attack model based on generative adversarial network (GAN) to fuse the source and target images, called Attack-GAN, which guarantees the generated attack images are imperceptible as well as being scaled to the target images. Experiments show that the superiority of Attack-GAN over the optimization method is that it can generate attack images with better camouflage and achieve higher attack success rates as well as accelerate the generation of attack images. Furthermore, we propose the Defense-GAN to learn and approximate the distribution of unperturbed images from attack images, which aims to eliminate and compensate the adversarial pixels. Based on different capabilities, customized defense strategies for different defenders are developed to resist the image-scaling attack. Experimental results manifest the proposed defense strategies are effective against the image-scaling attack, i.e., the generator of Defense-GAN can recover the attack images and retain the original ‘semantics’.},

  abstract     = {The primary objective of model compression is to maintain the performance of the original model while reducing its size as much as possible. Knowledge distillation has become the mainstream method in the field of model compression due to its excellent performance. However, current knowledge distillation methods for medium and small pre-trained models struggle to effectively extract knowledge from large pre-trained models. Similarly, methods targeting large pre-trained models face challenges in compressing the model to a smaller scale. Therefore, this paper proposes a new model compression method called Attention-based Replacement Compression (ARC), which introduces layer random replacement based on fine-grained self-attention distillation. This method first obtains the important features of the original model through fine-grained self-attention distillation in the pre-training distillation stage. More information can be obtained by extracting the upper layers of the large teacher model. Then, the one-to-one Transformer-layer random replacement training fully explores the hidden knowledge of the large pre-trained model in the fine-tuning compression stage. Compared with other complex compression methods, ARC not only simplifies the training process of model compression but also enhances the applicability of the compressed model. This paper compares knowledge distillation methods for pre-trained models of different sizes on the GLUE benchmark. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves significant improvements across different parameter scales, especially in terms of accuracy and inference speed.},

  abstract     = {In nonlinear control, barrier Lyapunov function is frequently utilized to handle state constraints; however, a feasibility condition for virtual signals often needs to be verified. In addition, when dealing with asymmetric state constraints, complex calculation is commonly involved. This article develops an adaptive neural network optimal backstepping control scheme for strict feedback nonlinear systems with input delay and asymmetric time–varying state constraints. To remove feasibility conditions, an asymmetric nonlinear state dependent function is introduced, and then the original system is transformed into an unconstrained one. Therefore, a direct method that does not require the usage of tracking error as an intermediate variable is provided to deal with state constraints. Simultaneously, a coordinate transformation with integral is proposed to tackle input delay. In the face of increasingly scarce resources, an optimal control strategy based on reinforcement learning is devised to optimize the interaction cost between agents or actors and the environment. According to the stability analysis, the developed scheme ensures that all signals in the closed–loop system remain bounded and all states do not exceed the constraint space. Ultimately, the effectiveness of the proposed strategy is verified through a simulation example.},

However, due to the nature of these structures, they lack the necessary degree of freedom to achieve optimal layouts. To address this issue, we present a new layout solution for adaptive patches. By allowing local patches to move freely and scale within the scene, we design a differentiable framework that iteratively computes the neural representation and updates the layout of the local patches. Taking into account the coverage, overlap, and balance of the workload, the patches work collaboratively to cover the scene. Our method also supports overlapping patches, which alleviates discontinuous artifacts in the reconstructed image across patch boundaries. Experimental results show that our approach produces high-quality reconstructed images using fewer local patches compared to existing works, demonstrating its effectiveness and efficiency.},

In this paper, we propose a unified prompt-tuning framework that converts cross-domain classification into few-shot learning, effectively integrating diverse cross-domain classification tasks into an iterative few-shot learning paradigm. The framework unifies all predicted pseudo labels, templates, and iterated models into a cohesive prompt-tuning model, exhibiting robust scalability for integrating other tuning modalities and offering high availability to minimize the necessity for extensive fine-tuning. Through extensive experiments on several well-known benchmark datasets, we validate the superior performance of our framework compared to other domain adaptation and fine-tuning PLMs methods, which achieves up to an impressive 99% predicting accuracy of true labels within the target domain.},

In this paper, we focus on simultaneously exploiting the multi-view consistency and diversity information in a tensorized multi-view subspace framework. In the diversity part, an additional position-aware exclusivity term is introduced to explore the unique features of each view to enhance feature complementarity between different views. Meanwhile, we explore inter-view similarity by minimizing the tensor Schatten p-norm, which well captures both consistency and high-order correlation information of multi-view data. Then, the objective function can be efficiently optimized by the alternating direction method of multipliers.

In addition, OSEG can dynamically guide individuals to exits in the shortest time though balancing the evacuation load among exits as individual densities are non-uniform in indoor spaces. According to our review of relevant research, this is the first framework that integrates deep learning for individual density prediction with load-balancing evacuation for emergency guiding in open indoor spaces, where the distance to each exit, capacities of all exits, concurrent moving of evacuees, and distribution of indoor individuals/groups are considered simultaneously. Simulation results show that our approach outperforms existing methods and can balance the evacuation load of each exit for individuals/groups to minimize total evacuation time, which can reduce 50% of total evacuation time at most compared with existing methods.},

Video scene understanding can promote the efficiency and quality of network regulation, in which video instance segmentation is a fundamental task for scene understanding. Due to the presence of small, dense instances and fast-changing scenes in livestreaming scenarios, we propose a Gaussian prior tri-cascaded Transformer Gp3Former for video instance segmentation. First, the Mask2Former-VIS encoder is used to enhance the representation of video features at different scales for small instance segmentation. Then, a tri-cascaded Transformer decoder is designed to adapt to the fast-changing scenes in livestreaming, which can extract global, balanced, and local instance features while sacrificing as little scene information as possible. Finally, to cope with the dense instances in livestreaming, a Gaussian prior is imposed during instance association and segmentation to learn the Gaussian distribution of a series of cross-frame instances. The experimental results show that with an inference efficiency of 19.6 FPS, the proposed method reaches 50.6%AP, 50.0%AR on YouTube-VIS 2019, and 82.9%AP, 82.3%AR on self-built BJUT-LSD, respectively, which is effective and superior for video instance segmentation of livestreaming scenarios.},

Previous methodologies have primarily focused on fine-tuning and post-editing techniques to ensure the fluency of generated contents, while overlooking the critical aspects of individualization and relevance concerning the specific hatred targets, such as LGBT groups, immigrants, etc. This research paper introduces a novel framework based on contrastive optimal transport, which effectively addresses the challenges of maintaining target interaction and promoting diversification in generating counter-narratives. Firstly, an Optimal Transport Kernel (OTK) module is leveraged to incorporate hatred target information in the token representations, in which the comparison pairs are extracted between original and transported features. Secondly, a self-contrastive learning module is employed to address the issue of model degeneration. This module achieves this by generating an anisotropic distribution of token representations. Finally, a target-oriented search method is integrated as an improved decoding strategy to explicitly promote domain relevance and diversification in the inference process. This strategy modifies the model's confidence score by considering both token similarity and target relevance. Quantitative and qualitative experiments have been evaluated on two benchmark datasets, which demonstrate that our proposed model significantly outperforms current methods evaluated by metrics from multiple aspects.},

  abstract     = {Person Re-Identification (PRid) has garnered research attention with the rising popularity of intelligent video surveillance. Deep learning methods like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) are vital in PRid. The CNNs acquire image characteristics that are distinctive, referred to as image features, by analyzing the entire image. This process enables them to recognize and differentiate between various images. However, in the case of PRid, this search across the entire image may lead the model to emphasize distinctive image features of the background while neglecting subtle but essential distinguishing regions of the person. This tendency can be observed in the heat maps generated from trained models. Therefore, it is crucial to direct the model's attention towards the vital regions of a person. Relying solely on global features might be limited in effectiveness, as it does not sufficiently capture essential finer details. Therefore, it becomes necessary to pinpoint significant features at a local level and guide the model to prioritize these features for improved results. Inspired to identify and prioritize vital regions based on local features, we propose TROPE (Triplet-Guided Feature Refinement for Person Re-Identification) in this paper. The technique involves analyzing the intermediate features of hard positive and hard negative images and generating weight vectors. These vectors are utilized to shift the attention of the network to specific regions of interest.

  abstract     = {Clickbait refers to deliberately enticing users into clicking through sensational text, and the corresponding content is usually totally unrelated. Recently, clickbait plays a semantic deceptive role on online web applications like news portals and social media, which will inevitably lead to user dissatisfaction and agitation. The recent clickbait detection approaches typically require large-scaled labeled data or auxiliary information like news content, however, humans can distinguish whether they are clickbaits without seeing the labeled content but only based on the titles. In this paper, we present a Clickbait Detection method that makes use of Prompt-tuning which can only leverage the few-shot labeled titles to train the detection model. Specifically, we feed the titles into the prompt template to predict the masked label, and we conducted five strategies to expand label words space for final detection. Despite being few-shot labeled titles, experimental results show that our method can obtain an obvious improvement compared to other clickbait detection methods based on deep neural networks and pre-trained language models, outperforming the state-of-the-art and up to 95% in all four metrics on three well-known benchmarks.},

  abstract     = {Classifying partially labeled high-dimensional data remains a difficult problem for semi-supervised support vector machine (SVM) since the convergence and the stability can hardly be guaranteed. Existing studies try to use dimensionality reduction techniques to relieve this problem. But the extracted features may not be suitable for the downstream classifier, leading to a sub-optimal classification performance. To address these problems, this paper proposes a novel semi-supervised framework named subspace sequentially Iterative SVM (ISVM) to integrate semi-supervised learning, high-dimensional data processing, and classifier learning into a unified framework. That is, ISVM expects to learn an optimal subspace by trading off multiple factors, including joint sparsity, regression learning, Laplacian graph regularization, and semi-supervised support vector learning, to provide a large margin for semi-supervised SVM classifier. The proposed framework not only owns the merits of subspace learning to solve dimensional disaster problem and large-scale data problem, but also has an effective mechanism to optimize different tasks perfectly. Theoretical analysis shows that the optimal solution to the original problem can be given by solving its dual problem, and the convergence of the optimization process can be guaranteed by the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker(KKT) conditions. Extensive experiments have been performed on some well-known datasets to validate the superiority of the proposed ISVM compared with the state-of-the-art algorithms.},

However, limited by time and manpower, there are huge numbers of unlabeled samples in reality. These unlabeled samples not only provide valuable additional information at a relatively low cost but also contribute to improving the generalization ability of predictors. Pairwise comparison classification ignores unlabeled data points, resulting in a wastage of valuable data resources. To overcome this problem, this paper for the first time focuses on the case where the training set contains only pairwise confidence comparisons samples (PC) (one is more likely to be positive than the other) and unlabeled data points (U) (no label information), which is a new form of weakly-supervised learning method. We derive an unbiased risk estimator with theoretical guarantees and then present a risk correction to address possible overfitting. We also theoretically establish the estimation error bound and prove that the estimation error achieves the optimal parameter rate.

Therefore, an analog circuit of memristive fuzzy logic for blood pressure grading quantification is designed in this paper. The circuit includes 1) fuzzifier module, 2) rule base module, 3) inference engine module. The fuzzifier module uses a memristor array to build a membership function circuit that can be fully programmed in parallel, and converts the input systolic and diastolic blood pressure signals into corresponding membership degrees through the circuit. The rule base module mainly implements fuzzy rules based on blood pressure fuzzy semantic sets through analog circuits. The function of the inference engine module is to transform the blood pressure rules stored in the rule base into the mapping relationship between fuzzy semantic sets, and to infer the results of blood pressure grading quantification. The PSPICE simulation results show that the calculation precision of the memristive fuzzy logic circuit can reach about 99.7%, and the accuracy rate of the circuit to achieve the blood pressure grading quantification reaches 98.69%. Compared to traditional digital circuits, this circuit has significant advantages in terms of power consumption and computational speed.},

To address this issue, low-light LF enhancement has been introduced.

In this paper, we propose a novel approach, named PFInet, for efficient low-light LF enhancement. Specifically, we propose to first incorporate global and local dependencies at multiple scales and then aggregate these representations for a richer spatial context understanding. Moreover, we develop a progressive feature interaction (PFI) strategy, which sequentially performs interaction on multiple subspace-specific features to exploit the inter-view correlations of LF images. Extensive experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method, surpassing the second-best method by 0.38 dB on average in terms of PSNR. Furthermore, our method achieves efficient low-light LF enhancement, as evidenced by a good tradeoff between the inference time and reconstruction performance.},

  abstract     = {The challenge in fine-grained visual categorization (FGVC) lies in how to explore the subtle differences between different subclasses and achieve accurate discrimination. Previous research has relied on large-scale annotated data and pre-trained deep models to achieve the objective. However, when only a limited amount of samples is available, similar methods often struggle to accurately learn the details of instances and perform effective recognition. Using diffusion models for data augmentation has gained widespread attention, but the high level of detail required for fine-grained images makes it challenging for existing methods to be directly employed. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach termed the detail reinforcement diffusion model (DRDM), which leverages the extensive knowledge of large models for fine-grained data augmentation and comprises two key components including discriminative semantic recombination (DSR) and spatial knowledge reference (SKR). Specifically, DSR is designed to extract implicit similarity relationships from the labels and reconstruct the semantic mapping between labels and instances, which enables better discrimination of subtle differences between different subclasses. Furthermore, we introduce the SKR module, which incorporates the distributions of different datasets as references in the feature space. This allows the SKR to aggregate the high-dimensional distribution of subclass features in few-shot FGVC tasks, thus expanding the decision boundary. Through these two critical components, we effectively utilize the knowledge from large models to address the issue of data scarcity, resulting in improved performance for fine-grained visual recognition tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate the consistent performance gain offered by our DRDM.},

  abstract     = {Sparse linear discriminant analysis (LDA) is a popular machine learning method that improves the accuracy of data classification by introducing sparsity. However, its performance often degrades seriously when encountering noise. To address this issue, this paper proposes a new method called efficient and robust sparse linear discriminant analysis (ERSLDA). The core idea is to characterize the local pixel corruptions by integrating $L_{p}$-norm $(0&lt; p&lt; 1)$, and to describe the global structured sparsity by enforcing $L_{2,p}$-norm $(0&lt; p&lt; 1)$, thereby improving the ability of feature selection. Compared with existing $L_{1}$-norm and $L_{2,1}$-norm, the involved $L_{p}$-norm and $L_{2,p}$-norm can bring higher robustness and better accuracy. Moreover, an additional matrix with Frobenius norm is embedded to represent Gaussian noise, which further enhances the robustness in different scenarios. In algorithms, an iterative optimization scheme is developed based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) to solve the proposed ERSLDA, and the resulting subproblems can be calculated efficiently. Extensive numerical comparisons are performed with nine state-of-the-art LDA-based methods on seven benchmark image datasets. The experimental results validate that the proposed method is efficient for data classification and robust to noise.},

Thus, in this paper, we propose a greedy-version automatic paper-reviewer recommendation algorithm regarding both aspects of depth and breadth, named as GMCTS. More specifically, from the depth aspect, we focus on the maximum weight matching between paper and reviewer for each recommendation. While from the breadth aspect, we consider the broadest of distinctive topics (expertise) covered by the recommended reviewers. Furthermore, to avoid the unfairness of recommendation, we consider three types of constraints both theoretically and experimentally, including paper demand constraint, reviewer workload constraint and multiple types of Conflict Of Interests (COIs). Finally, extensive experiments conducted on benchmark datasets demonstrate that GMCTS achieves an impressive performance. Specifically, GMCTS scores a 90.5% and 12.67% gain in topic coverage and recall respectively compared to some advanced recommendation methods.},

First, to overcome the defect that the traditional granular ball model cannot be applied to partial multilabel classification and its splitting rules are anomalous and stochastic, an objective function is designed by the fuzzy membership degree, the splitting rules and termination conditions are redesigned, and a new fuzzy granular ball clustering method using fuzzy k-means can be developed to preprocess partial multilabel data. Second, to reduce the impact of noise labels, the instance set of each granular ball is generated according to fuzzy granular ball clustering instead of neighborhood class, and the fuzzy similarity relationship between instances is constructed. Subsequently, granular ball-based fuzzy entropy measures and fuzzy mutual information and their properties are proposed in granular ball-based partial multilabel systems. Finally, the dependence and relevance between features and label sets are studied, the significance of features based on fuzzy mutual information is presented, and then a heuristic partial multilabel feature selection method is constructed to enhance the effect of partial multilabel data classification. Experiments on 18 partial multilabel datasets illustrate the availability of our method compared to other multilabel classification algorithms in its classification effect.},

These data, which may come from speech and handwriting, often contain complex relationships between the underlying variational factors such as speaker characteristic and the observed data. The standard RNN model has very limited randomness or variability in its structure, which comes from the output conditional probability model. To improve the variability and performance, we study the new latent variable models with novel regularization methods. This paper will present different ways of using high level latent random variables in RNN to model the variability in the sequential data. We will explore possible ways of using adversarial methods to train a variational RNN model. Through theoretical analysis we show that, contrary to competing approaches our schemes are theoretical optimum in the model training and the symmetric objective function in the adversarial training provides better model training stability. Our approach also improves the posterior approximation in the variational inference network by a separated adversarial training step. Numerical results simulated from TIMIT speech data show that reconstruction loss and evidence lower bound converge to the same level and adversarial training loss converges in a stable course. The results also show our approach of regularization provides stability and smoothness on probability distribution distance minimization between prior and posterior of the latent variables.},

Recently, tracking performance has improved significantly. However, there is still a lot of progress space to achieve consummate tracking performance because of the complex and varied target and its surrounding background. How to trade-off between accuracy, robustness, and approximately real-time performance is crucial for visual object tracking. We find that when attention mechanisms are integrated into the pyramidal residual network, they can subtly describe the appearance of the target object, which provides a strong guarantee for accurate, robust, and high-performance visual object tracking. Based on this find, we propose a simple yet powerful visual object tracking algorithm, APR-Net, that automatically searches various scales and significant regions. The comprehensive experimental results on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed APR-Net tracker attains the desired performance improvement in accuracy and robustness while achieving near real-time tracking performance in various real-world applications.},

  abstract     = {Finger-vein biometrics has attracted significant attention in recent years, posing a challenge in extracting robust finger-vein patterns from raw images with limited prior knowledge. While deep learning-based models, particularly convolutional neural network (CNN)-based methods, exhibit substantial capacity for feature representation, they still suffer from certain drawbacks. First, CNN-based models focus on learning internal feature representations by minimizing the loss function of the reconstruction error. However, this strategy may lack optimal exploration of the parameter space, resulting in limited performance. Second, existing deep learning-based feature extraction approaches encode vein textures based on an output threshold of 0.5, potentially causing the omission of discriminant vein patterns. To address these drawbacks, we propose DRL-FEE, a Deep Reinforcement Learning-based Feature Extraction and Encoding for finger-vein verification in this paper. DRL-FEE comprises a DRL-based feature extraction approach for vein texture extraction and a DRL-based supervised encoding approach for vein feature encoding. Specifically, we design a CNN model incorporated into an RL framework to establish a DRL-based segmentation model vein feature extraction, utilizing the CNN to generate a policy for feature extraction. To further enhance performance, we develop a DRL-based supervised encoding approach with a transformer-based controller to search for an optimal threshold for vein feature encoding. The experimental results on three public finger-vein databases demonstrate that the proposed DRL-FEE outperforms state-of-the-art solutions, achieving the lowest verification errors with EERs of 3.13%, 2.86%, and 1.66%, respectively.},

  abstract     = {Rotated object detection has emerged as a preferred alternative to the conventional Horizontal Box (HBox) object detection in various tasks. However, the majority of existing detection datasets are still annotated using HBox. Re-annotating these datasets for rotated object detection is notably inefficient and labor-intensive. Recently, weakly-supervised detectors based directly on HBox have provided a solution to bridge the gap between the rotated bounding box (RBox) prediction and the weak annotations. Nonetheless, they tend to overlook the potential impact of factors such as bounding box position, aspect ratio, and scale on angle prediction. Additionally, inconsistencies arise when evaluating rotation variations, hindering the inference performance. In light of these limitations, we propose an explicit and implicit equivariance detector (EIE-Det) to predict fine-grained RBox based on HBox annotations. Along with a shared backbone and neck structure, our proposed EIE-Det comprises a weakly supervised (WS) branch for predicting coarse RBox from HBox labels, an explicit equivariance (EE) branch for learning rotation consistency, and an implicit equivariance (IE) branch for learning position, aspect ratio, and scale consistency. Furthermore, we introduce the Tanimoto Coefficient for vector-based bounding box regression, enabling a comprehensive assessment of model prediction bias, thereby eliminating interference from variations in box aspect ratio and scale. Experiments demonstrate that our method not only significantly surpasses state-of-the-art models supervised with HBox but also achieves accuracy comparable to fully-supervised detectors (75.74$\%$ and 58.50$\%$ $AP_{50}$ on DOTA and DIOR-R, respectively).},

While deep learning-based fusion methods offer the advantage of end-to-end fusion, their design complexities are compounded by the absence of ground truth. To address this challenge, we developed an annotated dataset for use in this study. Initially, we formulated and generated an annotated dataset specific to this field, building upon existing datasets. Subsequently, recognizing the image fusion process as a graph-to-graph translation, we designed a novel fusion model termed CycleFusion. Subsequent application of this method involved its training and testing on the annotated dataset. Through both qualitative and quantitative evaluations, our curated dataset demonstrated favorable visual enhancements and texture delineations. Comparative analysis revealed that CycleFusion outperformed 24 other state-of-the-art fusion models. Specifically, CycleFusion exhibited superior performance across metrics such as gradient-based fusion performance (Qab/f), cross entropy (CE), and Chen-Varshney metric (QCV), while ranking second in edge detection evaluation (ED). These results indicate that the proposed method yields fused outputs characterized by rich informational content, enhanced clarity, pronounced contrast, and ease of visual interpretation. Moreover, in terms of model parameters and runtime efficiency, it showcased commendable performance relative to alternative methodologies.},

Current NAS research typically focuses on concurrently searching for architecture and given operational hyperparameters (e.g. kernel size, stride, and padding). The architecture and its operational hyperparameters obtained through this method may not necessarily be the most optimal match, ignoring the exploration of operational hyperparameters space. To address this challenge, we propose an EC-based NAS method, namely EA-FCNet, to strike a balance between global search and local search. Specifically, we design a hierarchical encoding strategy distinguishing architecture and operational hyperparameters so that the algorithm can search both in a nested manner. Meanwhile, unlike existing methods based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs), our search space combines convolutional and fully connected operations to extract comprehensive features and enhance feature association. Furthermore, we address the challenge of combining these two operations that have mismatched input and output shapes by introducing a repairment strategy that allows the algorithm to handle such situations seamlessly. To evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm, we conducted extensive comparison and ablation experiments on two publicly available datasets: DRIVE and CHASE_DB1, which demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, with the obtained architecture achieving competitive results.

Considering the inefficiency of traditional random walk methods, we incorporate an active learning mechanism to equip with the backtracking framework to effectively distinguish between the fake and real network traffic with a limited number of learning samples. In this paper, we present an Active Learning-based Backtracking Attack (ALBA) which leverages muti-layer sampling technique to discover SLP.

  abstract     = {Incomplete Multi-View Clustering (IMVC) offers a way to analyze incomplete data, facilitating the inference of unobserved and missing data points through completion techniques. However, existing IMVC methods, predominantly depending on either data completion or similarity matrix completion, failed to uncover the inherent geometric structure and potential complementary information between intra- and inter-views, causing incomplete similarity matrices to further tear apart the connections between views. To address this problem, we propose Dual Completion Learning for Incomplete Multi-view Clustering (DCIMC), which elaborately designs data completion and similarity tensor completion, and fuses both of them into a unified model to effectively recover the missing samples and similarities. Concretely, in data completion, DCIMC utilizes subspace clustering to recover the missing and unknown instances directly. Meanwhile, in similarity tensor completion, DCIMC introduces the idea of tensor completion to make better use of the high-order complementary information from multi-view data. By fusing the dual completions, missing information and complementary information in each completion are fully explored by each other, reciprocally enhancing one another to boost the accuracy of our clustering algorithm. Experimental results on various datasets show the effectiveness of the proposed DCIMC. Moreover, our DCIMC also achieved superior or comparable performance in an extended comparison with recent deep learning-based multi-view clustering algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Global wildfire models play a crucial role in anticipating and responding to changing wildfire regimes. JULES-INFERNO is a global vegetation and fire model simulating wildfire emissions and area burnt on a global scale. However, because of the high data dimensionality and system complexity, JULES-INFERNO's computational costs make it challenging to apply to fire risk forecasting with unseen initial conditions. Typically, running JULES-INFERNO for 30 years of prediction will take several hours on High Performance Computing (HPC) clusters. To tackle this bottleneck, two data-driven models are built in this work based on Deep Learning techniques to surrogate the JULES-INFERNO model and speed up global wildfire forecasting. More precisely, these machine learning models take global temperature, vegetation density, soil moisture and previous forecasts as inputs to predict the subsequent global area burnt on an iterative basis. Average Error per Pixel (AEP) and Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) are used as metrics to evaluate the performance of the proposed surrogate models. A fine tuning strategy is also proposed in this work to improve the algorithm performance for unseen scenarios. Numerical results show a strong performance of the proposed models, in terms of both computational efficiency (less than 20 seconds for 30 years of prediction on a laptop CPU) and prediction accuracy (with AEP under 0.3% and SSIM over 98% compared to the outputs of JULES-INFERNO).},

  abstract     = {Advanced language models demonstrate remarkable capabilities but remain vulnerable to adversarial word camouflage techniques. These techniques introduce visually perceptible language manipulations while conveying intended meanings to the target audience, potentially altering a model's output. This study explores the effectiveness and limitations of word camouflage in deceiving various language model architectures, including encoder-decoder, encoder-only, and decoder-only models, with a significant focus on the tokenizers employed. Despite their vocabulary diversity, all tokenizers exhibited notable weaknesses against camouflaged words, particularly keyword attacks, highlighting the urgent need for adaptable tokenizers to handle sophisticated adversarial strategies. Consistent with our findings, transformer models without specific training against word camouflage become increasingly compromised as the complexity and volume of camouflaged inputs grow. To address these vulnerabilities, we evaluated external countermeasures such as MASK and BLANK filters, demonstrating that semantic content persists in camouflaged text and can be exploited by models. We employed static and dynamic adversarial training methods, with static training introducing camouflaged data once, while dynamic training continuously updates the data during training. Our results showed that dynamic training effectively counters adversarial attacks and enhances overall model performance, suggesting its dual role as a defensive mechanism and a data augmentation technique. The methodology incorporates the AugLy library for external validation, demonstrating the superior efficacy of dynamic training over static methods. Key contributions include enhancing the open-source tool pyleetspeak to facilitate the creation of augmented camouflaged datasets, providing researchers and practitioners with effective tools to strengthen NLP systems against evolving threats in digital communication.},

To address these issues, this paper presents a Tensorlized Multi-Kernel Clustering (TensorMKC) method. The proposed TensorMKC stacks kernel matrices into a kernel tensor along the kernel space. To attain consensus extraction while mitigating the impact of noise, we incorporate the tensor low-rank constraint into the process of learning base kernels. Subsequently, a tensor-based weighted fusion strategy is employed to integrate the refined base kernels, yielding an optimized fused kernel for clustering. The process of kernel learning is formulated as a joint minimization problem to seek the promising fusion solution.

  abstract     = {Real-world multi-view data may manifest as point-clouds, but their meaningful structure often resides on a lower dimensional manifold embedded in the higher dimensional space. Consequently, existing graph based multi-view algorithms focus primarily on extraction of the low-rank subspaces for clustering. However, simultaneous optimization of the individual graph structures, their contributions/weights along with the clustering subspaces is likely to give a more comprehensive idea of the clusters present in the data set. In this regard, the paper proposes a Riemannian manifold optimization algorithm that harnesses the geometry and structure preserving properties of symmetric positive definite (SPD) manifold and Grassmann manifold for efficient multi-view clustering. The SPD manifold is used to optimize the graph Laplacians corresponding to the individual views, while preserving their symmetricity, positive definiteness, and related properties. The Grassmann manifold, on the other hand, is used to minimize the disagreement between the joint and individual clustering subspaces. Optimization over the Grassmann manifold additionally enforces the clustering solutions to be basis invariant such that all cluster indicator matrices whose columns span the same subspace map to the same clustering solution. A gradient based line-search algorithm, which alternates between two different manifolds, is proposed to optimize the multi-view graph Laplacians and its associated subspaces. The matrix perturbation theory is used to theoretically bound the disagreement between the clustering subspaces. Extensive experiments on several multi-view benchmark and multi-omics cancer data sets establish the effectiveness of the proposed method. The proposed work demonstrates how incorporation of Riemannanian optimization into the graph learning framework can boost multi-view clustering performance.},

  abstract     = {Electroencephalography (EEG) signals and eye movement signals, which represent internal physiological responses and external subconscious behaviors, respectively, have been shown to be reliable indicators for recognizing emotions. However, integrating these two modalities across multiple subjects presents several challenges: 1) designing a robust consistency metric that balances the consistency and divergences between heterogeneous modalities across multiple subjects; 2) simultaneously considering intra-modality and inter-modality information across multiple subjects; and 3) overcoming individual differences among multiple subjects and generating subject-invariant representations of the multimodal fused features. To address these challenges associated with multisource data (i.e., multiple modalities and subjects), we propose a novel comprehensive multisource learning network (CMSLNet) for cross-subject multimodal emotion recognition. Specifically, an instance-level adaptive robust consistency metric is first designed to better align the information between EEG signals and eye movement signals, identifying their consistency and divergences across various emotions. Subsequently, an attentive low-rank multimodal fusion (Att-LMF) method is developed to account for individual differences and dynamically learn intra-modality and inter-modality information, resulting in highly discriminative fused features. Finally, domain generalization is utilized to extract subject-invariant representations of the fused features, thus adapting to new subjects and enhancing the model's generalization. Through these elaborate designs, CMSLNet effectively incorporates the information from multisource data, thus significantly improving the accuracy and reliability of emotion recognition. Extensive experiments on two public datasets demonstrate the superior performance of CMSLNet. CMSLNet achieves high accuracies of 83.15% on the SEED-IV dataset and 87.32% on the SEED-V dataset, surpassing the state-of-the-art methods by 3.62% and 4.60%, respectively.},

  abstract     = {Recently, with the enhancement of drone's payload and endurance capability, drone logistics has received extensive attention from giant logistics enterprises. This research delves into the Heterogeneous multi-Drone Delivery Pickup Problem (HDDPP) through a novel distribution mode. Here, a large drone ferries multiple smaller drones to a specified sub-region. These smaller drones oversee parcel delivery and pickup tasks before returning to automated airports for recycling. Then we formulate it into an open two-echelon multi-objective routing optimization problem, addressing pickup and delivery problems. To enhance optimization efficiency, relying on conventional optimization algorithms initiates the optimization process from an initial state, neglecting pertinent empirical knowledge embedded in optimized instances. This oversight results in a considerable squandering of computational resources. Based on the above motivation, we propose a Transfer Optimization with Heuristic Operators (TOHO) method. TOHO adopts insights from previously optimized task models, ensuring quick convergence for new tasks. We also present a mapping method rooted in topological alignment, enabling effective alignment between source and target instances, which fosters faster optimization convergence. Furthermore, we design a voting-mechanism-based ensemble genetic optimization strategy employing heuristic operators to select the Pareto frontier with high-quality diversity and convergence. Extensive experimental results on extended benchmark instances validate the efficacy of TOHO, and underscore its capability to speed up the optimization while ensuring superior knowledge transfer compared to baselines.},

In such problems, evaluating the true fitness function requires significant computational resources, which necessitates effective determination of which individuals should be selected for evaluation. However, existing model management strategies often struggle to effectively balance exploration and exploitation when selecting individuals. To mitigate this issue, a bi-level model management strategy is proposed. The selection procedure not only considers exploring the objective space by balancing predicted values and uncertainty in the lower-level but also considers convergence and diversity in the upper-level selection. Specifically, we first divide the objective space into some sub-spaces through a set of direction vectors. Then, we select the first rank individuals via adopting the non-dominated sorting to balance the predicted objective values and the uncertainty in each subspace. The intersection individuals of the selected candidates can be denoted as the lower-level solutions. In the upper-level selection, we combine the modified inverted generational distance (IGD$^+$) and shift-based density estimation (SDE) indicators to select the most promising individuals from the lower-level to update the model. Experimental results on benchmark instances show that the proposed algorithm is competitive compared with some representative algorithms.},

These features provide valuable insights into individuals' health status, behavioral patterns, and quality of life. Nevertheless, the lack of readily identifiable labeling information in this data poses a significant challenge for learning, particularly with label-limited time series data. Traditional annotation methods are prohibitively costly and time-consuming, making them impractical for large-scale applications. To tackle this challenge, this paper presents a novel approach called semi-supervised contrastive learning for time Series classification in healthcare (SSC-TC). This approach leverages existing positive-negative pairs and introduces new selection rules and loss functions to enhance the learning process. By generating pseudo-labels on the initially label-restricted dataset, the proposed model extracts more meaningful label information and learns richer representations. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the SSC-TC over other baseline methods, both on balanced and imbalanced datasets. The effectiveness of the approach is further validated through ablation experiments, where different components of the model are evaluated and their contributions to the overall performance are assessed. Overall, this research highlights the potential of semi-supervised contrastive learning in overcoming the limitations of label-restricted time series data in the field of healthcare. It offers a promising solution for leveraging the vast amount of wearable device data and extracting valuable insights for personalized caregiving without the need for extensive manual annotation.},

To solve this problem, this paper proposes a clustering-based short-term wind speed interval prediction with multi-objective ensemble learning, which can provide an accurate and reliable wind speed interval prediction to support energy dispatch planning. First, a clustering-based uncertainties estimation method segments the initial wind sequence into several groups and determines the estimated width for each group. Second, a variational mode decomposition is employed to acquire the sub-sequence matrix of wind speed, and then a Hurst exponent-based model selection method is used to choose and train an optimal model for each sub-sequence based on its long-term correlation. Finally, an improved multi-objective optimizer is utilized to determine the optimal superposition weights of the prediction results for each model. The proposed approach is evaluated using eight cases from two wind farms, which are published by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. Experimental results indicate that the proposed approach outperforms several state-of-the-art studies, demonstrating a higher prediction interval coverage probability and a narrower prediction interval width.},

It minimizes the information loss occurring at the analog-to-spike transformation and possesses informational robustness to neural fluctuations and spike losses. The model provides a sparse and efficient coding scheme with precisely controllable spike rate that facilitates training of spiking neural networks in various auditory perception tasks.

Specifically, we propose a layer-wise-relevance-propagation-based (LRP-based) explanation technique coined GF-LRP which, to our knowledge, is the first explanation method for VGAEs. GF-LRP goes beyond existing LRP techniques for GCNs by taking into account, in addition to input features and the graph structure of the data, the VGAE branch-specific architecture. The explanations are branch-specific in the sense that we explain the mean and standard deviation branches of the Gaussian distribution learned by the model. For a node's prediction, GF-LRP infers the most relevant features, nodes and its edges. To prove the effectiveness of our explanation method, we compute fidelity, sparsity and contrastivity as well as commonly employed evaluation metrics. Extensive experiments and visualizations on two real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed explanation method.},

In the data preprocessing, the Simple Copy-Paste data augmentation method is used to increase the number of occlusion situations and enable the network to acquire additional occlusion processing experience and countermeasures. In the network structure, we take the form of occluded features as the boundary and divide it into two cases.

In addition, we also design the feature transmit structure that strengthens the link of occluded RoI features for detection and segmentation branches.

In this paper, a global cross-attention network (GCN) demosaicing method is proposed to excavate latent spectral characteristics to reconstruct the multispectral image. The architecture of GCN is based on the global cross-attention module, which contains a cross-transformer layer and a local self-attention module. Specifically, a global cross-attention module is proposed to fully explore intrinsic similarity characteristics in both spatial dimension and spectral dimension, non-local spatial self-attention and global spectral self-attention are conducted with Transformer architecture. Besides, the local self-attention module is utilized to enhance the effectiveness of extraction and refinement for local spatial information. Simulation experiments show that the image quality can be improved by up to 1.78 dB and the spectral similarity is significantly improved by our proposed GCN method compared to various reconstruction methods. In addition, GCN significantly reduces false color and zipper effect artifacts. Experiments using both synthetic and real data demonstrate that the proposed GCN outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods in terms of spatial and spectral fidelity.},

Therefore, this paper proposes a generalized multi-granulation dominance neighborhood rough set model based on weight distribution and discusses some relevant properties of this model. Furthermore, a new information entropy is constructed based on this model to handle uncertainty in data. This approach enhances the ability to describe uncertainty and enables more effective feature selection. As a result, a forward heuristic feature selection algorithm is developed to find the optimal feature subset.

  abstract     = {In recent works on semantic segmentation, there has been a significant focus on designing and integrating transformer-based encoders. However, less attention has been given to transformer-based decoders. We emphasize that the decoder stage is equally vital as the encoder in achieving superior segmentation performance. It disentangles and refines high-level cues, enabling precise object boundary delineation at the pixel level. In this paper, we introduce a novel transformer-based decoder called MUSTER, which seamlessly integrates with hierarchical encoders and consistently delivers high-quality segmentation results, regardless of the encoder architecture. Furthermore, we present a variant of MUSTER that reduces FLOPS while maintaining performance. MUSTER incorporates carefully designed multi-head skip attention (MSKA) units and introduces innovative upsampling operations. The MSKA units enable the fusion of multi-scale features from the encoder and decoder, facilitating comprehensive information integration. The upsampling operation leverages encoder features to enhance object localization and surpasses traditional upsampling methods, improving mIoU (mean Intersection over Union) by 0.4% to 3.2%. On the challenging ADE20K dataset, our best model achieves a single-scale mIoU of 50.23 and a multi-scale mIoU of 51.88, which is on-par with the current state-of-the-art model. Remarkably, we achieve this while significantly reducing the number of FLOPs by 61.3%.},

Despite their remarkable success, there has been a hurdle to applying data augmentation algorithms to code-related tasks since code consists of discrete tokens with uniqueness and certainty. In this work, we propose FeaMix, a novel yet simple data augmentation approach designed for the feature mix with memory batch based on self-consistency learning. FeaMix has a couple of uniqueness. First, it specially selects the samples to be mixed by memory batch to guarantee that the generated features are in the same spatial distribution as the mixed features. Second, it extends the self-consistency learning technique to optimize the language model for code-related tasks. With extensive experiments, we empirically validate that our method outperforms several baseline models and traditional data augmentation methods on code generation and code translation. It is noteworthy that we achieve state-of-the-art results in the CoNaLa and CodeTrans benchmarks, with a significant improvement of 1.9% in the Exact Match accuracy metric for code translation tasks.},

Stuck in the security and real-time issues of the THC with time-invariant key, this paper studies a dynamic novel Hill Cipher (NHC) with time-variant key for the first time. To ensure the fast decryption of the NHC, this work chooses the zeroing neural network (ZNN) which plays vital important role in solving dynamic problems as the decryption algorithm of NHC to solve the time-variant key inversion (TVKI) matrix. Specifically, a new robust fixed-time convergent activation function (NRFT-AF) and a new time-variant convergence factor (NTv-CF) are designed, and thus a new-type zeroing neural network model (NT-ZNN) is constructed by them for solving the TVKI. By virtue of abundant rigorous mathematical derivation, the fixed-time convergence and robustness of NT-ZNN model for solving the TVKI under the cases without noise and with noise are theoretically demonstrated in detail. Moreover, the NHC is also applied to the encryption and decryption experiments of different strings and RGB color image to validate its reliability. Then, comparative simulation results of the NT-ZNN model with conventional-type zeroing neural network (CT-ZNN) models constructed by other existing activation functions (AFs) and convergence factors (CFs) for solving the TVKI are given, and the superiority of the NT-ZNN model in NHC decryption is further verified.},

Firstly, an FSWNN is constructed according to Watts-Strogatz's rule. Derived from the graph theory, the hub centrality is calculated for each hidden neuron and then used as a measurement for its importance. The self-organizing algorithm is designed by splitting important neurons and merging unimportant neurons with their correlated neurons, and the convergence of this algorithm can be guaranteed theoretically. Extensive experiments are conducted to validate the effectiveness and superiority of SOFSWNN for both classification and regression problems. SOFSWNN achieves an improved generalization performance by SW property and the self-organizing structure.

  abstract     = {Dynamic community detection, which is capable of revealing changes in community structure over time, has garnered increasing attention in research. While evolutionary clustering methods have proven to be effective in tackling this issue, they often have a tendency to favor what are referred to as elite solutions, inadvertently neglecting the potential value of non-elite alternatives. Although elite solutions can ensure population convergence, they may result in negative population migration due to the lack of diversity when the network changes. In contrast, when the network undergoes changes, non-elite solutions could better adapt to the changed network, thereby can help the algorithm find accurate community structures in the new environment. To this end, we propose a diversified population migration strategy that consists of two-stages, i.e., solution selection and solution migration. In the first stage, we use elite solutions not only to ensure convergence but also non-elite solutions to maintain diversity and cope with network changes. In the second stage, the migration solutions are refined by using incremental changes between the two consecutive snapshots of networks. Based on the proposed strategy, we suggest a diversified population migration-based multiobjective evolutionary algorithm named DPMOEA. In DPMOEA, we design new genetic operators that utilize incremental changes between networks to make the population evolve in the right direction. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art baseline algorithms and can effectively solve the dynamic community detection problem.},

  abstract     = {The Capacitated Electric Vehicle Routing Problem (CEVRP) poses a novel challenge within the field of vehicle routing optimization, as it requires consideration of both customer service requirements and electric vehicle recharging schedules. In addressing the CEVRP, Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search (ALNS) has garnered widespread acclaim due to its remarkable adaptability and versatility. However, the original ALNS, using a weight-based scoring method, relies solely on the past performances of operators to determine their weights, thereby failing to capture crucial information about the ongoing search process. Moreover, it often employs a fixed single charging strategy for the CEVRP, neglecting the potential impact of alternative charging strategies on solution improvement. Therefore, this study treats the selection of operators as a Markov Decision Process and introduces a novel approach based on Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) for operator selection. This approach enables adaptive selection of both destroy and repair operators, alongside charging strategies, based on the current state of the search process. More specifically, a state extraction method is devised to extract features not only from the problem itself but also from the solutions generated during the iterative process. Additionally, a novel reward function is designed to guide the DRL network in selecting an appropriate operator portfolio for the CEVRP. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm excels in instances with fewer than 100 customers, achieving the best values in 7 out of 8 test instances. It also maintains competitive performance in instances with over 100 customers and requires less time compared to population-based methods.},

Most existing prediction schemes inadequately account for these traits, resulting in weak performance. In view of this, we propose a collaborative multi-component optimization model (MCO-BHPSF) to achieve high accuracy electricity demand prediction. For this model, the original data is first decomposed into linear trend components and nonlinear residual components using the Moving Average filter. Then, the enhanced Pattern Sequence-based Forecasting (PSF) algorithm that can effectively capture data patterns with obvious changes is used to accurately forecast the trend component and the embedded LightGBM for residual components. We further optimize the prediction results by using an error optimization scheme based on online sequence extreme learning machines to reduce prediction errors. The results of extensive experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposed MCO-BHPSF model outperforms four advanced baseline models. In day-ahead prediction, our model is on average 31% better than PSF baselines. For long-term prediction, our proposed MCO-BHPSF model has an average improvement rate of 37% compared to PSF baselines.},

To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first attempt to the incomplete multi-modal 3D shape clustering task. By exploring the spatial relationship between different 3D shape modalities, a spatial-aware representation cross-mapping module is proposed to generate representations of missing modal instances. Then, a dual adaptive representation fusion module is designed to obtain comprehensive 3D shape representations for clustering.

  abstract     = {Super-resolution is a promising solution to improve the quality of experience (QoE) for cloud-based video streaming when the network resources between clients and the cloud vendors become scarce. Specifically, the received video can be enhanced with a trained super-resolution model running on the client-side. However, all the existing solutions ignore the content-induced performance variability of Super-Resolution Deep Neural Network (SR-DNN) models, which means the same super-resolution models have different enhancement effects on the different parts of videos because of video content variation. That leads to unreasonable bitrate selection, resulting in low video QoE, e.g., low bitrate, rebuffering, or video quality jitters. Thus, in this paper, we propose SR-ABR, a super-resolution integrated adaptive bitrate (ABR) algorithm, which considers the content-induced performance variability of SR-DNNs into the bitrate decision process. Due to complex network conditions and video content, SR-ABR adopts deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to select future bitrate for adapting to a wide range of environments. Moreover, to utilize the content-induced performance variability of SR-DNNs efficiently, we first define the performance variability of SR-DNNs over different video content, and then use a 2D convolution kernel to distill the features of the performance variability of the SR-DNNs to a short future video segment (several chunks) as part of the inputs. We compare SR-ABR with the related state-of-the-art works using trace-driven simulation under various real-world traces. The experiments show that SR-ABR outperforms the best state-of-the-art work NAS with the gain in average QoE of 4.3%–46.2% and 18.9%–42.1% under FCC and 3G/HSDPA network traces, respectively.},

To surmount this obstacle, this paper presents a reconstruction mechanism to rebuild the consensus error at the switching topology instant. Combining optimal control theory and reinforcement learning strategy, the identifier neural network is utilized to approximate the unknown function, with its corresponding updating law being independent of the switching duration of system dynamics. In addition, an event-triggered mechanism is adopted to enhance the efficiency of resource utilization. With the assistance of the Lyapunov stability principle, sufficient conditions are established to ensure that all signals in the closed-loop system are cooperatively semi-globally uniformly ultimately bounded in probability and the consensus error is capable of converging to the specified interval in a prescribed time.

The state-of-the-art DNNs-based SAR image detection models are designed manually by only considering the test accuracy performance on clean datasets but neglecting the models' adversarial robustness under various types of adversarial attacks. In order to obtain the best trade-off between the clean accuracy and adversarial robustness in robust convolutional neural networks (CNNs)-based SAR image classification models, this work makes the first attempt to develop a multi-objective adversarially robust CNN, called MoAR-CNN. In the MoAR-CNN, we propose a multi-objective automatic design method of the cells-based neural architectures and some critical hyperparameters such as the optimizer type and learning rate of CNNs. A Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) layer is introduced after each cell to improve the computational efficiency and robustness. The experiments on FUSAR-Ship and OpenSARShip datasets against seven types of adversarial attacks have been implemented to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed MoAR-CNN to six classical manually designed CNNs and four robust neural architectures search methods in terms of clean accuracy, adversarial accuracy, and model size.

  abstract     = {Computational effectiveness and limited resources in evolutionary algorithms are interdependently handled during the working of low-power microprocessors for real-world problems, particularly in many-objective evolutionary algorithms (MaOEAs). In this respect, the balance between them will be broken by evolutionary algorithms with a normal-sized population, but which doesn't include a micro population. To tackle this issue, this paper proposes a micro many-objective evolutionary algorithm with knowledge transfer ($\mu$MaOEA). To address the oversight that knowledge is often not considered enough between niches, the knowledge-transfer strategy is proposed to bolster each unoptimized niche through optimizing adjacent niches, which enables niches to generate better individuals. Meanwhile, a two-stage mechanism based on fuzzy logic is designed to settle the conflict between convergence and diversity in many-objective optimization problems. Through efficient fuzzy logic decision-making, the mechanism maintains different properties of the population at different stages. Different MaOEAs and micro multi-objective evolutionary algorithms were compared on benchmark test problems DTLZ, MaF, and WFG, and the results showed that $\mu$MaOEA has an excellent performance. In addition, it also conducted simulation on two real-world problems, MPDMP and MLDMP, based on a low-power microprocessor. The results indicated the applicability of $\mu$MaOEA for low-power microprocessor optimization.},

  abstract     = {In the vast landscape of machine learning, meta-learning stands out as a challenging and dynamic area of exploration. While traditional machine learning models rely on standard algorithms to learn from data, meta-learning elevates this process by leveraging prior knowledge to adapt and improve learning experiences, mimicking the adaptive nature of human learning. This paradigm offers promising avenues for addressing the limitations of conventional deep learning approaches, such as data and computational constraints, as well as issues related to generalization. In this comprehensive survey, we delve into the intricacies of meta-learning methodologies. Beginning with a foundational overview of meta-learning and its associated fields, we present a detailed methodology elucidating the workings of meta-learning. Recognizing the importance of rigorous evaluation, we also furnish a comprehensive summary of prevalent benchmark datasets and recent advancements in meta-learning techniques applied to these datasets. Additionally, we explore meta-learning's diverse applications and achievements in domains like reinforcement learning and few-shot learning. Lastly, we examine practical hurdles and potential research directions, providing insights for future endeavors in this burgeoning field.},

  abstract     = {Human-object interaction (HOI) detection has attracted significant attention due to its wide applications, including human-robot interactions, security monitoring, automatic sports commentary, etc. HOI detection aims to detect humans, objects, and their interactions in a given image or video, so it needs a higher-level semantic understanding of the image than regular object recognition or detection tasks. It is also more challenging technically because of some unique difficulties, such as multi-object interactions, long-tail distribution of interaction categories, etc. Currently, deep learning methods have achieved great performance in HOI detection, but there are few reviews describing the recent advance of deep learning-based HOI detection. Moreover, the current stage-based category of HOI detection methods is causing confusion in community discussion and beginner learning. To fill this gap, this paper summarizes, categorizes, and compares methods using deep learning for HOI detection over the last nine years. Firstly, we summarize the pipeline of HOI detection methods. Then, we divide existing methods into three categories (two-stage, one-stage, and transformer-based), distinguish them in formulas and schematics, and qualitatively compare their advantages and disadvantages. After that, we review each category of methods in detail, focusing on HOI detection methods for images. Moreover, we explore the development process of using foundation models for HOI detection. We also quantitatively compare the performance of existing methods on public HOI datasets. At last, we point out the future research direction of HOI detection.},
