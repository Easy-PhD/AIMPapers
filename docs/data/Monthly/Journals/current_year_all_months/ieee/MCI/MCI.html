However, the practical deployment of QNNs, particularly in vision tasks, remains limited due to hardware constraints such as qubit scarcity. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a quantum convolutional neural network (QCNN)-based object detection framework designed for the noisy intermediate scale quantum (NISQ) era. The proposed method introduces four key components, patch processing, channel uploading, hybrid channel construction, and heterogeneous knowledge distillation, to enable efficient multi-channel object detection with a limited number of qubits. Furthermore, the knowledge distillation strategy facilitates the transfer of knowledge from a classical region proposal network (RPN) to its quantum counterpart, thereby enhancing detection accuracy despite the limitations of early-stage quantum machine learning. The evaluation results demonstrate the feasibility and efficiency of the proposed quantum object detection model, which can be effectively applied to complex vision tasks within existing quantum hardware limitations.},

  abstract     = {The rapid development of parallel and distributed computing paradigms has brought great revolution in computing. Thanks to the intrinsic parallelism of evolutionary computation (EC), it is natural to implement EC on these systems. On the one hand, the high computing power can significantly improve the efficiency and scalability of EC. On the other hand, distributed data bring new challenges and development to EC. In this paper, a systematic review on distributed EC (DEC) is given. First, this paper provides an overview of DEC from a broader perspective, including not only the work of improving the efficiency of EC in parallel and distributed platforms, but also the work of applying DEC to solve distributed optimization problems derived from modern distributed environments like the Internet of Things and multi-agent systems. A new taxonomy to review DEC is proposed according to problems, implementation environments, communication models, and algorithms. Based on this taxonomy, problems solved by DEC are categorized into centralized optimization problems and distributed optimization problems according to the information owner. Correspondingly, two major purposes, improving efficiency through parallel processing for centralized optimization and cooperating distributed individuals/sub-populations with partial information for distributed optimization can be distilled. Noting that the latter is an emerging and attractive trend, a systematic definition of distributed optimization is given, including dimension distributed-, data distributed-, and objective distributed-optimization problems. Various DEC studies for these problems are surveyed. Furthermore, challenges, and potential research directions are discussed to enlighten the design of DEC and pave the way to future developments.},

Nevertheless, the challenge of editing real images persists, as most methods are either computationally intensive or produce poor reconstructions. This paper introduces SAGE (Self-Attention Guidance for image Editing)—a novel technique leveraging pre-trained diffusion models for image editing. SAGE builds upon the DDIM algorithm and incorporates a novel guidance mechanism utilizing the self-attention layers of the diffusion U-Net. This mechanism computes a reconstruction objective based on attention maps generated during the inverse DDIM process, enabling efficient reconstruction of unedited regions without the need to precisely reconstruct the entire input image. Thus, SAGE directly addresses the key challenges in image editing. The superiority of SAGE over other methods is demonstrated through quantitative and qualitative evaluations and confirmed by a statistically validated comprehensive user study, in which all 47 surveyed users preferred SAGE over competing methods. Additionally, SAGE ranks as the top-performing method in seven out of 10 quantitative analyses and secures second and third places in the remaining three.},

  abstract     = {Subset selection, which refers to the selection of a finite number of variables to optimize a given objective function, is a fundamental problem in various applications. Among the existing algorithms for solving this problem, evolutionary algorithms (EAs) based on Pareto optimization have demonstrated good performance in acquiring high-quality subsets with a theoretical guarantee. However, most existing EAs ignore the importance of variables in designing evolutionary operators (for example, mutations), which makes the search inefficient. To fill this gap, this study proposes a steering mutation-based evolutionary algorithm called SMSS for subset selection, where the importance of variables is fully utilized to ensure both the effectiveness and theoretical guarantee of the algorithm. Specifically, a novel steering mutation operator is designed in SMSS to effectively select items of high importance and discard those of low importance in the Pareto optimization process, which provides the generation of final subsets with better quality. In addition, it is proved that SMSS can attain a $(1-e^{-\gamma })$(1-e-γ)-optimal polynomial-time approximation guarantee in scenarios where the objective function exhibits monotonicity. Extensive experiments on two subset selection applications (unsupervised feature selection and sparse regression) demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithm over state-of-the-art algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Symbolic Regression (SR) is a powerful technique for uncovering hidden mathematical expressions from observed data and has broad applications in scientific discovery and automatic programming. Genetic Programming (GP) has traditionally been the dominant technique for solving the SR, benefiting from a robust global search capability that enables the discovery of solutions with high fitting accuracy. Whereas, GP suffers from low search efficiency and may not fully exploit the accumulated knowledge to accelerate convergence. Conversely, deep learning-based methods, particularly those employing Transformer backbones, are trained offline on large-scale datasets. These methods exhibit strong generalization capabilities for unseen tasks without additional training. However, the lack of refinement mechanisms for specific tasks renders them inferior to GP methods in accuracy. This study aims to combine the specific problem-solving capabilities of GP with the generalization strengths of pretrained Transformer models. Specifically, we propose a pretrained model guided GP (PGGP) method, which is a GP-based method that incorporates a pretrained Transformer model to enhance SR problem-solving. New initialization and mutation operators are proposed based on the well-structured equation obtained using the pre-trained model. Extensive experiments are conducted, and the results show that our method not only surpasses comparative methods in terms of accuracy but also reduces the complexity of the generated solutions, potentially enhancing interpretability.},

However, traditional DRL methods often require large-scale neural networks and extensive computational resources, which limits their applicability in power-sensitive and resource-constrained edge environments, such as mobile robots and drones. To overcome these limitations, we leverage the energy-efficient properties of brain-inspired spiking neural networks (SNNs) to develop a novel spike-based DRL framework, referred to as Spike-DRL. Unlike traditional SNN-based reinforcement learning methods, Spike-DRL incorporates the energy-efficient time-to-first-spike (TTFS) encoding scheme, where information is encoded through the precise timing of a single spike. This TTFS-based method allows Spike-DRL to work in a sparse, event-driven manner, significantly reducing energy consumption. In addition, to improve the deployment capability of Spike-DRL in resource-constrained environments, a lightweight strategy for quantizing synaptic weights into low-bit representations is introduced, significantly reducing memory usage and computational complexity. Extensive experiments have been conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed Spike-DRL, and the results show that our method achieves competitive performance with higher energy efficiency and lower memory requirements. This work presents a biologically inspired model that is well suited for real-time decision-making and autonomous learning in power-sensitive and resource-limited edge environments.},

  abstract     = {The rapid proliferation of the E-commerce sector has profoundly transformed consumer behaviour, creating significant opportunities for businesses while simultaneously posing substantial challenges. As online shopping becomes increasingly ubiquitous, the exponential growth in data volume has impeded the task of identifying products that best align with individual preferences. Faced with an overwhelming array of similar products across multiple brands and platforms, consumers often suffer from decision fatigue, hindering their judgment to make optimal purchasing decisions. While recommendation systems have emerged as critical tools to mitigate this problem, existing approaches encounter persistent challenges in accurately modelling user preferences and behaviours, particularly using implicit feedback data such as clicks, views, and interactions. Motivated by these issues, this paper proposes a novel framework, the Multinomial Variational Autoencoder with K-means clustering (MulVAEK), designed to enhance the understanding of user preferences and behaviours from implicit feedback. Unlike conventional variational autoencoders (VAEs), which model user behaviour in latent space using Gaussian distributions, MulVAEK employs a multinomial distribution, capturing the discrete and complex nature of user-item interactions with greater fidelity. Furthermore, the integration of K-means clustering within the latent space enables the discovery of latent user archetypes and behavioural groupings, supporting the delivery of more personalised and contextually relevant recommendations. Rigorous experimental evaluations on widely recognised recommender system datasets demonstrate that MulVAEK significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methodologies, achieving superior accuracy, robustness, and interpretability across diverse recommendation scenarios.},

  abstract     = {An intrusion detection system (IDS) plays a crucial role in network security by distinguishing hostile activities from network traffic. Conventional hardware-based IDS architectures have high throughput and low energy consumption but suffer from poor detection accuracy. By contrast, software-based systems using machine learning and deep learning techniques can significantly improve detection accuracy. Nevertheless, owing to the implementation requirements of von Neumann computer architectures, their long inference time makes them unsuitable for application to large networks and high-bandwidth connections. To address this issue, this study proposes a novel dendritic neural model ensemble for intrusion detection. A logic circuit-based IDS is designed based on mutual information-based feature selection and ensemble learning algorithms. The IDS consists of logic gates, comparators, shift registers, and accumulators and was successfully implemented in a field programmable gate array (FPGA) device. Experimental results reveal that the proposed IDS shows both higher detection accuracy and higher detection speed than the state-of-the-art detection methods on two modern intrusion detection datasets. Therefore, it can be regarded as a powerful and efficient IDS in practical applications. The source code is available at https://jijunkai123.github.io/DNM/.},

  abstract     = {In the domain of multi-objective optimization, evolutionary algorithms are distinguished by their capability to generate a diverse population of solutions that navigate the trade-offs inherent among competing objectives. This has catalyzed the ascension of evolutionary multi-objective optimization (EMO) as a prevalent approach. Despite the effectiveness of the EMO paradigm, the analysis of resultant solution sets presents considerable challenges. This is primarily attributed to the high-dimensional nature of the data and the constraints imposed by static visualization methods, which frequently culminate in visual clutter and impede interactive exploratory analysis. To address these challenges, this paper introduces ParetoLens, a visual analytics framework specifically tailored to enhance the inspection and exploration of solution sets derived from the multi-objective evolutionary algorithms. Utilizing a modularized, algorithm-agnostic design, ParetoLens enables a detailed inspection of solution distributions in both decision and objective spaces through a suite of interactive visual representations. This approach not only mitigates the issues associated with static visualizations but also supports a more nuanced and flexible analysis process. The usability of the framework is evaluated through case studies and expert interviews, demonstrating its potential to uncover complex patterns and facilitate a deeper understanding of multi-objective optimization solution sets. A demo website of ParetoLens is available at https://dva-lab.org/paretolens/.},

This paper explores the potential of LLMs, such as ChatGPT, to annotate abundant speech data with the goal of advancing the state-of-the-art in SER. Specifically, it proposes a method that integrates audio representations and gender information with textual prompts to enhance the annotation process using LLMs. Our evaluation encompasses single-shot and few-shots scenarios, revealing performance variability in SER. Notably, this work achieves improved results through data augmentation by incorporating ChatGPT-annotated samples into the existing datasets.

  abstract     = {Currently, federated reinforcement learning (FRL) is driving progress in the edge artificial intelligence (AI) sector by effectively addressing a range of environmental challenges through distributed learning. The selection of participants in federated learning (FL) is especially vital because it greatly influences the overall performance and learning efficiency of the system. However, unlike traditional FL, the absence of a pre-accumulated dataset in FRL makes current FL participant selection methods unsuitable for FRL systems. To address this limitation, this paper proposes a novel experience-based participant selection method, tailored for FRL systems. This approach uses dimensionality reduction techniques to effectively analyze the experiences of agents and employs similarity measurements to intelligently select agents with diverse experiences. The FRL system has been implemented using the proposed technique, and extensive experiments have been performed to assess the system’s performance from various perspectives. Our evaluation results show a considerable increase in the intelligence of the FRL system, resulting in more efficient training and an overall enhancement in performance. This is demonstrated by a considerable reduction of 23.65% in average training time and an average performance improvement of 53.25% compared to existing methods.},

  abstract     = {Traditional multimodal multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MMOEAs) usually adopt the reproduction strategy based on meta-heuristic and fail to make full use of changes of multi-generation population distribution, which can help the population to further evolve and improve the exploitation ability of algorithms. To address this issue, this paper proposes a deep learning-based evolutionary algorithm (DLEA), which converts historical population information into time series and uses deep neural networks to predict the population distribution. Specifically, a transformer-based prediction model is constructed to reproduce promising offspring by capturing changes of population distribution in adjacent generations. Moreover, many MMOEAs focus only on global Pareto optimal solution sets (PSs) and ignore local PSs. Although local PSs are inferior to global PSs in terms of objective values, the cost of obtaining global PSs in some practical applications is huge. Local PSs with similar objectives to global PSs are acceptable alternatives for decision makers. Therefore, a difference-based attention mechanism is designed for archive update, which saves solutions on the global PSs and local PSs by calculating the attention value. Experimental studies indicate that DLEA outperforms other six competitive MMOEAs.},

  abstract     = {Learning from data streams originating from non-stationary environments is vital for many real-world applications. A notable challenge in this task is concept drift. Most existing methods rely on a large number of labeled instances to detect and tackle concept drift in data streams. However, obtaining labeled data is not easy due to high costs, especially in potentially infinite data streams. To address this issue, a semi-supervised active learning neural network for data streams with concept drift is proposed to build an accurate classification model from incompletely labeled data. First, a semi-supervised regularization based on smoothness assumption is proposed to adjust the network weights and utilize unlabeled data. Second, a smoothness loss-based query strategy is designed to select instances that effectively improve model performance in line with the semi-supervised regularization objective. Notably, the query strategy and semi-supervised regularization form a closed learning loop that realizes the mutual enhancement of semi-supervised learning and active learning. Furthermore, an adaptive node adjustment method is proposed, which adjusts only a few neurons to adapt to local changes. Experiments on 17 synthetic and real-world datasets show that the proposed approach outperforms other state-of-the-art methods under various labeling budgets.},

We survey the theoretical results of the four methods, highlighting their fundamental importance and successes by including discussions on problem formulation, key assumptions, algorithm procedures, and theoretical guarantees. Subsequently, we evaluate the performance of the control designs to provide analyses and insights on the feasibility of these design methods for applications from a control designer's point of view. Through systematic evaluations, we point out when theory diverges from practical controller synthesis. We, furthermore, introduce a new quantitative analytical framework to diagnose the observed discrepancies. Based on the analyses and the insights gained through quantitative evaluations, we point out potential future research directions to unleash the potential of CT-RL control algorithms in addressing the identified challenges.”},

  abstract     = {Artificial Intelligence (AI) has emerged as a transformative technology powering innovations that impact industries, societies, and individuals alike. At the core of this progress, Computational Intelligence (CI) plays a pivotal role in advancing AI's capabilities by enabling complex problem-solving approaches that incorporate knowledge, adaptability, and computational paradigms. This impact is clearly evident in IEEE Computational Intelligence Society (CIS) publications, which consistently showcase high-quality, impactful research that drives the development of AI. IEEE CIS's Transactions—TNNLS, TFS, TEVC, TOG, TCDS, TETCI, and TAI—along with our dedicated Computational Intelligence Magazine (CIM), provide a vital platform for groundbreaking research and thought leadership. This success stands as a testament to the quality and relevance of the work published and to the dedication of our research community, which continues to push the boundaries of AI.},
