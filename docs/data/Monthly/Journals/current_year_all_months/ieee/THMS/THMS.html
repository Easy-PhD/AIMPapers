  abstract     = {Increasing online active engagement has been shown to effectively improve rehabilitation outcomes. This article introduces a method for improving online active engagement during lower limb rehabilitation training based on electroencephalogram (EEG) signals using an artificial neural network (ANN) recognition model as well as a virtual reality-based induced active engagement rehabilitation training system (VATS). The VATS consists of a bicycle-style rehabilitation instrument and a virtual reality game. Experiments were performed to train the ANN model and to validate the effectiveness of the VATS. We compared the accuracy of the ANN with that of k-nearest neighbor and support vector machine models, where active engagement results from eye tracker analysis were used as the gold standard. In addition, we used the surface electromyography engagement index (Er) to compare the VATS with and without active engagement feedback. The results showed that the ANN model had the highest average accuracy of 76.95% and a maximum accuracy of 81.48%. A comparison of the ANN, KNN, and SVM models revealed statistically significant differences in accuracy (p < 0.05). Significant differences were observed in the Er values between the VATS with and without active engagement feedback. The results indicated that the ANN has an apparent advantage in active engagement recognition. Moreover, the VATS was effective in improving active engagement. The proposed method utilized EEG signals to characterize active engagement intention and achieved real-time enhancement of active engagement through VATS. This method could be further used to improve the rehabilitation training effect in clinical applications.},

  abstract     = {Bundle branch block (BBB) is a cardiac disease that occurs due to the delay in the heart’s electrical activity during a heartbeat. The early detection of BBB using 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) is crucial in clinical studies for monitoring the progress of this disease and initiation of treatment. This article proposes a fifth-order tensor-domain machine learning (FOTDML) approach for the automated detection of BBB using 12-lead ECG recordings. The entire duration of the 12-lead ECG recording of each subject is initially segmented into 12-lead beats using a multilead fusion-based QRS complex detection method. Multivariate fast iterative filtering (MVFIF) decomposes each 12-lead beat into intrinsic mode functions or local components. Then, the continuous wavelet transform is utilized to evaluate the time-frequency representation of the MVFIF mode of the 12-lead beat. A fifth-order tensor containing the information on 12-lead ECG beats, leads, MVFIF-domain local components, frequencies (or scales), and samples is evaluated from the entire duration of the 12-lead ECG recording of each subject. Multilinear singular value decomposition is employed to extract features from the fifth-order tensor. Different machine learning (ML)-based methods are utilized to detect BBB from the fifth-order tensor-domain features of each subject’s entire duration 12-lead ECG recording. The suggested approach is evaluated using 12-lead ECG recordings of subjects from two public databases. The results show that the proposed FOTDML approach has yielded the classification accuracy values of 99.88% and 100%, respectively, for healthy control (HC) versus left BBB versus right BBB and HC versus BBB schemes with the subject-independent hold-out validation strategy. The suggested FOTDML approach has demonstrated higher classification performance than the existing methods to detect BBB using 12-lead ECG.},

  abstract     = {Emerging evidence suggests that prolonged virtual reality (VR) exposure may impair human sensory systems. Most research has focused on the visual, proprioceptive, and vestibular systems, but the impact of VR on haptic perception remains unclear. In this study, we investigated alterations in human sensitivity to contact force following VR gaming. A force perception task was designed to assess changes in contact force across six difficulty levels with step sizes ranging from 0.5 to 5 N. A total of 18 participants performed the task before VR, after 10 min, and after an additional 20 min of VR. The perceptual accuracy of correctly perceiving force changes at each difficulty level was measured across three test periods. The results indicated that 66.67% of participants experienced a negative impact from VR at the 1-N change step. Perceptual accuracy significantly decreased in this group, with a 9.17% reduction after 10 min and a 17.50% reduction after an additional 20 min. In contrast, minimal effects were observed in the remaining participants. These findings suggest that even short-term VR exposure can impair force discrimination in certain users, with the effects becoming more pronounced over time.},

  abstract     = {Spacecraft rendezvous and docking maneuvers are becoming highly automated in an attempt to decrease astronaut workload, but still require a human supervisor to continually monitor the system and manually take over control when systems are not performing as expected. This requirement shifts astronaut workload to a monitoring and failure-mitigation task, which must be characterized to assess the influence of this task shift for automated rendezvous and docking (ARD). The physical performance of manual takeover maneuvers are well studied in other fields, such as automated vehicles, but less is known about the factors that influence the decision leading to takeover. This study operationalizes the concept of automation legibility (i.e., intent-expression) to gain insight into when and where supervisors initiate manual takeover. We hypothesized that fundamental aspects of autonomous agent path planning of initial condition and path curvature influence path legibility and takeover decision-making. The study had $N=33$ participants who performed an ARD monitoring task. Metrics for legibility were defined using the positions, where the human initiated a manual takeover along the ARD path. Results support that initial condition, path curvature, and autonomous agent heading were interacting predictors of path legibility and takeover decision timing and location. Increased legibility was correlated to supervisor perceptions of path-appropriateness. The most legible paths aligned the supervisor’s egocentric viewpoint to the path goal, while putting targets of avoidance in the supervisor’s periphery. Characterizations of cooperative performance in human-automation interaction systems from this study can inform future ARD system design that mitigates workload in ARD task performance.},

  abstract     = {Sudden traffic hazards trigger collision-avoidance behaviors in drivers that can significantly impact vehicle dynamics, potentially conflicting with the existing advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS), such as autonomous emergency braking and steering. This behavior can lead to unexpected vehicle movements, further complicating the situation and elevating the risk of accidents. Understanding and tailoring the inference of drivers’ perception-response time (PRT) is essential for optimizing ADAS activation in intelligent vehicles. This approach allows customization for individual drivers, improving safety and ensuring that interventions are personalized and minimally disruptive to normal driving patterns. To achieve this objective, this study performs high-fidelity simulation experiments to gather a comprehensive multidimensional dataset on drivers’ responses in safety-critical scenarios, primarily focusing on PRT and its influencing factors. Using the collision-avoidance behavior data, a driver evidence accumulation model is created to explain PRT distribution and facilitate real-time personalized inferences. We also analyze the relationship between model parameters and real-world physical significance, demonstrating that driver decisions rely on visual evidence accumulation influenced by dynamic interactions in different scenarios. Our proposed model, by offering a detailed understanding of drivers’ perceptual and decision-making processes, aids in developing personalized driver assistance system activation recommendations. This approach seeks to create personalized and adaptive systems within intelligent vehicles, thereby reducing human-machine conflicts and improving the overall safety of intelligent transportation systems.},

  abstract     = {In urban safety, intelligent transportation, and smart security applications, robust pedestrian detection is paramount. Methods that rely solely on visible light imaging struggle in low-light or adverse weather conditions. To address these challenges, we propose dual-modality pedestrian detection (DMPD)—a novel dual-modality pedestrian detection framework that fuses visible and infrared imaging through innovative fusion strategies. The method integrates a modal alignment module to reduce pixel-level misalignment, a differential modal fusion module to effectively combine complementary features while suppressing noise, and a mix module that enhances multiscale feature extraction via integrated convolution and self-attention mechanisms. Furthermore, the enhanced YOLOv7 is used to further boost feature representation and detection accuracy. Experimental results on the public dataset demonstrate that DMPD achieves a detection $mA{{P}_{50}}$ of 97.1% and a real-time speed of 118 FPS, outperforming state-of-the-art methods under both normal and adverse conditions, including fog, rain, and snow. These results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed fusion strategy in harnessing the complementary strengths of visible and infrared modalities, thereby offering a highly robust and scalable solution for pedestrian detection in complex urban environments.},

  abstract     = {Frequent blood glucose monitoring is crucial for patients with diabetes. However, current blood glucose measurement methods are primarily invasive and, thus, cause discomfort and infection risks. Accordingly, this study developed a noninvasive real-time glucose monitoring system based on a deep learning (DL) model (comprising convolutional neural network and long short-term memory network models) and multiwavelength near-infrared (NIR) light technology. The system is equipped with a portable finger gripper with NIR light-emitting diodes emitting at three distinct wavelengths (810, 860, and 940 nm) to illuminate the finger. A triad spectroscopy sensor is then used to capture finger photoplethysmography (PPG) signals within only 6 s. The captured signals are then transmitted to a server-side DL model for glucose prediction. This DL model analyzes the three-wavelength PPG data to predict a user’s blood glucose value. The predicted glucose value is subsequently displayed on a dedicated smartphone app. In contrast to previously proposed systems relying on machine learning for feature extraction, the proposed system uses a DL model to automatically extract glucose-related features from the three-band PPG signals, ultimately leading to blood glucose predictions with a root-mean-square error of 6.62. Furthermore, the proposed system prioritizes user comfort, portability, and stability, thereby offering a convenient and accessible blood glucose monitoring experience.},

In this system, conductive threads are employed to sew coils onto a regular glove covering the fingers, wrist, palm, and ulnar positions. To improve sensitivity, a data acquisition system measures a tank circuit formed by each sewn coil and external components. The system is rigorously tested on ten subjects. A comparative study of three machine learning algorithms (MLAs), including random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), and K-nearest neighbors (KNNs), is conducted to detect 26 ASL letters. To improve the diversity and generalizability of the MLA, the generative adversarial network (GAN) data augmentation method is provided, expanding the dataset to 5050 trials for each gesture. The results demonstrate impressive accuracy rates of 99.67% and 97.46% using five-fold cross-validation (5F-CV) and leave-one-subject-out cross-validation (LOSO-CV), respectively, for the RF algorithm. This exhibits higher sensitivity in detecting similar gestures compared to the previous design.

  abstract     = {As a periodic movement, gait contains informative biometric traits formed by individual body structures, motion patterns, and behavioral habits. Previous gait recognition methods mainly focus on mining the appearance cues from gait sequences, while neglecting the dynamic motion characteristics. Motion cues are important complementary information for generating high-quality gait representations that can help models accurately recognize individuals. In this article, we propose a novel gait recognition framework named GaitDS to model dynamic motion information and construct salient gait representations. Specifically, we develop a motion information perception module that can directly represent dynamic regions during walking and extract fine-grained motion features based on the appearance of body parts over time. In addition, since some frames in gait sequences share partial similarities, we present saliency identity representation learning to focus on key frames along the temporal dimension, and integrate salient identity features to enhance sequence-level representations. Furthermore, a channel enhanced module is designed to generate more discriminative gait representations, where motion and temporal salient features can be complemented with global representations. Compared with existing state-of-the-art methods, our model achieves superior average rank-1 recognition accuracy on three benchmark datasets, i.e., 93.7% on CASIA-B, 92.4% on OU-MVLP, and 50.7% on Gait3D.},

A voice application (for desktops and smartphones) was created to study these effects. Seniors, and their family care providers along with medical providers were consulted for voice application design and improvement opportunities using two user tests with 17 care dyads and 15 medical care providers. Results from qualitative content analysis show that care dyads generally prefer familiar voice reminders for routine tasks (such as taking medication) and generally find caregiver-voiced reminders to be acceptable, while medical care providers have mixed opinions about older adults using recorded reminders.},

While there are clear benefits of recourse from the user’s perspective, the notion of actionability in explainable AI research remains vague, and claims of ‘actionable’ explainability techniques are based on researchers’ intuitions. Inspired by definitions and instruments for assessing actionability in other domains, we construct a seven-item tool and investigate its effectiveness through two user studies. We show that the tool discriminates actionability across explanation types and that the distinctions align with human judgments. We illustrate the impact of context on actionability assessments, suggesting that domain-specific tool adaptations may foster more human-centred algorithmic systems. This is a valuable step forward for research and practices into actionable explainability and algorithmic recourse, providing the first clear human-centred tool for assessing actionability in explainable AI.},

  abstract     = {Bradykinesia is a hallmark symptom of Parkinson’s disease (PD) that significantly affects patients’ functional abilities and quality of life. This study proposed a fine-grained classification method for evaluating the level of bradykinesia in PD patients. Based on inertial signals, surface electromyographic (sEMG) signals, and videos obtained from 40 PD patients and 13 healthy subjects, the proposed data preprocessing method extracts 69-D features from inertial and sEMG (IE) signals, and 7-D skeleton features from videos. A two-stream network, including IE stream, skeleton stream, and decision fusion module, was developed using long short-term memory, full convolutional neural networks, and fully connected neural networks. In addition, the IE stream incorporated a feature shrinking module to process high-dimensional features to reduce redundant features. Furthermore, an LSTM-variational autoencoders method was proposed for data augmentation of categories with fewer samples. The proposed method achieved higher recognition rates (pro/supination movements of hands: 85.51%, finger tapping: 88.06%, hand movements: 90.00%) compared to other methods. With low-cost, compact and lightweight methods, bradykinesia in PD patients can be intelligently assessed, which will enhance patient management and treatment efficiency.},

In this study, we examined humans’ perception of the AI’s computer vision capability of classifying various road sign images, including the original images, images with two different types of malicious attacks, and images that are scrambled randomly at the pixel level. Our results showed that participants rated the AI agent to be less capable than themselves of classifying the road signs. However, they overestimated the AI’s computer vision capability for correctly classifying images with malicious attacks that should cause the AI system to misclassify the image.

  abstract     = {Rehabilitation exercises are essential for individuals who have lost their ability to function normally. Typically, a functional rehabilitation program consists of two parts: supervised exercises in a rehabilitation center and additional exercises performed independently at home. Home exercises are as important as in-center exercises and can significantly improve recovery time. However, at home, the patient is unsupervised, with a significant risk of performing exercises incorrectly. This article presents a web application designed for hand rehabilitation exercises that uses a pretrained hand landmark model and an artificial neural network (ANN) classifier to ensure correct exercise performance. The application employs transfer learning to extract features from the user's hand movements, with the ANN classifier, designed using the ML5 library, determining if the positions are performed accurately. The ML5 library, a high-level interface to TensorFlow.js, makes the application suitable for web deployment. Physicians can create new exercises and retrain the ANN classifier without programming skills. An evaluation with 12 participants demonstrated an overall classification accuracy of 90.25% and achieved a system usability scale score of 75.30, indicating high usability and potential for real-world rehabilitation scenarios. This lightweight web application is highly accessible and user friendly and runs seamlessly on any smartphone or tablet. This approach shows great promise in enhancing exercise accuracy and safety, thereby improving the rehabilitation process at home and in clinical settings. In addition, it is adaptable for other models for full-body and face tracking, making it versatile for various rehabilitation applications.},

Recently, several researchers have been working toward harvesting/producing energy from human beings and trying to translate that into electrical form, which wearable and implantable medical devices could use in the long run. This review article discusses different energy sources and harvesting techniques from the human body. The promising sources for energy harvesting are human movements, such as walking, running, etc., upper-limb movement, heartbeat, heat transmission, and breathing, which helps explore diverse types of energies, such as chemical, thermal, kinetic, mechanical, and other energies that can be harvested from the human body.

While AV explanations with different information types have been studied to enhance drivers' trust and SA, their effectiveness remains unclear when AVs make errors that do not trigger takeover requests. This study investigated the effects of information type, error type, and their interaction on drivers' trust in AVs, SA, and their relationships. We recruited 300 participants in an online video study with a 3 (information type: why, how, why + how) × 3 (error type: false alarm, miss, correct [no error]) mixed design. How information describes the vehicle's action, while why information refers to the reason for the vehicle's action. Linear mixed models showed that false alarms and misses were associated with lower SA compared with correct scenarios, but possibly due to different reasons. Compared with correct scenarios, both false alarms and misses were associated with lower trust, with misses even lower than false alarms, possibly due to the varying severity of potential consequences. Compared with why and why + how information, how information was generally associated with lower SA and a higher potential of overtrust in false alarms. Trust and SA had a negative linear relationship in misses and false alarms, while no correlations were found in correct scenarios. To mitigate potential overtrust and misinterpretation of situations when AVs make errors, it is crucial to maintain higher SA. We recommend including why information in AV explanations and deploying AV decision systems that are less miss-prone.},

The experiments were conducted on a motorized two-wheeler simulator in a randomized order in four situations: 1) normal, 2) distraction, 3) time pressure, and 4) distraction under time pressure. Naturalistic riding data was also collected to validate the results in normal riding conditions. First, seven latent classes were developed to understand the variation in speed of the rider along the road stretch as the rider approached or departed away from the speed hump. Further, using the spring-mass block theory, the riders' speed was considered to be the combination of constant base speed and varying simple harmonic motion speed. The spring-mass block theory was validated by developing univariate Bayesian regression models. Finally, the impact of inadequate marking and driving assistance systems such as advanced warning, individual vehicle attributes, lifestyle, and road crash history on the speed profile has been quantified using linear mixed effect models. Furthermore, the speed profile equations were validated using field data. The results revealed that unmarked speed humps were less detectable as the riders responded seven meters late to inadequately visible speed humps compared to marked speed humps. The advanced warning helped in smoothening the speed profile of the rider, which is crucial in avoiding crashes due to the speed hump. Overall, this study can further help in improving the adaptability of the advanced driver assistance systems and evidence-based policy making of speed hump placement to minimize road crashes.},

Despite the importance of security training and guidelines, it was surprising that many participants had not received them. A robust communication strategy is necessary to ensure that employees are informed and updated on security incidents that the organization encounters. In addition, there is an increased need to pay attention to the security-related attributes of employees, such as their behavior, awareness, and compliance.

For finger movements, the instantaneous energy and curvature of the gesture signals are extracted with Bézier curves. Meanwhile, the performer's familiarity with gestures is indicated by the movement fluency metric of sentences. In the assessment generator, the final assessment results are calculated by combining the weights of different quality metrics and the confidence of different gesture levels.

Participants mostly made up their minds in the first stage, and using the DSS typically lengthened the time to reach a decision.

  abstract     = {Present machine learning approaches to steer generative models rely on the availability of manual human input. We propose an alternative approach to supervising generative machine learning models by directly detecting task-relevant information from brain responses. That is, requiring humans only to perceive stimulus and react to it naturally. Brain responses of participants (N=30) were recorded via electroencephalography (EEG) while they perceived artificially generated images of faces and were instructed to look for a particular semantic feature, such as “smile” or “young”. A supervised adversarial autoencoder was trained to disentangle semantic image features by using EEG data as a supervision signal. The model was subsequently conditioned to generate images matching users' intentions without additional human input. The approach was evaluated in a validation study comparing brain-conditioned models to manually conditioned and randomly conditioned alternatives. Human assessors scored the saliency of images generated from different models according to the target visual features (e.g., which face image is more “smiling” or more “young”). The results show that brain-supervised models perform comparably to models trained with manually curated labels, without requiring any manual input from humans.},

  abstract     = {Measuring cognitive workload (CWL) is crucial for dynamic task reallocation (i.e., adaptation) between a human and a machine in a human-machine system (HMS). A conventional measurement of the CWL is based on subjectively reported scores about the six factors of the NASA Task Load Index (NASA-TLX) questionnaire. The questionnaire cannot however capture real-time fluctuations of the factors for an objective quantification. Additionally, each of the factors is associated with distinct activities and can be influenced by individual characteristics and/or task contexts. Such HMS adaptation should thus consider the objective quantification of each factor. So far, the quantification remains largely unexplored, while existing studies reveal a potential use of an electroencephalography (EEG) in measuring the CWL levels (e.g., high, medium, and low). Herein, we presented a pioneering study to propose EEG features for quantifying the factors. The pertinence of the features was demonstrated by their strong correlations with the scores of the factors across three distinct cases of visuomotor tasks. The pertinence is the stepping stone toward factor-based interventions in enabling HMS adaptation.},

  abstract     = {In brain–computer interface (BCI) applications, imagined speech (IMS) decoding based on electroencephalogram (EEG) has established a new neuro-paradigm that offers an intuitive communication tool for physically impaired patients. However, existing IMS–EEG-based BCI systems have introduced difficulties in feasible deployment due to nonstationary EEG signals, suboptimal feature extraction, and limited multiclass scalability. To address these challenges, we have presented a novel approach using the multivariate swarm-sparse decomposition method (MSSDM) for joint time–frequency (JTF) analysis and further developed a feasible end-to-end framework from multichannel IMS–EEG signals for IMS detection. MSSDM employs improved multivariate swarm filtering and sparse spectrum techniques to design optimal filter banks for extracting an ensemble of channel-aligned oscillatory components (CAOCs), significantly enhancing IMS activation-related sub-bands. To enhance channel-aligned information, multivariate JTF images have been constructed using JIF and instantaneous amplitude across channels from the obtained CAOCs. Further, JTF-based deep features (JTFDFs) were computed using different pretrained neural networks and mapped most discriminant features using two well-known feature correlation techniques: Canonical correlation analysis and Hellinger distance-based correlation. The proposed method has been tested on the 5-class BCI competition and 6-class Coretto IMS datasets. The experimental findings on cross-subject and cross-dataset reveal that the novel JTFDF feature-based classification model, MSSDM-SqueezeNet-JTFDF, achieved the highest classification performance against all other existing state-of-the-art methods in IMS recognition. Our introduced EEG–BCI models effectively enhance IMS–EEG patterns across multichannel data and offer great potential for the practical deployment of BCI technologies.},

It has been demonstrated that redundant actuation can improve the performance of mechatronic systems but introduce challenges with respect to control. One main difficulty is in establishing an accurate dynamic model of the RAPM system. With an inaccurate dynamic model, the torque applied by the actuators will be incorrect, leading to increased antagonistic forces in the system. To solve this problem, a novel coordinated adaptive impedance control approach based on a new adaptive impedance control law is presented here, along with proof of the stability of the closed-loop system. The control algorithm has been validated experimentally by a prototype cable-driven parallel manipulator. It can be seen from the experimental results that the proposed control method is an effective way to correct the antagonistic forces of the system, thus facilitating the improvement of its dynamic performance and its efficacy in different applications.},

Traditional game theory limits players to two choices, i.e., either cooperation or defection. However, player behavior in real-world scenarios is often multidimensional and complex; therefore, this work employs a continuous action iterated dilemma that allows players to choose a wider range of strategies. Moreover, traditional convergence analysis often relies on Jacobian matrices, which entail complex derivations. In contrast, the proposed strategy employs a time generator-based protocol that achieves agreement between all the players at a prescribed time, explicitly set by the user through a time parameter within the protocol. A comprehensive Lyapunov analysis affirms the prescribed time convergence even when the network is exposed to information loss during data transfer. Numerical simulations illustrate that the proposed scheme leads to a faster agreement at the preassigned time and with a better resilience performance compared to existing methods.},

To address challenges, such as obstructed views and limitations in camera placement in real-world scenarios, the CV method utilized video-derived coordinates from a selected set of landmarks. A 2-D pose estimator (HR-Net) detected landmark coordinates in each video frame, and a 3-D algorithm (VideoPose3D) estimated the depth of each 2-D landmark by analyzing its trajectories.

Then, the information granule can be constructed based on the time domain information, which completes complexity information. Together with the support vector machine algorithm, the proposed granulation method outperformed the existing classification methods in accuracy. It is utilized by classifying three motor imaginary EEG signals. Two of them are binary-class datasets, i.e., one dataset includes two-hand actions, and another includes hand and foot actions. The third dataset is multiclass, including two hands and two feet actions.

First, in the comprehensive lab for coal-related programs of Xi'an University of Science and Technology, the coal mine environment is simulated, and a realistic EEG dataset is constructed. Second, the multidomain features are extracted to represent abundant information in time, frequency, time-frequency, and space domain. These features with low dimension are classified adopting support vector machine (SVM), k-nearest neighbor (kNN), and back propagation (BP) network to obtain the optimal evaluation submodel (four domains corresponding to four submodels). Finally, based on the state probabilities provided by the optimal evaluation submodel, we adopt stack fusion and an improved Yager rule to fuse four submodels in order to find the most suitable fusion algorithm. The experimental results demonstrate that the average accuracy can reach 93.19% on the self-built dataset when utilizing the improved Yager rule with weight, and it realizes a better evaluation accuracy.},

To fill this gap, we assessed virtual presence, system usability, engagement, and ease of task completion, in subjects using two iterations of a VR application (controllers or hand tracking) designed to address the major limitations of current systems. Results revealed that both systems exceeded the benchmark usability score of 68. System 1 (controllers) performed better for interactions with the virtual tablet interface to answer questions, whereas interactions with the food objects were easier using System 2 (hand tracking). Participants also experienced a high sense of virtual presence using both systems. When measured in System 2, a high level of subject engagement during the immersive product evaluations was observed. These studies indicate that collecting both quantitative and qualitative feedback on VR systems can provide useful insights and directions for application optimization to ensure valid investigation of context effects in future research.},

  abstract     = {Neural or muscular injuries, such as due to amputation, spinal cord injury, and stroke, can affect hand functions, profoundly impacting independent living. This has motivated the advancement of cutting-edge assistive robotic hands. However, unintuitive myoelectric control of these devices remains challenging, which limits the clinical translation of these devices. Accordingly, we developed a robust motor-intent decoding approach to continuously predict the intended fingertip forces of single and multiple fingers in real time. We used population motor neuron discharge activities (i.e., neural drive from brain to spinal cord) decoded from a high-density surface electromyogram (HD-sEMG) signals as the control signals instead of the conventional global sEMG features. To enable real-time neural-drive prediction, we employed a convolutional neural network model to establish the mapping from global HD-sEMG features to finger-specific neural-drive signals, which were then employed for continuous and real-time control of three prosthetic fingers (index, middle, and ring). As a result, the neural-drive-based approach can decode the motor intent of single-finger and multifinger forces with significantly lower force estimation errors than that obtained using the global HD-sEMG-amplitude approach. Besides, the force prediction accuracy was consistent over time and demonstrated strong robustness to signal interference. Our network-based decoder can also achieve better finger isolation with minimal forces predicted in unintended fingers. Our work demonstrates that the accurate and robust finger force control could be achieved through this new decoding approach. The outcomes offer an efficient intent prediction approach that allows users to have intuitive control of prosthetic fingertip forces in a dexterous way.},

  abstract     = {Effective human–robot collaboration (HRC) requires robots to understand and adapt to humans' psychological states. This research presents a novel approach to quantitatively measure human comfort levels during HRC through the development of two metrics: a comfortability index (CI) and an uncomfortability index (UnCI). We conducted HRC experiments where participants performed assembly tasks while the robot's behavior was systematically varied. Participants' subjective responses (including surprise, anxiety, boredom, calmness, and comfortability ratings) were collected alongside physiological signals, including electrocardiogram, galvanic skin response, and pupillometry data. We propose two novel approaches for estimating CI/UnCI: an adaptation of the emotion circumplex model that maps comfort levels to the arousal–valence space, and a kernel density estimation model trained on physiological data. Time-domain features were extracted from the physiological signals and used to train machine learning models for real-time comfort levels estimation. Our results demonstrate that the proposed approaches can effectively estimate human comfort levels from physiological signals alone, with the circumplex model showing particular promise in detecting high discomfort states. This work enables real-time measurement of human comfort during HRC, providing a foundation for developing more adaptive and human-aware collaborative robots.},

  abstract     = {Recent years have witnessed a growing interest in Wi-Fi-based gesture recognition. However, existing works have predominantly focused on closed-set paradigms, where all testing gestures are predefined during training. This poses a significant challenge in real-world applications, as unseen gestures might be misclassified as known class during testing. To address this issue, we propose WiOpen, a robust Wi-Fi-based open-set gesture recognition (OSGR) framework. Implementing OSGR requires addressing challenges caused by the unique uncertainty in Wi-Fi sensing. This uncertainty, resulting from noise and domains, leads to widely scattered and irregular data distributions in collected Wi-Fi sensing data. Consequently, data ambiguity between classes and challenges in defining appropriate decision boundaries to identify unknowns arise. To tackle these challenges, WiOpen adopts a twofold approach to eliminate uncertainty and define precise decision boundaries. Initially, it addresses uncertainty induced by noise during data preprocessing by utilizing the channel state information (CSI) ratio. Next, it designs the OSGR network based on an uncertainty quantification method. Throughout the learning process, this network effectively mitigates uncertainty stemming from domains. Ultimately, the network leverages relationships among samples' neighbors to dynamically define open-set decision boundaries, successfully realizing OSGR. Comprehensive experiments on publicly accessible datasets confirm WiOpen's effectiveness.},

Traditional metrics such as Fréchet inception distance (FID) and kernel inception distance scores do not align closely with human evaluations. The proposed metric incorporates advanced transformer-based attention mechanisms to assess local similarity and maximum mean discrepancy to evaluate global distributional similarity. To evaluate the performance of GLIPS, we conducted a human study on photorealistic image quality. Comprehensive tests across various generative models demonstrate that GLIPS consistently outperforms existing metrics like FID, structural similarity index measure, and multiscale structural similarity index measure in terms of correlation with human scores. In addition, we introduce the interpolative binning scale, a refined scaling method that enhances the interpretability of metric scores by aligning them more closely with human evaluative standards. The proposed metric and scaling approach not only provide more reliable assessments of AI-generated images but also suggest pathways for future enhancements in image generation technologies.},

In this article, we propose a novel Vidura advisor design framework (VADF) to develop dialog system designs for information retrieval (IR) and question-answering (QA) tasks, while enabling the quantification of system utility based on human performance in diverse application environments. We adopt a socio-technical approach in our framework for designing dialog systems by utilizing domain expert feedback, which features a sparse retriever for enabling accurate responses in QA settings using linear interpolation smoothing. We apply our VADF for an exemplar science gateway, viz. KnowCOVID-19, to conduct experiments that demonstrate the utility of dialog systems based on IR and QA performance, application utility, and perceived adoption. Experimental results show our VADF approach significantly improves IR performance against retriever baselines (up to 5% increase) and QA performance against large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT (up to 43% increase) on scientific literature datasets. In addition, through a usability survey, we observe that measuring application utility and human performance when applying VADF to KnowCOVID-19 translates to an increase in perceived community adoption.},

However, the controlling of an upper limb exoskeleton for rehabilitation is a challenging task because of its nonlinear characteristics. This article presents a novel fuzzy adaptive controller that utilizes a high-dimensional integral-type Lyapunov function for a wearable assistive upper limb exoskeleton. A disturbance observer had been used to tackle uncertainties in the exoskeleton's dynamic model, thereby enhancing the tracking performance of the joints. The aim of this control scheme was to overcome unknown parameters in the dynamic model. The performance of the adaptive controller was validated through human interactive experiments and periodically repeated reference trajectory tests. The results demonstrated that the proposed fuzzy adaptive controller, with the inclusion of a disturbance observer, could effectively compensate for uncertain disturbances and could achieve efficient tracking of the reference trajectory. The statistical analysis revealed that the fuzzy adaptive controller performed 45%, 44%, and 31% less in average error compared to adaptive conventional controllers. The findings ascertained the potential of the proposed controller in improving the recovery of motor functions of hemiplegic patients.},

We determined that wearing exoskeletons reduced the biomechanical efforts of workers measured by joint kinematics and electromyography as well as the estimated shoulder joint reaction forces and torques derived from simulation. These quantitatively measured variables were statistically associated with subjective measures collected through satisfaction questionnaires. We specifically found that participants increased the shoulder flexion and abduction angles as well as the shoulder range of motion while wearing exoskeletons. Participants also reduced muscle activities, joint torques for shoulder flexion, and reaction forces exerted on the shoulder joints while wearing exoskeletons. Interestingly, our analysis also found that the increased shoulder movement while wearing the device was negatively associated with the satisfaction level. This indicates that although the assistance provided by the device allows users to perform a wider range of arm lifting movements, the deviation from their original movement with the device may lead to decreases in satisfaction levels. This integrative approach using biomechanics and ergonomics suggests that we can potentially predict the subjective scale of satisfaction based on biomechanical variables and preliminarily evaluate the usability and comfort while wearing exoskeletons in real-world settings.},

To prevent tube deformation in the Cartesian space due to the neglect of off-diagonal elements of covariance matrices, the refinement tube radii and nonlinear stiffness terms are computed in local coordinate systems based on the decomposed covariance matrix. An energy-tank-based passivity controller is designed to ensure system stability when employing the virtual fixture with state-dependent stiffness terms. In the validation tests with 18 participants, the proposed method showed improvements in task efficiency (18.69% increase) and collision avoidance (97.87% reduction) for a typical pick-and-place task with scattered materials. It also provided better subjective experiences of the users than traditional virtual fixtures. Meanwhile, compared with the method that neglects off-diagonal elements of the covariance matrix, the proposed method exhibited a 4.28% efficiency improvement and a 40.42% decrease in collision occurrences.},

  abstract     = {Human–machine shared control has recently been regarded as a promising paradigm to improve safety and performance in complex driving scenarios. One crucial task in shared control is dynamically optimizing the driving weights between the driver and the intelligent vehicle to adapt to dynamic driving scenarios. However, designing an optimal human–machine shared controller with guaranteed performance and stability is challenging due to nonnegligible time delays caused by communication protocols and uncertainties in driver behavior. This article proposes a novel receding-horizon reinforcement learning approach for time-delayed human–machine shared control of intelligent vehicles. First, we build a multikernel-based data-driven model of vehicle dynamics and driving behavior, considering time delays and uncertainties of drivers' actions. Second, a model-based receding horizon actor–critic learning algorithm is presented to learn an explicit policy for time-delayed human–machine shared control online. Unlike classic reinforcement learning, policy learning of the proposed approach is performed according to a receding-horizon strategy to enhance learning efficiency and adaptability. In theory, the closed-loop stability under time delays is analyzed. Hardware-in-the-loop experiments on the time-delayed human–machine shared control of intelligent vehicles have been conducted in variable curvature road scenarios. The results demonstrate that our approach has significant improvements in driving performance and driver workload compared with pure manual driving and previous shared control methods.},

This method could be used in the realm of brain disorders, particularly autism spectrum disorder (ASD), to facilitate prompt identification. We propose a novel radiomic features [deep radiomic features (DTF)], involving the use of principal component analysis to encode convolutional neural network (CNN) features, thereby capturing distinctive features related to brain regions in subjects with ASD subjects and their age. Using these features in random forest (RF) models, we explore two scenarios, such as site-specific radiomic analysis and feature extraction from unaffected brain regions to alleviate site-related variations. Our experiments involved comparing the proposed method with standard radiomics (SR) and 2-D/3-D CNNs for the classification of ASD versus healthy control (HC) individuals and different age groups (below median and above median). When using the RF model with DTF, the analysis at individual sites revealed an area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) range of 79%–85% for features, such as the left lateral-ventricle, cerebellum-white-matter, and pallidum, as well as the right choroid-plexus and vessel. In the context of fivefold cross validation with the RF model, the combined features (DTF from 3-D CNN, ResNet50, DarketNet53, and NasNet_large with SR) achieved the highest AUC value of 76.67%. Furthermore, our method also showed notable AUC values for predicting age in subjects with ASD (80.91%) and HC (75.64%).

  abstract     = {Recognizing interactive actions, including hand-to-hand interaction and human-to-human interaction, has attracted increasing attention for various applications in the field of video analysis and human–robot interaction. Considering the success of graph convolution in modeling topology-aware features from skeleton data, recent methods commonly operate graph convolution on separate entities and use late fusion for interactive action recognition, which can barely model the mutual semantic relationships between pairwise entities. To this end, we propose a mutual excitation graph convolutional network (me-GCN) by stacking mutual excitation graph convolution (me-GC) layers. Specifically, me-GC uses a mutual topology excitation module to firstly extract adjacency matrices from individual entities and then adaptively model the mutual constraints between them. Moreover, me-GC extends the above idea and further uses a mutual feature excitation module to extract and merge deep features from pairwise entities. Compared with graph convolution, our proposed me-GC gradually learns mutual information in each layer and each stage of graph convolution operations.

  abstract     = {Ecological environment and natural resource issues are becoming more and more prominent, which promotes the recycling of waste products for green economy. Disassembly plays a key role in the remanufacturing and reuse of waste products. However, with the rapid development of production automation, designers tend to ignore the fact that manual operation is more flexible. It is of great importance to consider human factors in a disassembly process. This work considers two human disassembly postures, namely standing and sitting. The multiobjective disassembly line balancing problem considering human posture changes is studied. A mathematical model with the objective functions of maximizing profit, minimizing the number of posture changes at a workstation, and minimizing the difference of maximum posture changes between any two workstations is established. The model is solved through a newly proposed Pareto-based discrete harmony search algorithm. Three neighborhood structures are designed to enlarge the search space for better solutions. Furthermore, an elite reserve strategy is used to improve the global optimization ability of the proposed algorithm. Finally, the proposed model and algorithm are applied to cases of different scales of complexities, and the effectiveness of the proposed model and algorithm is verified in comparison with four competitive algorithms.},

Recent research shows that one remote air traffic control officer can safely control up to three low-traffic airports simultaneously. In a multiple remote tower center, airports can be flexibly allocated across air traffic control officers based on prospective traffic loads. The main task of the supervisor in such a center is balancing the workload of each air traffic control officer by allocating airports accordingly. This study analyzes the supervisor's visual attention during interaction with a planning tool for their daily tasks. Five use cases were identified as the main tasks of the supervisor representing a mixture of planned and unplanned events. A mixed methods within-subjects design was used to assess the workload and eye-movement patterns associated with each of these use cases. In total, 15 professional air traffic control officers participated in the study. Workload and eye movement were analyzed independently in relation to the use cases but also in combination with each other. Across all use cases, a small correlation between subjective workload ratings and fixation duration was found, supporting previous findings of fixation duration being associated with information processing. Transitions between areas of interest on the supervisor planning tool provided valuable insights into the layout design of future supervisor planning tools.},

  abstract     = {This article proposes a shared control system model between the human pilot and autopilot for the special issue of carrier-based aircraft landing task. A key point of the shared and cooperative control is that the decision-sharing system depends on the longitudinal safety boundaries for manual/automatic landing. Two strategies of the human pilot are adopted, including capture strategy and tracking strategy. A hidden model tracking control method is utilized to model the autopilot. To address the issue of frequent switching between the human pilot and autopilot caused by relying solely on safety boundaries to allocate control authority, fuzzy control theory is introduced to reduce the workload of the human pilot. The time-domain simulation results show that considering the fuzzy control, the frequency of switching and the flight states have been improved compared with the results without fuzzy control. Nonlinear pilot-induced oscillation metric evaluation results show that the human-automation shared and cooperative control considering the fuzzy control can alleviate the workload of the human pilot. The shared and cooperative control system model has certain significance in ensuring the safety of carrier-based aircraft landing.},

Two similar sets of springs (each set having three springs with graded rigidness) were customized to increase the handle-resistance. The springs were experimentally calibrated to determine individual spring-constant value. The amount of exerted force values during joystick movements were standardized in a cohort of healthy subjects (n = 15). Coefficient of variation (CV) was calculated to determine the variability among healthy subjects. Further, five (n = 5) patients with stroke were enrolled in this pilot study and performed three separate virtual reality sessions using different springs. Task-performance metrics, i.e., time to complete, trajectory smoothness, and relative error, were evaluated for each of the levels. The values of spring-constants as determined experimentally were found to be 1.34 × 103 ± 16.1, 2.23 × 103 ± 29.8, and 6.47 × 103 ± 470.9 N/m for springs with increased rigidity, respectively. The mean force values for different joystick movements were observed to be increasing linearly with increasing spring-rigidity. The calculated CV ≤ 14% indicated the variability in the recorded force values of healthy subjects. Increased task-performance metrics and visual analog scale-fatigue scores for session 2 and 3 as compared to session1, indicated increasing task difficulty at session 2 and 3.},

This is especially important in the early stages of an athlete's career. The present study is based on a follow-up survey consisting of 117 female football players ranging from 10 and 20 years old, making it one of the first studies amongst this age group. A low-cost electronic performance and tracking system was developed to gather data on the players. During the training sessions, objective data (position, distances, etc.) and subjective parameters were collected using forms based on the rate of perceived exertion. This article deals with the evolution of the player's performance from both a physical and mental point of view. An emotional evaluation, based on well-being forms, is carried out and its possible influence on training. Finally, analysis is conducted on the level of health risk. It was found that the performance of female footballers improves with age and in competition-like situations. It has also been concluded that sporting activity leads to healthy lifestyle habits, which translates into a lower risk to their health.},

  abstract     = {Co-representation, which co-represents samples and features, has been widely used in various machine learning tasks, such as document clustering, gene expression analysis, and recommendation systems. It not only reveals the cluster structure of both samples and features, but also reveals the sample–feature correlation. Given a tabular data matrix, co-representation usually exhibits as the co-occurrence structures of rows and columns. However, identifying such structured patterns in complex real-world data can be very challenging. To address this problem, we propose an unsupervised discriminative co-representation learning model based on multidimensional scaling (DCLMDS). The main novelty is that DCLMDS introduces a co-representation learning term to ensure the discriminability between co-occurrence structures. As a result, the co-representation learned by DCLMDS contains richer information of the underlying correlation between samples and features within data. This could subsequently enhance the capacity of machines and systems for processing complex real-world information more proficiently. Furthermore, inspired by the fuzzy set theory, we integrate fuzzy membership degree that can accurately capture the uncertainty within data, thus enabling DCLMDS to learn a more effective co-representation in a soft manner. To evaluate the performance of DCLMDS, we conduct extensive experiments on 18 datasets, and the results demonstrate that DCLMDS can generate both accurate and discriminative co-representation, which well meets our desired outcomes.},

  abstract     = {Recent literature suggests that the surface electromyography (sEMG) signals have nonstationary statistical characteristics, specifically due to the random nature of the covariance. Thus, the suitability of a statistical model for sEMG signals is determined by the choice of an appropriate model for describing the covariance. The purpose of this study is to propose a compound-Gaussian (CG) model for multivariate sEMG signals in which the latent variable of covariance is modeled as a random variable that follows an exponential model. The parameters of the model are estimated using the iterative expectation maximization (EM) algorithm. Further, a new dataset, electromyography analysis of human activities database 2 (EMAHA-DB2), is developed. The proposed model is evaluated through both qualitative and quantitative methods. Based on the model fitting analysis on the sEMG signals from EMAHA-DB2, it is found that the proposed CG model fits more closely to the empirical pdf of sEMG signals than the existing models. In addition, statistical analyses are carried out among the models and estimated parameters under different scenarios. The estimate of the exponential model's rate parameter exhibits a clear relationship with training weights, potentially correlating with underlying motor unit activity. Finally, the average signal power estimates of the channels show distinctive dependency on the training weights, the subject's training experience, and the type of activity.},

  abstract     = {The research on human-following robot is important for practical applications. It is a hot field of human–machine technology. This article proposes an adaptive recurrent proportional integral differential (PID) control algorithm with self-tuning filter based on vision to address the issue of insufficient recognition accuracy of specific following targets in the presence of occlusion, multiple people, or deformation. It also aims to further improve the control accuracy and immunity of a human-following robot. First, a depth camera-based red green blue (RGB) picture and a depth image are acquired. The person reidentification algorithm and the YOLOv8 algorithm are used to detect and track the targets. The spatial position information of the targets is calculated by the depth image. Additionally, the orientation proportional differential (PD) controller and the speed proportional integral (PI) controller are built. Its foundation is the discrepancy between the relative posture of the user and the robot. In order to minimize sensor data fluctuations and lessen the negative impacts of relative positional instability, a self-tuning filter is developed. To remember the relative postures between the robot and the user in the history window, an adaptive recurrent mechanism is suggested. The controller has the ability to output the control quantity in an adaptive manner based on the current system state. Finally, experiments are conducted to verify the reliability of the proposed method. The experimental findings demonstrate that the visual pedestrian tracking algorithm proposed in this article is highly adaptable. Compared to the traditional PID, fractional-order PID, and virtual spring model, our method demonstrates significant enhancements, reducing the average distance error by 64.29%, 57.14%, and 60.52% in steering scenarios, and by 42.86%, 40.00%, and 40.00% in straight-ahead scenarios, respectively.},

When humans supervise robots, their accountability increases, especially when robot behavior deviates from expectations. To address this, robots may choose a highly constrained plan when monitored and a more optimal one when unobserved. While this behavior is not driven by human-like motives, it stems from robots accommodating diverse supervisors. To optimize monitoring costs while ensuring safety, we model this interaction in a trust-based game-theoretic framework. However, pure-strategy Nash equilibrium often fails to exist in this model. To address this, we introduce the concept of a trust boundary within the mixed strategy space, aiding in the discovery of optimal monitoring strategies. Human studies demonstrate the necessity of optimal strategies and the benefits of our suggested approaches.},

The operators' performances are evaluated through the scores of a self-reported questionnaire (i.e., subjective measurement) and the results of a deep learning-based cognitive workload prediction algorithm that uses physiological and behavioral data (i.e., objective measurement). To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed controller, we conduct an exploratory user experiment with various allocation strategies. The user experiment uses a multihuman multirobot CCTV monitoring task as an example and carry out comprehensive real-world experiments with 32 human subjects for both quantitative measurement and qualitative analysis. Our results demonstrate the performance and effectiveness of the proposed controller and highlight the importance of incorporating both subjective and objective measurements of the operators' cognitive workload as well as seeking consent for workload transitions, to enhance the performance of multihuman multirobot teams.},

For this, the selected three-compartment controller fatigue model including a resting recovery parameter was adapted to a dynamic walking task scenario, incorporating a torque–velocity–angle dependency to quantify muscle activity. The model parameters were experimentally verified in a study with six healthy subjects, demonstrating accurate prediction of maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) decline with an average mean absolute error of 4.9%MVC. Subsequently, an HiL control mechanism was developed, utilizing ratings of perceived fatigue and state of fatigue values as reference metrics. The presented control approach effectively regulates fatigue levels within a 0%MVC–6%MVC steady-state error range during simulations. Experimental validation confirmed this performance, however, with partly higher steady-state errors mainly due to the restrictions of the exoskeleton's assistance. This preliminary study provides a promising foundation for future research, demonstrating the potential to manage fatigue effectively in exoskeleton users, offering an improved, personalized experience.},

In this study, we introduced pseudorandom catch trials (errors) in 1.68% of all strides, where an expected exoskeleton torque was not applied for a single stride, to understand the immediate and time-dependent responses to missed actuations. Participants (N = 15) completed a targeted stepping task while walking with a bilateral powered ankle exoskeleton. Human-exoskeleton fluency and trust were inferred from task performance (step accuracy), step characteristics (step length and width), muscle activity, and lower limb joint kinematics. Reductions in ankle plantarflexion during catch trials suggest user adaptation to the exoskeleton. Hip flexion and muscle activity were modulated to mitigate effects of the loss of exoskeleton torque and reduced plantarflexion during catch trials to support task accuracy and maintain step characteristics. Trust was not impacted by this level of error, as there were no significant differences in task performance or gait characteristics over time. Understanding the interactions between human-exoskeleton fluency, task accuracy, and gait strategies will support exoskeleton controller development. Future work will investigate various levels of actuation reliability to understand the transition where performance and trust are affected.},
