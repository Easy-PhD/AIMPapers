  abstract     = {Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved impressive progress in decision-making and task automation for intelligent agents. However, multiple agents must cooperate to complete tasks in complex real-world applications, such as auto-annotating in autonomous driving. The primary challenges lie in how multiple agents effectively communicate and collaborate in a multi-modal environment and how to automatically refine annotating results to reduce human intervention. These challenges also hinder LLMs from fully evolving into embodied intelligent agents. Driven by these motivations, we propose ALGPT, a multi-agent cooperative framework for open-vocabulary multi-modal auto-annotation in autonomous driving. ALGPT dynamically assembles agent teams with different roles, and agents cooperate to complete annotation tasks according to requirements. By leveraging Chain of Thought (CoT) and In-Context Learning (ICL) techniques, ALGPT's reasoning capabilities are enhanced, allowing it to develop suitable plans autonomously without human intervention. Furthermore, drawing from project management standards, we introduce project management documents and Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs), which further align ALGPT's behavior with human expectations and mitigate the impact of GPT illusions caused by the cascading effects of multiple GPTs.},

  abstract     = {Automated driving has the potential to revolutionize personal, public, and freight mobility. Beside accurately perceiving the environment, automated vehicles must plan a safe, comfortable, and efficient motion trajectory. To promote safety and progress, many works rely on modules that predict the future motion of surrounding traffic. Modular automated driving systems commonly handle prediction and planning as sequential, separate tasks. While this accounts for the influence of surrounding traffic on the ego vehicle, it fails to anticipate the reactions of traffic participants to the ego vehicle's behavior. Recent methods increasingly integrate prediction and planning in a joint or interdependent step to model bidirectional interactions. To date, a comprehensive overview of different integration principles is lacking. We systematically review state-of-the-art deep learning-based planning systems, and focus on how they integrate prediction. Different facets of the integration ranging from system architecture to high-level behavioral aspects are considered and related to each other. Moreover, we discuss the implications, strengths, and limitations of different integration principles. By pointing out research gaps, describing relevant future challenges, and highlighting trends in the research field, we identify promising directions for future research.},

Firstly, for this kind of discrete-time MAS, a novel system transformation, which can not only solve the noncausal problem that exists in the backstepping method but also reduce the computational complexity, is proposed. Secondly, the algebraic-loop problem inherent in the conventional controller design is solved by compensating the dynamics and using the property of neural network (NN). Thirdly, the multi-gradient recursive (MGR) RL scheme is developed for the sake of designing the optimal controller. Finally, the stability analysis is presented, and all signals are ensured to be semi-global uniformly ultimately bounded (SGUUB) in the Lyapunov's sense. Besides, this scheme is applied to the MMV which can be described in the non-strict feedback form to extend the application of the designed controller.

  abstract     = {Velocity of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) plays a significant role in the energy consumption of these vehicles, as well as their other capabilities, such as localization, maneuverability, and time to complete assigned missions. In this paper, for the first time, an online energy management strategy (EMS) is proposed for AUVs, which enables approaching the target in minimum time by adjusting the sub-optimal speed according to the amount of available energy. In this model-based energy management system, a framework is proposed that its output is the highest forward speed, so that the mission duration is minimized and the stored battery energy is used in the best possible way. In this field, existing efforts are mostly focused on reducing energy consumption, without considering other vehicle capabilities, but this method tries to reduce this gap. First, the architecture of an AUV propulsion is described and modeled, and a nonlinear equation is derived to generate the sub-optimal speed, which simultaneously minimize the amount of energy consumption and the time to reach the target. Then, for online implementation of this algorithm, a framework is proposed that generates the desired speed by using the battery state of charge (SOC), the voltage and the instantaneous Distance to destination. Illustrative simulation examples were conducted in MATLAB/Simulink to demonstrate the validity of the proposed scheme and the hardware in the loop test is conducted to evaluate the computational complexity of algorithm. Finally, experimental results showed the practical effectiveness of the proposed EMS.},

The conventional inspection conducted by the skilled workers is highly expensive, time consuming and may cause the safety and heath problem. Nowadays, the emerging unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) based techniques make it possible to replace human to do the periodical inspection in these environments. However, how to obtain the reliable, high accuracy and precise position information of the UAV becomes a challenging issue, as the GPS is unable to provide the accurate position information in these environments. In order to resolve this problem, an adaptive square-root cubature Kalman filter (ASRCKF) based low cost UAV positioning system is designed. Through the combination of the inertial measurement unit (IMU), ultra-wideband (UWB), the cubature rule, the adaptively estimated noise model and weighting factors, the potential degradation and oscillation for the system performance which caused by the linearisation process, the variation of the measurement noise and the manually adjusted noise model are solved. Finally, the 0.081m median localisation error, 0.172m 95$^{th}$ percentile localisation error and 0.045m average standard deviation (STD) can be attained, which can support the UAV to achieve the autonomous inspection in dark and GPS-denied environments.},

The goal is to improve collaborative operational efficiency for UAVs and UGVs engaged in reconnaissance, combat, relay, suicide, and electronic warfare tasks. The proposed approach validates through scenarios like urban search and rescue, counterterrorism, and disaster management. AD-GNN dynamically adjusts its depth based on scenario complexity, while biomimetic algorithms optimize task allocation by emulating natural processes. Existing methods often focus on static task allocation or separate enhancement of UAV and UGV capabilities, lacking adaptability and efficiency in unpredictable urban settings. The AD-GNN model addresses these limitations by adjusting its complexity in real-time, optimizing decision-making for task allocation. The integration of biomimetic algorithms enhances robustness and flexibility, adapting to changing operational demands. Simulations using real-world geographic information system (GIS) data in extensive urban settings demonstrate significant improvements in task allocation efficiency. UAVs and UGVs achieve operational efficiencies above 85% in search and rescue operations and 90–95% in disaster management scenarios after optimization. These results highlight the model's capability to manage and allocate tasks efficiently in dynamic and unpredictable urban environments. In conclusion, this paper contributes to autonomous systems by offering an innovative solution for DTA in urban settings, showcasing the potential of integrating advanced graph neural networks with biomimetic principles to enhance UAV and UGV fleet operations in complex environments.},

This approach enhances both the levitation stability and anti-interference capability of the maglev car system. Initially, a four-wheel dynamic model is established. The RBF neural network is then introduced to observe and mitigate disturbances caused by the temperature rise. An RBF-SMC control strategy is designed to improve the system's static levitation stability. The effectiveness of this control strategy is evaluated through simulations and experiments under various operating conditions. The research results indicate that, compared to the traditional PID control strategy, the proposed method reduces tracking error by 75.2%, compensates for the levitation force attenuation caused by the eddy current temperature rise of the conductive plate, and suppresses disturbances.},

  abstract     = {Owing to rapid developments in driverless technologies, vision tasks for unmanned vehicles have gained considerable attention, particularly in multimodal-based urban scene parsing. Although deep-learning algorithms have outperformed traditional models in such tasks, they cannot operate on mobile devices and edge networks owing to the coarse-grained cross-modal complementary information alignment, inadequate modeling of semantic-category relations, overabundance of parameters, and high computational complexity. To address these issues, a multilayer guided semantic graph network via knowledge distillation (MGSGNet-S*) is proposed for red-green-blue-thermal urban scene parsing. First, a new cross-modal adaptive fusion module adjusts pixel-level adaptive modal complementary information by incorporating additional deep modal information and residual cross-modal matrix fine-grained attention. Second, a novel semantic graph module overcomes the misclassification problems of objects of the same semantic class during low-level encoding by incorporating high-level information in the Euclidean space and modeling semantic graph relationships in the non-Euclidean space. Finally, to strike the balance between accuracy and efficiency, a tailored framework optimally utilizes effective knowledge of pixel intra- and inter-class similarity, fusion features, and cross-modal correlation. Experimental results indicate that MGSGNet-S* considerably outperforms relevant state-of-the-art methods with fewer parameters and lower computational costs. The numbers of parameters and floating-point operations were reduced by 95.69% and 93.34%, respectively, relative to those for the teacher model, thus demonstrating stronger inferencing capabilities at 28.65 frames per second.},

  abstract     = {LiDAR-camera extrinsic calibration (LCEC) is crucial for data fusion in intelligent vehicles. Offline, target-based approaches have long been the preferred choice in this field. However, they often demonstrate poor adaptability to real-world environments. This is largely because extrinsic parameters may change significantly due to moderate shocks or during extended operations in environments with vibrations. In contrast, online, target-free approaches provide greater adaptability yet typically lack robustness, primarily due to the challenges in cross-modal feature matching. Therefore, in this article, we unleash the full potential of large vision models (LVMs), which are emerging as a significant trend in the fields of computer vision and robotics, especially for embodied artificial intelligence, to achieve robust and accurate online, target-free LCEC across a variety of challenging scenarios. Our main contributions are threefold: we introduce a novel framework known as MIAS-LCEC, provide an open-source versatile calibration toolbox with an interactive visualization interface, and publish three real-world datasets captured from various indoor and outdoor environments. The cornerstone of our framework and toolbox is the cross-modal mask matching (C3M) algorithm, developed based on a state-of-the-art (SoTA) LVM and capable of generating sufficient and reliable matches. Extensive experiments conducted on these real-world datasets demonstrate the robustness of our approach and its superior performance compared to SoTA methods, particularly for the solid-state LiDARs with super-wide fields of view. Our toolbox and datasets are publicly available at https://mias.group/MIAS-LCEC.},

It examines the scenario where DoS attacks obstruct communication between neighboring agents. A novel neighbor output prediction strategy is introduced to mitigate the impact of DoS attacks. Upon detecting a DoS attack, subsystems affected by the compromised channel predict the output sequences of their upstream counterparts, updating these predictions at each time step based on receiver buffer contents and attack duration. Subsequently, a cost function incorporating the predicted output sequences and a terminal constraint tailored to DoS conditions is formulated to maintain system stability during attacks. The analysis thoroughly explores recursive feasibility and input-to-state practical stability (ISpS). Comparative tests underscore the proposed SDMPC algorithm's effectiveness and enhanced security in maintaining stability amid DoS attacks.},

Our objective was to evaluate error rates, physiological responses, and subjective workload across these control modalities. The results revealed that distraction significantly increases error rates and perceived workload across all models. Voice control exhibited the lowest error rates without distraction but was most affected by it, whereas Hand Gesture control showed the highest error rates and workload in both scenarios. Physical Button control demonstrated moderate error rates and the least impact from distraction. Physiological data supported these findings, with significant increases in heart rate under distraction for all models, particularly in the voice control model. The NASA Task Load Index scores indicated higher workload under distraction, with hand gesture control being the most demanding. Our findings suggest that a combination of Physical Button and Voice control may offer the most effective solution, with recommendations for adaptive and multimodal interaction designs to mitigate distraction effects and enhance overall user satisfaction.},

Based on the Lagrangian modeling method, a 6-DoF dynamical model of the pendulum drone is established. The strong coupling and under-actuated nature of the model pose significant control challenges. Controllers suitable for such system are proposed to stabilize the fully-actuated part and the two under-actuated parts of the dynamics, respectively. A theoretical stability analysis of the closed-loop dynamics is presented. Finally, in the simulation examples under static reference, dynamic reference, impulse disturbance and model uncertainties, the effectiveness of the proposed controller is verified, and its superior performance is demonstrated in comparative simulations.},

  abstract     = {Autonomous modular buses (AMB) are considered a promising solution to the challenges in public transportation, as they can reduce commute times, enhance transfer convenience, and address supply-demand imbalances in transportation systems. Nonetheless, current research mainly focuses on operational aspects, whereas the high precision required for in-transit docking remains a critical challenge for implementation. The accuracy of current autonomous driving perception systems is often limited due to errors introduced by multi-sensor fusion methods. To address this issue, this paper introduces an attention-based ensemble learning fusion method (AEfusion) which includes a supervision module that utilizes the more accurate depth information from LiDAR to guide the generation of image depth information. Additionally, the fusion module incorporates two enhanced channel attention blocks and a spatial attention block to strengthen feature learning and integration. Experiments on both the nuScenes dataset and a self-collected dataset demonstrate that our method is suited for full-range docking perception in AMBs and is superior to the existing approaches.},

To enhance forecasting accuracy, existing deep learning models often feature complex structures with large computational demands for deployment. To achieve seamless traffic system operations and prompt communication between vehicles and roadway infrastructure, the best solution is to deploy models on locally operating edge devices, which are limited in hardware resources. In this realm, we consider both efficiency and effectiveness in this paper with our newly proposed Lightweight Forecasting (LightCast) model. Specifically, we first design Spatio-temporal Global-local Former (STGLFormer) that introduces various self-attention mechanisms comprehensively considering both global and local spatio-temporal information in traffic data to offer state-of-the-art (SOTA) forecasting accuracy. Furthermore, LightCast involves a mix-granularity pruning strategy to remove redundant components in STGLFormer at different granularities and an automated layer-matching distillation scheme to effectively restore the forecasting accuracy after pruning. The automated layer-matching distillation scheme resolves the issues of layer mismatching in the traditional feature distillation approach. Extensive experiments conducted on four real-world public transportation datasets demonstrate that our approach can achieve near SOTA performance at a much higher computation efficiency.},

Furthermore, the widespread adoption of GPS-enabled devices over the last few decades has opened up exciting possibilities, particularly in the realm of data analysis, where motorcycle GPS data has emerged as a valuable resource for various applications. This article presents a novel methodology for estimating the travel duration of powered two-wheelers (PTWs) in heterogeneous traffic using GPS data generated by motorcycles on urban road networks. The proposed methodology has the potential to offer valuable insights into the behavior of PTWs in heterogeneous traffic environments. By analyzing Big Data generated by GPS-based trajectory data, researchers can identify areas with high motorcycle density and pinpoint potential bottlenecks that impact travel times. Temporal data storing with bearing information in hexagonal shards called “bubbles” enables researchers to utilize Big Data more efficiently. Spatial transformation, Kalman filtering, and map-matching of the trajectory data significantly enhance the quality of the data. In this study, the 10-minute interval is performed as optimal for estimating travel time with 4.3% MAPE. Furthermore, combining historical bubble data with a 0.35 scale factor improves MAPE by 9.6%. Despite the limitations, not only is the transferability of this methodology noteworthy, but it is also opening the door to broader applications in diverse urban settings.},

Secondly, a double-layer event-triggered platoon control design framework is proposed for the considered CAV platoon. In the upper-layer, an event-triggered platoon controller is designed to generate desired platoon trajectory for CAV. A compensation signal is properly defined such that the platoon controller allows the spacing policy of the CAVs switching among constant spacing, constant time-headway, and variable time-headway policies. In the lower-layer, an adaptive neural network sliding-mode controller is developed to force the CAVs to track desired trajectory. An event-triggering condition that made up of data transmission error and vehicle consensus error is designed to determine data transmission sequence, such that a balance can be achieved between data transmission and platoon control performance. Finally, theoretical analysis is presented to illustrate CAV state stability and platoon string stability, and simulation studies are carried out to further demonstrate feasibility and effectiveness of the scheme.},

  abstract     = {Communication plays a role in multi-UAV to perform formation tracking missions. In complex environments, UAV communication is often subject to jamming attacks, affecting the formation process. Therefore, studying the formation tracking control problem in jamming attacks is of great significance. Typically, the actions of the UAV consist of two fundamental modules: mobility strategy and communication strategy. In this paper, we design an anti-jamming attack mixed strategy for formation tracking control of the multi-UAV system. In practical scenarios, multi-UAV systems not only require the accomplishment of formation maneuvers but also necessitate effective mitigation of jamming attacks caused by other UAVs. Therefore, we suppose there are three types of UAVs: leaders, followers, and jammers. To illustrate the interactions between multiple UAVs of the formation tracking process under jamming attack, a three-layer Stackelberg game is constructed. Leaders and followers need to resist interference from jammers during the formation tracking process with a leader-follower structure. Leaders and followers achieve formation tracking through cooperation. The interactions between jammers and the other UAVs form a non-cooperative game. Moreover, the utility functions of a mixed strategy, which contain mobility and communication strategies, are designed for the three-layer Stackelberg game. The Stackelberg-Nash equilibrium of the designed game model is proven to exist. For seeking the Stackelberg-Nash equilibrium, a tri-level actor-critic (Tri-AC) reinforcement learning algorithm is designed. The convergence of the designed algorithm is also proved theoretically. Finally, the effectiveness of the designed method is verified by various simulation experiments.},

Specifically, one group of UAVs is employed to support AGVs in data transmission, while another group of UAVs equipped with computational resources, functions as aerial base stations (ABSs) for receiving and processing the collected data. Following this, we explore the collaborative deployment between AGVs and UAVs, and propose a highly efficient, low-interference, and energy-efficient uplink data transmission framework based on distributed collaborative beamforming. Correspondingly, we formulate a high-performance and low-interference transmission multi-objective optimization problem (HLTMOP) to reduce the transmission time and operation energy consumption of the AGVs and UAVs, while minimizing the total sidelobe levels toward the directions of all non-current receiving ABSs. Due to the NP-hardness of the HLTMOP, we propose a swarm intelligence algorithm, namely, improved multi-objective ant lion optimization (IMOALO), with three improved operators. Simulation results show that the proposed IMOALO algorithm performs better and can generate more excellent solutions than other benchmark algorithms.},

However, compared to the current studies focusing on the single video-based trajectory extraction, the long-distance trajectory extracted from multiple aerial videos still suffer from trajectory unrealistic and discontinuity problems. Existing long-distance trajectory construction method can be categorized into two classes: trajectory-based and video-based methods. The former significantly changes the original trajectory data, leading to trajectory distortion and cannot restore vehicle travel videos with corresponding trajectories, thus falling short of meeting research demands in traffic filed. The trajectory data extracted by the latter approach still exhibit noticeable discontinuity at videos stitching area, leading to the biases of vehicle motion parameters, which further cause the errors of studies such as vehicle model calibration and safety evaluation. Therefore, this study introduces a novel long-distance trajectory construction method which can extract long-distance trajectories from multiple aerial videos and mitigate the discontinuity problem in video stitching area. The proposed method contains four modules which are multi-video registration, vehicle detection and tracking, long-distance trajectory connection and fusion, trajectory smoothing and parameters extraction. Experimental results show that the proposed method can obtain more continuous motion parameters in spatiotemporal distribution, and have more advantages in traffic-related studies.

A relaxed barrier function (RBF) is designed as a penalty term in the cost function to replace the inequality constraints, thus achieving constraints on the system state. By resorting to neural network (NN) approximation of the nonlinear dynamics, an optimal control framework is established via the dual method, combined with the Lagrange multipliers on the RBF. Within this framework, the Lagrangian multipliers are employed to balance the optimisation of control performance and state constraints. The convergence of value iteration algorithms is revealed through rigorously mathematical analysis. Furthermore, by using the Lyapunov stability theory, the desired observer gain is calculated via a set of matrix inequalities, and sufficient conditions for the relevant parameters and learning rates are derived such that the weight estimation errors of both the observer's NNs and the actor-critic NNs are ultimately bounded. Finally, simulations of both vessel systems and numerical examples are used to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {Early and accurate hazard detection is crucial for enhancing the safety of automated driving systems (ADS) by allowing them to anticipate and react to imminent accidents. While current research focuses on classifying safe and hazardous scenes, simply identifying a hazard class does not provide sufficient information for an appropriate response. This gap underscores the need for an effective language model to describe hazards and enable downstream ADS planning of evasive manoeuvres. Such a model could also be integrated into a warning system for human-driven vehicles and assist developers and regulators in interpreting system responses. Motivated by this need, we propose HazardVLM, a novel video language model designed for real-time hazard description. Conventional approaches leverage generic large language models but are computationally expensive and known to generate inconsistent and inaccurate information in specific tasks. To this end, HazardVLM is a task-specific small language model which reduces complexity through 1) a lightweight encoder-decoder architecture, 2) a custom tokenizer with only relevant vocabulary to create a task-specific problem space and 3) adaptive sampling using optical flow to reduce the complexity of video analysis. To evaluate HazardVLM, we introduce a new dataset of over 7,901 real-world road collision scenes with detailed descriptions. Our extensive evaluation demonstrates that HazardVLM outperforms state-of-the-art models (SOTA) by 9.59% in hazard description accuracy, achieving a BLEU-4 score of 0.714 and reducing the critical false negative rate (missed hazards) by 26.9% compared to the SOTA.},

  abstract     = {Efficient monitoring and early warning of hazards on transmission lines are crucial for the safety of both the lines themselves and the surrounding personnel. Among them, real-time distance monitoring of construction machinery and other vehicles approaching power lines is an effective and cost-efficient method of hazard detection. This paper proposes a novel architecture named D-LDRNet for all-weather distance monitoring based on monocular vision, which can obtain three-dimensional information of hazardous objects using only a monocular camera. Firstly, an innovative feature extraction network is constructed to reduce redundant convolutional calculations and parameters, coupled with new upsampling operators and optimized detection head networks using Involution. Then, an improved low-light enhancement network is introduced to enhance the recognition performance of the detection model in nighttime scenarios. Finally, leveraging the pose matching relationship between images and point clouds, a ranging module for hazardous objects is designed and integrated into the constructed hazard detector. Experimental results conducted on surveillance images from different transmission line scenarios demonstrate that D-LDRNet not only possesses a more lightweight network structure but also exhibits optimal hazard detection performance in nighttime construction scenes. Experiments conducted on surveillance videos further confirm the effectiveness of the proposed ranging scheme and its industrial application significance.},

To counteract malicious attacks, a network recovery mechanism is implemented to repair the spanning tree destroyed by DoS attacks. Switching topologies containing the spanning-tree-retained cases and the spanning-tree-destroyed cases are utilized to depict cyber states during DoS attacks and recovery mechanism. To reduce data transmission in V2V (vehicle-to-vehicle) communication, based on the switching topology model, the event-triggered mechanism (ETM) is further implemented to schedule the information transmission over the Vehicle Ad Hoc Network (VANET) effectively. In the absence of disturbances and leader inputs, the sufficient conditions are derived for CVSs employing the event-triggered V2V communication to achieve internal stability under DoS attacks. The constraints on the duration and frequency of the spanning tree being destroyed by the DoS attacks are derived. Furthermore, the propagation of external disturbances and unknown leader inputs along the platoon is proven to meet the prescribed $H_\infty$ attenuation level by the Lyapunov-based methods.

First, a ground constraint module based on the principal normal of the planar ground is proposed to avoid vertical drift. To address the lack of geometrical features in corridors and environments with large-scale featureless walls, intensity features combined with geometrical features are adopted for scan-to-map registration. Finally, a joint optimization module integrates the feature correlation, the IMU pre-integration, and the ground constraint into a factor graph to perform low-drift SLAM. Extensive experiments are conducted on the GroundRobotDataset, which include challenging degradation scenarios such as long corridor, obstacle crossing and unstructured outdoor environment with large-size walls in weak texture.

An automatic sensor calibration function is essential for safe autonomous driving, responding to the sensor's geometric change. In this paper, background knowledge of sensor calibration is explained, and related papers are referenced. Depth estimation and semantic segmentation models are learned to detect significant regions from the camera using open and custom datasets. This paper describes the online calibration procedures based on motion-based calibration between the camera and LiDAR. Motion-based calibration faces a challenge for lack of roll and pitch variation, and our method overcomes this challenge by estimating a camera 3D ground plane from semantic segmentation and depth estimation and simultaneously detecting a 3D LiDAR ground plane. LiDAR-to-camera roll, pitch, and z values are then extracted using the camera and LiDAR ground plane, and the motion-based calibration problem is solved and optimized using those values as constraints.

Though reinforcement learning (RL) has shown tremendous potential in solving decision-making problems in autonomous driving, existing research often overlooks the heterogeneity of CAVs. Moreover, current RL methods lack robust safety guarantees, especially in mixed traffic scenarios where HDVs are often non-cooperative and uncontrollable. To address challenges of the cooperative driving among heterogeneous CAVs in dynamic and mixed traffic, we have developed a novel heterogeneous cluster safe algorithm and hybrid-critic training framework. Specifically, to overcome the limitations of existing methods primarily designed for homogeneous agents, we introduce a cluster policy-sharing mechanism. Additionally, we propose a safe policy update method with a high sample utilization rate, which combined with the cluster policy-sharing mechanism leads to the HCP4O algorithm. Furthermore, we have designed an innovative hybrid-critic training framework to enhance the safety driving performance of heterogeneous CAVs under various conditions. Finally, we train our model in hundreds of random and dynamic scenarios to validate the generalization ability of agents. The experimental results show that, compared to current advanced Multi-Agent RL algorithms and rule-based methods, our approach demonstrates significant advantages in safety and efficiency, especially in scenarios with a large number of agents.},

A mixed multi-scale attention module (MMSA) is designed to equilibrate parameter counts across various scales and bolster the network's capacity to learn incomplete features.

Nevertheless, these approaches, rooted in traditional centralized computing paradigm, grapple with conflicts related to data needs versus privacy protection, robustness versus personalization, and transferability versus accuracy. To address these challenges, this study proposes a novel decentralized federated transfer learning (FTL) method, named P2P-PerFTL, which aggregates local SOH estimation models into a global model using peer-to-peer communication while preserving battery data locally, combining federated learning and transfer learning to realize personalization and transferability within various working conditions and batteries. This algorithm utilizes a domain-shift-based weighted aggregation mechanism for global model formulation, and constructs a personalized and transferable neural network architecture by assigning part layers as personalization layers and incorporating domain shift loss. Through a comprehensive case study with four FTL scenarios, it is demonstrated that the proposed P2P-PerFTL can train a highly proficient SOH estimation model with a limited volume of data from local clients across diverse operational conditions and battery types, and outperforms alternative training frameworks.},

Safe maneuvers, especially in urban traffic, are characterized by frequent lateral motions, such as lane changes, overtakes and turning along curved roads. Motivated by our previous work which shows a $3\!-\!10 \%$ increase in energy consumption due to lateral motion when an electric vehicle changes its lane once every kilometer while following standard drive cycles, we incorporate vehicle lateral dynamics in the modeling and control synthesis, which is in contrast with most prior works. In the context of safety, we leverage past data of obstacle motion to construct a future occupancy set with probabilistic guarantees, and formulate robust collision avoidance constraints with respect to such an occupancy set using convex programming duality. Consequently, we formulate a finite-horizon optimal control problem subject to robust collision avoidance constraints while penalizing resulting energy consumption, and solve it in a receding horizon fashion. Finally, we show the effectiveness of the proposed approach in reducing energy consumption and collision avoidance via numerical simulations involving curved roads and multiple obstacles. A detailed analysis of energy consumption along different components of EV motion highlights appreciable improvement under the proposed approach.},

Traditionally, most algorithms handle these tasks in sequential steps, detecting objects based on appearance features in video frames, and then analyzing their behavior through frame tracking. This study presents a novel deep learning-based object and motion detection method that uniquely combines spatial and temporal information into a single framework. The motion pattern of objects is uniform across different object classes and appears as traces in the spatial-temporal domain. These object movements can be interpreted from motion profile images even in complex driving environments. Unlike two-stage methods that rely on detection and tracking, our approach directly learns object motion from a vast dataset of driving videos, demonstrating its efficiency and practicality. It is specifically designed to address the challenges encountered in dynamic driving scenarios, proving its effectiveness and relevance in practical applications. The goal is to quickly identify objects and their motion in the driving context. Our method excels in real-time performance with interpretable motion detection in the spatial-temporal domain. It also demonstrates high mean average precision, $\mathbf {78\%}$, and low mean average error, $\mathbf {3.09^\circ }$, on a publicly available dataset, further validating its effectiveness and reliability.},

  abstract     = {Task-specific data-fusion networks have marked considerable achievements in urban scene parsing. Among these networks, our recently proposed RoadFormer successfully extracts heterogeneous features from RGB images and surface normal maps and fuses these features through attention mechanisms, demonstrating compelling efficacy in RGB-Normal road scene parsing. However, its performance significantly deteriorates when handling other types/sources of data or performing more universal, all-category scene parsing tasks. To overcome these limitations, this study introduces RoadFormer+, an efficient, robust, and adaptable model capable of effectively fusing RGB-X data, where “X” represents additional types/modalities of data such as depth, thermal, surface normal, and polarization. Specifically, we propose a novel hybrid feature decoupling encoder to extract heterogeneous features and decouple them into global and local components. These decoupled features are then fused through a dual-branch multi-scale heterogeneous feature fusion block, which employs parallel Transformer attentions and convolutional neural network modules to merge multi-scale features across different scales and receptive fields. The fused features are subsequently fed into a decoder to generate the final semantic predictions. Notably, our proposed RoadFormer+ ranks first on the KITTI Road benchmark and achieves state-of-the-art performance in mean intersection over union on the Cityscapes, MFNet, FMB, and ZJU datasets. Moreover, it reduces the number of learnable parameters by 65% compared to RoadFormer. Our source code is publicly available at mias.group/RoadFormerPlus.},

  abstract     = {The active anti-roll system is capable of rapidly applying a counter roll torque to the vehicles when a roll tendency occurs, suppressing the degree of body roll and maintaining vehicle stability. However, the anti-roll system of a vehicle is a complex nonlinear system, where modeling errors, real-time changes in vehicle parameters, and uncertainties from external disturbances may affect its performance. Sliding mode control (SMC) has been widely applied in various fields owing to its effectiveness in handling the aforementioned issues. Nonetheless, conventional SMC requires knowledge of upper bound of disturbances, and the controller gain is typically set higher than the upper bound of disturbances to ensure convergence of tracking errors. To address this issue, the barrier function adaptive sliding mode control (BFASMC) is introduced, which can quickly converge the sliding variable to a predetermined domain without the need to know the upper bound of disturbances, and it can also avoid excessive actuator outputs. Based on this, a novel property adjustable barrier function adaptive sliding mode control (PABFASMC) strategy has been set to adapt to the application of the actuators. It is possible to balance the convergence time of sliding variable and control input, while also avoiding singularity problems of the control law. Co-simulation was conducted using the MATLAB/Simulink controller model and the CarSim vehicle model to evaluate the performance of PABFASMC. The experimental results demonstrate that the developed controller exhibits the aforementioned performance, while also proving the effectiveness of the active anti-roll system in enhancing vehicle stability and ride comfort.},

  abstract     = {Multi-object tracking (MOT) is an essential technique for navigation in autonomous driving. In tracking-by-detection systems, biases, false positives, and misses, which are referred to as outliers, are inevitable due to complex traffic scenarios. Recent tracking methods are based on filtering algorithms that overlook these outliers, leading to reduced tracking accuracy or even loss of the object's trajectory. To handle this challenge, we adopt a probabilistic perspective, regarding the generation of outliers as misspecification between the actual distribution of measurement data and the nominal measurement model used for filtering. We further demonstrate that, by designing a convolutional operation, we can mitigate this misspecification. Incorporating this operation into the widely used unscented Kalman filter (UKF) in commonly adopted tracking algorithms, we derive a variant of the UKF that is robust to outliers, called the convolutional UKF (ConvUKF). We show that ConvUKF maintains the Gaussian conjugate property, thus allowing for real-time tracking. We also prove that ConvUKF has a bounded tracking error in the presence of outliers, which implies robust stability. The experimental results on the KITTI and nuScenes datasets show improved accuracy compared to representative baseline algorithms for MOT tasks.},

  abstract     = {Reinforcement learning (RL) has demonstrated considerable potential in addressing intricate control and decision problems such as vehicle tracking control and obstacle avoidance. Nonetheless, the control policies acquired through RL often lack smoothness even in the presence of minor noises or disturbances, which may induce oscillations, overheating, and even damage to the system in real-world applications. Existing methods handle this issue from temporal or spatial domains and are often tightly coupled with specific tasks. This paper studies the smoothness of control policy from the frequency domain perspective. We propose a class of neural networks with low-pass filtering ability, named Smonet, to alleviate the non-smooth issue by learning a low-frequency representation within hidden layers. Smonet features with serial filtering layers responsible for low-pass filtering of the input signal. Each filtering layer contains multiple inertia cells, one adaptive cell, and one activation layer. To facilitate the filtering ability of Smonet, we further proposed a Smonet-based RL training method by integrating an extra regularization term relating to filtering factors to standard RL loss. Finally, we assess the efficacy of Smonet through diverse simulated robot control tasks and a real-world mobile robot obstacle avoidance experiment, comparing its performance with two commonly utilized networks, multi-layer perceptron and gated recurrent unit. Results indicate that Smonet consistently enhances policy smoothness under various observation noises without compromising control performance. Notably, it achieves up to a 72.7% reduction in the action fluctuation ratio compared to traditional network structures.},

  abstract     = {LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) is a technology that is widely used in Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) and Autonomous Driving (AD) applications for tasks such as perception, localization, and Simultaneous Localization And Mapping (SLAM). For LiDAR to function appropriately, it is necessary to calibrate the rotation extrinsic parameters that define the orientation relationship between the LiDAR and vehicle coordinates. These parameters include roll, pitch, and yaw, initially calibrated during manufacturing. However, they may change over time due to vibration, heat, loading, or accidental impact during long-term vehicle operation. Using parameters that do not reflect these changes can drastically degrade the performance of ADAS and AD applications. This paper proposes a precise online calibration process to detect and correct LiDAR rotation parameter changes. The precise online calibration system utilizes standard on-road driving data to estimate the LiDAR-vehicle rotation extrinsic parameters online. The proposed process consists of two parts: roll-pitch parameter estimation and yaw parameter estimation. The system estimates the roll-pitch relative to the ground plane in the roll-pitch estimation. In estimating the yaw parameter, a simplified hand-eye calibration approach is used, which leverages vehicle and LiDAR odometry to estimate the yaw of the LiDAR calibration parameter. To improve the accuracy and stability in the yaw estimation, a fault data exclusion algorithm is introduced to identify and exclude faulty inputs based on the difference between the vehicle and LiDAR odometry. The proposed system's effectiveness, robustness, and accuracy are verified in various environments, including urban roads and highway scenarios.},

The output weights and deep reservoir parameters of the DTVRP-ESN are synchronously updated based on the approximation and tracking errors to accelerate the computational process. Secondly, actuator faults are addressed by the proposed ISCA method, which considers both the direction of change and the cost of reaching saturation boundaries for unsaturated actuators. By sequentially saturating the most easily saturated actuators along the direction specified by the PID controller, matrix inversion calculations are avoided, and simple algebraic computations are used to quickly obtain optimal solutions.

  abstract     = {Intelligent connected vehicles integrate smart systems and network communication to enhance safety and efficiency, making them widely applicable for formation control in diverse scenarios. Current mainstream methods typically split formation control tasks into independent functional modules and establish relationships for transmitting information, which results in a fixed number of vehicles in the fleet and limited flexibility in formation configurations. In this paper, we propose a cooperative integrated decision and control (CIDC) framework for formation control in diverse scenarios. This framework splits the driving task into three modules: static trajectory planning, order allocation, and dynamic optimal tracking. First, in the static trajectory planning module, static traffic elements are considered to generate a set of candidate trajectories, freeing up higher-level constraints and enhancing trajectory planning efficiency. Second, in the order allocation module, reasonable and safety preceding vehicles for following are selected, determining the configuration of the connected vehicle fleet in real-time. Finally, in the dynamic optimal tracking module, a multi-objective optimal tracking problem is designed to track the optimal path while considering dynamic obstacles, thereby improving vehicle autonomy and achieving cooperative formation control with variable vehicle numbers and flexible formation configurations. Simulation and real vehicle experiment results demonstrate that the proposed CIDC framework can achieve automatic formation adjustment, making it suitable for various formation control tasks such as convoy driving, deliver and platoon driving.},

We begin with fully-actuated MVs, characterized as a second-order strict-feedback system. This structure enables us to employ the recursive backstepping design method by introducing a virtual control law. To avoid identifying the complex kinetic model of MVs, we establish a data-based closed-loop representation for the error system of the tracking problem. Leveraging this representation and the backstepping technique, a data-driven tracking controller is derived by solving a semidefinite program with pre-collected noisy data. The proposed controller ensures the global uniform ultimate boundedness of solutions of the closed-loop system by approximately canceling the system's nonlinearity. Next, we tackle the more challenging under-actuated MVs that possess fewer control inputs than generalized coordinates, making direct nonlinearity cancellation inapplicable. To address this issue, we solve the tracking problem by stabilizing a new error system derived through a coordinate transformation. Notably, this new error system shares a similar structure with that of fully-actuated MVs but with a reduced dimension. This similarity enables us to seamlessly extend the results of fully-actuated MVs to under-actuated MVs.

However, most current ITS applications rely on a centralized training approach where users upload source data to a cloud server with high computing power for management and centralized training. This approach has limitations such as poor real-time performance, data silos, and difficulty in guaranteeing data privacy. To address these limitations, federated learning (FL) has been proposed as a promising solution.

Conventional visibility-based moving object segmentation (MOS) methods that check free space by using LiDAR beams have been facing issues related to false predictions owing to the large incidence angle of the beam, inaccurate sensor pose, and overlapping views of slowly moving objects. To address these issues, we propose the AWV-MOS-LIO system, which performs adaptive window visibility-based MOS with LiDAR inertial odometry (LIO). The AWV-MOS-LIO consists of AWV-MOS with Object Scale Test (OST) and AWV-LIO. The AWV-MOS with OST, which utilizes adaptive window-based point-to-window comparison and object-level false prediction check, improves the MOS performance by preventing the false predictions resulting from large incidence angle and inaccurate sensor pose. In addition, AWV-MOS utilizes keyframes to check free space in various views. AWV-LIO minimizes pose ambiguity through scan-to-submap matching by utilizing static scans and static weights, and it corrects point distortion by using IMU odometry. We evaluate the online MOS performance of the proposed system on the KITTI Raw dataset and its odometry estimation performance on the UrbanLoco dataset. The proposed method achieves 6.3% higher online MOS performance (IoU) than the deep learning-based method, and 14.4% higher odometry estimation performance (ATE) than the baseline LIO method.

Initially, an auxiliary controller is designed to provide guidance and reference for regulating the system damping ratio. Subsequently, leveraging the Lyapunov comparison principle, the auxiliary control law is transformed into corresponding inequality constraints. Simultaneously, the paper introduces a function-adaptive law to compensate for model uncertainty and disturbance inherent in actual systems. The stability analysis of both the model predictive controller and the function-adaptive law is conducted utilizing the Lyapunov stability criterion.

  abstract     = {Point cloud segmentation (PCS) plays an essential role in robot perception and navigation tasks. To efficiently understand large-scale outdoor point clouds, their range image representation is commonly adopted. This image-like representation is compact and structured, making range image-based PCS models practical. However, undesirable missing values in the range images damage the shapes and patterns of objects. This problem creates difficulty for the models in learning coherent and complete geometric information from the objects. Consequently, the PCS models only achieve inferior performance. Delving deeply into this issue, we find that the use of unreasonable projection approaches and deskewing scans mainly leads to unwanted missing values in the range images. Besides, almost all previous works fail to consider filling in the unexpected missing values in the PCS task. To alleviate this problem, we first propose a new projection method, namely scan unfolding++ (SU++), to avoid massive missing values in the generated range images. Then, we introduce a simple yet effective approach, namely range-dependent $K$-nearest neighbor interpolation ($K$NNI), to further fill in missing values. Finally, we introduce the Filling Missing Values Network (FMVNet) and Fast FMVNet. Extensive experimental results on SemanticKITTI, SemanticPOSS, and nuScenes datasets demonstrate that by employing the proposed SU++ and $K$NNI, existing range image-based PCS models consistently achieve better performance than the baseline models. Besides, both FMVNet and Fast FMVNet achieve state-of-the-art performance in terms of the speed-accuracy trade-off. The proposed methods can be applied to other range image-based tasks and practical applications.},

  abstract     = {The construction of an online vectorized high-definition map is critical for downstream planning and decision-making in autonomous driving. Existing methods have established solid baselines for this task by modeling map elements as a collection of points that describe their shapes. However, the complex geometric relationships between map elements have not been thoroughly investigated, resulting in significant errors when dealing with issues such as multiple pedestrian crossings. In this paper, HoMap, an end-to-end online vectorized high-definition map construction framework that effectively captures complex relationships between instances is proposed. Specifically, the concept of high-order modeling is introduced for the map construction task, which involves partitioning each instance in a high-dimensional space and computing high-order statistics to capture the correlations between map elements. Then, statistical attention is incorporated as a Bird's Eye View enhancement module to reinforce semantic and geometric information. Additionally, instance queries are used as input for the decoder, which improves query capabilities and avoids inconsistencies in instance information. HoMap achieves state-of-the-art performance on the nuScenes and Argoverse2 datasets while maintaining good mapping results in complex driving environments.},

  abstract     = {Freeway on-ramp merging is a challenging task for connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) due to the complex traffic environment. The emergence of reinforcement learning (RL) has accelerated the development of driving strategies for CAVs by leveraging its capability to learn from interactions with the environment. However, the difficulty in achieving convergence in the training process poses challenges for applying RL to driving tasks effectively. Moreover, most RL-based merging strategies are developed in highly parameterized and oversimplified simulation environments, resulting in poor performance in real scenarios. To address this, this study introduces a novel merging policy training framework for CAVs, which includes a merging environment reconstruction method and a two-stage policy training approach. Firstly, the empirical merging scenarios are extracted from the NGSIM dataset and augmented using the calibrated Intelligent Driver Model (IDM), creating a more interactive and realistic training environment for the merging CAV. Then, a two-stage training approach is proposed, where the merging CAV first imitates human behavior under sparse rewards in the first stage and is further optimized under dense rewards in the second stage. The experiment results indicate that the proposed method effectively enhances traffic efficiency by reducing the average merging time of CAVs by 3.6 s and increasing the merging speed by 3.6 ft/s, in comparison to Human-Driven Vehicles (HDVs). The sensitivity analysis also validates the effectiveness and robustness of our proposed framework.},

This work proposes a novel data-driven-based SOC modeling method by constructing some input features related to open circuit voltage and terminal voltage. The objective is to offer more valuable information to conventional data-driven-based SOC modeling methods and enhance their interpretability. Then, by following the changing trends of the constructed features, a battery online SOC estimation method based on feature point sampling is designed to ensure the stability of SOC estimation results.

Considering the resource constraints of real communication devices, we implemented a dual channel for converged data and deployed the corresponding smart contracts separately. We use Raspberry Pi simulations to implement resource-constrained light nodes and implement the proposed framework as multiple machines built on multiple devices in the Hyperledger Fabric blockchain platform. In addition, we conduct a series of experiments to test the incentives and the performance of the blockchain and verify the feasibility of the proposed scheme.

  abstract     = {The robust estimation of heavy-duty vehicles (HDVs) sideslip angle is crucial for vehicle stability controls. This paper aims to address the challenge of estimating the sideslip angle for HDVs when carrying cargo. We propose an innovative framework for estimating the sideslip angle of HDVs after loading. To address the problem of deviation in the inertial measurement unit (IMU) output acceleration signal during vehicle turning caused by the change of center of gravity (C.G.) position after loading cargo, we amalgamate the minimum model error (MME) criterion with the cubature Kalman filter (CKF) to accurately estimate the longitudinal C.G. position and carry out the IMU sensor position correction. On this basis, concerning the estimation of the sideslip angle for HDV when carrying cargo, a series-connected structure estimator is proposed, comprising a kinematic model estimator, a tire cornering stiffness estimator, and a dynamics model estimator. In this structure, the kinematic and dynamics model estimator employs CKF. Considering the characteristics of both kinematic and dynamics models, alongside HDVs' variable payload, an innovative adaptive weighted recursive least squares (AWRLS) method is designed for the adaptive estimation of tire cornering stiffness. This allows the series-connected structure estimator to dynamically adjust in real-time, achieving an accurate and robust estimation of the sideslip angle. Finally, through extensive simulations and real-world vehicle experiments, we validate the efficacy of the proposed framework. The results of the experiments show that the proposed method has a satisfactory level of estimation accuracy, significantly outperforming the estimation results of individual models.},

  abstract     = {This paper investigates the cooperative adaptive cruise control (CACC) of intelligent and connected vehicles under event-triggered communication and modeling uncertainties. These uncertainties in the vehicular platoon can challenge the well-known homogeneity and linearity assumptions of the CACC. To address this issue, we propose a disturbance observer (DOB) to estimate both the parametric uncertainty and the unmeasured external signals. The DOB-based disturbance estimate is directly incorporated into the feedback linearization control law for uncertainty compensation. To assess the individual stability of each vehicle and the string stability of the nonhomogeneous platoon, we formulate overlapping dynamics that model the interconnection of only those vehicles directly exchanging information. This formulation of overlapping dynamics also facilitates the scalability of the platoon, i.e., we can conveniently increase the number of vehicles in the platoon without compromising the complexity of the stability analysis. Using a suitable Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional and the null-term relaxation technique, we derive sufficient conditions to design a switched dynamic event-triggered controller (ETC) that ensures both individual stability and string stability. With the proposed switching ETC approach, the event-triggering condition is only evaluated after a predefined constant period, ensuring a lower bound between events to avoid Zeno behavior. Extended from the $\mathcal {L}_{2}$-stability concept to explicitly account for the uncertainty effects of the nonhomogeneous platoon, the ETC design conditions are formulated as a convex optimization problem under linear matrix inequalities to maximize the inter-event time. The effectiveness of the proposed ETC approach is validated through extensive simulations and comparisons using an uncertain CACC setup.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, how to achieve stable localization and construct high-quality dense maps in large-scale scenes has become a research highlight. In large-scale scenes, for the consideration of the mapping accuracy and efficiency, multi-agent systems rather than single-agent ones are usually employed. Currently, as far as we know, collaborative VI-SLAM (Visual Inertial Simultaneous Localization And Mapping) systems applicable to multi-agent systems are still sporadic, and systems those can achieve a good balance among the localization accuracy, the mapping density, and the transmission efficiency are temporarily lacking. In this paper, we propose a novel centralized collaborative VI-SLAM framework, namely TES-CVIDS (Transmission Efficient Sub-map based Collaborative Visual-Inertial Dense SLAM). In TES-CVIDS, instead of the original RGBD images, the compact sub-maps are transmitted, effectively reducing the transmission data redundancy. After that, the server completes key-frame processing, hierarchical pose-graph optimization, and global dense map construction in three separate threads. Besides, thanks to our depth search mechanism, the geometry information of all key-frames can be recovered on the server-end. Thus, sub-maps can be regenerated after the global pose-graph optimization to maintain the consistency between the localization and the mapping. Both the qualitative and the quantitative experimental results corroborate the superior performance of our TES-CVIDS.},

  abstract     = {The discriminative correlation filter (DCF) is commonly utilized in UAV tracking because of its high tracking accuracy and computing speed. However, in aerial tracking scenarios, challenges such as target occlusion and similar object interference are likely to cause the predicted object position to deviate from the correct motion trajectory. To alleviate this issue, this paper proposes a correlation filter algorithm based on trajectory correction and context interference suppression for real-time aerial tracking. First, a tracking quality evaluation metric is proposed to determine the confidence of the current tracking results. When the object is in a low confidence status, the state matrices of the object position and velocity are constructed, and the Kalman filter strategy is utilized to correct the tracking trajectory automatically. In addition, temporal context-response regularization is designed to fully exploit previous temporal information in order to suppress background interference. Extensive experimental results on four mainstream datasets demonstrate that the proposed algorithm has high tracking performance while achieving a real-time tracking speed of 32 fps on a single CPU.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a novel approach that integrates image-based visual servoing (IBVS) with online model predictive control (MPC) for landing a rotor Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) on maritime vessels, which ensures long-term visibility of the landing tag and enhances robustness against external disturbance. In contrast to existing studies that overlook the influence of UAV attitude changes on target visibility, this work distinguishes itself by comprehensively considering the attitude changes and the visibility constraints in the optimization framework, thereby effectively averting target loss. Furthermore, this paper contributes to the field by analyzing the input-to-state stability of the proposed approach under bounded disturbances, where the upper bound of disturbances is provided when the convergence domain is specified. To address the specific challenge of landing from high altitudes, a two-stage control strategy leveraging a self-designed nested landing tag is introduced. This strategy enables fast and accurate landings with smooth velocity transitions. Additionally, a soft constraint method is introduced to prioritize solution feasibility in online optimization. Extensive numerical simulations, software-in-the-loop (SITL) simulations, and field experiments validate the feasibility and superiority of our proposed method, underscoring its potential for practical implementation.},

An interconnected Linear Parameter Varying (LPV) observer architecture is proposed to estimate the vehicle states and the occurrence of unknown actuator faults. To construct the LPV observer for online estimation, non-measurable nonlinearities related to real-time variation in the longitudinal and lateral velocities and tires slip behavior are considered in a polytope with finite vertices. Subsequently, an output feedback interconnected fault-tolerant controller (FTC) is proposed based on the Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) approach which reduces conservatism and computational complexity while enhancing robustness. The stability analysis of the proposed adaptive observer is performed using the Lyapunov theory. In particular, the ISpS (Input-to-State practical Stability) characteristic is employed for more robustness against unknown disturbances inputs and nonlinearities terms. Finally, hardware validation is performed with the full-scale Sherpa driving simulator to illustrate the performance in terms of robustness and applicability of the proposed FTC architecture.},

In this paper, a coordinated behavior planning and trajectory planning (BPTP) framework is proposed to deal with the MUGVs collision-prone problem in UNIS, which consists of interactive behavior planning layer and an optimization-based trajectory planning layer. The behavior planning layer is designed based on the mixed integer quadratic programming (MIQP) and breadth-first search (BFS) approach to generate collision-free trajectory clusters in the spatio-temporal state. The selected coarse trajectory fully considers the continuity of the trajectory, the non-collision and the driving efficiency between MUGVs. For trajectory planning, a spatio-temporal motion corridor (STMC) approach is proposed based on MIQP and optimization approach to model the constraints posed by complex unstructured environments in a unified way. Based on STMC, a safe and smooth trajectory is optimized, conforming to the decision provided by the behavior planner. Finally, the proposed BPTP framework is validated in both simulations and real-vehicle, and experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves human-like driving behavior in UNIS safely and smoothly compared to the existing planning methods.},

  abstract     = {Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) equipped with acoustic modems are currently one of the important means of obtaining underwater environment data such as sounds and images. They rely on high-speed underwater acoustic (UWA) communication technology for data transmission tasks. Orthogonal chirp division multiplexing (OCDM) is a multicarrier method based on chirp spread spectrum (CSS) which has better reliability in frequency selective fading channels than orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM). In this work, we combine index modulation (IM) and propose an OCDM-IM system that provides faster data rates when it activates the same number of subchirps as OCDM. On the other hand, it activates fewer subchirps when the data rate is the same, so it has better anti-interference capability. The simulation results under a measured UWA channel and random channels and the experimental results show that OCDM-IM has a better bit-error rate (BER) performance than that of OCDM and OFDM-IM systems when the subchirps are not fully loaded. In particular, when a small number of subchirps are activated, OCDM-IM is able to provide up to 2x bit rate with more than 5 dB improvement in BER performance. Our simulation and experimental results also show that IM has much better reliability than constellation mapping when Doppler effect is considered. Therefore, OCDM-IM is more suitable for the communication of AUVs.},

By abstracting the service computing granularity to a higher function level, the nascent serverless edge computing is envisioned to leave the burdensome scheduling and management issues to computing vendors. Nevertheless, the traditional terrestrial-based edge system's features, such as heterogeneity, scattered deployments, and environment dynamics, significantly complicate the function scheduling process for computing vendors. Specifically, inhomogeneous load distribution caused by these features leads to edge servers' concurrent performance bottlenecks and low resource efficiency issues. Further, it is crucial to develop an efficient scheduling scheme for the serverless vehicular edge computing network with heterogeneous function requirements/edge configurations and without prior environment evolution knowledge. To this end, we propose a dual-heterogeneous serverless vehicular edge computing network to facilitate the function scheduling within two-scale ranges. We formulate the joint function scheduling problem considering the closely coupled request dispatching, function placement, and computation resource allocation as a cooperative partially observable Markov game. Then, a model-free multi-agent reinforcement learning is introduced to acquire an online scheduling strategy. Simulation experiments show that the proposed approach can guarantee more completed function requests than other baselines.},

  abstract     = {Domain adaptive semantic segmentation enables robust pixel-wise understanding in real-world driving scenes. Source-free domain adaptation, as a more practical technique, addresses the concerns of data privacy and storage limitations in typical unsupervised domain adaptation methods, making it especially relevant in the context of intelligent vehicles. It utilizes a well-trained source model and unlabeled target data to achieve adaptation in the target domain. However, in the absence of source data and target labels, current solutions cannot sufficiently reduce the impact of domain shift and fully leverage the information from the target data. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end source-free domain adaptation semantic segmentation method via Importance-Aware and Prototype-Contrast (IAPC) learning. The proposed IAPC framework effectively extracts domain-invariant knowledge from the well-trained source model and learns domain-specific knowledge from the unlabeled target domain. Specifically, considering the problem of domain shift in the prediction of the target domain by the source model, we put forward an importance-aware mechanism for the biased target prediction probability distribution to extract domain-invariant knowledge from the source model. We further introduce a prototype-contrast strategy, which includes a prototype-symmetric cross-entropy loss and a prototype-enhanced cross-entropy loss, to learn target intra-domain knowledge without relying on labels. A comprehensive variety of experiments on two domain adaptive semantic segmentation benchmarks demonstrates that the proposed end-to-end IAPC solution outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.},

A frequency modulated continuous waveform (FMCW)-based radar-communication system (FRaC) utilizing both sparse multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) arrays and index modulation (IM) has been proposed to form a DFRC system specifically designed for vehicular applications. In this paper, the three-dimensional (3D) parameter estimation problem in the FRaC is considered. Since the 3D-parameters including range, direction of arrival (DOA) and velocity are coupled in the estimating matrix of the FRaC system, the existing estimation algorithms cannot estimate the 3D-parameters accurately. Hence, a novel decomposed decoupled atomic norm minimization (DANM) method is proposed by splitting the 3D-parameter estimating matrix into multiple 2D matrices with sparsity constraints. Then, the 3D-parameters are estimated and efficiently and separately with the optimized decoupled estimating matrix. Moreover, the Cramér-Rao lower bound (CRLB) of the 3D-parameter estimation are derived, and the computational complexity of the proposed algorithm is analyzed. Simulation results show that the proposed decomposed DANM method exploits the advantage of the virtual aperture in the existence of coupling caused by IM and sparse MIMO array and outperforms the co-estimation algorithm with lower computation complexity.},

Firstly, a distributed observer-based decentralized formation control protocol is proposed to provide the state estimation of the leader, where the estimated leader's state facilitates that each agent maintains formation distance between the leader and the formation process. Secondly, a decentralized control policy is considered and learned by the iterative solution of the Bellman equation to achieve the optimal formation tracking control for each agent. However, the aforementioned obtained results heavily rely on the system dynamics and an initial stabilizing control policy. To relax these limitations, a data-based switching learning algorithm is proposed, and it consists of a model-free matrix updating learning algorithm and a data-based policy iteration algorithm. In contrast to existing algorithms for similar studies, the proposed algorithms eliminate the system model and initial stabilizing requirements, but also ensure the formation control in an optimal control way.

Most existing IBVS studies for OMR systems have only addressed the kinematics of OMRs, and studies that consider the dynamics of OMRs have only been conducted recently. In particular, the practical uncertainties caused by dynamic uncertainty, interaction matrix uncertainty, and target motion have not been considered in previous studies. In this paper, feature point dynamics of OMRs are modeled by including all of the dynamic uncertainty, interaction matrix uncertainty, and target motion. To approximate and compensate for these uncertainties, fuzzy logic systems (FLS) with two update laws—the general adaptive law and I&I law—are proposed. Notably, the proposed I&I law eliminates the limitations of general adaptive methods, improving transient response owing to its noncertainty-equivalent adaptive structure. The proposed methods are designed by based on the FLS, I&I law, and integral sliding mode control all together to compensate for the practical uncertainties in feature point dynamics, guaranteeing global asymptotic stability unlike the existing studies. The stability and feasibility of the proposed methods are verified via the Lyapunov stability analysis, simulations, and experiments in an environment with uncertain feature point dynamics.},

The JSTC model integrates a back-pressure (BP) signal controller that comprehensively considers the right-of-way with traffic modes and the person-based traffic demand, which aims to enhance intersection throughput and improve the probability of arrival on green (PAOG) of CAVs. Additionally, this paper provides a theoretical stability proof of the control system by deviating the upper bound of the Lyapunov drift penalty function. Furthermore, it simultaneously introduces a discretized CAV trajectory control model by discretizing continuous time variables with vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication periods for smooth and safe travelling. Simulation results demonstrate that the JSTC model exhibits excellent responsiveness and achieves the lowest convergence value of cycle maximum queue length across various flow-based traffic demand levels. The smoothness of the Lyapunov function values validates the ability to stabilize the control system. Two months of connected transit buses (CTB) operation data shows that substantial progress has achieved. These include the elimination of unnecessary stops, an over 20 km/h increase in daily average speed, a 17% reduction in weekly average delay, and at least 10% reduction in weekday travel time.},

  abstract     = {The challenge of allowing a quadrotor to land quickly on an unknown moving platform using visual cues is addressed. A position-based visual servoing (PBVS) framework is designed that utilises the relative position data captured by the onboard camera to ensure a successful landing. The inherent limitation imposed by the camera's low sampling rate, which hampers the update and transfer rate of control commands, is mitigated by introducing an alternating predictive observer (APO). This observer inputs rapid actual or virtual position information into the control system. Actual relative positions are used for observer design when available from the camera, whereas virtual relative positions, predicted by the quadrotor model, are used when direct sampling is unattainable. This approach enables a process that alternates between prediction and observation, allowing for the design of a sampled-data controller that updates at a fast rate, commensurate with the APO. The robustness of the proposed PBVS-APO controller is exhibited, requiring no prior knowledge of the platform's dynamics. Validation through numerical simulations and experiments confirms the high control bandwidth and the rapid landing efficacy of the control strategy.},

  abstract     = {This research paper addresses the formation control problem in a swarm of quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) over directed interaction topologies, with the primary objective of achieving persistent motion based on bearing measurements. A novel bearing-only formation controller is proposed, eliminating the need for relative position or linear velocity measurements between quadrotors. Specifically, a distributed hierarchical formation control scheme is adopted for the quadrotors. This scheme consists of an outer-loop translation controller designed for target formations using only bearing vector measurements, as well as an inner-loop attitude controller for precise attitude adjustments. To overcome the absence of bearing rate measurement in the translational controller, a filter is introduced to estimate it, effectively compensating for the lack of linear velocity measurement. Additionally, a differentiator is employed to estimate the high-order control input of the translational dynamics, enabling convenient derivation of the desired angular velocity and its derivatives required for the torque controller. The stability analysis of the underactuated systems of multi-UAVs under directed graphs is conducted using Lyapunov stability theory. Simulation results demonstrate the convergence properties of the proposed protocols, while real-world tasks validate its practicality.},

As real-time microscopic traffic characteristics can be vividly represented by graph data, we strive to achieve accurate trajectory predictions via graph-structured series for the stability and the efficiency of transportation. Although the existing data-driven algorithms have achieved fabulous accuracy in various simulation tasks, there are limitations in the distribution and the number of vehicles under investigation. With car-following patterns applied as physical information, we derive the adjacency matrix and design graph filters to explore the spatial dependence between vehicles via the graph-represented multi-lane traffic. The multi-head attention layer is attached to the spatiotemporal convolutional network as an extension. The rationality and the superiority of our model are validated on two calibrated datasets. Through error comparisons, we discuss the role of changeable hyper-parameters to deduce the optimal model for one-step and multi-step predictions.

  abstract     = {Millimeter-wave (mmWave) radar is widely used in autonomous driving thanks to its robustness under harsh weather conditions. However, compared to LiDAR point clouds, mmWave radar point clouds tend to be sparse and include several “ghost” targets. Existing methods attempt to optimize radar signal processing to generate superior radar point cloud. Nonetheless, these methods are primarily designed for simple scenarios. How to obtain superior radar point clouds for complex autonomous driving scenarios is still unexplored. In this article, we propose a novel point cloud generation network that generates superior radar point clouds by utilizing complementary advantage of radar and camera. Technically, our approach comprises three key steps. First, to obtain precise relationships between neighboring pixels, the mmWave range-azimuth map (RAM) is enhanced to extract the radar affinity matrix. Second, to obtain dense image bird's-eye-view (BEV) features, image features are diffused by learning local details from the radar affinity matrix. Third, to obtain superior radar point clouds, radar features and diffused image features are combined in a unified BEV representation, and optimized by K-nearest-neighbor (KNN) graph. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed methods, we collect a real-world dataset under autonomous driving scenarios to conduct experiments. The results demonstrate that our method outperforms exisiting ones in producing high-quality radar point clouds. And as a consequence, the radar point cloud generated using our methods significantly improve the performance of object detection task.},

Video semantic segmentation (VSS) further takes temporal information into consideration for better scene parsing and temporal consistency. Previous research on VSS is mostly dedicated to developing new techniques (e.g. optical flows, attention) to better mine temporal information. In this work, we contribute from a different angle by efficiently incorporating multi-scale temporal information. The dual spatial-temporal feature pyramid is proposed to enable the direct enhancement of multi-scale features for target frames and unlash the design of temporal information mining modules. It contains a spatial feature pyramid from a target frame and a spatial-temporal feature pyramid from multiple reference frames. Building on the dual feature pyramid, we further propose to decouple motional contexts and static contexts to fully leverage temporal information. Specifically, multi-scale motional contexts are mined with the introduced dedicated module and static contexts are enhanced by making temporally fused category-level representations interact with the target frame feature. The final segmentation maps are obtained by regarding the enhanced category-level representations as powerful feature classifiers to classify the target frame feature of rich motional contexts. Experimental results on two popular VSS benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed method with decent parameter and inference efficiency clearly outperforms previous advanced methods.},

Based on the input and output data of the train, a new extended state observer based model-free adaptive iterative learning control (ESO-based MFAILC) scheme is developed, which mainly includes the following perspectives: 1) an extended state observer is conducted to iteratively estimate the exogenous disturbances by utilizing its learning capacity from repetitions; 2) on the basis of the historical train information, a switched error system is modeled against aperiodic DoS attacks; 3) a predicted output compensation scheme is employed to alleviate the influence of communication delays. The boundedness of speed tracking error is rigorously guaranteed by the proposed algorithm, regardless of the time-iteration-dependent disturbances and the appearance of aperiodic DoS attacks and random communication delays.

The variable Tube-based model predictive trajectory tracking control strategy includes the radial basis function (RBF)-Ridge observer and dynamic cross-section Tube-based model predictive control (DCTMPC). The data-driven RBF-Ridge observer performs real-time estimation of parameters affected by load to reduce the range of parameters disturbance. The RBF-Ridge observer calculates the optimal ridge parameter based on sensor signals, eliminating the impact of multi-collinearity and unbalanced on parameter estimation accuracy. The DCTMPC adaptively reconstructs the model and adjusts the state Tube based on observer estimation to improve the path tracking robustness of automatic trucks. Hardware-in-the-loop tests show that the proposed strategy can accurately calculate the truck parameters affected by load changes and improve the truck trajectory tracking accuracy under different loads.},

As the potentials for real-world applications increase, so does the demand for a safe and robust driving system. For example, an end-to-end deep reinforcement learning agent makes guidance decisions based on the observation states extracted from perception sensor inputs, which can be interfered by unpredictable adversarial attacks. The latter causes adversarial observation states, which easily leads autonomous driving agent to incorrect decisions and ultimately to unintended accidents. In this work, we propose both attack and defence approaches for robust learning-based self-driving agent. The optimal observation perturbation is realized using an efficient augmented gradient-based method. An attack detection deep network with saliency map based explainability is then proposed to flag up to the users the existing danger of the attacks on the sensor perception. Furthermore, to ensure safe driving under these perceptional perturbations, we propose a deep adversarial reinforcement learning based approach for robust autonomous driving in a roundabout passing scene. We adopt PPO (Policy Proximal Optimization) [1] as our baseline guidance algorithm and develop a theoretical supported constraint, multi-object objective function optimization to efficiently mitigate the effect on the deep guidance autonomous driving policy from strong adversarial attacks. We conduct extensive experiments and evaluate our robust model under various adversarial attack configurations in traffic scenarios.

Over the past few decades, there has been notable advancement in the field of MRL techniques. Several works have achieved remarkable success in terms of both the accuracy and reliability of localization. In MRL, scene maps are represented in diverse forms, and they dictate the functionality and efficacy of MRL methods. However, to the best of our knowledge, existing surveys do not provide systematic reviews about the correlation between MRL solutions and their used scene map representation. This survey fills the gap by comprehensively reviewing MRL methods from such a perspective, promoting further research. 1) We commence by delving into the problem definition of MRL, exploring current challenges, and comparing ours with existing surveys. 2) MRL methods are categorized and reviewed into five classes based on the representation forms of the utilized map, i.e., geo-tagged frames, visual landmarks, point clouds, vectorized semantic maps, and neural network-based maps. 3) To quantitatively and fairly compare MRL methods using different maps, we introduce some public datasets and evaluate the performances of several advanced MRL approaches. The strengths and shortcomings of MRL methods using various maps are analyzed. 4) Finally, we introduce some topics of interest in this field and provide our individual viewpoints.

However, the information exchanged between these parties is vulnerable to eavesdropping attacks, emphasizing the need to develop privacy-preserving approaches. The cryptographic methods are undoubtedly effective, but their high computational overhead may adversely impact the normal operations of UASs. Additionally, the dynamic of a UAV has a high dimension, which is disadvantageous for both estimation and encryption. Therefore, this paper proposes a secure distributed estimation protocol with partially homomorphic encryption by encrypting the transmitted measurements and estimates. Attribute to distributed structure and partial homomorphism, the computation amount for secure estimation is greatly reduced. At the same time, the raw data that needs to be encrypted is transferred into the space of plaintexts by a uniform quantizer and a mapping strategy.

However, planning feasible paths becomes challenging due to constraints imposed by complex environments and the inherent maneuverability of UAVs, particularly in large-scale scenarios involving multiple UAVs (multi-UAV). This paper addresses the multi-UAV cooperative path planning problem, formulating it as a constrained optimization problem and proposing the evolutionary state estimation-based multi-strategy jellyfish search (ESE-MSJS) algorithm to search for high-quality paths. In the proposed algorithm, a switching framework based on evolutionary state estimation is constructed to prevent ineffective searches and enhance suitability for path planning. Within this framework, three distinct update modes are developed for each individual, enabling a more efficient and flexible selection of appropriate learning strategies. In addition, a neighborhood topology-based elite example learning strategy is employed to increase population diversity, and a best information guiding-driven adaptive scaling factor strategy exploits the surrounding space, strengthening local search capabilities. The Gaussian barebone mechanism is introduced to balance exploration and exploitation. To effectively cope with intricate constraints, a dynamic $\alpha$-level comparison strategy is incorporated into the individual update stage of the ESE-MSJS. Experimental results demonstrate that ESE-MSJS outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms regarding accuracy, feasibility, and stability, proving to be an effective method for multi-UAV cooperative path planning in complex environments.},

  abstract     = {Reinforcement learning (RL) has demonstrated its advantages in the intelligent control of many vehicle systems. However, controlling the exploration-to-exploitation (E2E) ratio of RL for the best performance in real-world operations is a great challenge. To obtain the optimal E2E ratio for managing the energy flow of a plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV) in real-world driving, this paper proposes an ensemble learning scheme based on two independent Q-learning agents working back-to-back competitively. At each sampling time, these agents generate two candidate control actions based on state observation and their control policies. Three decay functions, including the widely-used exponential decay and two new decay methods i.e., reciprocal function-base decay and step-based decay, are introduced to formulate one-dimensional look-up tables for E2E control. Then the PHEV control action will be selected from the candidate actions by a learning automata module(LAM) developed in this paper. The combinations of the three decay methods and three ensemble strategies with maximum-based, random-based, and weighted-based methods are investigated with the considerations of their energy efficiency, real-time performance, and robustness. Experiments are carried out on software-in-loop and hardware-in-the-loop platforms to demonstrate the energy-saving potentials. By implementing the ensemble learning scheme based on the weighted-based ensemble method in the control of the studied PHEV, up to 1.04% of energy can be saved under the predefined real-world driving cycles compared to the conventional Q-learning scheme.},

  abstract     = {When quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicles land on moving platforms, they require not only precise landing points for safety but also high platform speeds for higher mission efficiency. However, the combined effects of wind gusts and uneven ground effects will become stronger and have faster dynamics with the increase of platform speed. These complex disturbances will deteriorate landing point precision of the quadrotor vehicles with only traditional control methods. In order to suppress the complex disturbances and improve landing point precision, an extended disturbance observer based block backstepping control scheme is proposed for a quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicle landing on a moving platform. Firstly, two observers are designed to accurately estimate the complex disturbances for the translational and rotational subsystems respectively after the disturbances are modelled as high-order time polynomials. Secondly, the position and attitude controllers are designed recursively between the subsystems with the outputs of the observers as feedforward compensation following the idea of block backstepping. Asymptotic boundedness of the whole closed-loop system is proved by Lyapunov stability theory. Finally, landing experiments on a moving platform of 20 km/h demonstrate the superiority of the proposed scheme over other ones in improving both platform speeds and landing point precision.},

To achieve this, we propose an Omnidirectional Curve Segment Detection (OCSD) method combined with a camera model which is applicable to images with large distortions, such as panoramic annular images, fisheye images, and various panoramic images. The geodesic segment is sliced into multiple straight-line segments based on the radian and descriptors are extracted and recombined. Descriptor matching establishes the constraint relationship between 3D line segments in multiple frames. In our VIO system, line feature residual is also extended to support large-FoV cameras. Extensive evaluations on public datasets demonstrate the superior accuracy and robustness of LF-PGVIO compared to state-of-the-art methods.},

To address the cutting-corner problem on roads with significant curvature changes, a path-coupled extended look-ahead (PELA) approach is proposed. This approach comprehensively integrates both the vehicle state and path information to generate PELA points as new tracking targets. Based on it, a DMPC algorithm involving longitudinal and lateral control is designed. The error cost of the assumed output trajectory in DMPC is modified to adapt to vehicle platoon control on curved roads. The position error cost functions are constructed in similar forms as the repulsion function in artificial potential fields and a piecewise linear function. Such a treatment enhances the safety performance of system and the platoon tracking capability while maintaining the feasibility of DMPC unaltered. A criterion for asymptotic stability of the system is derived. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is verified via experimental results.},

However, the complex dynamics introduced by the articulated structure of the tractor semi-trailer results in poor yaw and roll stability, which in consequence poses great challenges in path tracking under extreme conditions featuring high lateral acceleration or low tire-road friction. In this work, a stability-guaranteed computationally efficient model predictive path tracking framework is devised. In particular, a comprehensive tractor semi-trailer stability constraint (TSSC) consisting of a three-dimensional (3D) yaw stability envelope and rollover limitation is proposed to guarantee the yaw and roll stability. By linearizing the system model and constraints, the proposed path tracking controller is solved as a set of quadratic programming (QP) problems with the potential for real-time implementation. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed control framework reduces the maximum tracking deviation by at least 48.5% compared to the existing method and ensures the dynamic stability of the tractor semi-trailer under extreme conditions.},

A Lyapunov-based model predictive control (LMPC) algorithm is developed for the visual tracking task, which generates the constrained control signals to consistently achieve optimal tracking performance in accordance with the objective function. An auxiliary Lyapunov-based controller is designed to construct the contraction constraint for LMPC. With the assistance of this auxiliary controller and the contraction constraint, the feasibility and stability of the proposed LMPC controller are analyzed. The trouble of the complex local linearization step in traditional model predictive control (MPC) is resolved and the linearization-induced inaccuracy can be avoided. A barrier cost is integrated into the cost function of LMPC to prevent the visual target from escaping the field of view. Finally, comparative simulation experiments are conducted and the results verify the improved convergence and robustness of the proposed high-dimensional visual servo tracking controller of UVMSs.},

This investigation employs an online model-free parameter learning mechanism, and develops a fully distributed event-triggered communication (ETC)- and actuation (ETA)- based control protocol. Initially, given the challenge of accurately modeling the intricate dynamics of AUVs, we construct a formulation of AUV with a well-defined inverse-matrix-based regression function and a vector of unknown model parameters. Thus, an online model-free parameter learning approach is designed for its estimation. Subsequently, a fully distributed ETC-based leader observer is developed for constructing the reference formation trajectory for each AUV. Then, we devise an ETA-based control protocol, which enables the asymptotic model-free formation of multiple AUVs with unknown time-invariant model parameters. For scenarios involving time-varying unknown model parameters, we extend our methodology by incorporating $\sigma$-modification, which achieves the bounded formation. Both ETC-based observer and ETA-based control algorithm will not exhibit the Zeno behavior with determining a minimum interval for the proposed event-triggered mechanisms (ETMs). Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed control schemes has been verified by some numerical simulations and comparisons.},

Initially, a coordinated control process for multiple suspensions on stepped roads is designed, and an analysis of the stability mechanisms involved is conducted. Addressing dynamic vehicle issues related to the control process, a novel dynamic model is established, considering factors such as suspension geometry, bumper blocks, and vehicle supported by three wheels. Following this, a feedforward and feedback coordinated controller are developed. Feedforward values are determined by steady-state suspension forces and suspension deflection (SD), while feedback control is designed based on dynamic sliding mode control (DSMC). Finally, experimental validation confirms the accuracy of the active suspension systems (ASS) model. The precision of the established dynamic model is verified against CarSim, and processor-in-the-loop (PIL) results confirm the effectiveness of the coordinated control process and controller. In the described configuration, C-V demonstrates exceptional control performance on stepped roads with heights of up to 500 mm.},

To acquire complementary cross-modality encoding and decoding features, we propose a multi-branch differential bidirectional fusion network known as MDBFNet. Firstly, it models the dependencies between the modality-specific characteristics and the different encoding layers, and designs a TIR-led detail enhancement module (TDE) and an RGB-led semantic enhancement module (RSE) to guide distinguishable fusion for different layer features. Secondly, a three-branch fusion decoder with three supervision (TFDS) is proposed to thoroughly explore the complementary decoding features between two modalities.

In the context of the semantic segmentation challenge for UAV aerial images, we propose a strategy for data augmentation that can significantly reduce the effort of manually annotating a large number of images. The result is a set of semantic, depth and RGB images that can be used to improve the performance of neural networks. The main focus of the method is the generation of semantic images, with depth and texture images also being generated through the process. The proposed method for semantic image generation relies on a 3D semantic mesh representation of the real-world environment. First, we propagate the existing semantic information from a reduced set of manually labeled images into the mesh representation. To deal with errors in the manually labeled images, we propose a specific weighted voting mechanism for the propagation process. Second, we use the semantic mesh to create new images. Both steps use the perspective projection mechanism and the Depth Buffer algorithm. The images can be generated using different camera orientations, allowing novel view perspectives. Our approach is conceptually general and can be used to improve various existing datasets. Experiments with existing datasets (UAVid and WildUAV), augmented with the proposed method, are performed on HRNet. An overall performance improvement of the inference results by up to 5.5% (mIoU) is obtained.},

The open-loop plant, from displacements of electric cylinders to vehicle speed, is approximated by a 1st-order nonlinear uncertain system, which is further transformed into an FFDL model. To ensure desirable tracking accuracy and compensate for uncertainties, novel cost functions are considered to establish sampled-data adaptive PI control algorithms. Then, theoretical conditions are provided to ensure closed-loop stability and convergence of set-point tracking errors. Finally, experiments on real electrical cars, which are running on chassis dynamometers, are conducted under Chinese National Standard GB/T18386.1-2021 requirements. To improve the reliability and reduce the period of adaption, several compensation technologies are utilized in the experiments, including rough offline parameter learning, preview target speed, and $\sigma$-modification methods. The experiment results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our control algorithms and robotic driver hardware.},

  abstract     = {This study introduces an adaptive integral sliding mode disturbance observer (AISMDOB)-based robust bidirectional platoon control method, aiming to ensure mesh stability in vehicular systems. Most existing platoon control studies only focus on error propagation stability in either the longitudinal or lateral direction, neglecting the uncertainties in kinematics and dynamics of vehicular systems. The study proposes new coupled spacing error dynamics derived from vehicle kinematics and extended look-ahead-based coupled spacing errors to ensure both the longitudinal and lateral error propagation stability (that is, mesh stability) and are subsequently utilized to develop the novel AISMDOB, which improves the existing integral sliding mode disturbance observers (ISMDOBs) by incorporating adaptive estimation of unknown disturbance bounds while preserving their advantages. The AISMDOB-based platoon control method is then proposed using both robust kinematic and dynamic controllers to effectively compensate for the kinematic disturbances and dynamic model uncertainties, thereby reducing chattering phenomenon and ensuring the asymptotic convergence of spacing and velocity errors. Additionally, the proposed method can prevent cutting-corner behaviors during cornering maneuvers by utilizing the coupled spacing error dynamics. Simulation and experimental results verify the effectiveness of the proposed method through comparison with ISMDOB-based, sliding mode control (SMC)-based, and previous extended look-ahead-based methods.},

In this paper, we propose a novel framework that models urban driving as a stochastic generalized Nash equilibrium problem (SGNEP) and solves it using information-theoretic model predictive control (IT-MPC). By exploiting the cooperative nature of urban driving, we transform the SGNEP into a stochastic potential game (SPG), which has desirable convergence guarantees. Furthermore, we provide an algorithm for isolating interacting vehicles and thus factorizing a game into multiple sub-games. Finally, we solve for the open-loop generalized Nash equilibrium of a stochastic game utilizing a sampling-based technique. We solve the problem in a receding-horizon fashion, and apply our framework to various urban scenarios, such as intersections, lane merges, and ramp merges, and show that it can achieve safe and efficient multi-agent navigation.},

In spite of this, data missing due to a communication barrier or equipment failure is an unavoidable issue in the process of data acquisition, which significantly impacts lane-changing (LC) prediction. To solve this issue, the influence of data missing on lane change prediction was explored from the several aspects such as missing pattern, missing proportion and data interpolation. The different degrees of data missing in three patterns, namely block missing, temporally correlated missing and random missing, were examined. Missing values are repaired and LC behavior is predicted based on machine/deep learning models, and hyperparameters are optimized using genetic algorithms. By analyzing the factors that affect the model's generalization ability, the difference between the best data repair result and the best prediction result was further explored. The results show that: (1) the proposed methods can effectively solve the problems of data missing repair and prediction accuracy, especially the KNNImputer for repair and the Transformer for prediction; (2) temporally correlated missing is inferior to random missing for filling in errors, but superior for prediction performances. This indicates that the selection of repair methods should take into account not only the best data imputation, but also the best prediction performance; and (3) there are significant differences in the stability of prediction models under different data missing patterns and the CNN-BiLSTM-SA has achieved relatively good performance.},

  abstract     = {Railway intrusion detection is a serious task in intelligent rail transportation system, ensuring the safe operation of trains and the safety of people's lives. The existing railway intrusion detection methods mainly adopt the methods based on deep learning with large-scale datasets, which is undoubtedly costly. The emerging few-shot object detection method (FSOD) provides a potential solution to solve the suddenness and contingency of railway intrusion. However, there is an inherent contradiction between the performance of the novel class and base class in most FSOD, i.e., the model bias problem. To address the above-mentioned issues of railway intrusion detection, few-shot railway intrusion detection (FSRD), consisting of Balanced region proposal network (RPN), Double Detector and an efficient fine-tuning framework, is proposed to detect novel class by few-shot samples without forgetting base class. Balanced RPN is developed to generate high-quality proposals that are not biased towards any classes for subsequent training and inference. Double Detector is further proposed to handle the region of interest (RoI) features of the novel and base class respectively, and generalize the novel class without forgetting the base class. Upon these baselines, we also tailored an efficient fine-tuning framework to further improve overall performance. The proposed method is extensively experimented on our constructed few-shot railway intrusion dataset (FSRT2023). Experimental results show that the overall performance of FSRD significantly outperforms some state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods in all settings. FSRD can be used as a never-forgetting few-shot detector that learns rare novel classes in railway intrusion detection.},

This process is designed to robustly and precisely estimate the system state and map the traversed area. In this paper, we propose a low-drift, highly resilient multilevel navigation system with completely decoupled odometry and adaptive environmental mapping. A novel method for visual-LiDAR-inertial frame-to-frame odometry is presented to leverage the complementary strengths of these sensors. This odometry approach involves decoupling the 6-degree-of-freedom (6-DoF) state to allocate each state component to an appropriate submodule for estimation. An adaptive environmental mapping module that aims to align the target frame with the local map is proposed to refine the rough odometry pose. This module is achieved through the utilization of an adaptive keyframe strategy and the feature consistency constraint. Enhance the matching of keyframes to the map by reducing the point-to-feature error between frame points and map features. Additionally, the state is further refined by minimizing the feature consistency error on lines in the adjacent corner map and the local map at each keyframe. Our proposed algorithm is validated using both public and self-collected datasets, demonstrating superior results compared to state-of-the-art algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Recently, self-driving vehicles have been actively studied and have begun to operate on actual roads. Most of the current self-driving vehicles rely on a number of sensors to individually judge the situation and take action. However, from a road perspective, a collection of individual vehicles' decisions is inevitably sub-optimal, and it is essential that roads directly intervene (control/assist) in vehicle operation for optimal traffic management. This paper proposes Software-Defined Traffic Management (SDTM) that incorporates the concept of Software-Defined Networking (SDN) into the transportation environment. In SDTM, each vehicle is handled like a packet in SDN and its movement can be assisted/controlled using a global view of the road. To this end, SDTM enables reliable interaction between vehicles and infrastructure (RSU/controller) by 1) allocating collision-free channels to vehicles, 2) reducing vehicle's messaging interval by fully utilizing available channel resources, and 3) redistributing sensitive information from the infrastructure. Based on the traffic information collected and reported by RSU, the controller induces vehicle to form clusters and controls/assists the movement of vehicles on a cluster-by-cluster basis, implementing safe and efficient traffic flows. According to the performance evaluation using the ns-3 simulator, under SDTM, vehicles experience an average travel time reduced by 30% (more than 97% of all vehicles experience shorter travel time) compared to the real traffic traces, while maintaining a safety distance.},

In this paper, we propose a novel approach to monocular depth estimation based on two other cheaper annotation tasks: semantic segmentation and prediction of a single vanishing point without the need for ground truth depth data. In a Manhattan-world assumption with a single vanishing point, only one vanishing point exists and represents the end of the scene extension on the z-axis. Depending on semantic segmentation prediction, we set hand-crafted rules to determine the depth of each pixel in the scene depending on its label and its spatial position with regard to the vanishing point. We train two convolutional neural networks (CNNs): a semantic segmentation CNN and a vanishing point prediction CNN. We then fuse the results obtained from the two networks using the hand-crafted rules, which are defined based on single-view geometry rules by taking into consideration the label of the pixel and the nature of the object obtained by the segmentation model. Extensive experiments were done using the KITTI and Cityscapes benchmark datasets. The proposed model achieves impressive performance in semantic segmentation (mean intersection over union of 82.20%) and vanishing point estimation (mean absolute error of 1.87). Monocular depth estimation achieved a relative absolute error of 0.070 with the KITTI dataset and 0.289 with the Cityscapes dataset, outperforming many state-of-the-art methods in depth estimation and semantic segmentation at 10 frames per second.},

To address these challenges, this paper presents a novel end-to-end method that implicitly integrates the mobile robot's motion constraints to help the agent navigate and avoid obstacles in complex environments. By designing a novel observation space and a Long Short-Term Memory module, our DRL framework can output two continuous actions, which are linear and angular velocities for collision avoidance in dense environments, by only using the depth image from the onboard RGBD camera. To remove the assistance from conventional algorithms, we have designed a novel reward function that takes into account the motion constraints for differential drive robots, promoting higher linear velocity and lower angular velocity, thus for efficient and smooth obstacle avoidance, especially in sparse-obstacle environments. We have extensively validated the proposed framework against state-of-the-art methods using the BARN_Dataset map set. Furthermore, various real-world scenarios, including structured, unstructured, and random environments, and moving pedestrians, have further demonstrated the effectiveness and robustness of our proposed framework.},

  abstract     = {LiDAR and camera are crucial perception sensors that provide complementary information for object detection in autonomous driving vehicles. However, the fusion of sensor data to achieve efficient object detection requires accurate calibration and precise time synchronization between the sensors. While calibration ensures the geometric relationship between the sensors, and time synchronization ensures that data from both sensors corresponds to the same moment in the real world. Even though various methods have been introduced to achieve accurate calibration between LiDAR and camera, time synchronization between sensors remains relatively unexplored. Poor synchronization between sensors caused by incorrect time stamping process significantly affects data fusion. Therefore, in this paper we present sensor time synchronization for LiDAR and camera data fusion approach, especially in autonomous driving vehicles. It also explores various techniques involved in establishing synchronization between LiDAR and camera.

  abstract     = {Autonomous vehicles require accurate, real-time environmental representations for safe navigation. Traditional methods relying on detailed offline maps struggle in dynamic environments with outdated data. Thus, real-time solutions integrating diverse data sources and adapting to current situations are essential. One such framework is the situation-aware drivable space (SDS). However, SDS faces limitations such as simplified object representation, nonstandard output, and validation only on simulated or high-quality data. This paper introduces SDS++, an improved framework for drivable space estimation addressing these limitations. Key improvements include incorporating complex geometries, providing a more flexible and accurate drivable space, and adopting a standardized output representation. Methodologically, SDS++ operates in two main steps. First, it formulates a Graph-based SLAM optimization from semantic objects and determines the most likely environment, leveraging a novel custom factor for optimizing curved line features. Second, it estimates drivable space using artificial potential fields (APFs) constructed from domain knowledge through implicit and sigmoid functions. SDS++ offers several benefits. The novel factor allows the incorporation of complex geometries such as road lanes and edges. Constructing APFs from domain knowledge provides a flexible drivable space that adapts to the driving situation. Additionally, APFs created from implicit and sigmoid functions offer higher accuracy than typical bi-Gaussian representations. SDS++ has been rigorously validated in simulations and through experiments in a real vehicle with unrefined data. Integration with a model predictive control (MPC)-based planner demonstrates significant enhancements in trajectory planning, showcasing SDS++'s robustness against localization noise and ability to adapt trajectories to the driving context.},

  abstract     = {This paper proposes a novel lane change path optimization algorithm for emergency collision avoidance in intelligent vehicles. Traditional path planning often faces challenges such as optimizing many variables, being unsuitable for emergency scenarios, or producing paths that are difficult for vehicles to follow accurately. Our approach employs lagged longitudinal and lagged curvature models with $G^{2}$ continuous curves, generating reliable collision avoidance trajectories under low-level actuator time lag. The lagged longitudinal model is designed to be differentiable in the spatial domain, allowing curvature optimization in the curvilinear coordinates. The lagged curvature model facilitates rapid lane changes, making it suitable for emergency collision avoidance. The proposed method optimizes only dual connecting points and enhances computational efficiency using analytic gradient-based nonlinear programming. Comparisons with existing path planning methods–namely, the fifth-order spline optimization method, model predictive control-based optimization, and the time-domain fifth-order polynomial optimization method–on straight and curved roads demonstrate that the proposed method minimizes collision avoidance areas more effectively. The proposed path is verified with a simple tracking controller in high-fidelity simulation using TruckSim.},

  abstract     = {In time series and data stream analysis, neural networks (NNs) have demonstrated remarkable capacity in predicting current and future states. However, NNs often suffer from catastrophic forgetting (CF) when adapting to new tasks or data domains. This issue is particularly pressing in vehicle state estimation, given that new data domains are frequently invited to a pre-trained model. While memory-based techniques have been proposed to address CF in continual learning, they are less effective for time series regression problems due to the absence of a suitable subset selection strategy. This paper presents a novel method called ReSeleCT (Representative Selection for Continual learning in Time-series scenarios) for identifying and capturing a coreset of old datasets in memory-based continual learning with application to vehicle velocity estimation. The approach focuses on selecting a representative subset of historical data to retain key information from previous tasks. The framework is applied to estimate a vehicle's longitudinal and lateral velocities using neural networks, incorporating new maneuvers into the previously trained model. Experiments on sensor data from an electric Equinox vehicle demonstrate that ReSeleCT efficiently adapts to new data domains while preserving prediction accuracy on the old dataset, with the added benefit of fast model adaptation without significant computational overhead. Comparison against other algorithms in continual learning shows a superior performance of the proposed method in terms of prediction error while maintaining an acceptable training time.},

The problem is crucial to various automotive tasks like trajectory prediction, object detection, and scene reconstruction. In the absence of ground truth scene flow labels, contemporary approaches concentrate on deducing and optimizing flow across sequential pairs of point clouds by incorporating structure-based regularization on flow and object rigidity. The rigid objects are estimated by a variety of 3D spatial clustering methods. While state-of-the-art methods successfully capture overall scene motion using the Neural Prior structure, they encounter challenges in discerning multi-object motions. We identified the structural constraints and the use of large and strict rigid clusters as the main pitfall of the current approaches, and we propose a novel clustering approach that allows for a combination of overlapping soft clusters and non-overlapping rigid clusters. Flow is then jointly estimated with progressively growing non-overlapping rigid clusters together with fixed-size overlapping soft clusters. We evaluate our method on multiple datasets with LiDAR point clouds, demonstrating superior performance over the self-supervised baselines and reaching new state-of-the-art results. Our method excels in resolving flow in complicated dynamic scenes with multiple independently moving objects close to each other, including pedestrians, cyclists, and other vulnerable road users.},

However, most existing feature-level fusion methods utilize multiple convolutional layers with fixed parameters to extract bimodal features, leading to low adaptivity to diverse data distributions. This paper proposes a Cross-scale Dynamic Convolution-driven YOLO Fusion (CDC-YOLOFusion) network, which introduces a novel Cross-scale Dynamic Convolution Fusion (CDCF) module to adaptively extract and fuse bimodal features concerning on data distribution. Technically, CDC-YOLOFusion first designs a novel data augmentation strategy “Cross-modal Data Swapping” (CDS) to exchange local regions between visible and infrared images, effectively capturing cross-modal correlations within local regions. Building on this, the proposed CDCF utilizes cross-scale enhanced features to assist dynamic convolution prediction by introducing a disparity attention mask, which emphasizes the extraction of disparate features between two modalities. Our CDCF is effectively guided by a novel cross-modal kernel interaction loss, aiming the learned kernels to simultaneously focus on common salient features and unique features of each modality for comprehensive feature generation. Extensive experiments on three representative detection datasets demonstrate that CDCF can be easily plugined into the existing pipelines, obtaining consistent performance improvements. Moreover, our approach yields SOTA performance with about 2% to 3% mAP improvements as compared to the state-of-the-art methods.},

In this paper, we present a Restoration-enhanced object detection network for adverse weather scenes enabled by Degradation Modeling, dubbed RDMNet. Firstly, to capture more potential information of degraded images, we incorporate the idea of restoration into the detection network, thus forming a dual branch network. Secondly, to improve the network's adaptability for different weather types, we propose to model the degradation of degraded images and learn its multi-scale degradation representations to guide the feature transformation in both restoration and detection branches. Finally, to facilitate the cross-task integration of restoration and detection branches, we develop a multi-scale bi-directional feature fusion block and propose a restoration weight decay training strategy. Extensive experiments in rain, haze, and snow weathers demonstrate that our RDMNet outperforms the recent object detection approaches.},

  abstract     = {RGB-D semantic segmentation has proven effective in many real-world applications by incorporating additional depth information. However, current methods often treat depth and RGB images as perfectly calibrated and directly design sophisticated architectures to fuse them. In reality, RGB and depth images frequently suffer from noise and defect problems due to hardware constraints. Fusing noisy depth and RGB features without prior calibration will diminish their representation ability. Moreover, current methods integrate RGB and depth features at a single feature level, failing to eliminate the semantic gap between them effectively. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel feature calibration and integration network called CFCI-Net, which comprises a global-local feature calibration module (GL-FCM) and a base-shape feature integration module (BS-FIM). The GL-FCM is proposed to calibrate the RGB and depth features using their complementarity from global and local perspectives, respectively. The BS-FIM is designed to integrate the calibrated RGB and depth features by extracting and aggregating their base features and shape features, where base features provide the geometry location while shape features provide the texture information. The proposed CFCI-Net is inserted into vision-transformer-based two-stream backbones for RGB-D semantic segmentation. We conduct extensive experiments on three widely explored RGB-D semantic segmentation datasets, NYUDv2, SUN RGB-D, and 2D-3D-S, confirming the state-of-the-art performance of CFCI-Net.},

However, in existing research on trust models for UASNs, the impact of multidimensional trust features on the trust prediction process is usually treated as the same, even in dynamic current environments and dynamic network topologies. In addition, underwater sensor nodes undertake excessive trust computation in the traditional UASN architecture. In this paper, we introduce the Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) as the edge device to construct the edge-enabled UASN architecture, and propose an AUV-assisted adaptive Trust Prediction model, which we name ATP. Furthermore, by analyzing the characteristics of the edge-enabled UASN architecture, we extract trust features from AUV and underwater sensor nodes respectively, and AUV is utilized for trust computation and prediction. In order to improve the performance of anomalous node detection, we adaptively adjust the contribution of different trust features to trust prediction based on the attention mechanism. Evaluation results indicate that our proposed ATP model is able to detect anomalous nodes effectively, and it achieves higher accuracy than that of the two established trust models.},

This domain gap leads to missing detections for densely observed objects, misaligned confidence scores, and increased high-confidence false positives, rendering the detector highly unreliable. To address this, we introduce MS3D++, a self-training framework for multi-source unsupervised domain adaptation in 3D object detection. MS3D++ generates high-quality pseudo-labels, allowing 3D detectors to achieve high performance on a range of lidar types, regardless of their density. Our approach effectively fuses predictions of an ensemble of multi-frame pre-trained detectors from different source domains to improve domain generalization. We subsequently refine predictions temporally to ensure temporal consistency in box localization and object classification. Furthermore, we present an in-depth study into the performance and idiosyncrasies of various 3D detector components in a cross-domain context, providing valuable insights for improved cross-domain detector ensembling. Experimental results on Waymo, nuScenes and Lyft demonstrate that detectors trained with MS3D++ pseudo-labels achieve state-of-the-art performance, comparable to training with human-annotated labels in Bird's Eye View (BEV) evaluation for both low and high density lidar.},

We define an intention-aware control problem incorporating epistemic uncertainties of the opponent vehicles and model their intentions as discrete-valued random variables. Then, we focus on a control objective specified as belief-space temporal logic specifications. From this stochastic control problem, we derive a sound deterministic control problem using stochastic expansion and solve it using shrinking-horizon model predictive control. The solved intention-aware controller allows a vehicle to adjust its behaviors according to its opponents' intentions. It ensures provable safety by restricting the probabilistic risk under a desired level. We show with experimental studies that the proposed method ensures strict limitation of risk probabilities, validating its efficacy in autonomous driving cases. This work provides a novel solution for the risk-aware control of interactive vehicles with formal safety guarantees.},

In this paper, a novel CACC method is proposed. Firstly, a switching logic of cruise following mode is formulated. Secondly, a safety distance model for velocity classification under the requirements of full velocity region of vehicle is established. Thirdly, the CACC method is designed based on fuzzy-robust model predictive control (Fuzzy-RMPC) algorithm. A five-order model of vehicle longitudinal distance is constructed. According to the safety, compliance and comfort requirements, MPC cost function and constraints are obtained. A robust controller is constructed to provide error correction terms, and a relaxation factor is introduced to extend the feasible solution.

  abstract     = {There is evidence that the driving style of an autonomous vehicle is important to increase the acceptance and trust of the passengers. The driving situation has been found to have a significant influence on human driving behavior. However, current driving style models only partially incorporate driving environment information, limiting the alignment between an agent and the given situation. Therefore, we propose a situation-aware driving style model based on different visual feature encoders pretrained on fleet data, as well as driving behavior predictors, which are adapted to the driving style of a specific driver. Our experiments show that the proposed method outperforms all evaluated baselines significantly and forms plausible situation clusters. Furthermore, we found that feature encoders pretrained on our dataset lead to more precise driving behavior modeling. In contrast, feature encoders pretrained supervised and unsupervised on different data sources lead to more specific situation clusters, which can be utilized to constrain and control the driving style adaptation for specific situations. Moreover, in a real-world setting, where driving style adaptation is happening iteratively, we found the MLP-based behavior predictors achieve good performance initially but suffer from catastrophic forgetting. In contrast, behavior predictors based on situation-dependent statistics can learn iteratively from continuous data streams by design. Overall, our experiments show that important information for driving behavior prediction is contained within the visual feature encoder. The dataset is publicly available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/jHaselberger/SADC-Situation-Awareness-for-Driver-Centric-Driving-Style-Adaptation.},

Deterioration of visual quality will decrease the accuracy of intelligent vehicle applications based on polarization, resulting in a decreased perception range and increased navigation risk. To suppress the effects of real-world nighttime scenes for intelligent vehicles, we propose a retinex-based polarization-aware low-light image enhancement network (RPLENet) that can enhance the polarization and color information. We prove that the reflectance layer obtained from the retinex decomposition of the unpolarized component $I_{un}$ is more accurate than the reflectance layer from any polarizer angle intensity image. Therefore, we perform retinex decomposition on $I_{un}$ to obtain a more precise reflectance layer instead of decomposing the reflectance layer in the polarizer angle intensity image. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance by conducting extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets. We also collected polarization datasets from real-world nighttime road scenes to evaluate the performance of RPLENet. Our method can effectively improve the perception of polarization-based features in low-light conditions. This is of great value for the environmental robustness of visual perception systems and transportation safety.},

In this study, limitations and key causes arising from differences in steering dynamics models are identified when applied to various vehicles, leading to accuracy degradation in commercialized vehicles. To address the irregularities between hands-on and hands-off characteristics across different vehicles, an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) based hands-off detection model is implemented first with additional inputs from forward cameras and in-vehicle sensors, some of which have not been utilized in existing rule-based methods. The Permutation Feature Importance technique is used to extract critical input features for hands-off detection, and the performance of the optimized model is verified to validate the importance of the detected features. Next, the newly identified significant signals are then used to enhance the existing rule-based method. Through experiments, the enhanced rule-based method is compared with the existing rule-based approach and, additionally, compared with learning-based and optimized learning-based methods.

Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel pedestrian-vehicle information modulation network (PVIM). Particularly, we first propose a pedestrian-vehicle spatial context (PVSC) that effectively models the spatial dynamics between the pedestrian and ego-vehicle. Second, we design a temporal bilinear attention module that removes temporal redundancy and consolidates temporal correlation for more accurate predictions. We have conducted extensive experiments on the PIE pedestrian action prediction benchmark and have achieved state-of-the-art performance.

A novel algorithm called deep reinforcement learning with deceleration (DRLD) is proposed to solve the problem of multi-USV cooperative formation control. To maintain the stability of the formation, a deceleration mechanism is first proposed. Invalid actions of USVs are avoided by the deceleration mechanism during the formation process. Then, to avoid sparse rewards, an improved reward shaping method is proposed. The artificial potential field (APF) is introduced to construct reward functions in DRLD. Moreover, to set priorities for collision avoidance in different cases, weights are introduced into reward functions. This priority-based scheme makes the collision avoidance of USVs become more reasonable. The proposed DRLD can still provide a good performance even if the multi-USV system executes formation switching. Finally, comparative experiments and ablation studies are conducted to confirm the effectiveness of the DRLD algorithm.},

The path tracking controller encompasses estimated TRFC and estimation uncertainty, both of which are operationalized within the path tracking model and the probabilistic state constraint. First, a stochastic variational deep kernel learning method is presented to effectively map spatial-temporal features of TRFC and evaluate estimation uncertainty. Second, a new linear friction-adaptive path tracking model is proposed based on affine force-input model. Then, a closed-loop learning-based stochastic model predictive control (LBSMPC) strategy is presented to seek trade-offs between control performance and state constraint violation based on the given TRFC estimation uncertainty description. In addition, the probabilistic resolvability of the LBSMPC strategy is proved, and the closed-loop stability and chance constraint satisfaction are ensured. Finally, the experimental tests illustrate that the proposed framework achieves path tracking with low error and less conservatism.},

This paper proposes a time-aware formation control (TAFC) strategy to improve the formation regulation time of the CAV platoon. First, to construct an effective information sharing mechanism among the vehicles in the platoon, a unidirectional weighted graph is designed to construct the relation of the CAV platoon and calculate the impact factor between two different vehicles. Second, based on the unidirectional weighted graph, the time-aware requirement is converted into a regulation order problem. The regulation order, which corresponds to the minimum time, is designed and provided with sufficient proof. Third, the qualitative regulation strategy for the CAV platoon is designed and the string stability of the platoon is analyzed with a detailed proof. In addition, the quantitative tune-up strategy of the vehicles is designed. Compared with the existing formation control schemes, the main novelties of the proposed TAFC lie in the regulation orderliness of the CAVs and the target consistency of the CAV platoon are simultaneously considered for achieving the fast formation regulation. In order to analyze the performance of the TAFC strategy, two state-of-the- art methods are selected as the benchmarked methods. The validation results demonstrate that the proposed method possesses better performance in the formation regulation process compared with the benchmarked methods.},

  abstract     = {In the realm of Mobility-on-Demand (MoD) systems, the forecasting of rider demand is a cornerstone for operational decision-making and system optimization. Rider demand levels are profoundly influenced by both endogenous and exogenous factors, leading to high and dynamic volatility. This volatility significantly undermines the efficacy of conventional time series forecasting methods. Furthermore, traditional forecasting methodologies primarily yield point estimates, thereby neglecting the inherent uncertainty within demand projections. In response, we propose an Extended Recurrent Mixture Density Network (XRMDN), a novel deep learning framework engineered to address these challenges. XRMDN leverages a sophisticated architecture to process demand residuals and variance through correlated modules, allowing for the flexible incorporation of endogenous and exogenous data. This architecture, featuring recurrent connections within the weight, mean, and variance neural networks, adeptly captures demand trends, thus significantly enhancing forecasting precision, particularly in high-volatility scenarios. Our comprehensive experimental analysis, utilizing real-world MoD datasets, demonstrates that XRMDN surpasses the existing benchmark models across various evaluation metrics, notably excelling in high-demand volatility contexts. Most importantly, XRMDN outperforms the benchmark models up to 93.0%, 72.7%, and 31.3% in terms of the log-likelihood value, MAPE, and rejection rates compared to the benchmark models. This advancement in probabilistic demand forecasting marks a significant contribution to the field, offering a robust tool for enhancing operational efficiency and customer satisfaction in MoD systems.},

  abstract     = {Deriving robust control policies for realistic urban navigation scenarios is not a trivial task. In an end-to-end approach, these policies must map high-dimensional images from the vehicle's cameras to low-level actions such as steering and throttle. While pure Reinforcement Learning (RL) approaches are based exclusively on engineered rewards, Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning (GAIL) agents learn from expert demonstrations while interacting with the environment, which favors GAIL on tasks for which a reward signal is difficult to derive, such as autonomous driving. However, training deep networks directly from raw images on RL tasks is known to be unstable and troublesome. To deal with that, this work proposes a hierarchical GAIL-based architecture (hGAIL) which decouples representation learning from the driving task to solve the autonomous navigation of a vehicle. The proposed architecture consists of two modules: a GAN (Generative Adversarial Net) which generates an abstract mid-level input representation, which is the Bird's-Eye View (BEV) from the surroundings of the vehicle; and the GAIL which learns to control the vehicle based on the BEV predictions from the GAN as input. hGAIL is able to learn both the policy and the mid-level representation simultaneously as the agent interacts with the environment. Our experiments made in the CARLA simulation environment have shown that GAIL exclusively from cameras (without BEV) fails to even learn the task, while hGAIL, after training exclusively on one city, was able to autonomously navigate successfully in 98% of the intersections of a new city not used in training phase.},

  abstract     = {Detailed longitudinal dynamics simulations may be used to predict the energy performance of road vehicles. However, including uncertainty in the operating conditions often implies high computational costs. Model-based formulations, in conjunction with statistical methods, may obviate this limitation by directly accounting for stochasticity, thus eliminating the need for simulating large populations of driving and operating cycles. To this end, leveraging directly the methods of stochastic calculus, this work presents a novel theory of longitudinal vehicle dynamics and energy consumption, where the vehicle's speed varies stochastically depending on the characteristics of the operating environment. In particular, the proposed formulation, consisting of stochastic differential equations (SDEs) governing the longitudinal motion of road vehicles, inherently accounts for the statistical variation connected with uncertainties in the driver's behavior and road properties, including, e.g., topography and legal speed. A Fokker-Planck partial differential equation (PDE) that describes the time evolution of the joint probability density function (PDF) of the vehicle's speed, position, and road parameters is also derived from the SDEs established in the paper. The SDE and Fokker-Planck-based approaches enable statistical estimation of important quantities like speed fluctuations, instantaneous power requests, and energy consumption. The developed models may be used to assess the energy performance of road vehicles for different combinations of road transport missions. This is applicable at the early stages of the development, virtual testing, and certification processes, without the need to perform computationally expensive simulations, as corroborated by the virtual experiments conducted in the paper.},

This study focuses on resilient platoon operation control of heterogeneous heavy-haul trains in intricate driving environments. The primary objective is to develop an innovative planning and control co-design scheme for real-time coordination of train departure headway and dynamic spacing. This approach aims to simulate real-world railway scenarios, validating system-level stability, real-time capability, and resilience against uncertainties and delays. The comprehensive analysis reveals that in platoon operation mode, the minimum departure headway for 5,000-ton heavy-haul train can be reduced to 95 seconds while maintaining an average spacing of 782.13 meters between trains on downhill sections with slopes less than 10%. This substantial enhancement in transportation efficiency exceeds that achieved by the existing fixed block mode.},

To bridge the gap and merge the different methodologies, we present an extension of the V-model for iterative data-based development processes that harmonizes and formalizes the existing methods towards a generic framework.

Driving simulators play an essential role in this by providing a reproducible, safe yet realistic environment for research and development, with the ability to rapidly generate almost infinite system and scenario variants. In this paper, a study has been designed to investigate the suitability of a static driving simulator for characterizing a safety-oriented Lane Departure Avoidance (LDA) system through both subjective and objective assessment. The study comprises two components: a subjective assessment conducted with participants and a standardized driver-in-the-loop test drive to objectively assess the system on the simulator. The research endeavors to determine the most suitable test maneuvers for objectively characterizing the system while also identifying target ranges for relevant objective metrics for an optimal subjective assessment. The results show that the professional drivers give a more reproducible subjective rating than the normal drivers. Notably, both groups consistently evaluate subjective criteria that are based on the perception of the steering wheel movement as well as the change in ego position and heading angle. However, the perception of the absolute ego position does not lead to a consistent subjective assessment. This study suggests that the characterization of LDA systems on a static driving simulator is generally feasible, with potential for improvement of characterizing aspects based on absolute positions such as maximum lane overshoot.},

  abstract     = {Reinforcement learning (RL) has excelled in sequential decision-making and control tasks, yet traditional RL algorithms are limited by adherence to a single control style in identical scenarios, failing to address varied control preferences. Existing multi-style RL methods typically require customized reward or objective functions tailored to specific control styles, which may not be feasible when diverse driving styles are necessary. To overcome these limitations, we propose the multi-style distributional soft actor-critic (M-DSAC) algorithm, capable of learning a single policy that supports multiple control behaviors. We begin by developing a multi-style policy iteration (MPI) framework that learns the entire distribution of returns, known as the value distribution, rather than just focusing on the expected return (i.e., the $Q$ value). In this framework, we utilize the quantile index of the value distribution as a style indicator, enhancing the inputs of both the policy and its corresponding value distribution with these quantile indices. Building upon the MPI framework, the M-DSAC algorithm employs a parameterized diagonal Gaussian function to approximate the value distribution. This approach enables efficient computation of different value quantiles by combining the value distribution's mean and standard deviations with appropriate coefficients. By optimizing the policy across different quantiles, M-DSAC efficiently learns a versatile policy that can handle a range of control styles without the burden of significant computing costs. Experimental evaluations using MuJoCo benchmarks and real-world robot control tasks confirm the effectiveness of M-DSAC, showcasing its broad practical applicability.},

And model predictive control (MPC) is a main method in the area of multi-vehicle control. Most of the recent MPC of the UAV-USV (unmanned aerial vehicle-unmanned surface vehicle) systems rarely consider unknown external disturbance. Therefore, the distributed robust model predictive control (DRMPC) is proposed. However, as it is widely known, the disturbance that can be dealt with by RMPC is bounded. To deal with unbounded external disturbance, a distributed stochastic model predictive control method (DSMPC) is proposed in this paper. Considering an UAV-USV system, the UAVs separate from the USV to perform a task. When the power of the UAVs is low, the UAVs rendezvous with the USV to be charged. During the process of separation and rendezvous, unbounded disturbance in the marine environment can't be ignored. To deal with the unbounded disturbance during this process, a separation and rendezvous control method for the UAV-USV system based on DSMPC is proposed. The recursive feasibility and asymptotic stability of DSMPC are proven. A series of simulations are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the above methods.},

  abstract     = {Autonomous racing has attracted extensive interest due to its great potential in self-driving at the extreme limits. Model-based and learning-based methods are widely used in autonomous racing. Out of which, model-based methods cannot cope with complex environments when only local perception is available. This limit can be overcome by the Proximal policy optimization (PPO), a typical learning-based method, which does not excessively rely on global perception. However, existing PPO faces challenges with low training efficiency in long sequences. To solve this issue, this paper develops an improved PPO by introducing a curiosity mechanism, a balanced reward function, and an image-efficient actor-critic network. The curiosity mechanism focuses on training on key segments, facilitating efficient short-term learning of the PPO. The balanced reward function adjusts rewards based on the complexity of racetracks, promoting efficient exploration of the control strategy during training. The image-efficient actor-critic network enhances the PPO to fast process the perceived information. Simulation results on a physical engine demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms benchmark algorithms in achieving less number of collisions, higher peak reward with less training time, and shorter laptime among multiple testing racetracks.},

This paper proposes RaViDeep, a novel target detection method based on deep fusion of millimeter-wave radar and monocular image. Initially, a Semantic-based Point Cloud Registration (SPCR) module combines image semantics, radar hierarchical features, and Doppler data to enhance target spatial representation, yielding dense and stable semantic radar points. Subsequently, a Radar-Guided Depth Estimation (RGDE) module with Gaussian enhancement is introduced, utilizing accurate radar depth measurements to guide image depth estimation. This approach fosters a comprehensive scene understanding and effectively reduces measurement and calibration errors. Finally, a pseudo point cloud, generated by the estimated image depth, is integrated with the semantic radar points to facilitate target detection. Tailored for autonomous berthing tasks in wharf scenarios, a novel Non-Occupied Overlap (NOO) metric is developed. Experimental results demonstrate that RaViDeep surpasses state-of-the-art methods, achieving a 12.10% improvement in the NOO metric and a 13.90% improvement in recall.

Specifically, a cooperative target estimator is designed that utilizes the inter-USV communication to estimate the position and velocity of a target with unknown velocities. Then, a cooperative target enclosing controller based on USV kinematics is designed to achieve both the distance keeping and evenly space circumnavigation with neighbors. To guarantee the safety issues for USVs with unknown dynamics during the target enclosing, a radial basis function neural network (RBFNN) based controllers combined with a safety-critical filter using input-to-state safe based control barrier function (ISSf-CBF) are developed. The RBFNNs are employed to approximate the unknown USV dynamics, and the network outputs serve as the basis for the safety-critical filter. This filter handles the impact of approximation errors and external disturbances on safety issues while achieving the collision avoidance, thus ensuring the safety and reliability during the target enclosing process. Comparative simulations and real platform experiments are implemented to verify the effectiveness of proposed safety-critical cooperative target enclosing control framework for USVs.},

Our analysis revealed that the time-frequency cross mutual information (TFCMI) serves as an effective driving-related EEG (DR-EEG) feature capable of describing the correlation between brain regions irrespective of their physical proximity. Furthermore, we demonstrated that incorporating situational embeddings yielded a significant improvement in predictive performance of 27.28%. Notably, our results highlighted the impact of individualized differences in brain cognition and situational perception, which enable individual models to outperform general models, with an average of R2 = 0.982. We found that the activation of neural connections associated with the frontal and left temporal lobes appears to be of paramount importance in driving decision-making.

  abstract     = {Robotaxis tend to hesitate when encountering obstacles with uncertain future trajectories because their decision-making strategies are overly cautious, aiming to ensure robust safety. To reduce conservatism while ensuring reliable obstacle avoidance, this paper introduces Stochastic Model Predictive Decision-Making (SMPDM), considering the probabilistic distributions of obstacle future trajectories. Firstly, an integrated longitudinal and lateral stochastic decision-making model is established, utilizing real-vehicle data to model the uncertainty distribution of modeling errors. Secondly, a collision risk assessment method based on the Separating Axis Theorem (SAT) and Monte Carlo (MC) simulations is proposed. This method accounts for both the geometric dimensions of the intelligent vehicle and obstacles, as well as the time-varying uncertainty in their future trajectories. Thirdly, a safety-dominant dual decision-making optimization problem was formulated for minimizing collision risks under high-risk conditions. This dual optimization problem was further transformed into a piecewise optimization problem, with a proof of equivalence provided for the transformation process. The real-time solution of this stochastic model predictive optimization problem was realized through GPU-based parallel computing. Finally, utilizing the Next Generation Simulation (NGSIM) dataset, we conducted Hardware-in-the-Loop (HiL) experiments on an industrial computer, performing both ablation studies and comparative analyses. Additionally, we conducted real vehicle experiments. The result indicates that, by establishing stochastic models that consider uncertainties in future trajectories and designing safety-dominant decision-making approaches, our method ensures safety while reducing vehicle conservatism.},

Medium and large autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) can be equipped with various navigation sensors to ensure positioning accuracy. In contrast, small AUVs have limited carrying capacity, and how to achieve reliable positioning for long endurance with more basic and necessary sensors is worthy of in-depth investigation. Therefore, a robust Doppler velocity log (DVL) aided inertial navigation strategy is designed in this survey. A tightly integrated system model based on DVL Doppler shift and ranging information aided inertial navigation system is established, which solves the problem of positioning performance degradation caused by error accumulation and beam failure in traditional methods. Based on consistency principle of sensor equipment, the system residual is identified by dead reckoning model and compensated for DVL terrain aided navigation, which solves the problem that systematic errors have great influence on nonlinear terrain and are difficult to identify. At the same time, the terrain entropy is introduced to design the confidence evaluation algorithm, which improves the adaptability of system in different terrain scenes. Simulation and lake test results show that the proposed method has higher positioning accuracy, reliability and stability, and is suitable for AUVs long-endurance navigation tasks.},

  abstract     = {This article studies the automation of aircraft ground movement operations using towbarless robotic tractors. The tractor-aircraft system is modeled as a car-like mobile robot with an off-hooked trailer, in which an accurate dynamic model of the tractor-aircraft system is employed. The primary objective of this study is to determine the control inputs and the resulting collision-free trajectories to steer the aircraft from the initial to the final position, under the assumption that the model of the system and the positions of the obstacles are known. This trajectory planning problem is formulated as an energy-time optimal control problem, which is solved using a pseudospectral knotting numerical method. The effects of the uncertainty in the weight of the aircraft on the solution of the planning problem are also quantified. Since, in general, the tractor-aircraft system moves backwards during ground movement operations, the issue of jackknifing is also addressed. Therefore, the secondary objective of this article is to deal with the problem of tracking the planned trajectory while preventing jackknifing. The trajectory tracking problem is solved using a Jacobian linearization of the offset dynamics about the planned trajectory, in which the optimal control inputs are used as feedforward terms to improve tracking precision.},

By combining the sliding mode (SM) method and the Generalized Regression Neural Network (GRNN) for their compensation, this novel approach introduces a single estimator to consider a complete dynamic system that incorporates all nonlinearities and actuator faults. Inspired by conventional Model-Free Control (MFC) techniques, which often rely on specific model assumptions, we propose a new adaptive model-free control structure based on local measurements. Furthermore, we introduce an innovative event-triggered control mechanism that activates control actions only when necessary, where the system closed-loop stability is demonstrated through a rigorous Lyapunov theory analysis. This strategy not only enhances system efficiency but also reduces energy consumption and processing overhead in computing systems. The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated through numerical simulations and experimental tests, particularly in lateral Lane-Keeping Assist (LKA) systems for Steer-by-Wire (SBW) vehicle. Overall, our contributions advance the field of fault-tolerant control, offering practical solutions for real-world applications.},

  abstract     = {Accurate velocity prediction is a practically crucial yet challenging task for intelligent vehicles. The challenge derives from the time-varying vehicle states, and the dynamic environment. Dynamic Bayesian Networks (DBNs) are widely used to predict vehicle velocity in dynamic environments due to their inherent capability to handle uncertainty and the flexibility to incorporate expert prior knowledge for constructing network structures. However, discrete-to-continuous state transitions restrict the outputs of traditional DBNs to discrete levels, thus being intractable for real-time applications. Moreover, the first-order Markov assumption fails to adequately utilize historical information, leading to poor long-term prediction performance. To this end, a feedback-weighted DBNs (FW-DBNs) framework is proposed for predicting the vehicle velocity in dynamic environments. First, we proposed an adaptive window search algorithm leveraging historical data to narrow down the search domain to a smaller one, thus expediting the search process. Second, we integrated multiple DBNs with various prediction horizons, forming a feedback-weighted mechanism, which allows adaptive adjustments to the weighted values. The ablation experiment results demonstrate that the adaptive window search algorithm reduces the running time by 47.6%, while the feedback-weighted mechanism improves prediction performance by over 20%. Experimental results across various scenes on the highD dataset demonstrate that FW-DBNs outperformed the state-of-the-art methods. The driver-hardware-in-the-loop simulation across four typical scenarios validated the efficiency and robust generalization ability of the FW-DBNs.},

The performance of the algorithm directly affects the safety of the AUV and the success of collision avoidance. To improve the algorithm's generalization and adaptability, a fuzzy reinforcement learning collision avoidance strategy is presented in this study. Firstly, reinforcement learning learns without explicit modeling and converge quickly, making it suitable for continuous online learning tasks. Therefore, this paper adopts a multi-step temporal difference reinforcement learning approach to control the collision avoidance of AUV. Then, fuzzy theory is integrated into reinforcement learning to address generalization issues in the state space. This integration allows the acquisition of continuous state inputs and action outputs, enhancing motion state recognition and improving operational smoothness. Finally, enhancing online training of the fuzzy reinforcement learning method through adaptive strategy adjustments has improved the algorithm's online optimization efficiency. The proposed AUV collision avoidance strategy is validated through simulations and experiments in a three-dimensional underwater environment. The research results demonstrate that this strategy can safety and efficiently guide the AUV, showcasing strong generalization capabilities.},

  abstract     = {The global navigation satellite system (GNSS) positioning performance is widely recognized to degrade in challenging environments due to complex observation uncertainty and variability. In GNSS positioning framework, the stochastic model plays a crucial role in achieving unbiased parameter estimation by correctly capturing statistical observation characteristics. However, classical empirical stochastic models, such as elevation-dependent and carrier-to-noise ratio (C/N0)-based weighting schemes, are deemed inadequate for kinematic positioning services. The environmental context, which comprises terminal space and received signal characteristics, possesses the potential to promote quantifying observation uncertainty. To address this issue, we propose to construct context-aware adaptive GNSS stochastic models that integrate context information. Firstly, leveraging a substantial urban vehicle GNSS dataset, code residuals are accurately extracted using high-accuracy reference trajectory, with significant context features extracted and selected. Secondly, a temporal neural network (TNN) is developed for urban scenario recognition, including open sky, urban canyon, boulevard, and under viaduct. Additionally, context-aware stochastic functions are formulated through correlation analysis and function fitting between C/N0 and median code residuals. Finally, the context-aware stochastic model can be adaptively configured with context prediction results yield by TNN. Experimental results show the context detection model achieves an high-confidence accuracy of 95.37%. Furthermore, the proposed method is evaluated and compared with the classical weighting schemes using code-based single point positioning (SPP). Remarkably, the context-aware stochastic model surpasses the classical C/N0-based stochastic model in terms of continuity and accuracy, representing improvements of 17.60 and 22.39% for horizontal and vertical components, respectively, thereby highlighting its remarkable environment adaptability.},

Second, a Student's t (St) kernel function is introduced as a more sensitive weight function and is combined with the minimum error entropy (MEE) criterion to develop a more general objective function. This enhanced function is designed to better capture the thick-tailed, multimodal characteristics of noise. Finally, a fixed-point method is introduced to update the posterior state estimation, and a computational complexity and convergence analysis is conducted.

Exteroceptive sensors such as cameras, GPS and LiDAR may encounter difficulties in scenarios with poor illumination, indoor environments, dusty areas and straight tunnels. Therefore, improving the pose estimation accuracy only using interoceptive sensors is important to enhance the reliability of navigation system even in degrading scenarios mentioned above. However, interoceptive sensors like IMU and wheel encoders suffer from large drift due to noisy measurements. To overcome these challenges, the proposed system trains deep neural networks to correct the measurements from IMU and wheel encoders, while considering their uncertainty. Moreover, because ground robots can only travel on the ground, we model the ground surface as a globally continuous manifold using a dual cubic B-spline manifold to further improve the estimation accuracy by this soft constraint. A novel space-based sliding-window filtering framework is proposed to fully exploit the $C^{2}$ continuity of ground manifold soft constraints and fuse all the information from raw measurements and neural networks in a yaw-independent attitude convention. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed approach can outperform state-of-the-art learning-based interoceptive-only odometry methods.},

Virtual simulation testing, known for its high fidelity, cost-effectiveness, and efficiency, emerges as a pivotal technology poised to replace traditional testing methods. This study proposes an interactive critical scenario generation method based on in-depth crash data for AV safety testing. The process begins by reconstructing intersection crashes from the China In-depth Mobility Safety Study-Traffic Accident (CIMSS-TA) database. Scene setup involves extracting static and dynamic variables from the original crashes. Subsequently, scene diversity is enhanced using Conditional Tabular Generative Adversarial Network (CTGAN). Next, the dynamic interaction between the objective vehicle, controlled by the Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3) algorithm, and the ego vehicle, controlled by Baidu Apollo within the SVL simulator, generates challenging scenarios. Following this, various experiments are designed to ensure comprehensive coverage of intersection driving situations, with diversity stemming from the relative positions of the vehicles and their driving tasks. Lastly, the effectiveness of these generated critical scenarios is evaluated using metrics such as crash rate, Generalized-Time-To-Collision (GTTC), and Post Encroachment Time (PET). The study also compares the performance of different control algorithms. The experimental results indicate that the interactive critical scenarios present significant challenges to AVs, making them valuable for assessing the safety and resilience of AVs in dynamic, interactive, and hazardous situations.},

  abstract     = {The development and testing of automotive perception systems require a large amount of labeled data. The ground truth of the measurement scene is usually generated by manual video annotation. However, besides requiring a lot of manual effort, it can be time-consuming. Moreover, since the annotation boxes must be transformed into the vehicle's BEV space, the result is often not precise enough due to the camera's poor depth estimation. The existing ground truth generation systems rely on extremely expensive sensor clusters, including LiDARs and GNSS RTK. In this paper, we present a novel semi-automatic ground truth generation tool that exclusively depends on a mono-vision camera and an automotive radar, eliminating the need for these costly sensors. The proposed system comprises an automatic pre-generation algorithm and an interactive GUI annotation tool. We present a novel pre-generation algorithm relying on offline tracking algorithms and fusing radar and camera data that exploits the offline nature of the problem and enhances the preciseness of depth estimation. The proposed system is evaluated on a highway section by comparing the automatically generated objects to the manually created ground truth. According to the results, the automatic pre-generation can significantly decrease the effort of manual annotation, which is also supported by a user-friendly GUI. Along with the theoretical background, the tool and the dataset used for this paper are provided on GitHub.},

  abstract     = {Four-dimensional (4D) Radar is a useful sensor for the detection of surrounding three-dimensional (3D) objects under various weather conditions. However, since Radar measurements could be corrupted by noise, interference, multipath, and clutter, it is necessary to employ a preprocessing algorithm to filter out invalid measurements before the object detection with neural networks. In this paper, we propose RTNH+ that is an enhanced version of RTNH, a 4D Radar object detection network, based on two novel proposed algorithms. The first algorithm is the two-level preprocessing (TLP) algorithm that produces two measurement outputs from the same 4D Radar measurements at different filtering levels. The two outputs enrich the representation of the 4D Radar measurements and enhance object detection network performance. The second is the vertical encoding (VE) algorithm that effectively encodes vertical features of the surrounding objects in the TLP outputs. We provide details of the RTNH+ and demonstrate that RTNH+ achieves significant performance improvement of 10.14% in ${{AP}_{3D}^{IoU=0.3}}$ and 16.12% in ${{AP}_{3D}^{IoU=0.5}}$ over RTNH.},

On the other hand, when driving UAVs to executing these tasks, strong robustness, rapid response and high energy efficiency are extremely critical considerations. For these reasons, this paper investigates an optimal circumnavigation control problem for UAVs subject to performance constraints and wind disturbances. First, a concise disturbance observer for enhancing system robustness is designed by imposing several filtering operations on state and input variables. Leveraging the estimated components, a performance-designated robust enclosing framework is proposed that not only enables UAVs to circumnavigate the target along an arbitrarily desired geometric shape, but also guarantees specified time and precision constraints. Unlike the prevailing circular/elliptical enclosing case, the deployment of any shaped enclosing orbit improves efficiency and adaptability for accommodating various missions. Second, a critic-only adaptive dynamic programming algorithm is tailored to minimize value function and stabilize error dynamics, allowing the UAV to balance cost and performance. Benefiting from the efficient utilization of real-time and historical data, the updating law for critic network ensures convergence of estimated weights to optimal values within finite time. Finally, simulation outcomes verify the efficiency of superiority of the presented method.},

To address the varying demands for delay and reliability in different transmission tasks within this new generation of cellular vehicular networking, NR Cellular Vehicle-to-Vehicle (C-V2V), a Reinforcement Learning-based Flexible Numerology V2V Resource Allocation (RLFN-VRA) algorithm is introduced. The algorithm utilizes NR flexible physical layer parameters, adopts deep reinforcement learning to dynamically configure the subcarrier spacing, and selects spectrum resources in a distributed manner at the vehicle end. The transmission evaluation of messages with different delay requirements, reliability requirements, and traffic densities shows that the algorithm has strong convergence ability and can meet the different requirements of transmission tasks on delay and reliability.

Especially in cities with many vehicle-bicycle-mixed traffic roads, predicting the trajectories of multi-cyclists remains a significant challenge for AVs. However, current trajectory prediction methods ignore the influence of cyclist subjectivity on interaction decision-making, fail to capture the social interactions in cyclist interaction strategies that occur during group cycling, and are difficult to predict phenomena such as risk-taking behaviors and complex maneuvers that arise during group cyclists. In this paper, a multi-cyclist trajectory prediction framework considering group effects is proposed based on cyclists’ interaction decision-making processes. A two-layer interaction mechanism is designed to model the collaborative decision-making process of multi-cyclists under the influence of group internal and external interactions. And, an interaction strategy learning method based on efficiency-safety preference is proposed to capture cyclists' subjective interaction strategies. Furthermore, two quantification methods for interaction relationships based on strategy learning results are proposed to explain subjective factors in cyclists’ decision-making. Experimental results demonstrate that the model has higher accuracy. The effectiveness of strategy learning is validated based on visual analysis of invasion behaviors and interaction maneuvers. And, finally, ablation experiments for the corresponding modules are provided for demonstrating validity.},

Fault magnitude information is then forwarded to the model-predictive controller, which configures its state-space input matrix and constraints based on the information provided to overcome the adverse effects of these faults that may manifest as both actuator loss of effectiveness and jam. It is shown that the integration of the fault estimation and the reconfiguration procedure does not affect the stability of the control system. The performance of the proposed method is first verified using obstacle avoidance maneuvering in a control-oriented, simpler vehicle model. An experiment with a scaled test vehicle is also conducted to prove the real-time applicability of the proposed control algorithm. Our analysis with two representative scenarios shows that the proposed reconfigurable fault-tolerant MPC algorithm can improve the system's performance by a minimum of 30% (and as much as 86%) compared to the conventional and adaptive model predictive controllers designed for vehicle stability.},

  abstract     = {It is challenging to precisely predict pedestrian crossing intentions in autonomous driving, which requires combining changing traffic scene with dynamic pedestrian behaviors. Past studies have always resorted to pedestrians' historical behaviors to forecast their crossing intentions. However, pedestrians' crossing intentions are more related to their future behaviors. Moreover, deep learning-based crossing intention prediction lacks interpretability, limiting the practical application in intelligent vehicles. To tackle the mentioned issues, we propose a Multi-Task Mutual Guidance Network (MTMGN), which optimizes the primary task of pedestrian crossing intention prediction by introducing an auxiliary task of pedestrian posture generation. The crossing intention prediction task consists of two modules: (1) A multi-source input fusion module is proposed to extract context-constraint features based on multiple inputs, including historical pedestrian postures, semantic segmentation maps, and pedestrian-vehicle distances. (2) A future posture injection module is proposed to forecast whether the pedestrian will cross based on context-constraint features and generated future postures. The pedestrian posture generation task leverages the conditional diffusion model to generate future pedestrian postures that adhere to the traffic scene based on the extracted context-constraint features. MTMGN is evaluated on two public datasets, JAAD and PIE, with F1/Recall values of 73%/89% and 92%/90%, respectively. Both qualitative and quantitative evaluations indicate that MTMGN can precisely anticipate pedestrians' crossing intentions, benefitting from the generated pedestrian postures. Moreover, the generated postures provide intuitionistic interpretability for crossing intention prediction.},

The method encompasses three pivotal phases: the encounter leading to collision, the loss of control post-collision, and the resulting harm to third parties on the ground or in the air. Instead of focusing solely on the collision risk, this method quantifies potential harms, introducing the metric of “fatalities per flight hour” akin to conventional aviation. Three main barriers, strategic mitigation, tactical mitigation, and collision avoidance, are modelled to calculate the probability of mid-air collisions. The gas model evaluates the probability of strategic mitigation failure, while an encounter timeline concept determines the probability of tactical mitigation failure. This paper concludes with Monte Carlo simulations validating the proposed model and a real-world case study demonstrating its applicability for regulators, operators, and stakeholders in ensuring the safety and efficiency of future UAM operations.},

In this paper, a self-supervised contrastive learning framework incorporating an out-of-distribution detection classifier (SCLODC) is designed for the fault diagnosis of marine machinery systems. First, this paper develops a combination one-dimensional (1D) data augmentation strategy to aid in extracting valuable features from unannotated conditional signals through self-supervised contrastive learning. Second, an out-of-distribution detection classifier in this framework based on two output distributions, which are the class prediction probability and the confidence level value, is proposed to not only recognize known health states but also to identify previously unseen fault conditions. In the SCLODC framework, only 5% of the total samples are annotated to determine the most effective feature representations and to train the classifier. This framework is applied in four case studies across fault diagnosis scenarios. Impacts of training sample sizes on classification performance are also examined. Experimental results indicate that the SCLODC framework performs efficiently in the extraction of the valuable feature information from abundant unlabeled samples, and functions well in obtaining more excellent diagnostic results than other state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract     = {The perception system based on roadside LiDAR is an important component for autonomous driving. However, previous studies optimizing the deployment configuration of roadside LiDAR systems were constrained by LiDAR designs that failed to provide uniform coverage of vehicle point clouds within the perception area. Our objective is to enhance the perception capability of roadside sensing systems by considering both the inherent properties of LiDAR (e.g., beam distribution) and its relationship to roadside infrastructure, particularly in terms of placement height. Firstly, we proposed an analytical model to establish a quantitative relationship between LiDAR configurations and the distribution of vehicle point clouds. We conducted a field test to generate real vehicle point clouds and validate the proposed analytical model using three types of LiDARs. Secondly, we optimized the roadside LiDAR configurations to maximize the perception entropy of vehicle point clouds. We designed a particle swarm optimization algorithm using initial configurations generated through the bisection method as prior knowledge. The use of a particle swarm optimization algorithm narrowed down the search area, thereby expediting the optimization process. A set of simulation-based experiments was conducted using the NGSIM I-80 dataset. Compared to three alternative configurations, the proposed joint optimization model showed the most significant improvement for the 16-beam and 32-beam LiDAR models, with detection Recall increasing by 65% and 63%, respectively. These improvements are 4.8 times and 3 times higher than those of the base configuration. This study provides an effective method for LiDAR manufacturers to optimize roadside LiDAR systems.},

  abstract     = {In the advancement of vehicle detection sensors, LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) sensors are increasingly utilized for estimating the surrounding environment and vehicle status. Beyond traditional uses, recognizing ground shapes with LiDAR can become essential, enabling vehicles to adjust speed and suspension stiffness based on road surface conditions, thus reducing vibration and enhancing durability and stability. However, the use of mass-produced LiDAR presents challenges in accurately recognizing the shape of the ground due to sparse point clouds and limited field of view, necessitating advanced mapping techniques. Traditional LiDAR mapping systems often encounter issues with accuracy and stability due to the degradation of point cloud registration performance, which is affected by dynamic objects on the road. This research emphasizes the need for a swift, precise, and stable LiDAR mapping system, particularly in high-speed and urban environments. We propose an algorithm that effectively removes points from dynamic objects in real-time through a two-stage road surface extraction process, improving the accuracy and stability of point cloud registration in LiDAR odometry by optimizing variable reduction and integrating dead reckoning with in-vehicle sensors. This approach allows for more accurate and stable road surface mapping around the vehicle, even in the presence of numerous dynamic objects and with mass-produced LiDARs. Our algorithm, tested in various terrains and both urban and highway settings, showed significant improvements in mapping accuracy and computational speed, approximately 16% and 45%, respectively, over current state-of-the-art methods, as validated through quantitative comparisons with high-precision mapping equipment.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, a novel Enhanced Kinematic (E-Kinematic) model for Heavy-Duty Buses (HDBs) is suggested and employed to construct a robust Model Predictive Control (MPC) system for efficient path tracking. The E-Kinematic model is derived from actual vehicle yaw motion data, with its efficacy validated at both low and high speeds through frequency domain analysis. This model is then utilized in the development of a robust MPC system for the improved path tracking performance. To enhance the path tracking performance of HDBs, a new reference trajectory is introduced within the delay frame to account for the vehicle's inherent lateral motion delay. This approach prompts the vehicle to adhere to the reference trajectory based on its anticipated future state, effectively considering lateral motion delay of the vehicle. Furthermore, the output constraints of the MPC controller are designed to take into account the geometric characteristics of the vehicle, such as sidewalls and overhangs, to prevent potential lane boundary intrusion. Techniques of constraint tightening and smoothing are applied to ensure robust control in the presence of model uncertainty. The performance of the proposed system is comprehensively validated through simulations and real vehicle experiments over various curvatures.},

The prevalence of congested roads not only results in delays, increased fuel consumption, environmental pollution, and a reduced quality of life, but also contributes to lowered productivity due to the time wasted in the search for available street parking. Current solutions are either tailored solely for detecting vacant spaces within parking lots or rely on unfeasible street sensors and stationary surveillance cameras, falling short in accurately pinpointing individual free street parking spots. In this paper, we introduce an innovative street parking detection and localization system designed to cater to both human-driven and autonomous vehicles. Our solution is specifically engineered to be integrated into modern vehicles, utilizing the live video feed from the car's built-in navigation and obstacle avoidance cameras. This approach combines convolutional neural networks, our video global motion analysis, and an innovative distance measurement technique to achieve accurate detection and precise localization of unoccupied street parking spaces. Our solution eliminates the impact of vehicle speed, duplicate detection of identical parking spots during sudden stops, and delivers outstanding accuracy while maintaining low computational costs and complexity. We also introduce a unique dataset tailored for this objective, serving as the cornerstone for training and assessing well established object detection network architectures.

This research concentrates on mixed traffic scenarios in the near future, which capitalize on the implications of AVs on the transportation system and environment. How to co-exist with AVs in a complex environment is quite an unfamiliar challenge for human drivers of conventional vehicles. To conquer the difficulty, we investigate the behavioral response of human-driven vehicles (HVs) to AVs in multiple mixed traffic situations based on the real-world trajectory dataset and propose the driving characteristic indicator based on machine learning to conduct the quantitative comparison of different car-following (CF) behaviors. Additionally, to precisely replicate the driving features of HVs and longitudinal control of AVs in mixed traffic, a microscopic behavior modeling framework consisting of model-based and data-driven CF strategies is designed, which accurately reproduces the sophisticated microscopic behavior and maintains the interpretability of the intrinsic controller mechanism. Furthermore, simulation experiments on a real-world urban-scale network in Suzhou, China are performed to thoroughly evaluate the implications of widespread implementation of AVs under different market penetration rates (MPRs). The result indicates that the low penetration rate may exert adverse effects on the mixed traffic environment.},

Due to the improvement of vehicle perception capabilities, vision-based road surface condition recognition has gained more attention in recent years. Nevertheless, the existing methods are mainly based on CNN, and perform poorly on texture-like data such as road surfaces due to their failure to capture spatial layouts accurately or leverage shallow low-level visual features. To address this problem, we propose a novel network based on fractal geometric dimensions, which primarily emphasizes the analysis of fractal dimensional statistical information extracted from road surface texture features within the color space rather than the coordinate space. Specifically, we propose a Point Repackage Block (PRB) module to effectively segment the feature maps into sub-feature groups based on statistical similarity, which enables the exchange of texture features information on the road surfaces, as well as the reorganization of the feature maps with similar attributes across all channels. In addition, a FractalHead module is employed to conduct fractal geometric statistics on the sub-feature groups in the color space. Finally, we combine the local orderless descriptors generated by FractalHead and the spatial information accumulated by GAP to achieve road surface condition recognition. Through extensive experiments conducted on a dedicated road surface dataset against the other methods, the superiority of the proposed method is demonstrated.},

  abstract     = {A long-range and robust perception system plays a crucial role in advancing research and deployment of autonomous driving. 4D radar, as an emerging range sensor, offers superior resilience to adverse weather conditions than lidar and provides elevation measurement compared to 3D radar. Existing 4D radar datasets, emphasizing robust and multimodal perception, typically combine camera, lidar, and 4D radar. However, they often lack long-range capability due to limited annotations. Furthermore, the configuration of their single short-focus camera fails to effectively match a long-range 4D radar. To overcome these limitations, we present a novel long-range multimodal dataset. It encompasses high-resolution and long-range sensors, including forward-facing cameras, a 360° lidar, and a front-mounted 4D radar, along with detailed annotations for 3D objects across 11.2K key frames in different scenarios and weather conditions. Particularly, our dataset introduces, for the first time, three cameras with different focal lengths, enabling simultaneous capture of images with varying perception ranges. It serves as a valuable resource for developing accurate long-range perception algorithms. Remarkably, our dataset achieves the longest annotation ranges among comparable 4D radar datasets, spanning up to 220 meters. It supports applications such as 3D object detection and tracking, as well as facilitates the study of multimodal tasks. Through rigorous experiments, we validate the efficacy of our dataset and offer valuable insights into long-range 3D object detection.},

However, the dynamic environment makes the gap between the simulated and realistic environment larger, so the self-adaptability of the decision-making model is an essential capability for IUAS to realize simulation to reality. Although many scholars use a large number of accurate annotation data to improve the performance of a decision-making model, methods of this nature need to consume a lot of human and material resources, especially those scenes never been seen before. In this paper, to improve unmanned systems' adaptability in dynamic environments, we propose an adaptive meta-reinforcement learning (AMRL) algorithm for simulation to reality. In AMRL, we build a task pool to ensure that the intelligent agent has “seen much and knows much” capability under limited resources. In addition, by introducing a curiosity mechanism and a prioritized experience replay mechanism, the intelligent agent can preferentially learn high-quality samples in a dynamic scene. As a result, the adaptability of the intelligent agent to complex and dynamic scenarios has been improved, especially in scenarios not seen before. Finally, combining a feature fusion method of multiple types of perception information, the AMRL algorithm is extended to an adaptive decision-making framework for simulation to reality. The experimental results show that our proposed AMRL has advantages over other state-of-the-art algorithms. It can complete tasks efficiently in dynamically changing virtual scenes and has good adaptability in real scenes.},

In this work, we propose a novel Lane-aware Dynamic Spatio-temporal Transformer, called DSTformer, for effective and accurate vehicle trajectory prediction. The system aims to improve the robustness of autonomous vehicles by incorporating lane-aware scene constraints and utilizing both dynamic activities and scene context information. Specifically, we incorporate two masking methods to mitigate the impact of deviations and uncertainties from temporal and geographic spatial propagation views. Vehicles' trajectories that violate the expected lane-following rules are penalized via the Transformer-based modeling. Semantic neighborhood information is also employed via a graph masking method to capture the long-range spatial dependencies in traffic data. Additionally, the centerline waypoints based map structure is used to capture the vehicle-lane relations and enable multimodal trajectory prediction. Experimental results on the real-world dataset demonstrate that the proposed framework is resilient to imperfect data and achieves competitive performance with fewer parameters compared to current state-of-the-art prediction methods.},

LiDAR-based methods could work under visual appearance-changing conditions, such as season or weather changes, and different times of a day. However, these methods require every vehicle to be equipped with a 3-D LiDAR during the online localization stage, resulting in high costs for the vehicles. To alleviate this issue, we propose a cross-modal place recognition network, which can localize vehicles with visual images obtained from a low-cost monocular camera against a pre-built LiDAR point-cloud database. To this end, we first bridge the modality gap between visual images and point clouds via modality alignment. Then, we propose an orientation voting module to suppress the recognition ambiguity caused by the inconsistent field-of-view between images and point clouds, thereby improving the place recognition accuracy. Experiments are conducted with three public datasets: KITTI, KITTI-360, and Oxford RobotCar, covering over 71.6 KM of vehicle trajectories in 12 urban and suburban regions in two countries. The results demonstrate the superiority of our network.},

Additionally, existing dynamic scene modeling methods typically employ deformation fields to map points at different time steps into canonical space. However, inappropriate canonical spaces struggle to smoothly accommodate motion. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a multi-resolution hybrid explicit representation for novel view synthesis of dynamic scenes. Specifically, we introduce an efficient hybrid feature representation for dynamic scenes that combines multi-resolution 3D hash grids and dense 2D plane features. Compared to dense voxel grid representations, two-dimensional planes can more effectively enlarge resolution, compensating for reconstruction errors in dynamic areas with minimal parameters and time costs. Moreover, we utilize a self-adaptive deformation module to learn canonical moments and identify optimal canonical moments across arbitrary scenes. Our method achieves commendable rendering fidelity while maintaining compact model sizes. We evaluate our approach in both synthetic and real-world environments and compare it to state-of-the-art techniques. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves superior or comparable rendering quality and is more computationally efficient (more than 100 times faster than the original D-NeRF).},

To address the issues of lengthy search paths and high duplicate coverage in the Bio-Inspired Neural Network (BINN) algorithm, this paper proposes a CCPP algorithm based on the A*-Improved Bio-Inspired Neural Network (A-IBINN). Firstly, the connection weights and the neural activity values within the cells in the BINN are calculated, thereby covering a larger area. Secondly, in order to shorten the coverage path length, when the USV gets trapped in a local search dead zone, the A* heuristic function is introduced to generate a globally optimal search path to the scattered free cells. Thirdly, an optimized BINN local path planning strategy is proposed to achieve full coverage more effectively by decreasing duplicate coverage. Thus, the USV can map the desired areas with low duplicate coverage and economic energy consumption. In this paper, the experimental results of different CCPP methods are compared through simulations and lake experiments, validating the effectiveness of the A-IBINN.},

  abstract     = {Visual object tracking is a fundamental component of transportation systems, especially for intelligent driving. Despite achieving state-of-the-art performance in visual tracking, recent single-branch trackers tend to overlook the weak prior assumptions associated with the Vision Transformer (ViT) encoder and inference pipeline in visual tracking. Moreover, the effectiveness of discriminative trackers remains constrained due to the adoption of the dual-branch pipeline. To tackle the inferior effectiveness of vanilla ViT, we propose an Adaptive ViT Model Prediction tracker (AViTMP) to design a customised tracking method. This method bridges the single-branch network with discriminative models for the first time. Specifically, in the proposed encoder AViT encoder, we introduce a tracking-tailored Adaptor module for vanilla ViT and a joint target state embedding to enrich the target-prior embedding paradigm. Then, we combine the AViT encoder with a discriminative transformer-specific model predictor to predict the accurate location. Furthermore, to mitigate the limitations of conventional inference practice, we present a novel inference pipeline called CycleTrack, which bolsters the tracking robustness in the presence of distractors via bidirectional cycle tracking verification. In the experiments, we evaluated AViTMP on eight tracking benchmarks for a comprehensive assessment, including LaSOT, LaSOTExtSub, AVisT, etc. The experimental results unequivocally establish that, under fair comparison, AViTMP achieves state-of-the-art performance, especially in terms of long-term tracking and robustness.},

  abstract     = {Resource allocation in dense vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication networks poses intricate challenges due to scalability issues, dynamic environments, and diverse quality of service requirements. Traditional optimizations like genetic algorithms struggle with computational complexity and dynamic planning. Meanwhile, pure multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL)—a type of machine learning where multiple agents learn to optimize their decisions through interactions with each other and the environment—faces the curse of dimensionality and communication overhead, which limits the large-scale deployment of dynamic vehicular networks. This paper proposes an innovative approach to joint spectrum allocation and power control within dense V2X networks, conceptualizing it as an MARL-based multi-objective optimization problem. To mitigate computational demands, we adopt a hybrid approach combining centralized-training-with-decentralized-execution paradigm, alongside parameter-sharing techniques, within classic Mean-Field MARL (MF-MARL) framework, and name it Scalable-V2X-MF-MARL (ScalV-MF-MARL), enabling a lightweight training process in dense V2X networks with numerous V2V agents. It also technically encodes observations and mean field of actions, thereby enhancing the model's dynamism and scalability. This advancement permits the application of a single model across varying vehicle densities. Experimental results demonstrate that ScalV-MF-MARL achieves 99.5% of the performance of density-specific MF-MARL models, while reducing GPU memory usage by 79.49% to 94.03% during training as vehicle number increases from 40 to 160. Additionally, it outstrips conventional algorithms. Its generalization capabilities across diverse V2X network densities facilitate training in less dense scenarios, with seamless application to denser networks. In conclusion, ScalV-MF-MARL streamlines the V2X network deployment and effectively handles dynamic changes in vehicle numbers.},

  abstract     = {Object detection for autonomous haulage trucks in open-pit mines is challenging due to unstructured environments. Collecting and annotating large-scale real-world images in these harsh conditions is extremely expensive. Inspired by parallel vision, virtual images have been used to supplement real-world data. However, models trained on virtual data exhibit poor performance in real mines due to the simulation-to-real (sim2real) domain shift. To address this issue, a human-in-the-loop algorithm called Active Parallel Teacher (APT) is introduced to select and annotate real images for sim2real object detection, in which the gradient information of a mean-teacher architecture is formulated as an important indicator for sample selection. Based on the gradient embeddings, three active sampling metrics are designed to measure sample importance from different perspectives including uncertainty, inter-domain difference, and diversity of target domain. Following that, an adaptive budget allocation strategy is presented to achieve the trade-off between uncertainty and difference along with different model training stages, with the purpose of maximizing the performance gain of human annotations. Finally, a Mean Teacher based domain adaptation process is developed to leverage fine-tuning and mix-training techniques to full utilize both labeled and unlabeled real data. Experimental results on the open-pit mine dataset demonstrate that our method can outperform other domain adaptation methods and attains 91% of the performance achieved under fully supervised conditions with only 7.5% of the real data labeled.},

  abstract     = {Fog computing reduces network latency by moving computational resources close to where the data is generated. Vehicular fog computing (VFC) is an emerging computing paradigm where fog nodes deployed on moving vehicles (i.e., vehicular fog nodes (VFNs)) complement stationary fog nodes (e.g., the ones co-located with cellular base stations) to satisfy the spatio-temporally varying demand for computing resources in a cost-efficient manner. On-demand VFC (ODVFC) supports the dynamic routing of VFNs to the places where demand emerges. Different from previous works on capacity planning and vehicle routing that utilize compute-intensive optimization methods such as integer linear programming (ILP), this paper explores the feasibility of applying reinforcement learning to dynamic capacity planning in a time-efficient manner. Specifically, we propose to apply the multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) method (i.e., actor-critic) to learn the VFN routing policies. This approach allows distributed VFNs to cooperatively maximize the techno-economic performance of ODVFC. For evaluation, we built an open-source VFC simulation platform that integrates vehicular traffic simulation with 5G NR V2X and MARL environment. Compared with decentralized learning (i.e., each VFN independently learns its routing policy), centralized learning (i.e., using a global agent for VFN routing), and ILP methods, our proposal proves to achieve 8.3% higher revenue and 13.2% higher number of served tasks than decentralized training; and it has 40.6% and 83% lower execution time than centralized learning and ILP, respectively, with only 14% lower revenue than both. It is also scalable to real-life scenarios with a great number of users and VFNs.},

These rigorous characteristics of the actual application scenarios and tasks always make global searching difficult to be optimized and local obstacle avoidance into deadlock. To solve the above problems, this paper introduces a hierarchical online collaborative planning framework inspired by global spatio-temporal paths. In order to reduce the solution complexity while dissolving the overall conflict, global rough searching is conducted for initial spatio-temporal guidance path. To overcome dynamic obstacles without affecting the system internal harmony, online conflict-trend-based clustering co-optimization inspired by the initial path is performed to achieve obstacle avoidance while improving scalability. Experimental tests were conducted in simulation environments with narrow pipelines and dynamic obstacles with comparison to current mainstream centralized and distributed methods. The results demonstrate that our work can generate smoother and safer trajectories with higher success rate in the constraint-rich dynamic environments.},

  abstract     = {Vehicle parking resource provisioning in major cities and urban areas has gradually become a challenging issue in Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) due to the upward trend in car ownership rates. Besides, the increasing attractiveness of Autonomous Electric Vehicle (AEV) technologies complicates the parking problem as self-parking and EV-charging solutions need to be integrated into existing parking infrastructure. Dynamic pricing and reservation-based automated parking and charging are envisioned to accommodate the increasing demand for parking and EV-charging services. This will minimize traffic congestion and enhance road safety. This paper proposes a novel intelligent framework based on dynamic pricing and in-advance parking and charging reservations for Automated Valet Parking and Charging (AVPC) scenarios. We formulate the dynamic pricing problem between a Parking Lot Manager (PLM) and multiple Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) as a twostage Stackelberg game in which the PLM, as the leader, sets its service price in the first stage to maximize its utility, and each AV, as a follower, determines its service demand in the second stage to maximize its utility. Then, we theoretically prove the existence and uniqueness of the Stackelberg Equilibrium (SE). Considering the stochastic nature of the parking traffic, we transform the game-based optimization problem into a Multi-Agent Markov Decision Process (MAMDP) and propose a Stackelberg Game-aided Multi-Agent Dueling Deep Q-Network (SG-MADDQN) algorithm to solve the problem. Comprehensive simulation results and analysis prove that the proposed algorithm achieves convergence and can best balance the pricing and demand strategies of the PLM and AVs compared with existing solutions.},

While several works proposed a way to describe such driving scenarios called Operational Design Domain (ODD), their syntax still lacks formal semantics, which makes it difficult to design trustworthy compilers—a software that converts an abstract scenario expressed in ODDs into a concrete scenario executable in a virtual environment. We propose a systematic way to formalize the lane-level driving scenarios described using a subset of ASAM OpenSCENARIO syntax. In particular, our formalization exploits the concept of separating concerns in which an abstract scenario is described without exposing the low-level behavioral details of autonomous driving; the details can then be auto-filled during the concrete scenario generation via different objectives. We define the decision variables that need to be determined when generating concrete scenarios; then, we propose a set of constraint categories that restrict the valuation space of the variables according to the syntactic structure of an abstract scenario. We implemented two compiler designs as exemplar based on two solvers: one with SMT (Satisfiability Modulo Theories) and another MILP (Mixed-Integer Linear Programming) solvers, and show the qualitative and quantitative analysis of concrete scenarios auto-generated from an abstract one.},

During the tasks, path planning plays an important role in achieving the autonomous operation of the vehicle. The path planning process faces the following challenge. Under inevitable flight faults, reasonable mode switching decisions are required to obtain different short and energy-efficient multi-mode paths. To address this, a flight-fault-aware path planning strategy using game learning approach is proposed. Firstly, by constructing a two-layer game framework, Nash equilibrium solutions are solved for air-ground mode switching. The above framework includes the distance layer and energy consumption layer. Secondly, considering the multi-mode movement capability, a newly designed reward function expands the passable areas. Based on the above, an improved update rule constantly updates a new Q table to obtain a short and energy-efficient multi-mode path. Thirdly, under different faults, optimal flight conditions are solved to regain Nash equilibrium solutions for new multi-mode paths. Finally, the proposed strategy is verified in maps of different sizes. Under each fault, this strategy provides short and energy-efficient multi-mode paths of the evader and pursuer. The former focuses on shorter path distance, while the latter focuses on less energy consumption. They are selected for different task requirements.},

  abstract     = {Traversability analysis is of vital importance for autonomous vehicle navigation in outdoor environments. This paper focuses on the navigation algorithms in outdoor environments with water hazards, where the water areas can neither simply be neglected nor be deemed as non-traversable for safe and efficient navigation. To this end, we present a tightly-integrated navigation algorithms framework, which includes an environmental traversability analysis model and a control signal acquisition model. The traversability analysis model includes the SwinT-CGRU semantic segmentation model and the ConvCRFs water analysis model proposed in this paper. SwinT-CGRU can efficiently extract the feature from the input successive images, providing initial analysis of environmental traversability. To further analyze the water region, we employ a ConvCRFs, which determines the water traversability in an effective way. The results of the water traversability analysis are convincing for reliable vehicle navigation in outdoor scenarios. Based on the traversability analysis results, we propose a path planning approach by adapting the artificial potential field method to the image space. The control signal for steering and driving the vehicle can be acquired through an established mapping from the image space to the vehicle space. Experiments demonstrate that our segmentation model improves mIoU by 2.09-18.21% on the RELLIS-3D dataset. Furthermore, our navigation algorithm exhibits real-time performance and stability, ensuring the safety of vehicles in outdoor environments.},

  abstract     = {This study examines the impact of conditionally automated driving vehicles (CADVs) handing control over to human drivers on the string stability of mixed traffic. It specifically considers various penetration rates of CADVs and different time-to-collision (TTC) thresholds set at 5, 7, and 9 s. To gather relevant vehicle trajectory data, driving simulator tests were performed, capturing both the normal car-following and the post-takeover processes. Then, the intelligent driver model parameters were calibrated for these two processes, respectively. Additionally, a car-following model was developed to incorporate the dynamic takeover process of CADVs within the heterogeneous traffic. Theoretical analysis was conducted to determine the string stability boundary of heterogeneous traffic, with numerical simulation tests performed to validate the results. The results indicate that the transition of control from CADVs to human drivers significantly contributed to the instability of mixed traffic. Specifically, a higher TTC correlated with more CADVs transferring control to human drivers. The increase in the takeover rate from CADVs to human drivers resulted in pronounced instability within heterogeneous traffic flows. Additionally, the simultaneous control transition of multiple CADVs was associated with reduced minimum platoon speed, exacerbating traffic congestion. Conversely, enhancing the permeability of CADVs led to smoother traffic conditions and suppressed the formation of unstable traffic waves. The findings underscore the significant impact that the transition of control from CADVs to human drivers has on the stability of heterogeneous traffic. This lays a crucial foundation for implementing cooperative safety control measures within such traffic systems. Moreover, implementing a 5-second takeover request lead time in automated driving systems can effectively reduce the takeover rate of CADVs, thereby enhancing overall traffic stability.},

  abstract     = {Typically, object detection methods for autonomous driving that rely on supervised learning make the assumption of a consistent feature distribution between the training and testing data, this such assumption may fail in different weather conditions. Due to the domain gap, a detection model trained under clear weather may not perform well in foggy and rainy conditions. Overcoming detection bottlenecks in foggy and rainy weather is a real challenge for autonomous vehicles deployed in the wild. To bridge the domain gap and improve the performance of object detection in foggy and rainy weather, this paper presents a novel framework for domain-adaptive object detection. The adaptations at both the image-level and object-level are intended to minimize the differences in image style and object appearance between domains. Furthermore, in order to improve the model's performance on challenging examples, we introduce a novel adversarial gradient reversal layer that conducts adversarial mining on difficult instances in addition to domain adaptation. Additionally, we suggest generating an auxiliary domain through data augmentation to enforce a new domain-level metric regularization. Experimental findings on public benchmark exhibit a substantial enhancement in object detection specifically for foggy and rainy driving scenarios.

This context is particularly illustrative in scenarios where robots are tasked to charge electric vehicles. The algorithm begins by partitioning a composite task sequence into distinct subsets based on spatial similarity principles. Subsequently, we employ a coalition formation game paradigm to coordinate the assembly of robots into cooperative coalitions focused on these distinct subsets. To mitigate the impact of unpredictable task demands on allocations, our approach utilizes the conditional value-at-risk to assess the risk associated with task execution, along with computing the potential revenue of the coalition with an emphasis on risk-related outcomes. Additionally, integrating consensus auctions into the coalition formation framework allows our approach to accommodate assignments for individual robot-task pairings, thus preserving the stability of individual robotic decision autonomy within the coalition structure and assignment distribution. Simulative analyses on a prototypical parking facility layout confirm that our algorithm achieves Nash equilibrium within the coalition structure in polynomial time and demonstrates significant scalability. Compared to competing algorithms, our proposal exhibits superior performance in resilience, task execution efficiency, and reduced overall task completion times. The results demonstrate that our approach is an effective strategy for solving the scheduling challenges encountered by multi-robot systems operating in complex environments.},

Despite significant advancements in this area, there is a need to enhance the performance of most existing techniques when dealing with complex large-scale scenarios due to disruptions caused by unstable information. The presence of those unstable data not only increases unnecessary computational load but also results in erroneous matches. In response, this paper presents a novel visual relocation algorithm based on saliency matching. We first use the reprojection error and uncertainty of map points to calculate the saliency values of the image, reducing the subjective bias that exists in the artificial definition of saliency. Then, we incorporate the saliency mechanism into the local matching, effectively filtering out distracting information and generating more accurate and robust matching relationships for the final pose determination. Finally, we assess the efficacy of our proposed algorithm by comparing it to other algorithms across numerous publicly available datasets.

  abstract     = {Reliable and cost-effective localization is of great importance for the realization of intelligent vehicles (IV) in complex scenes. The visual-inertial odometry (VIO) can provide high-frequency position estimation over time but is subjected to drift over time. Recently developed map-aided VIO opens a new window for drift-free visual localization but the existing loosely coupled integration fails to fully explore the complementariness of all the raw measurements. Moreover, the observability of the existing map-aided VIO is still to be investigated, which is of great importance for the safety-critical IV. To fill these gaps, in this article, we propose a factor graph-based state estimator that tightly couples a 3D lightweight prior line map with a VIO system and rigorous observability analysis. In particular, for the cross-modality matching between 3D prior maps and 2D images, we first utilize the geometric line structure coexisting in the 3D map and 2D image to build the line feature association model. More importantly, an efficient line-tracking strategy is designed to reject the potential line feature-matching outliers. Meanwhile, a new line feature-based cost model is proposed as a constraint for factor graph optimization with proof of the rationality behind this model. Moreover, we also analyze the observability of the proposed prior line feature-aided VIO system for the first time, the result shows that x, y, and z three global translations are observable and the system only has one unobservable direction theoretically, i.e. the yaw angle around the gravity vector. The proposed system is evaluated on both simulation outdoor and real-world indoor environments, and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods.},

  abstract     = {The planning and control subsystem is essential to the autonomous driving system. The prevailing algorithmic architecture follows a hierarchical design: the planning subsystem generates a safe trajectory based on the surrounding environment, and the control subsystem guides the vehicle driving along this trajectory. However, due to the limitations of the vehicle dynamics, in specific emergencies or on low-adhesion road surfaces, the generated trajectory may not be compatible with the vehicle's tracking ability, potentially resulting in difficulties in trajectory tracking or overly conservative trajectory generation. This paper proposes an integrated planning and control framework based on the artificial potential field and neural network vehicle model to address the above issue. Utilizing a neural network to model the vehicle not only ensures model accuracy but also empowers it with the capability to adapt to diverse road surfaces. The traffic environment is represented as an artificial potential field model using improved potential field functions. In a unified optimization framework, the above two aspects are combined to generate safe and efficient vehicle control commands directly. The test results under urgent scenarios and low-adhesion road surfaces indicate that the proposed method consistently keeps the vehicle within safe and stable boundaries while achieving driving objectives. It produces smoother driving trajectories and smaller lateral accelerations compared to hierarchical algorithms.},

  abstract     = {In vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANETs), ensuring passenger safety requires fast and reliable emergency message broadcasts. The current communication standard for messaging in VANETs is IEEE 802.11p. As IEEE 802.11p allows carrier-sense multiple access with collision avoidance (CSMA/CA) in the media access control (MAC) layer. A large contention window ($CW$) value will increase delay, whereas a small $CW$ value will increase the probability of collision. Therefore, adaptive regulation of the $CW$ value is needed to achieve high reliability and low delay in VANETs, in accordance with variations in the environment. However, the traditional MAC protocol cannot achieve the aforementioned requirements. Reinforcement learning (RL) emphasizes the selection of optimal action according to observations of the environment to achieve optimal system performance. In this study, a Q-learning (QL) RL algorithm based on IEEE 802.11p was used to achieve the requirements of adaptive broadcasting. Adaptive broadcasting was achieved based on a reward definition of high reliability and low delay for the QL algorithm. In this approach, the learning state is the $CW$ size, the system sets up a Q-table using RL, and the optimal action is based on the maximum Q-value. The $CW$ size can be provided with adaptive self-regulation by RL, providing high reliability and low delay for the broadcast of emergency messages. We also compared our proposed scheme to other QL-based MAC protocols in VANETs by performing simulations and demonstrated that it can achieve high reliability and low delay for the broadcast of emergency messages.},

Currently, point-line VINS have attracted significant attention due to their increased robustness and accuracy compared to point-only VINS. However, their effectiveness relies on the existence of clear line structures within the scene. Point-line VINS may become inaccurate or fail when scenes contain scattered lines or other features like arcs. Moreover, extracting and matching line features can bring computational overheads due to complex geometric models. In order to address VINS challenges without the overheads related to lines, we propose a novel approach, denoted as PE-VINS, which adds edge features to point-based VINS. Our proposed employs edge features in scenes to establish extra correspondences between views and then enhance its accuracy and robustness. Our method identifies edge features using image gradients and selects the most informative ones in the front end. We leverage sparse optical flow to track selected edge features and triangulate them using the initial pose predicted by the Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU). In the back end, we present a novel edge feature residual formulation that differs from the traditional reprojection residual. We tightly couple the new edge residual with the reprojection and IMU preintegration residual to better refine camera poses.

Though existing notable efforts have resulted in impressive performance improvements, a gap persists in scene cognitive and understanding of complex traffic semantics. This paper proposes Traj-LLM, the first to investigate the potential of using pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) without explicit prompt engineering to generate future motions from vehicular past trajectories and traffic scene semantics. Traj-LLM starts with sparse context joint encoding to dissect the agent and scene features into a form that LLMs understand. On this basis, we creatively explore LLMs' strong understanding capability to capture a spectrum of high-level scene knowledge and interactive information. To emulate the human-like lane focus cognitive function and enhance Traj-LLM's scene comprehension, we introduce lane-aware probabilistic learning powered by the Mamba module. Finally, a multi-modal Laplace decoder is designed to achieve scene-compliant predictions. Extensive experiments manifest that Traj-LLM, fueled by prior knowledge and understanding prowess of LLMs, together with lane-aware probability learning, transcends the state-of-the-art methods across most evaluation metrics. Moreover, the few-shot analysis serves to substantiate Traj-LLM's performance, as even with merely 50% of the dataset, it surpasses the majority of benchmarks relying on complete data utilization. This study explores endowing the trajectory prediction task with advanced capabilities inherent in LLMs, furnishing a more universal and adaptable solution for forecasting agent movements in a new way.},

  abstract     = {Vision sensors are widely applied in vehicles, robots, and roadside infrastructure. However, due to limitations in hardware cost and system size, camera Field-of-View (FoV) is often restricted and may not provide sufficient coverage. Nevertheless, from a spatiotemporal perspective, it is possible to obtain information beyond the camera's physical FoV from past video streams. In this paper, we propose the concept of online video inpainting for autonomous vehicles to expand the field of view, thereby enhancing scene visibility, perception, and system safety. To achieve this, we introduce the FlowLens architecture, which explicitly employs optical flow and implicitly incorporates a novel clip-recurrent transformer for feature propagation. FlowLens offers two key features: 1) FlowLens includes a newly designed Clip-Recurrent Hub with 3D-Decoupled Cross Attention (DDCA) to progressively process global information accumulated over time. 2) It integrates a multi-branch Mix Fusion Feed Forward Network (MixF3N) to enhance the precise spatial flow of local features. To facilitate training and evaluation, we derive the KITTI360 dataset with various FoV mask, which covers both outer- and inner FoV expansion scenarios. We also conduct both quantitative assessments and qualitative comparisons of beyond-FoV semantics and beyond-FoV object detection across different models. We illustrate that employing FlowLens to reconstruct unseen scenes even enhances perception within the field of view by providing reliable semantic context.

  abstract     = {Accurately estimating the road slope and mass of a tractor-trailer is crucial from a control perspective as it significantly impacts the dynamic behavior. However, achieving accurate estimation of these variables poses a challenge, especially in scenarios involving mass variations due to loading on the semi-trailer. This difficulty arises from the need to appropriately decouple among the longitudinal acceleration, the acceleration due to road slope and acceleration sensor bias due to pitch angle. To solve this difficulty, this study proposes a road slope and mass estimation framework that accounts for changes in pitch angle. Firstly, a kinematic model is introduced including the longitudinal acceleration and the pitch angle. Secondly, a physically feasible neural network-based pitch angle estimator is designed to determine the pitching effect in the longitudinal acceleration sensor data. The input features are derived based on the pitch dynamics, and pitch bias is additionally introduced to consider the mass variation during weight loading/unloading. Then, a Kalman Filter (KF) is designed to estimate the longitudinal acceleration and slope angle with considering the estimated pitch angle. Finally, a Recursive Least Squares (RLS)-based mass estimation method is presented utilizing the estimated longitudinal acceleration and the estimated road slope. Outlier data are filtered using the Random Sample Consensus (RANSAC) algorithm to improve the performance of the RLS. The proposed estimation method is validated through simulations.},

First, a modified extended state observer (ESO) is proposed to simultaneously achieve the state recovery of position-heading and non-measurable velocities under unknown dynamics and external disturbances. To eliminate the effect of multiple faults, separated adaptive compensation mechanisms are introduced to estimate various fault factors individually. Based on the proposed ESO and estimated factors, an adaptive output-feedback MFTC strategy is explored to stabilize the closed-loop control system in the presence of multiple faults. It is proven that the proposed controller guarantees that all signals in the closed-loop control system are bounded, including tracking error, observer error, and estimation errors.

  abstract     = {Accurately tracking the location of vehicles in real-time is crucial for mobile navigation services. However, detecting that the vehicle is off-route can be challenging when drivers stray from the pre-planned route. Traditional GNSS-based solutions are often unreliable due to noisy signals, leading to erratic location errors and delayed alarms when the vehicle enters an off-route area. This paper presents a novel off-route detection framework, ForkTracker, which combines image, Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), and Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) information to track vehicles and predict whether they will deviate. Specifically, a lightweight deep learning model is used to extract driving direction from images, and inertial readings are utilized for event detection, such as lane shifts. Finally, the multi-source data is fused through a Sequential Monte Carlo framework to produce the vehicle's real-time position. We have implemented a prototype and conducted experiments on real-world data. The results show that our system can effectively predict the driving direction before the off-route occurs, with a proportion of 97.3% in advance and 14.1 m on average.},

Unlike existing approaches to driving hazard prediction that rely on computational simulations or anomaly detection from videos, this study focuses on high-level inference from static images. The problem needs predicting and reasoning about future events based on uncertain observations, which falls under visual abductive reasoning. To enable research in this understudied area, a new dataset named the DHPR (Driving Hazard Prediction and Reasoning) dataset is created. The dataset consists of 15 K dashcam images of street scenes, and each image is associated with a tuple containing car speed, a hypothesized hazard description, and visual entities present in the scene. These are annotated by human annotators, who identify risky scenes and provide descriptions of potential accidents that could occur a few seconds later. We present several baseline methods and evaluate their performance on our dataset, identifying remaining issues and discussing future directions.

To extract intricate correlations among multiple vehicle-based speed time series, previous methods have used graph convolution networks. However, the conventional static and dynamic graphs fail to reflect the traffic evolution and the hysteresis spatial influence caused by vehicle movement. To address this issue, we propose a novel cross-time dynamic graph-based deep learning model, named CDGNet, for vehicle-based traffic speed forecasting. The model is able to effectively capture hysteresis spatial dependencies between each time slice and its historical time slices through the cross-time dynamic graph-based GCN. Meanwhile, a gating mechanism is integrated into our cross-time dynamic graph, which conforms to the sparse correlation in the real world. Besides, GCNs are incorporated into a novel encoder-decoder architecture to forecast multi-step speed. Experimental results on three real-world vehicle-based traffic speed datasets demonstrate the superiority of our CDGNet over various state-of-the-art spatio-temporal forecasting methods and the effectiveness of each component. We additionally provide a visualization of our cross-time dynamic graph to show the capability of assisting intelligent vehicles to avoid congestion.},

This paper presents a novel cascade control approach based on a port-controlled Hamiltonian model that incorporates position, velocity, and flow loops to improve the robustness and stability of path-tracking in tracked vehicles. Firstly, the nonlinear kinematic model undergoes an equivalent transformation to tackle the challenge of converting the hydraulic-tracked vehicle kinematic model into a port-controlled Hamiltonian model. The effectiveness of this substitution is evaluated through a phase portrait analysis. Subsequently, an interconnection and damping assignment passivity-based controller is formulated to achieve position control and generate a desired velocity reference. Leveraging the dynamics of the tracked vehicle, a velocity controller is developed to calculate the desired vehicle torque and hydraulic motor angular velocity, facilitating velocity tracking. Flow control is realized through a novel passivity-based L2-gain robust control method designed in conjunction with the port-controlled Hamiltonian model. This method empowers the electro-hydraulic servo system to track the desired angular velocity at the expected torque, mitigating the adverse impact of the electro-hydraulic servo system on the tracking performance of tracked vehicles. Finally, a comprehensive comparison is made with two existing control strategies. The results show that the overall performance of the controller is improved by 20.3% and 10.92%, and the tracking accuracy is improved by 15.01% and 5.97%, respectively.},

However, they typically focus on developing a pre-training model by learning average features from trajectory data and are difficult to learn and predict heterogeneous behavior patterns. Especially in the case of cyclists, the prediction of low-probability risky behavior is a major challenge for autonomous driving systems. Considering that cyclists are likely to express more subjectivity than vehicle drivers, this paper proposes a self-learning motion prediction framework for adaptively predicting cycling behavior based on cyclists’ psychological hidden variables. Instead of the time series modeling of traditional approaches, this framework views it as a dynamic estimation problem based on candidate trajectories. The aggressiveness and rationality levels of cyclists are set as the self-learning parameters because of their significant impact on cycling decisions. In addition, the feature identification methods and online learning strategies corresponding to the above features are proposed for self-learning. The performance of the proposed model has been verified using the bicycle trajectory data at an intersection in Shanghai, China. Compared with the state-of-the-art and baseline models, the self-learning model shows lower prediction errors. And it provides a significant improvement in complex scenarios. Then, an individual example is given to demonstrate how self-learning works. Finally, the paper visualizes and analyzes the characteristics of the psychological variables among cyclists.},

Conventional data-driven approaches for driver intention prediction models typically involve gathering extensive driver-related data, which raises significant privacy concerns. With the development of the Internet of Vehicles (IoV), federated learning (FL) has emerged as a prominent privacy-preserving learning paradigm, garnering considerable attention. However, FL encounters challenges in driver intention prediction due to the heterogeneity of driver client data and the limited computational resources of vehicles. To address these challenges, this paper proposes the FedPMR framework, comprising a computationally efficient model for predicting driver intentions. Moreover, to tackle the problem of data heterogeneity, it leverages personalized mixture representation to provide a personalized model adapted to the local data distribution of each driver client. We conducted extensive experiments on the Brain4Cars dataset, achieving an F1-score of 95.24% and a comprehensive evaluation metric of 0.9663, exceeding state-of-the-art. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed FedPMR effectively addresses the challenges encountered when applying FL to driver intention prediction.},

  abstract     = {In off-road scenes, the fusion of dual-LiDAR data is crucial for ensuring the accuracy of environmental perception in autonomous vehicles. The terrain in off-road scenes is complex and filled with unstructured information. This leads to significant noise and a lack of distinct structural features in the point cloud data, making traditional point cloud registration methods difficult to apply. To address these issues posed by complex off-road scenes, we propose a novel point cloud fusion framework named Off-Fusion. We first filter and segment the ground in the input point cloud data, focusing on preserving the core features of the ground while effectively removing noise caused by the terrain. Next, we propose a robust and efficient feature point extraction method based on voxel division and curvature weighting, ensuring extracting meaningful and representative feature points from complex off-road scenes. Based on this, we use feature matching to calculate rough relative transformation pairs, providing a high-quality starting position for the Iterative Closest Point (ICP) algorithm, effectively avoiding local optima. Finally, by combining the kd-tree accelerated ICP algorithm, we achieve precise point cloud registration, successfully calculating the optimal rotation and translation matrix between the two LiDARs. The experimental results show that our method significantly improves the quality and speed of data fusion. Compared to some of the most advanced methods, it performs better in off-road scenes, achieving the best results.},

Presently, predominant efforts are directed toward enhancing safety and efficiency in AV operations. However, the crucial aspect of human discomfort, integral to the AV user experience and capable of influencing user acceptance and eventual AV deployment, remains relatively understudied. To bridge this gap, this paper delves into the influential factors of human discomfort in AVs through human-in-the-loop studies utilizing a high-fidelity autonomous driving simulator featuring six-degrees-of-freedom motions. The investigation examined the impacts of various significant factors, including AV maneuvers, driving styles, and road types, on human discomfort. Through the application of multivariate analysis of variance and mixed logit modeling techniques, the data was quantitatively analyzed. The findings revealed the relationship between various autonomous driving factors and human discomfort, furnishing invaluable insights for the design of future autonomous vehicles.},

Communication path loss refers to the attenuation of signal strength as it propagates between transmitting and receiving vehicles. To address this issue, we model the problem of minimizing communication path loss during the formation process as a non-convex problem. In this context, a novel dynamic optimal formation control with real-time topology adaptation (DOFC) algorithm is proposed. The algorithm consists of iterative optimizer, position offset estimation and predefined-time controller, seamlessly integrating optimization and control methods. Compared to traditional optimal formation, our proposed DOFC allows for dynamic adaptation to communication topology switches and adjustments of the optimal formation during motion.

  abstract     = {3D object detection is crucial for applications like autonomous driving and robotics. However, in real-world environments, variations in sensor data distribution due to sensor upgrades, weather changes, and geographic differences can adversely affect detection performance. Semi-Supervised Domain Adaptation (SSDA) aims to mitigate these challenges by transferring knowledge from a source domain, abundant in labeled data, to a target domain where labels are scarce. This paper presents a new SSDA method referred to as Target-Oriented Domain Augmentation (TODA) specifically tailored for LiDAR-based 3D object detection. TODA efficiently utilizes all available data, including labeled data in the source domain, and both labeled data and unlabeled data in the target domain to enhance domain adaptation performance. TODA consists of two stages: TargetMix and AdvMix. TargetMix employs mixing augmentation accounting for LiDAR sensor characteristics to facilitate feature alignment between the source-domain and target-domain. AdvMix applies point-wise adversarial augmentation with mixing augmentation, which perturbs the unlabeled data to align the features within both labeled and unlabeled data in the target domain. Our experiments conducted on the challenging domain adaptation tasks demonstrate that TODA outperforms existing domain adaptation techniques designed for 3D object detection by significant margins.},

  abstract     = {Because of the numerous benefits, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) assist ground users in maintaining a satisfactory quality of service (QoS) even when they are far from terrestrial base stations (BSs) or outside the cellular coverage area. However, the limited energy capacity of UAVs restricts their operational duration. This study, therefore, investigates how to maximize energy efficiency (EE) in a UAV-enabled data collection system to prolong the network's lifespan, taking into account variations in UAV propulsion and data reception energy. The study focuses on optimizing user associations, their instantaneous transmit power allocation (PA), and UAV's trajectory while meeting users' minimum data rate requirements. This optimization problem is challenging due to its non-convex and combinatorial nature, making analytical solutions difficult. To address this, the study uses the Markov decision process (MDP) to split the problem into two sub-problems: user association with PA and UAV's optimal successive locations. These sub-problems are then solved alternately, first deriving optimal instantaneous transmit powers for each user analytically and then employing a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework based on the soft actor-critic (SAC) algorithm to acquire the UAV's optimal flying path. The proposed adaptive SAC algorithm allows the UAV to adjust its speed, heading direction, and altitude while efficiently shaping rewards to adhere to practical constraints. Numerical results validate the analysis and demonstrate significant improvements in total EE compared to benchmark deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG), twin-delayed DDPG (TD3), and particle swarm optimization (PSO) techniques, with increases of 19.29%, 7.53%, and 53.96%, respectively.},

  abstract     = {Automated Driving Systems (ADS) rely on a variety of sensors and algorithms to perceive their environment and make proper and timely driving decisions to ensure safety and efficiency. One of their critical tasks is object detection, which detects and classifies object presence with a specific emphasis on cars, pedestrians, and cyclists, in 3D space in their surroundings with the use of sensing data from those sensors, including LiDAR. 3D object detection in Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) is a challenging problem due to the complexity and variability of real-world scenarios, such as occlusions, varying lighting conditions, and diverse object shapes and sizes. Moreover, the limitations of computing power and the availability of information about the surrounding environment, combined with the quality and age of sensors installed in standalone AVs, often lead to poor perception performance. In this context, Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) have become a promising solution that can be employed to harness connectivity and external information and enhance their perception capabilities. In this paper, we provide a review of existing 3D object detection techniques based on deep learning for ADS using data from LiDAR and other sensors, as well as the architecture of CAVs and their communications, which facilitate heterogeneous networks of mobile and satellite communication technologies. We also discuss real-world and synthetic datasets for both single-vehicle and multi-view vehicles, such as vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-everything (V2X).

Adaptive scenario testing based on a surrogate model (SM) provides an effective evaluation framework.

To address this challenge, we propose a SMART-C (Surrogate Model-guided Adaptive Random Testing with Candidates) method, aiming to search for test scenarios more efficiently. This method enhances the search part of the framework, integrating guidance from the SM and the traditional search strategy, allowing for batch scenario search and testing. To verify the robustness of this approach, the performances of four typical SMs are compared across three datasets with small, medium, and large-scale lane-changing logical scenarios. Results demonstrate that the SMART-C method is superior to the original method in terms of scenario hazard prediction and hazardous scenario recall. Across all datasets and SMs, the SMART-C method significantly reduces time expenditures. Additionally, the method provides more diverse and evenly distributed test scenarios, providing vital support for accelerating safety assessments of AVs.},

  abstract     = {Visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) is a critical technique for intelligent vehicles and autonomous driving. Most SLAM systems assume the environment to be static or treat dynamic features as outliers for better localization performance. However, clear information about dynamic objects is crucial for localization and decision-making in complex environments. This paper proposes STS-SLAM, a tightly-coupled visual simultaneous localization and multi-object tracking system in dynamic scenes. It can synchronously optimize the motion of the ego-vehicle and objects and estimate object velocity without any prior information about the object. To accurately cluster features, we design a feature metric based on spatio-temporal similarity (STS), which considers the intrinsic properties and current state of the features. All static features are employed for ego-vehicle localization, and features with high STS on dynamic objects are robustly tracked. Furthermore, we propose an adaptive scaling covariance kernel (ASCK) algorithm based on STS to deal with perceptual noise and outliers, which avoids manual optimization of kernel parameters. The STS-SLAM problem is modeled as a dynamic constraint factor graph for joint optimization of dynamic and static structures. Finally, evaluation results on the KITTI tracking dataset, Oxford multi-motion dataset, and real-world scenarios show that the proposed algorithm obtains higher localization accuracy and smaller tracking errors than other state-of-the-art SLAM algorithms.},

In this paper, we present a novel control strategy that combines stochastic dynamic control method with condition-awareness for safe automated driving. In particular, the effectiveness of condition-awareness is supported by two distinct condition-monitoring functions. The first function involves the monitoring of a vehicle's internal health condition using model-based approaches. The second function involves the monitoring of a vehicle's external surrounding conditions, using machine learning and artificial intelligence approaches. For the quantification of current conditions, the results from these monitoring functions are used to create system health indices, which are then utilized by a safety control function for dynamic behavior regulation. The design of this safety control function is based on a chance-constrained model predictive control model, combined with a control barrier function for ensuring safe operation. The novelty of the proposed method lies in a systematic integration of monitored external and internal conditions, estimated component degradation, and remaining useful life, with the controller's dynamic responsiveness. The efficacy of the proposed strategy is evaluated with adaptive cruise control in the presence of various sensory uncertainties.},

These scenes come with various challenges, including navigating around crowds of people, dealing with flying plastic bags that can temporarily blind sensors, and addressing reduced LiDAR density caused by cooking smoke. Such scenarios can result in over-degeneracy, causing the map to drift. To address this issue, this paper presents a multi-map LiDAR-inertial system (MM-LINS) for the first time. The front-end employs an iterated error state Kalman filter for state estimation and introduces a reliable evaluation strategy for degeneracy detection. If over-degeneracy is detected, the active map will be stored into sleeping maps. Subsequently, the system continuously attempts to construct new maps using a dynamic initialization method to ensure successful initialization upon leaving the over-degeneracy. Regarding the back-end, the Scan Context descriptor is utilized to detect inter-map similarity. Upon successful recognition of a sleeping map that shares a common region with the active map, the overlapping trajectory region is utilized to constrain the positional transformation near the edge of the prior map. In response to this, a constraint-enhanced map fusion strategy is proposed to achieve high-precision positional and mapping results. Experiments have been conducted separately on both public datasets that exhibited over-degenerate conditions and in real-world environments. These tests demonstrated the effectiveness of MM-LINS in over-degeneracy environment.},

  abstract     = {Safety-critical scenarios for autonomous vehicle testing have been rare in the real world. However, virtual simulation technology can provide numerous and diverse testing scenarios. Various effective methods can be employed to generate unknown safety scenarios and determine dangerous scenarios for tested autonomous vehicles. To meet time-varying safety-critical scenario construction requirements for virtual testing of autonomous vehicles, this study proposes a data-model-driven method for generating the edge cases of high-risk lane-changing scenarios. The trajectory time generative adversarial network named the Traj-TimeGAN is proposed to generate emergency lane-changing trajectories based on data from HighD dataset. In addition, a safety distance-based constraint model is designed to define the safety boundary and generate the initial state of a tested autonomous vehicle. Further, a generalization generation method is developed to generate many risk-critical scenario edge cases, and a lane-changing scenario dataset is constructed. The proposed method is verified by experiments, and the average root-mean-square error for 520,000 generated emergency trajectories is $1.9 \times 10^{- 3}$, indicating a high similarity between generated and real trajectories. Based on the results, in 99.93% of the 520,000 generated risk-critical lane-changing edge cases, the absolute value of time to collision (TTC) between the tested automated vehicle and the lane-changing background vehicle is less than 1 s. Finally, the results show that the proposed method can effectively generate high-risk lane-changing edge cases for autonomous vehicle testing.},

We propose DynaNav-SVO, a stereo visual odometry (VO) framework, which semantically detects and constructs a region-of-interest (ROI) by focusing on a-priori urban fixed elements for reliable feature extraction and subsequently estimates vehicle pose. The outcome is a static map with minimal outliers and is used for state estimation in dynamic scenes and perceptually degraded conditions. This map enhances computational efficiency due to the reduced size of the new static mask (as confirmed in several experiments), compared to the existing visual simultaneous localization and mapping (vSLAM) solutions. To refine the estimated pose, a back-end module selects a moving horizon of frames, generates a covisibility graph for data association, and optimizes a structure-from-motion program using local bundle adjustment. Finally, the performance of the framework is experimentally evaluated using a test vehicle in highly-dynamic urban settings and under adverse weather conditions with degraded visual perception with varying sequence lengths. The experiments confirm excellent performance in terms of estimation accuracy and computational efficiency for autonomous navigation compared to existing vSLAM methods.},

  abstract     = {Detecting surrounding situations and reacting accordingly to avoid collisions remains a challenging task for autonomous driving. This task requires predicting the trajectories of surrounding agents and assessing the potential risk of future situations, which can be difficult to achieve solely through onboard vehicle devices. Therefore, this paper proposes a cooperative architecture for trajectory prediction and risk assessment conducted on roadside devices (RSUs) to assist Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs). Firstly, we develop a segment-based prediction model (SegNet) tailored to hub signalized intersections. Intersections are divided into multiple segments, and the Curvilinear coordinates are utilized to indicate the geometric road features. The model leverages individual interaction cues in the ego segment and group features in the merging segments, while also incorporating traffic signal information to generate multimodal prediction results. In terms of risk assessment, we utilize the prediction results to provide hierarchical assistance, such as risk values, risk maps, and reference trajectories. Offline experimental results demonstrate that our SegNet model achieves competitive and well-balanced performance compared to state-of-the-art methods on the CitySim Database, with more accurate and smooth prediction trajectories. Through real-time CARLA and SUMO co-simulation, the performance of assisted CAVs indicates that they can safely and effectively navigate with the support of the proposed architecture.},

  abstract     = {Peer-to-Peer (P2P) concept within Vehicular Ad-Hoc Networks (VANETs) facilitates instantaneous information sharing among vehicles, leading to a seamless exchange of multimedia content, enhanced traffic management, heightened road safety, and ultimately contributing to a transportation ecosystem that is both more enjoyable and secure. However, the paradigm of P2P faces various challenges ranging from network scalability and reliability to the frequent topology changes of vehicular environments and weak resource management. As a result, a set of problems could be generated, such as data inconsistency and unreliability, weak lookup success rate, and low end-to-end delay, especially when requesting data. To address all these issues, we propose an innovative solution that leverages an aerial backbone consisting of a connected group of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). This system efficiently covers the integrality of the terrestrial vehicular environment while ensuring efficient data sharing and distribution towards it, thus playing the role of an aerial P2P overlay. The establishment of the aerial backbone takes into account two factors: i) the connectivity degree among UAVs and ii) their remaining energy levels. To ensure that these two factors are constantly verified and maintain permanent data availability for the vehicular environment, a Deep Q Network (DQN) method is adopted to optimize the movements of UAVs according to the terrestrial environment dynamics. After conducting a series of simulations, our methodology exhibits a marked superiority over existing baseline techniques regarding lookup time and success rate.},

However, vision-based approaches are susceptible to occlusions and LiDAR-based methods struggle with object identification due to the lack of texture information, posing challenges in object tracking. To overcome the inherent limitations of these individual sensors, we propose a fusion-based 3D MOT system that tightly couples LiDAR and vision measurements. Specifically, we first design an aggregated association metric that fuses the detections and geometric features from both LiDAR and image domains, to effectively track objects. On this basis, all associated multimodal measurements are further integrated into a unified factor graph optimization framework to refine the tracked 2D and 3D trajectories. The extensive experiments conducted on public datasets demonstrate that our system significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art fusion-based MOT methods in terms of both object localization accuracy and MOT performance.},

First, a vehicle energy management system (EMS) model and a engine-battery-cabin coupled thermal management system (CTMS) model are developed. By analyzing the coupling relationship between the CTMS and the EMS, a multi-objective optimization problem is constructed to minimize fuel consumption and battery aging damage and ensure SOC stability. Facing the challenges of solving optimization problems caused by the high-order complex nonlinearity of thermal-electrical coupling systems, the optimization problems are transformed into a Markov decision process (MDP). A reinforcement learning framework based on the TD3 algorithm is designed to achieve a real-time solution to the problem from a new perspective, overcoming the reliance on the system models and accurate future traffic information. The proposed strategy has efficient performance in terms of fuel economy, battery life, ensuring SOC stability, and adaptability. The total optimization cost reaches 91.42$\%$ level of the dynamic programming (DP) strategy, which is 30.3$\%$ lower than the model predictive control (MPC) strategy. The online computing burden is only 0.19$\%$ of the MPC strategy, which has strong potential for real-time applications.},

Reinforcement learning has the potential to address this challenge, but its application has been hindered by safety issues. To address the safety concern, we propose a Lagrangian framework called Knowledge-Enhanced Safe Reinforcement Learning (KESRL), which integrates prior knowledge of model-based methods into the model-free safe RL framework. Firstly, a model-based constraint based on high-order control barrier function is derived to deduce the safety criteria for the control system. Secondly, we propose a model-free constraint which estimates the distribution of accumulated safety cost and restricts the worst-case safety cost value. Furthermore, the above constraints are unified into the proposed Lagrangian framework to equip the end-to-end autonomous driving system with safety constraints. Experimental results conducted in the CARLA simulator demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework KESRL in decreasing the collision rate and enhancing the control safety compared with several state-of-the-art RL methods.},

First, a BUV prototype is designed, incorporating morphological characteristics resembling those of adult bottlenose dolphins, which features robust sensing capabilities, redundant actuation surfaces, and a passive peduncle joint for mitigation of the head-nodding motion. Second, a dynamic model for assessing the intermittent propulsion's cost of transport and velocity in a balanced perspective is established. In-depth investigations are conducted to analyze the impact of parameters in the intermittent-propulsion mode under varying flapping and gliding drag coefficients, which offer a novel and reasonable explanation for the exceptional duty cycle observed in bottlenose dolphins by biologists. Finally, numerous aquatic experiments are conducted to validate the remarkable energy-saving advantages of the proposed intermittent-propulsion mode of the BUV. These results present a new solution for efficient and sustainable long-distance navigation of BUVs, highlighting their potential for effective marine exploration.},

EVs drivers' Quality of Experience (QoE) is an significant impact factor that should be considered to find the optimal assignment of EVs to CSs. In this context, a novel framework to find the optimal assignment of EVs to CSs has been proposed based on optimization of QoE. Our proposed approach considers the travel time of EVs towards CSs taking into account the distance between EVs and CSs, the impact of congestion level on the roads resulted from the Internal Combustion Engine Vehicles (ICEVs) and EVs, queuing time at the CSs, and the time required to fully charge the EVs battery when connected to any charging slot at a CSs. The adjacency between the different zones in a city environment is also considered in order to minimize the potential number of CSs for each EVs. Specifically, the assignment problem is formulated as Mixed Integer Nonlinear Programming (MINLP), and a heuristic solution is developed using the Genetic Algorithm (GA) technique. The performance evaluation in realistic metropolitan environment attests the benefits of the proposed CSs assignment framework considering range of charging metrics.},

  abstract     = {Globally referenced and accurate positioning is of great significance for the application of intelligent vehicular systems. The visual and inertial measurement unit (IMU) integrated navigation system (VINS) is widely used in many intelligent positioning-based services. However, VINS are prone to drift over time and their performance is significantly compromised in urban canyons since the numerous outlier visual features caused by moving objects and unstable illuminations. Similarly, the global navigation satellite system (GNSS) is reliable in open areas but struggles with signal obstructions and reflections in urban canyons. To exploit the complementariness of the VINS and GNSS, this paper proposed a sliding window factor graph optimization (FGO)-based GNSS/Visual/IMU/Map (GVIM) integration, which exploits the full suit raw measurements from GNSS, IMU, and visual, together with the prior lightweight map. Unlike the existing tightly-coupled GNSS/Visual/IMU integration schemes, the potential of the carrier-phase measurement is fully explored using the recently developed window carrier phase (WCP) model. To further mitigate the impacts of the GNSS outliers, a novel sliding window (SW)-based map matching model is proposed to correct the states using the lightweight OpenStreetMap (OSM). Different from conventional filtering-based map matching, the states within the sliding window are associated with the lane information from the OSM which effectively exploits the measurement redundancy provided by the factor graph model. The experiments are conducted in the urban canyons of Hong Kong, utilizing a challenging dataset characterized by poor satellite visibility and numerous visual feature outliers, to verify the performance of the proposed method.},

In this paper, we propose a Score-Softmax classifier, which reduces the model overconfidence by enhancing category independence. Imitating the human scoring process, we designed a two-dimensional dynamic supervisory matrix consisting of one-dimensional Gaussian-smoothed labels. The dynamic loss descent direction and Gaussian smoothing increase the uncertainty of training to prevent the model from falling into noise traps. Furthermore, we introduce a simple and convenient multi-channel information fusion method; it addresses the fusion issue among arbitrary Score-Softmax classification heads. We conducted cross-dataset experiments using the SFDDD, AUCDD, and the 100-Driver datasets, demonstrating that Score-Softmax improves cross-dataset performance without modifying the model architecture. The experiments indicate that the Score-Softmax classifier reduces the interference of background noise, enhancing the robustness of the model. It increases the cross-dataset accuracy by 21.34%, 11.89%, and 18.77% on the three datasets, respectively.},

  abstract     = {The prevailing paradigm in 3D vision involves fully fine-tuning all the backbone parameters of pre-trained models. However, this approach poses challenges due to the large number of parameters requiring tuning, resulting in unexpected storage demands. To address these issues and alleviate the computational cost and storage burden associated with full fine-tuning, we propose Point Cloud Prompt Tuning (PCPT) as an effective method for large Transformer models in point cloud processing. PCPT offers a powerful and efficient solution to mitigate the costs associated with full fine-tuning. Drawing inspiration from recent advancements in efficient tuning of large-scale language models and 2D vision models, PCPT leverages less than 0.05 $\%$ of trainable parameters, while keeping the pre-trained parameters of the Transformer backbone unchanged. To evaluate the effectiveness of PCPT, extensive experiments were conducted on four discriminative datasets (ModelNet40, few-shot ModelNet40, ScanObjectNN, ShapeNetPart) and four generation datasets (PCN, MVP, ShapeNet55, and ShapeNet34/Unseen21). The results demonstrate that the task-specific prompts utilized in PCPT enable the Transformer model to adapt effectively to the target domains, yielding results comparable to those obtained through other full fine-tuning methods. This highlights the versatility of PCPT across various domains and tasks.},

  abstract     = {Malfunctions in the steering system inevitably result in a decline in lateral motion capacity, leading to unexpected conflicts between maintaining tracking reference path performance and satisfying current steering capacity. To resolve this conflict, we propose a supervisory-based fault-tolerant tracking control approach in this study. Our robust supervisory-based fault-tolerant control strategy comprises two main components. Firstly, a dynamically feasible motion interval predictor determines the lateral motion feasible set under uncertainties. Subsequently, new reference trajectories are reconstructed to accommodate current input constraints dynamically. These components operate as a unified supervisor to assess the reasonability of the reference path.Furthermore, a transformation function converts complex path-following goals into the desired yaw angle tracking objective. To ensure the robustness of our fault-tolerant controller, we employ a linear matrix inequality (LMI) based methodology to address tracking problems involving parametric uncertainties and input constraints. Finally, the effectiveness of our approach in addressing steering system faults with capacity degradation and uncertainties is demonstrated through extensive simulation results. Comparative analysis with stabilization-based fault-tolerant controllers reveals that our method significantly enhances vehicle stability and tracking performance under steering capacity degradation conditions.},

Driven by the pronounced multi-modal nature of human driving behavior, this paper presents an approach that leverages Bayesian beliefs over the distribution of potential policies of other road users to construct a novel risk-aware probabilistic motion planning framework. In particular, we propose a novel contingency planner that outputs long-term contingent plans conditioned on multiple possible intents for other actors in the traffic scene. The Bayesian belief is incorporated into the optimization cost function to influence the behavior of the short-term plan based on the likelihood of other agents' policies. Furthermore, a probabilistic risk metric is employed to fine-tune the balance between efficiency and robustness. Through a series of closed-loop safety-critical simulated traffic scenarios shared with human-driven vehicles, we demonstrate the practical efficacy of our proposed approach that can handle multi-vehicle scenarios.},

However, in data-sensitive fields such as Internet of Vehicles (IoV), insecure communication channels, semi-trusted RoadSide Unit (RSU), and collusion between vehicles and the RSU may lead to leakage of model parameters. Moreover, when aggregating data, since different vehicles usually have different computing resources, vehicles with relatively insufficient computing resources will affect the data aggregation efficiency. Therefore, in order to solve the privacy leakage problem and improve the data aggregation efficiency, this paper proposes a privacy-preserving data aggregation protocol for IoV with FL. Firstly, the protocol is designed based on methods such as shamir secret sharing scheme, pallier homomorphic encryption scheme and blinding factor protection, which can guarantee the privacy of model parameters. Secondly, the protocol improves the data aggregation efficiency by setting dynamic training time windows. Thirdly, the protocol reduces the frequent participations of Trusted Authority (TA) by optimizing the fault-tolerance mechanism. Finally, the security analysis proves that the proposed protocol is secure, and the performance analysis results also show that the proposed protocol has high computation and communication efficiency.},

  abstract     = {Cross-view geo-localization has great potential in the field of autonomous driving for vehicles. Existing methods on ground-to-aerial geo-localization show two main limitations. First, they typically train a two-stream neural network using metric learning loss to learn feature embeddings for two views, with each branch processing one view modality independently. However, without cross-view interaction, the large domain gap makes the finding of a better feature embedding harder. Besides, it also prevents these models from benefiting from fine-grained regression loss. Second, the binary labels assigned to cross-view image pairs cannot fully characterize their relevance degrees, thus confounding the learning of these models. To this end, we propose an offset regression enhanced cross-view feature interaction model (OR-CVFI) for this task. OR-CVFI introduces a cross-view attention layer on top of Siamese-like CNN backbone to maintain interactions between cross-view features. The cross-attentive features are used to measure similarity between a pair of input images while regressing their position offset. For model training, we design a soft label-guided InfoNCE loss to complement the regular InfoNCE loss. Combined with the proposed two-stage inference strategy, OR-CVFI is proved to significantly outperform state-of-the-art methods in retrieval accuracy. Remarkably, the recall rate@top-1 improves from 65.23% to 74.41% and from 33.05% to 45.64% respectively on same-area and cross-area VIGOR benchmarks.},

Apart from the challenges faced by general natural scene text detection, the presence of a large amount of non-traffic text which leads to false alarms further complicates the problem of traffic text detection, e.g., billboards, building signs, etc. In this work, we infer text component relationships via a component relationship reasoning network (CR2-Net) for traffic text detection. The method contains main contributions as follows: (1) Explored a GCN-based component-relational reasoning traffic text detection network by leveraging global contextual information and reasoning about intrinsic connections between text components to improve traffic text detection performance. (2) Designed a Group Deformable Convolution Network (GDCN) and adaptively adjusting the convolutional manner to enhance the feature extraction capability of the network for text regions. (3) Proposed a Fusion Attention Module (FAM) to enhance the network adaptive ability by assigning feature map weights to different channels. To demonstrate the effectiveness, we evaluate CR2-Net on four standard benchmarks. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves remarkable performance on two traffic text datasets, i.e., CTST-1600, and TPD. Especially, our results on TPD dataset surpass all previously reported results to the best of our knowledge. Additionally, our approach exhibits competitive results on general natural scene text datasets, such as ICDAR 2015, and SCUT-CTW1500, thereby fully demonstrating the superiority and adaptability of our method.},

To date, most studies of ASV formation have only focused on static formation configuration. However, in practical applications, ASVs need to change formation maneuvering to accomplish various tasks, such as obstacle avoidance and maritime patrol. Addition, multi-ASV systems are constrained by environmental disturbances, limited communication resources, and input saturation. To deal with these constraints, a novel formation maneuver control strategy for multi-ASV systems is proposed. First, to achieve formation maneuvering in multi-ASV systems, an affine formation maneuver controller based on a stress matrix is designed. Second, radial basis function neural networks are deployed to reduce the influence of nonlinear term on multi-ASV systems. An event-triggered mechanism is used to decrease the frequency of information transmission, thereby conserving communication resources. Finally, the stability and the Zeno behavior of the system are analyzed. The simulation demonstrates that the control strategy proposed in this research enables multi-ASV systems to complete formation maneuver tasks.},

In contrast to the static event-triggering mechanism (STEM), this approach leverages the internal dynamic variable to further save communication resources.

In this work, a distributed tube-based model predictive control (TMPC) method is proposed to address the cooperative control of virtually coupled HSTs, which improves the ride comfort of passengers while enhancing the railway capacity. Firstly, a nonlinear MPC scheme based on the nominal dynamics model of the train is developed to address the cooperative operation among multiple HSTs with different initial states. Especially, the constraints related to the ride comfort, including the acceleration and acceleration change rate, are transformed into the input and input increment constraints of the MPC respectively. Besides, the constraints of velocity and tracking interval related to the train operation safety are also considered in the design of the MPC. The recursive feasibility and stability of the MPC are proved theoretically. Secondly, an auxiliary feedback control system (AFCS) is devised based on the actual dynamics model of the train to deal with the external disturbances while enhancing the train operation stability and ride comfort. Specifically, the AFCS consists of a discrete-time sliding mode control and a discrete-time disturbance observer, utilizing the optimal state sequences generated by the MPC as a reference for the feedback control. Additionally, the stability of the AFCS is strictly proved. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed distributed TMPC is verified by simulation.},

To address these issues, we introduce fuzzy learning into NMS and propose a novel generalized Fuzzy-NMS module to achieve finer candidate bounding box filtering. The proposed Fuzzy-NMS module combines the volume and clustering density of candidate bounding boxes, refining them with a fuzzy classification method and optimizing the appropriate suppression thresholds to reduce uncertainty in the NMS process. Adequate validation experiments use the mainstream KITTI and large-scale Waymo 3D object detection benchmarks. The results of these tests demonstrate the proposed Fuzzy-NMS module can improve the accuracy of numerous recently NMS-based detectors significantly, including PointPillars, PV-RCNN, and IA-SSD, etc. This effect is particularly evident for small objects such as pedestrians and bicycles.

Most existing calibration methods are offline and rely on artificial targets, which is time consuming and unfriendly to non-expert users. To improve efficiency, robustness and user-friendliness, this paper proposes a novel target-free LiDAR-IMU-camera online extrinsic calibration framework. An IMU-centric motion excitation assessment method is newly designed to assist non-expert users in data collection, serving as the termination criterion for extrinsic rotation initialization. We calibrate the extrinsic parameters of the LiDAR and camera relative to the IMU in real-time and in parallel without any priori knowledge: (i) For camera-IMU calibration, a new convergence criterion based on the coefficient of variation is proposed to judge if the calibration has been accomplished. (ii) For LiDAR-IMU calibration, a data selection strategy is designed to concurrently record a segment of original data from both the LiDAR and IMU during initialization. Subsequently, the selected data is utilized to refine the extrinsic parameters under a continuous-time batch optimization framework. Moreover, a scene recognition algorithm is proposed to autonomously select parameters according to indoor or outdoor features. Finally, we leverage the IMU as a bridge for computing the LiDAR-camera extrinsic parameters. Extensive real experiments on our self-recorded and public datasets show the high accuracy and robustness of the proposed method, with an average error of less than 0.01 m in translation and 0.5° in rotation.},

  abstract     = {Car-following (CF) algorithms are crucial components of traffic simulations and have been integrated into many production vehicles equipped with Advanced Driving Assistance Systems (ADAS). Insights from the model of car-following behavior help researchers to understand the causes of various macro phenomena that arise from interactions between pairs of vehicles. Car-following Models encompass multiple disciplines, including traffic engineering, physics, dynamic system control, cognitive science, machine learning, deep learning, and reinforcement learning. This paper presents an extensive survey highlighting the differences, complementarities, and overlaps among microscopic traffic flow and control models based on their underlying principles and design logic. It reviews a range of representative algorithms, from theory-based Kinematic Models, Psycho-Physical Models, and Adaptive Cruise Control Models to learning-based algorithms like Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Imitation Learning (IL). Additionally, it considers the impact of large Generative AI (GenAI) models, categorized as Knowledge-Driven models. The survey discusses the strengths and limitations of these models, explores their applications in various contexts, and summarizes available datasets across different domains to address knowledge gaps. By synthesizing historical developments and current trends, this survey provides a comprehensive overview of the evolution and future directions of car-following models. It highlights the importance of interdisciplinary approaches and the need for continued innovation to address emerging challenges.},

  abstract     = {Autonomous Vehicles aim to understand their surrounding environment by detecting relevant objects in the scene, which can be performed using a combination of sensors. The accurate prediction of pedestrians is a particularly challenging task, since the existing algorithms have more difficulty detecting small objects. This work studies and addresses this often overlooked problem by proposing Multimodal PointPillars (M-PP), a fast and effective novel fusion architecture for 3D object detection. Inspired by both MVX-Net and PointPillars, image features from a 2D CNN-based feature map are fused with the 3D point cloud in an early fusion architecture. By changing the heavy 3D convolutions of MVX-Net to a set of convolutional layers in 2D space, along with combining LiDAR and image information at an early stage, M-PP considerably improves inference time over the baseline, running at 28.49 Hz. It achieves inference speeds suitable for real-world applications while keeping the high performance of multimodal approaches. Extensive experiments show that our proposed architecture outperforms both MVX-Net and PointPillars for the pedestrian class in the KITTI 3D object detection dataset, with 62.78% in $AP_{BEV}$ (moderate difficulty), while also outperforming MVX-Net in the nuScenes dataset. Moreover, experiments were conducted to measure the detection performance based on object distance. The performance of M-PP surpassed other methods in pedestrian detection at any distance, particularly for faraway objects (more than 30 meters). Qualitative analysis shows that M-PP visibly outperformed MVX-Net for pedestrians and cyclists, while simultaneously making accurate predictions of cars.},

  abstract     = {This paper develops a sequencing-enabled hierarchical connected automated vehicle (CAV) cooperative on-ramp merging control framework. The proposed framework consists of a two-layer design: the upper-level control sequences the vehicles to harmonize the traffic density across mainline and on-ramp segments, simultaneously enhancing lower-level control efficiency through a mixed-integer linear programming formulation. Subsequently, the lower-level control, in turn, employs a longitudinal distributed model predictive control (MPC) supplemented by a virtual car-following (CF) concept to ensure three key aspects: asymptotic local stability, $l_{2}$ norm string stability, and safety. Proofs of asymptotic local stability and $l_{2}$ norm string stability are mathematically derived. Compared to other prevalent asymptotic local-stable MPC controllers, the proposed distributed MPC controller greatly expands the initial feasible set. Additionally, an auxiliary lateral control is developed to maintain lane-keeping and merging smoothness while accommodating ramp geometric curvature. To validate the proposed framework, multiple numerical experiments are conducted. Results indicate a notable outperformance of our upper-level controller against a distance-based sequencing method. Furthermore, the lower-level control effectively ensures smooth acceleration, safe merging with adequate spacing, adherence to proven longitudinal local and string stability, and rapid regulation of lateral deviations.},

However, traditional methods such as RNN and k-NN graph construction, often employed in point clouds GNNs, tend to suffer from low real-time performance and high resource consumption. To tackle these challenges, this work introduces a concise, lightweight, and fast global triangulation GNN (TriNN). To replace RNN and k-NN, the Range Plane and Range Belt are proposed for constructing a Delaunay triangulation-based graph on point clouds. Importantly, both the range plane and range belt can be triangulated without relying on point-wise normals. The resulting graph not only encapsulates the raw point cloud in its most concise representation but also preserves all adjacency relationships. Finally, we evaluate the performance of the proposed architecture with respect to overfitting, resource consumption, time cost, and accuracy trade-offs. Experimental results substantiate that TriNN is adept at constructing deeper networks, demands fewer computational resources, and achieves faster computation.},

  abstract     = {Multimodal fusion technology significantly enhances the safety and perception capabilities of intelligent vehicles. Recently, replacing Cartesian coordinate system voxels with polar voxels in 3D perception tasks has significantly improved spatial occupancy rates and adaptability. However, the uneven distribution of voxels introduces new challenges: feature information distortion and reduced real-time performance. This paper proposes a multimodal fusion network based on polar graphs to address these issues. Raw data from LiDAR, cameras, and millimeter-wave (MMW) radar are initially preprocessed, and point-graph and voxel-graph structures in polar coordinates are constructed. Subsequently, using Graph Attention Networks (GAT), features are extracted and aggregated at multiple levels, forming a polar-based Bird's Eye View (BEV) feature map. At the BEV level, multimodal features are fused, and multi-scale features are aggregated using multi-scale GAT, culminating in the design of a polar-based CenterHead to complete the 3D perception task. Extensive experiments conducted on the nuScenes dataset and real vehicle test data have demonstrated that the detection precision (70.5% mAP) and inference speed (12.6 Hz) of the model's surpass those of comparative models, establishing a new state-of-the-art (SOTA). Additionally, the model exhibits high levels of perception accuracy, robustness, and generalizability across various real vehicle scenarios.},

To overcome these limitations, we propose a real-time mesh-based LiDAR odometry and mapping approach for large-scale scenes through implicit reconstruction and a parallel spatial-hashing scheme. In order to efficiently reconstruct the triangular meshes using the implicit function, we suggest an incremental voxel meshing strategy that depends on a novel voxel map fusing scans through a single traversal of the current frame. Moreover, we introduce a scalable partition module to compress space. By taking advantage of the rapid access to triangular meshes, we design a robust odometry method with location and feature-based data association to estimate the poses between the input point clouds and the recovered triangular meshes. The experimental results on four public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach in recovering both accurate motion trajectories and environmental mesh maps.},

  abstract     = {This paper develops a distributed safety-critical predefined-time control method for the 3-dimensional (3D) moving target surrounding problem of multiple UAVs. A new 3D surrounding shape is first formulated for multiple UAVs to distribute on a moving spherical surface around the target. To reduce the communication and load burden, a predefined-time distributed estimator is designed for a subset of UAVs without any access to the target, so that the target's motion information can be accurately estimated within a predefined time. Subsequently, a robust safety-constrained predefined-time control law is designed with a twofold structure, where the nominal control term guarantees the predefined-time convergence under the safety constraints, and the adjunctive control term overcomes the influence of disturbances. A new dynamic parameter-based predefined-time control method is proposed, which can relax the unnecessary requirement of control design for achieving predefined-time convergence. The corresponding dynamic parameter-based predefined-time control Lyapunov function (DPP-CLF) is constructed together with second-order control barrier function (SCBF) to map the convergence requirement and safety constraints on states to constraints on control inputs. The nominal control term is obtained by minimizing the control inputs under constraints with linear programming. The adjunctive control term is acquired by combining a filter-based estimator and an integral sliding mode surface design, providing an accurate compensation for the disturbances. The theoretical analysis and simulation results demonstrate the predefined-time stability and collision avoidance performance of the multi-UAV system.},

This paper provides a novel model of driver-steering interaction. The model estimates driver's desired torque target as well as potential conflicts of interest between driver and active ADAS. We apply the Variable Coefficient (VC) method to identify the time-varying parameters of the model taking into account physical constraints. The model is validated on real driving data with 58 drivers on a racing track. Based on the driver interaction model, we apply supervised machine learning algorithms using the MATLAB Classification Learner App to distinguish five interaction strategies drivers applied when interacting with the assistance system.},
