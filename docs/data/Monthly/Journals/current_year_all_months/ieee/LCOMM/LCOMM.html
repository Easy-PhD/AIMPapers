  abstract     = {Weighted Minimum Mean Square Error (WMMSE) precoding can achieve near-optimal weighted sum rate (WSR) in MU-MIMO-OFDM systems, but it suffers from high computational complexity and severe dependence on accurate channel state information (CSI). This letter proposes a lightweight reinforcement learning (RL)-driven deep unfolding (DU) network (RLDDU-Net) to overcome these limitations. Specifically, its DU module maps a wideband stochastic WMMSE algorithm, which maximizes the ergodic WSR under imperfect CSI, into a deep-learning framework. Approximation techniques exploiting beam-domain sparsity and subcarrier correlation are also adopted to significantly reduce complexity and accelerate convergence. The RL module dynamically generates compensation matrices to mitigate approximation errors and adjusts DU network depth online, thereby enhancing both flexibility and performance. Simulation results demonstrate that RLDDU-Net outperforms existing baselines in terms of ergodic WSR, computational efficiency, and convergence speed under imperfect CSI.},

However, channel aging poses a significant challenge, leading to the outdated channel state information and degraded system performance. To address this issue, we propose a decoding-aided Kalman filter channel tracking algorithm based on the globally-coupled low-density parity-check (GC-LDPC) codes. The proposed approach leverages locally decoded symbols to optimize channel estimation and employs global decoding to further reduce the error floor. Additionally, protograph-based extrinsic information transfer analysis and the error minimization progressive edge-growth algorithm are utilized to optimize the compatible GC-LDPC codes.

Based on the proposed model, the corresponding downlink ergodic capacity is investigated. We find that when the VR size remains constant, the ergodic capacity decreases as the number of transmit antennas increases. Due to the closed-form expressions for ergodic capacity being related to Laguerre polynomials, which requires numerical integration for evaluation, the closed-form lower bounds on ergodic capacity are investigated. In XL-MIMO systems, the number of transmit antennas is significantly greater than the rank of the XL-MIMO channel, and we use the theorem of principal minor determinant expansion and Binet-Cauchy theorem to obtain the closed-form lower bound on the ergodic capacity. Compared to the Monte-Carlo simulation results, the proposed lower bound is tight and suitable for application in XL-MIMO communication systems.},

To this end, we introduce a multi-objective optimization framework to explore the fundamental trade-off between maximizing effective rate and minimizing effective power. In contrast to conventional energy efficiency (EE) approaches, the proposed framework offers flexible system design by allowing the relative importance of rate and power objectives to be adjusted through the reward function. Additionally, it encourages fair resource allocation by penalizing imbalanced rate and power distributions among receivers. We propose a robust resource allocation framework based on the critical actor asynchronous meta-advantage (MA3C) reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm. Simulation results demonstrate substantial robustness to IPCSI via MA3C. Additionally, the integration of RSMA significantly boosts the total data rate and reduces total power, outperforming other benchmarks.},

To address these limitations, this letter proposes a passive VLP algorithm based on Multi-Camera Joint Optimization (MCJO). In the considered system, multiple ceiling-mounted pre-calibrated cameras continuously capture images of targets with unmodulated point light sources, and can simultaneously localize these targets at the server. In particular, MCJO comprises two stages: It first estimates target positions via linear least squares (LLS) from multi-view projection rays; then refines these positions through nonlinear joint optimization to minimize the reprojection error. Simulation results show that MCJO can achieve millimeter-level accuracy, with an improvement of 19% over an LLS-based state-of-the-art algorithm. Experimental results further show that MCJO achieves an average position error as low as 5.63 mm.},

A novel adaptive weight adjustment mechanism is proposed that dynamically modulates particle weights according to real-time measurement uncertainty and system variability. This approach effectively addresses particle degeneracy and preserves sample diversity, which are common shortcomings of conventional particle filtering techniques. To rigorously implement the proposed framework, the method incorporates the Cubature Kalman Filter to construct an efficient proposal distribution and employs variational Bayesian inference for the estimation of unknown, time-varying measurement noise covariance. The integration of these components enables the filter to adapt to complex and evolving environments while maintaining high positioning accuracy. Extensive simulations and real-world experiments demonstrate that the VB-CK-APF algorithm consistently achieves positioning errors below 10 cm, even in challenging indoor–outdoor transition scenarios.},

  abstract     = {Unequal error protection (UEP) coding that enables differentiated reliability levels within a transmitted message is essential for modern communication systems. Autoencoder (AE)-based code designs have shown promise in the context of learned equal error protection (EEP) coding schemes. However, their application to UEP remains largely unexplored, particularly at intermediate blocklengths, due to the increasing complexity of AE-based models. Inspired by the proven effectiveness of superposition coding and successive interference cancellation (SIC) decoding in conventional UEP schemes, we propose a structured AE-based architecture that extends AE-based UEP codes to substantially larger blocklengths while maintaining efficient training. By structuring encoding and decoding into smaller AE subblocks, our method provides a flexible framework for fine-tuning UEP reliability levels while adapting to diverse system parameters. Numerical results show that the proposed approach improves over established achievability bounds of randomized superposition coding-based UEP schemes with SIC decoding, making the proposed structured AE-based UEP codes a scalable and efficient solution for next-generation networks.},

  abstract     = {Non-line-of-sight (NLOS) propagation significantly impacts the performance of ultra-wideband (UWB) positioning. Identifying and mitigating or suppressing NLOS propagation is crucial for improving UWB positioning accuracy, with NLOS identification being a key component. Current NLOS identification methods limited to single scenarios, lacking adaptability to dynamic environmental changes and cross-scenario transferability. Existing transfer methods heavily rely on annotated data, increasing data annotation costs and implementation difficulty. Therefore, this letter proposes an unsupervised transfer NLOS identification model based on adversarial discriminative domain adaptation (ADDA) in UWB positioning: ADDA-NLOS. Experiment results show existing models have poor transferability in NLOS identification. ADDA-NLOS achieves high-performance unsupervised cross-scenario NLOS identification transferability and outperforms supervised models under limited data.},

  abstract     = {Radio Frequency Fingerprinting (RFF) is an emerging physical-layer authentication technique that leverages intrinsic hardware imperfections introduced during the manufacturing of IoT devices. These device-specific features, inherently embedded in emitted RF signals, enable passive and non-intrusive device identification. While most existing RFF methods rely on data from a single receiver, real-world IoT deployments typically involve heterogeneous receivers, leading to cross-receiver domain shifts that severely degrade identification performance. However, research addressing this issue remains limited. To address this challenge, we propose a receiver-agnostic RFF framework that enhances generalization by learning domain-invariant features through a dual-perspective feature extraction strategy. Specifically, Fourier phase information is leveraged for its semantic stability and robustness to domain shifts. A knowledge distillation framework is introduced to extract intra-domain invariant features from the phase component, ensuring feature consistency within each receiver. In addition, a cross-domain correlation alignment mechanism is employed to capture shared representations across receivers, thereby improving robustness to distributional variations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art domain generalization techniques. Moreover, results show that increasing the number of training receivers significantly improves identification accuracy in unseen receiver scenarios.

  abstract     = {Affine frequency division multiplexing with index modulation (AFDM-IM) system enhances the energy efficiency and bit error rate (BER) performance. To facilitate data detection in the AFDM-IM system, it is necessary to obtain the channel state information. We propose an embedded pilot-assisted channel estimation (CE) scheme based on interference position indices for AFDM-IM systems under low signal-to-noise ratio conditions, where CE and data detection are conducted within the same frame. In the proposed scheme, the AFDM-IM system only activates a portion of subcarriers for transmitting constellation modulation symbols, while the rest subcarriers stay inactive. Therefore, the pilot can be inserted into the silent subcarriers for CE. To fully exploit the high energy efficiency and spectral efficiency in the AFDM-IM system for information transmission, we design a frame structure for the transmitted signal. Aiming at the issue of insufficient guard intervals between pilot and data caused by this structure, we incorporate an interference position indices determination method into the channel estimation scheme to directly identify the elements for channel estimation in the received signal, which enables more accurate channel estimation and more efficient interference cancellation. Then, CE, interference cancellation, and data detection are iteratively performed. Simulation results show that the proposed channel estimation scheme achieves favorable BER performance by gaining more precise CE in a low signal-to-noise ratio condition.},

Leveraging the single-waveguide architecture, non-orthogonal multiple access is employed to enable the superposed transmission of information signals, eliminating the need for dedicated energy carriers by concurrently serving both the IRs and the ERs. In this letter, an optimization problem is first formulated with an objective is to maximize the sum power received at the ERs via joint optimizing the IRs power allocation and the PAs positioning. Given the challenging non-convex nature of the formulated optimization problem, it is decoupled into two sub-problems which are solved alternatively. Specifically, the power allocation subproblem is recast a convex optimization problem, and hence can be solved efficiently.

Extending these results to incorporate perceptual constraints yields the Rate-Distortion-Perception Function (RDPF) and presents persistent challenges even in the relatively simple case of Gaussian sources. The inherent asymmetry of perceptual constraints, commonly quantified by the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, raises uncertainties about whether encoding a Gaussian source into Gaussian-distributed codewords is optimal. Restricting the search space without proof may overlook superior alternatives. In this study, we examine the case of two correlated Gaussian sources under individual fidelity constraints addressing both perceptual quality and distortion. In the presence of perception constraints (KL-divergence), we prove that the optimal strategy involves encoding the correlated Gaussian sources into a pair of Gaussian distributed codewords. Then, we explicitly express the correlation between the encoded messages. Moreover, we derive the RDPF as a solution to an optimization problem involving four variables intricately linked to encoded and source information statistics.},

  abstract     = {Accurate channel modeling plays a pivotal role in optimizing communication systems, and fitting field measurements to stochastic models is crucial for capturing the key propagation features and to map these to achievable system performances. In this work, we shed light on what’s the most appropriate alternative for channel fitting, when the ultimate goal is performance analysis. Results show that likelihood-based and average-error metrics should be used with caution, since they can largely fail to predict outage probability measures. We show that supremum-error fitting metrics with tail awareness are more robust to estimate both ergodic and outage performance measures, even when they yield a larger average-error fitting.},

This letter investigates secure communication design for RIS-assisted CR systems affected by HWIs and RIS PEs. To maximize the security energy efficiency (SEE) of cognitive users (CUs), a joint optimization method for base station (BS) beamforming, artificial noise (AN), and RIS reflection phase is proposed. An alternating iterative approach addresses this optimization problem by first optimizing beamforming and AN through variable substitution and successive convex approximation (SCA), then optimizing the passive beamforming using Semidefinite Relaxation (SDR) and singular value decomposition (SVD), assuming PEs follow a uniform or von mises distribution.

Existing AoI models often assume multi-hop communication networks with fully reliable nodes, which may not accurately capture scenarios involving node transmission failures. This letter presents an analytical framework for two configurations of tandem queue systems, where status updates generated by a single sensor are relayed to a destination monitor through unreliable intermediate nodes. Using the probability generating function, we first derive the sojourn time distribution for an infinite-buffer M/M/1 tandem system with two unreliable nodes. We then extend our analysis to an M/G/1 tandem system with an arbitrary number of unreliable nodes, employing the supplementary variable technique while assuming that only the first node has an infinite buffer. Numerical results demonstrate the impact of key system parameters on the average AoI in unreliable tandem queues with Markovian and non-Markovian service times.},

To enable real-time and accurate identification of the current propagation scenario, this letter proposes a scenario identification method based on least squares channel estimation and a deep residual shrinkage network (LSE-DRSN). The channel impulse response (CIR) is obtained via the low-complexity least squares (LS) method, while the deep residual shrinkage network (DRSN) ensures the scenario identification accuracy in propagation environments where significant estimation errors exist in LS-based CIR acquisition.

The mixed field gain channel matrix is subjected to QR decomposition in this letter. The R matrix improves the directional information of the user (UE), greatly increasing the accuracy of the UE’s location. In particular, to extract the UE’s angle domain information from the R matrix, we first provide an angle domain dictionary set approach. Next, we present a user localization technique based on QR decomposition for dictionaries (QR-CDL and QR-PHD-MUSIC) that eliminates interference beams in various pathways, creates a lower sparsity angle domain dictionary set, and applies QR decomposition to the mixed field’s channel gain matrix. The UE’s angle domain information is then obtained utilizing iterative techniques. The experimental findings demonstrate that the algorithm provided in this research can achieve higher user location accuracy when compared to the dictionary-based localization (CDL) and polar-domain hierarchical dictionary-MUSIC (PHD-MUSIC) approach.},

  abstract     = {Localization using multiple base stations (BSs) has gained much attention for its high localization accuracy. However, the performance of the multi-BS system suffers from its limited number of antennas. To solve the above issue, we propose to use reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) serving as antennas. Existing localization methods enabled by multiple RISs mainly focus on the far-field (FF) region of each RIS. As the scale of RIS increases, the near-field (NF) region of each RIS expands, where FF methods struggle to achieve high localization accuracy. In this letter, a hybrid NF and FF localization method aided by multiple RISs is proposed. In such scenarios, achieving user localization and RIS optimization is challenging due to the high complexity caused by the exhaustive search through all candidate locations to match the signals. Moreover, the interference from multiple RISs degrades the localization accuracy. To address this challenge, we propose a two-phase localization method that first estimates the relative locations of the user to each RIS and fuses the results to obtain the estimation. This approach reduces the complexity by decreasing the number of candidate locations considered in each step. Also, we introduce a constraint in the RIS optimization problem that limits the sidelobe levels directed towards other RISs, minimizing inter-RIS interference. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified through simulations.},

Motivated by these benefits, We construct a weighted optimization framework aimed at jointly maximizing the overall secrecy rate and reducing the Cramér-Rao Bound (CRB) for target estimation in near-field scenarios, while adhering to communication demands and total power limitations of the system. By integrating fractional programming (FP) and semidefinite relaxation (SDR) techniques, we jointly optimize the transmit waveform covariance matrix and the beamforming vectors to enhance both sensing accuracy and secure transmission performance simultaneously. Numerical results reveal that the secure near-field ISAC scheme can effectively achieve a synergy enhancement between sensing and secure communication while maintaining reliable system performance.},

  abstract     = {This letter addresses loss of packets in a wireless fronthaul link being interpreted as channel errors for the service link. This may occur if, for instance, User Equipment (UE) is served by a radio unit in an Uncrewed Aerial Vehicle (UAV) via a wireless fronthaul link to a baseband unit (BU) on the ground. The fronthaul packet loss leads to a mismatch between the real and estimated channel state, which in turn results in degraded system performance. The letter proposes a novel strategy to mitigate fronthaul packet loss impact and regain network performance without requiring complex packet-to-PHY data mapping. The method identifies fronthaul packet losses by detecting missing inputs to the Inverse Fast Fourier Transform (IFFT) in an OFDM modulator and maps this information to a codeword loss metric, which is fed back and processed at the BU. The loss metric is compared against thresholds by the BU to differentiate between fronthaul and channel-related losses. Performance evaluation is conducted using a 5G New Radio (NR) downlink system with a UAV serving a UE under full-buffer traffic conditions. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves up to 64.1% gain in throughput compared to conventional link adaptation schemes under various fronthaul packet loss rates and service link signal-to-noise ratios.},

Under the proposed architecture, the state estimation problem is solved, and the design conditions are developed in terms of a new type of cooperative recursive linear matrix inequalities (CRLMIs). In addition to the process and measurement noises, the communication noise is considered to represent the undesired network phenomena such as channel interference, electromagnetic disturbances, or environmental variations.

Wi-ZFC employs the Zero-Frequency Circle (ZFC) derived from the Doppler Frequency Shift (DFS) to segment the sensing area and characterize the dynamic components of gestures by intersecting the ZFCs of multiple links. Subsequently, the sensing area is defined by the actual motion distances $D_{\delta } $ of the various dynamic components of the gesture. The Spatial Power Profile (SPP) is further proposed to refine the Doppler frequency of the gesture. The SPP is combined with $D_{\delta } $ to derive the actual traveled Distance Information (DI) of the gesture.

Therefore, the detection and management of UAVs have become crucial. Currently, radio frequency fingerprint identification (RFFI) based on deep learning for UAVs have achieved significant advances. Although many schemes has designed for UAVs in RFFI tasks, they still demand extensive UAV signal samples. To surmount mentioned challenges, we propose few-shot RFFI scheme based on gaussian prototype network (GPN) model by meta-learning in this letter, which not only can satisfy the requirement of few-shot RFFI but also enables new UAVs’ enrollment without retraining. GPN model adopts the Mahalanobis distance between the embedding feature and gaussian prototype as its metric. What’s more, GPN model is designed based on ResNext and the squeeze-and-excitation (SE) module to realize feature extraction. Experiments conducted based on real UAV signals confirmed the excellent performance of our proposed scheme compared to other schemes.},

  abstract     = {This letter proposes an enhanced irregular repetition slotted ALOHA (IRSA) scheme for the binary adder channel (BAC) using sparse random combinatorial matrices as codebooks. Existing IRSA schemes for the BAC, which rely on dense Bernoulli matrices as codebooks, struggle to resolve a large number of collisions, primarily due to the high density of the codebook. To address it, we introduce a codebook construction using sparse random combinatorial matrices, where each codeword is a binary vector with exactly d ones, optimized to maximize the collision resolution capabilities. Furthermore, the proposed scheme eliminates pilot symbols by leveraging the codebook’s inherent sparsity and combinatorial structure. Numerical simulations show that the proposed scheme achieves a higher decoding threshold and superior average sum rate compared to existing schemes, thanks to its enhanced collision resolution capabilities.},

This work presents a novel authentication scheme designed to enhance security in 5G downlink positioning using the positioning reference signal (PRS). The proposed method embeds a hash-based message authentication code (HMAC) of the PRS into the empty resource elements (REs) of its comb-based structure, along with the original PRS sequence. Furthermore, a novel authentication similarity threshold is introduced, enabling the HMAC authentication process to operate under lower SNR conditions. In addition, the proposed method in the presence of channel estimation, synchronization and carrier frequency offset errors is quantified, reporting the percentage of erroneous bits in each extracted HMAC sequence. The robustness of the proposed threshold mechanism is highlighted, demonstrating its ability to tolerate bit errors caused by impairments of the physical layer. Simulations reveal that occupation of these REs does not affect position estimation.},

The optimal parameters are further derived by minimizing proposed peak-to-virtual-interference ratio (PVIR), and the subcarrier-ISS trade-off is investigated between the number of data subcarriers and ISS capacity.

Motivated by this, we consider the sum sensing rate (SR) optimization for a cooperative ISAC system with linear precoding, where each base station (BS) works in a different frequency band. With this aim, we propose an optimization algorithm based on the semi-definite rank relaxation that introduces covariance matrices as optimization variables, and we apply the inner approximation (IA) method to deal with the nonconvexity of the resulting problem. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm increases the SR by approximately 25% and 40% compared to the case of equal power distribution in a cooperative ISAC system with two and three BSs, respectively. Additionally, the algorithm converges in only a few iterations, while its most beneficial implementation scenario is in the low power regime.},

We study the problem of minimizing the sum of an average distortion function and a transmission cost. Since the controller is at the sink side, the controller (sink) has only partial knowledge about the source states, and thus, we model the problem as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) and then cast it as a belief-MDP problem.

Specifically, this letter devises a virtual signal class generation approach and an integrated loss function to expand the feature space for incremental categories while preserving valid feature representations. During the incremental phase, FCCA uses a frozen feature extractor to obtain category feature embeddings and models feature covariance relationships, helping the classifier better differentiate between categories. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that FCCA outperforms other methods. It also demonstrates excellent performance on few-shot class incremental problems.},

  abstract     = {The embedded element efficiency (EEE), which quantifies mutual coupling in antenna arrays, critically limits the signal-to-noise ratio in large-scale array communications. However, calculating the EEE for finite arrays remains challenging. Existing methods are either computationally expensive or fail to account for edge effects in finite arrays. In this letter, an efficient method to estimate the EEE for finite arrays is proposed. We first derive the impedance matrix of an array from the pattern overlap matrix, then compute the generalized scattering parameters for a given source network. Consequently, the EEE of each element can be determined. Compared with traditional approaches, this method captures the EEE variations across different elements while maintaining high computational efficiency, and is applicable to arrays with arbitrary geometries. Channel capacity is evaluated to illustrate the impact of EEE on multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems.},

  abstract     = {Network coding enhances wireless communication by transmitting coded packets. However, transmission errors often lead to unnecessary packet discards, even when most data remains intact. Existing recovery methods address this issue but suffer from high recovery delays in noisy environments and false positives caused by checksum collisions, resulting in redundant retransmissions. This letter presents a novel method, termed Combined Recovery, which replaces traditional Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) codes with Homomorphic Message Authentication Codes (HMAC). By exploiting the homomorphic property of HMACs, Combined Recovery introduces a technique that enables efficient error correction with notably reduced search complexity. Simulation results across various scenarios demonstrate that Combined Recovery eliminates retransmissions and significantly reduces recovery delay, providing a robust and efficient solution for reliable communication over noisy channels.},

  abstract     = {Currently, semantic communication is predominantly confined to wireless communication scenarios, but not the general scenarios that transmit data packets. We propose packet semantic communication (PSC), a new semantic communication framework which achieves reliable transmissions in networks with packet loss. PSC works at the application layer, and it encodes the source data as binary data bits by using deep joint source-channel coding (DeepJSCC) and entropy coding, then transmits data as packets, and the decoder at the receiver performs the decoding process even when the packets are partially lost. We implement the proposed PSC for image transmission with a packet loss channel and compare its performance with the conventional better portable graphics (BPG) codec and learned image compression (LIC) model. The results obtained show that BPG and LIC are highly vulnerable to packet loss, but the proposed PSC can achieve strong robustness against packet loss, even when the packet loss rate (PLR) is as high as 80%.},

However, the resolution of the DD grid influences both algorithmic complexity and channel estimation (CE) performance. This letter proposes an adaptive second-order grid refinement (ASGR) scheme, which effectively balances computational efficiency and CE precision. To accurately estimate the doubly fractional channel in the OTFS system, a second-order Taylor expansion is used to approximate the measurement matrix. A fast Bayesian compressive sensing (FBCS) is then employed for preliminary hyperparameter estimation to reduce computational load. Subsequently, the pivotal parameters on the grid are adaptively adjusted, and the evolved points are inserted into the original grid to achieve local refinement. Simulation results show that the proposed ASGR achieves a performance gain of 4-6 dB over the off-grid FBCS.},

Previous studies have mostly assumed far-field channel conditions, based on which angle-based beamforming is adopted for the base station (BS) and IRSs. However, this approach may lead to degraded performance in practical near-field scenarios. To address this issue, we consider near-field channel modeling and formulate an optimization problem aimed at maximizing the received power at the user equipment (UE) by jointly optimizing the beamforming at the BS and IRSs. Given the intractability under the beam training (BT)-based communication framework, the problem is revisited and reformulated. Subsequently, an efficient algorithm based on alternating optimization (AO) is proposed to solve the reformulated problem. Numerical results demonstrate that, in typical setups, our AO-based beamforming designs provide over 170% and 20% received power gains over conventional angle-based beamforming and beam focusing, respectively. Furthermore, the power scaling law derived under far-field conditions no longer holds in near-field scenarios.},

First, for non-static MIMO scenarios, we develop a joint effect model by jointly considering the self-interference, co-channel interference and noise, aiming to maximize channel gain. Next, we derive a closed-form expression for the uplink outage probability by employing the Laplace transform of the interference. To reduce complexity, an approximate expression for the uplink outage probability is proposed according to a dynamic truncation criterion. Based on this, we derive a theoretical upper bound for the approximation error. Finally, the simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme significantly reduces the outage probability compared to state-of-the-art schemes, with the approximate solution showing less than 6% error and requiring only 7% of the computational time of the closed-form solution. Additionally, the impact of transmission power, antenna configurations, and retained higher-order terms on the outage probability is thoroughly analyzed.},

  abstract     = {Atmospheric ducts, formed by sharp refractive index gradients in the lower atmosphere, play a crucial role in signal propagation, particularly for next-generation communication systems operating in high-frequency bands (sub-6 GHz and beyond), where ducts can significantly modify signal paths. This study refines the standard ITU refractivity model through a region-specific correction and subsequently develops a multiple linear regression (MLR) framework to adapt the model using real meteorological data. The MLR model evaluates predictor significance, addresses multicollinearity, and applies statistical criteria to produce a localized refractivity estimate. To address residual nonlinear patterns not captured by MLR, a machine learning (ML) model is trained on the residuals and integrated with the statistical output to form a hybrid prediction. The region-specific (RS) model shows a systematic deviation from the ITU-based modified refractivity profile, with a mean difference of 4.67 M-units, a standard deviation of 3.49 M-units, and an RMSE of 5.83 M-units. These differences suggest that the ITU profile does not adequately represent local atmospheric conditions. Furthermore, the hybrid model reduces residual error relative to MLR alone. The results highlight the importance of incorporating RS adjustments and data-driven methods in modeling atmospheric ducts for propagation analysis.},

To enhance noise robustness, we develop a hybrid denoising scheme combining adaptive dual-tree complex wavelet transform with phase-space reconstruction. The designed DCA model can extract deep features from the multi-domain features of the denoised signal. It employs an attention-based parallel dual-pooling mechanism to preserve local-global feature correlation during downsampling. In addition, the composite loss function is used to improve generalization ability and reduce overfitting.

  abstract     = {Deep neural networks (DNNs) predistortion models of radio frequency (RF) power amplifiers (PAs), while offering excellent performance, typically suffer from high parameter counts and computational complexity. Convolutional NNs (CNNs) have been introduced to reduce model complexity due to their weight-sharing characteristic. However, the inherent calculation mode of traditional convolutional structures limits their ability to effectively capture temporal dependencies within the data, hindering their effectiveness in addressing memory effects in PAs. In this letter, we propose an enhanced digital predistortion (DPD) model based on a real-valued residual temporal convolutional neural network (RVRTCNN) for quadrature digital PAs (QDPAs). The proposed model incorporates dilated convolutions to extract features across multiple time steps and capture complex temporal dependencies, thereby enhancing its ability to address the dynamic nonlinearity of PAs. A 15-bit transformer-based QDPA chip, integrating Class-G and IQ-cell-sharing techniques, was fabricated by 28 nm CMOS process to validate our proposed method. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model achieves superior linearization performance with significantly fewer parameters and lower computational complexity compared to state-of-the-art (SOTA) models, improving both adjacent channel power ratio (ACPR) and error vector magnitude (EVM) by over 10 dB for the 802.11ax 40 MHz 64-QAM signal.},

Traditional fingerprint localization systems typically require significant time and labor for manual data collection and face challenges in maintaining data completeness. To address these challenges, this letter employs the MAE model with a high-masking strategy to simulate the missing RSS data. The model learns the spatial relationship between signal strength and location, allowing for accurate reconstruction of the radio map despite missing data. Improvements to the MAE model include adjusting input dimensions, modifying position encoding functions, and designing a loss function that targets masked regions. These enhancements help capture the spatial correlation between reference points (RPs) and access points (APs), improving reconstruction accuracy. Experiments results show that the MAE model outperforms traditional methods in effectively filling missing data. With 40% missing data, the error probability within 2 meters is about 95%, and with 80% missing data, it still remains around 93%. Moreover, the MAE model significantly reduces data collection time and requires less data to complete the radio map reconstruction, while saving over 85% of computational and human resources, all while ensuring localization accuracy.},

Through numerical simulations, we evaluate the bit error rate (BER) of the eavesdropper as a function of its spatial offset, transmitter tracking errors, and beam waist. The results demonstrate that even with high-quality detection, the eavesdropper’s performance significantly deteriorates beyond a critical misalignment threshold, making interception infeasible.

Yet, such approaches persistently confront the dual dilemmas of excessive feature degradation in signal processing or unwarranted dependence on prior knowledge assumptions, ultimately hindering real-world deployment.

  abstract     = {This letter introduces an enhanced normalized min-sum decoder designed to address the performance and complexity challenges associated with developing parallelizable decoders for short BCH codes in high-throughput applications. The decoder optimizes the standard parity-check matrix using heuristic binary summation and random cyclic row shifts, resulting in a Tanner graph with low density, controlled redundancy, and minimized length-4 cycles. The impact of row redundancy and rank deficiency in the dual code’s minimum-weight codewords on decoding performance is analyzed. To improve convergence, three random automorphisms are applied simultaneously to the inputs, with the resulting messages merged at the end of each iteration. Extensive simulations demonstrate that, for BCH codes with block lengths of 63 and 127, the enhanced normalized min-sum decoder achieves a 1–2 dB performance gain and $100\times $ faster convergence compared to existing parallel and iterative decoders. Additionally, a hybrid decoding scheme is proposed, which selectively activates order statistics decoding when the enhanced normalized min-sum decoder fails. This hybrid approach is shown to approach maximum-likelihood performance while retaining the advantages of the normalized min-sum decoder across a broad SNR range.},

Our method reshapes latent vectors into sub-vectors, applies a hyperparameter-based and bounded scalar quantization, while it integrates a nested dropout layer to prioritize sub-vectors based on their importance to CSI retrieval. Simulation results confirm that the proposed scheme significantly reduces the computational complexity, as it avoids to exhaustively search the quantization codebook, while it shows an improved CSI reconstruction ability compared to state-of-the-art multi-length CSI feedback models.

To address this issue, we design a novel network architecture for multi-user time-frequency-space joint channel extrapolation that integrates a temporal graph convolutional network (TGCN) and a dual-discriminator generative adversarial network (2DGAN). By leveraging geographic topology to capture time-frequency-space correlations within the channels and multi-user interactions, the designed network reconstructs full spatial CSI from partial spatial CSI and extrapolates future subcarrier allocation states on the basis of historical allocations. Consequently, this approach promotes efficient information sharing to reduce CSI acquisition overhead.

In this work, an antenna attitude-based beam pointing method using downlink data bursts from broadband satellites is proposed. The proposed method consists of two stages: in the acquisition stage, the user terminal achieves rough beam alignment using a 9-axis inertial measurement unit (IMU) as the conventional method; and in the tracking stage, super-resolution time difference of arrival (TDOA) measurements are obtained from a phased array antenna with multiple subarrays by receiving data bursts from the passing satellite. The TDOA measurements are fused with the triaxial gyroscope and triaxial magnetometer outputs through the proposed factor graph optimization-based fine attitude estimation algorithm to achieve fine attitude estimation results, from which the optimal beam pointing direction is derived. The simulation results show that the proposed method achieves 0.2° beam pointing estimation precision when a 1 ms, 100 MHz 5G non-terrestrial network (NTN) downlink orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) signal is available per second.},

  abstract     = {Smart helpers (SHs) have been proposed to improve content delivery delays and alleviate high fronthaul loads in fog radio access networks (F-RANs). They offer an alternative to deploying additional enhanced remote radio heads (RRHs), which are often infeasible due to site constraints. The optimal placement of SHs can significantly increase the number of users they serve which leads to enhanced cache efficiency and improved content delivery delay. In this letter, we optimize SH placement within an F-RAN to maximize the cache hit rate and further reduce the content delivery latency. We model the SH cache hit rate as a function of outage probability and user density distribution. We develop a function to estimate user density distribution leveraging the radial basis functions (RBFs) method and optimize SH placement utilizing the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. Our numerical results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed approach in maximizing the SH cache hit rate, thereby improving delivery delays and fronthaul loads of the network.},

This letter proposes matched location processing (MLP), a novel technique that achieves precise geolocation through coherent phase measurements from multiple satellites. MLP determines emitter locations by maximizing the correlation between received signals and location-specific modeled signals derived from radio propagation analysis. While extending spatial beamforming principles, MLP incorporates normalized phase correlation processing to surpass existing direct position determination (DPD) methods in both accuracy and computational efficiency. Simulation results demonstrate robust performance in extremely low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) environments, achieving geolocation accuracy within 10 km at −30 dB SNR.

However, the impact of this suppression phenomenon has not been sufficiently investigated. This letter presents an analysis of the suppression mechanism affecting LEO-NA signals in PI adaptive arrays and proposes a theoretical model to quantify its impact. Based on the proposed model and the maximum signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (MSINR) criterion, the optimal power augmentation for LEO-NA signals can be determined in a fixed scenario. Both theoretical analysis and experimental results demonstrate that the optimal power augmentation level is approximately 23.9 dB for a LEO-NA signal operating at the B3I frequency in a single-satellite augmentation configuration.},

This letter presents a novel two-step deep learning (DL) framework for MIMO-NOMA signal detection. The proposed two-step deep learning (DL) framework first employs an autoencoder (AE) to denoise the received signal, and then feeds it to the deep neural network (DNN) for signal detection. The proposed architecture utilizes an AE with convolutional layers and a dual-receiver DNN signal detection for each user signal, eliminating the need for SIC.

Specifically, the low-correlation elements of the effective channel matrix are set to zero by a preset threshold. Based on the reconstructed sparse matrix, approximate inverse operation can be implemented by Cholesky decomposition to reduce computational complexity. Moreover, the lower triangular matrix is constructed iteratively to improve detection performance. Simulation results indicate that the designed VV-EP algorithm is capable of reducing complexity by about 90% with a negligible performance loss compared to the orthogonal approximate message passing (OAMP) detector.},

It is noteworthy that the integration of distributed uplink multiple access and MEC has not been investigated in the existing literature, while distributed uplink RSMA can also be seen as a generalization of distributed uplink NOMA. In more detail, considering a system with two remote radio heads (RRHs) and two users, where the users have the ability to offload their data to either RRH, we aim to minimize the delay for the full offloading scenario. To this end, both the power allocation coefficient and the number of bits offloaded to each RRH are optimized.

This letter presents two key advancements. First, we develop an enhanced three-round cooperative repair scheme by using linearized polynomials corresponding to meticulously designed subspaces. Compared with the existing schemes, the proposed scheme maintains the same repair bandwidth while reducing the constraint to $ n {-} k \geq q^{m} $ with an integer $m\in \left [{{\frac {3}{4}\ell, \ell -1}}\right]$ , $\ell \geq 4$ .

Nonetheless, the main drawback of some cutting-edge techniques is the complex detection at the receiver by implementing the legacy maximum likelihood (MLi) scheme for signal demodulation. In this letter, a novel less complex detector is proposed based on performing a bitwise detection. The proposed scheme aims to reduce the received signal constellation search space by transforming the MLi-based detection to a search operation in a constructed binary constellation tree, resulting in a lower number of constellation points used for comparison. The proposed scheme is first introduced for single-input single-output (SISO) systems and then generalized for single-input multiple-output (SIMO) systems. The obtained results, backed up by Monte Carlo simulations, show that the proposed scheme manifests an identical performance as the optimal MLi scheme with a logarithmic complexity in terms of the modulation order compared to a linear one for the benchmark MLi one. Furthermore, closed-form expressions for the bit error probability are derived for the M-ary phase shift keying (PSK) modulation with $M=4$ and 8 (QPSK and 8-PSK) modulation schemes.},

Due to its Doppler shift sensitivity, the time-varying characteristic will degrade the performance of OFDM. After Doppler shift compensation, the algorithms for eliminating NBI and IN are proposed within the sparsity-aware framework for OFDM system. In particular, the proposed interference mitigation technique exploits the sparsity of NBI and IN in the frequency and time domains, respectively. The chirp-z transform combined with the least square method is first used to address the issue of NBI causing the spectrum leakage effect after OFDM demodulation. Furthermore, based on the OFDM measurements with NBI suppression, the turbo compressed sensing algorithm is performed to iteratively correct the estimate of the impulsive noise from the residual NBI interference and ambient noise.

To address these limitations, we propose a deep learning-based two-stage dual-reflection cascaded channel estimation for multi users multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system. In the first stage, the dual-reflection channel of a reference user is estimated and in the second stage, the channels of the remaining users are estimated using the reference estimate. The proposed approach operates the first RIS in a known fixed mode, while the second RIS in a dynamically adjustable mode, reducing the number of pilots and channel coefficients to be estimated.

Compared to existing NNs, the proposed NNs-based cancelers require less complexity when realizing comparable cancellation performance to the polynomial-based canceler, and improve the SI cancellation ratio by about 1 dB. Moreover, the residual SI signal power can be reduced to only 1.73 dB above the noise floor with minimal increase in complexity.},

  abstract     = {A secure integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system enhanced by an active reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) is investigated in the letter. Unlike existing works, the proposed fairness-aware beamforming framework jointly ensures fair multi-target detection and secure multi-user communication. The objective is to maximize the minimum beampattern gain across target directions, subject to constraints on secure transmission, power budgets, active RIS reflection coefficients, and the noise introduced by the active RIS. To solve this non-convex problem, an alternating optimization (AO) algorithm that leverages penalty-enhanced successive convex approximation (SCA) is developed, which enhances beamforming gain and angular uniformity over standard semidefinite relaxation (SDR). Simulation results confirm the superior performance of the proposed design scheme compared to existing baseline schemes.},

To fill this gap, this letter proposes an orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM)-guided mobility-robust JSCC (MR-JSCC) scheme for wireless image transmission in multipath high-mobility channels. Leveraging an attention mechanism-based signal restorer, the scheme mitigates time-frequency selectivity effects and refines feature information using pilots. The restorer captures channel state information to separate and map aliased image features caused by inter-carrier interference. Experiments demonstrate that MR-JSCC outperforms existing JSCC schemes in multipath high-mobility scenarios, even beyond the model’s training range.},

Specifically, in the considered system model, a base station equipped with MAs assists in computing tasks offloaded from multiple devices. In contrast to previous works focusing on continuous antenna movement, a more realistic scenario involving discrete antenna position selection is taken into account under the constraint of minimum antenna distance. To maximize the total task completion rate of all devices, it is essential to jointly optimize the transmit power and computation rate at each device as well as MA position selection while satisfying power and discrete antenna selection constraints. To address this challenging mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem, we first reformulate the original problem into an equivalent, more tractable form by Lagrangian dual transform. Then a penalty dual decomposition based method is proposed to efficiently find the stationary solutions. Simulation results confirm that MA-assisted MEC systems significantly outperform the conventional fixed-position antenna and antenna selection based schemes.},

These models typically discretize the time horizon into fixed intervals, inherently introducing spatial discretization when network nodes are mobile. Spatial discretization is also widely applied in reinforcement learning approaches. While temporal and spatial discretizations reduce computational complexity, they may introduce inaccuracies, especially in highly dynamic systems. This letter presents analytical upper bounds for the relative deviation in signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in both optical wireless communication (OWC) and RF, focusing on how grid granularity affects SNR accuracy through theoretical analysis. The results show that, under identical grid conditions and ideal node orientation, OWC experiences up to 45% higher relative SNR deviation than RF. Furthermore, an upper bound is derived as a function of node velocity and time interval, indicating that OWC requires 31% shorter time intervals than RF to achieve comparable SNR accuracy. Simulations validate the model, confirming that the theoretical upper bounds closely align with empirical results.},

We propose an EVT-based adaptive quantile loss function that integrates EVT into the loss function of the deep recurrent neural networks (DRNNs) with gated recurrent units (GRUs) to predict extreme channel conditions efficiently. The numerical results indicate that the proposed GRU model, utilizing the EVT-based adaptive quantile loss function, significantly outperforms the traditional GRU. It predicts a tail portion of 7.26%, which closely aligns with the empirical 7.49%, while the traditional GRU model only predicts 2.4%. This demonstrates the superior capability of the proposed model in capturing tail values that are critical for URLLC systems.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, Long Range (LoRa) modulation has attracted much attention from both academia and industry because of its capability to offer long-distance, low-power communication through the use of chirp spread spectrum (CSS) modulation at the physical layer. However, LoRa is slow in link speed, reaching a maximum data rate of 50 kbps, and unable to deliver adequate data rates. We present Combination-Encoded CSS (CE-CSS), which is compatible to the legacy LoRa. At the physical layer, CE-CSS can transmit multiple concurrent symbols in a single chirp period to increase link capacity, while avoiding the need for complex demodulation processes. The core of CE-CSS is a combination-encoded mechanism that focuses on encoding combinations of all concurrent symbols, rather than only modulating individual symbols. CE-CSS enables standard LoRa demodulation to extract out the concurrent symbols by only one pass of Fast Fourier Transform, without requiring any complex processes or customized hardware deployed at the gateway. The simulation-based experiments show the effectiveness and efficiency of our design.},

This BPD focuses on the codes with a repair degree of $d = k + 1$ and handles the repair of parity nodes naively. Compared with previous piggybacking designs, BPD has lower average repair bandwidth for $l=2$ and $r\geq 3$ . Moreover, we prove that BPD can be given over a field $\mathbb {F}_{q}$ with $q\leq 256$ when $n\leq 15$ and $r\leq 4$ . For instance, the proposed BPD based on the $(14,10)$ Reed-Solomon (RS) code can be given over $\mathbb {F}_{2^{8}}$ , which achieves approximately 41% savings in the average repair bandwidth for systematic nodes over the naive repair approach. This is the lowest repair bandwidth achieved so far for $(14,10)_{256}$ RS codes with $l=2$ .

In this work, we model THz outdoor small-scale fading channels using the mixture gamma (MG) distribution, considering absorption losses, spherical wave propagation, MC, and spatial correlation across large base stations and RISs. We derive the distribution of the cascaded RIS-aided channel and investigate linear channel estimation techniques, analyzing the impact of various channel parameters.

To enhance generality of the model, we use an elliptical geometry structure to describe scatterers distribution, and derive channel impulse response for both the communication and sensing channels. The proposed model can be adapted to various bistatic sensing scenarios by adjusting the parameters. Subsequently, we analyze space-time-frequency correlation function.

The network is pre-trained using unlabeled noisy modulation signals and constellation diagrams, effectively learning to reconstruct their equivalent noiseless signals and diagrams. DenoMAE achieves state-of-the-art accuracy in automatic modulation classification (AMC) tasks with significantly fewer training samples, demonstrating a $10\times $ reduction in unlabeled pretraining data and a $3\times $ reduction in labeled fine-tuning data compared to existing approaches.

Therefore, designing effective synchronization codes, i.e., codes capable of correcting IDS errors, is essential for DNA storage systems. Marker codes are a favorable choice for this purpose. In this letter, we extend the notion of marker codes by making the following key observation. Since each DNA base is equivalent to a 2-bit storage unit, one bit can be reserved for synchronization, while the other is dedicated to data transmission. Using this observation, we propose a new class of marker codes, which we refer to as half-marker codes. We demonstrate that this extension has the potential to significantly increase the mutual information between the input sequence and the soft outputs of an IDS channel modeling a DNA storage system. Specifically, through examples, we show that when concatenated with an outer error-correcting code, half-marker codes outperform standard marker codes and significantly reduce the end-to-end bit error rate of the system.},

  abstract     = {Channel estimation in the IEEE 802.11p standard is particularly challenging because of its time and frequency selectivity, making it difficult for current channel estimation schemes to accurately track the channel, especially in high mobility scenarios. This letter proposes a deep learning-based channel estimation scheme using the GA-GRU-AT model. The scheme employs gated recurrent unit (GRU) optimized by genetic algorithm (GA) to more accurately extract time and frequency domain features of the channel, and incorporates adaptive time (AT) processing to further suppress noise propagation. Simulation results show that this scheme outperforms existing deep learning-based channel estimation schemes for the IEEE 802.11p standard under various modulation schemes and high mobility channel conditions.},

However, conventional methods rely on both source and target domain data, presenting practical challenges related to data privacy and big data transmission. This study proposes a source-free domain adaptation method enabling target model adaptation without source data. Specifically, our approach utilizes multi-neighborhood semantic consistency and spatial adjacency to encourage uniform predictions for features with analogous characteristics, serving as regularization objectives during optimization. Additionally, a discrete loss function distracts the prediction of potentially dissimilar features. Experimental results show that this method achieves an average identification rate of over 89% without relying on source domain data.},

It is demonstrated that the CCFD system provides significant advantages, not only by increasing data rates through the doubled bandwidth for bidirectional transmissions, but also by allowing a larger number of transmitted data symbols, thereby enabling the longer blocklengths, which can reduce the error rate further. Subsequent analyses focus on the issue of spectral efficiency for a given error probability. Notably, gains exceeding 2 are observed when the self-interference (SI) is effectively canceled below a certain threshold.

To maximize the achievable communication rate while satisfying the minimum sensing signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) threshold, we jointly optimize the digital beamforming of base station, the holographic beamforming of RHS and the passive beamforming of RIS. To deal with the complicated non-convex optimization problem, an alternating optimization (AO)-based algorithm is adopted to decouple it into three subproblems which are further solved individually. Particularly, penalty concave-convex procedure (PCCP) method is utilized to deal with the rank-one constraint of passive beamforming subproblem and successive convex approximation (SCA) is utilized to simplify the complicated quadratically constrained quadratic programming (QCQP) of holographic beamforming. Simulation results demonstrate the superiorities of the proposed system as compared with its counterparts, and also show that the AO-based algorithm outperforms the benchmark algorithms obviously.},

In this letter, we describe a method for transmitting MIMO OTFS in 5G NR resource grid without any modification to the 5G NR pilot and the resource grid structure. We present the corresponding receiver which uses channel estimates obtained from the demodulation reference signal (DMRS) pilots of 5G NR PHY.

We find that the coded error performance of OTFS mapped to 5G NR resource grid is superior to that of the existing OFDM based 5G NR by 3 dB or more.

Unlike previous works assuming perfect channel state information (CSI), this letter addresses the robust MA position optimization problem under imperfect CSI conditions for a multiple-input single-output (MISO) MA system. Specifically, we consider two types of CSI errors: norm-bounded and randomly distributed errors, aiming to maximize the worst-case and non-outage received signal power, respectively. For norm-bounded CSI errors, we derive the worst-case received signal power in closed-form. For randomly distributed CSI errors, due to the intractability of the probabilistic constraints, we apply the Bernstein-type inequality to obtain a closed-form lower bound for the non-outage received signal power. Based on these results, we show the optimality of the maximum-ratio transmission for imperfect CSI in both scenarios and employ a graph-based algorithm to obtain the optimal MA positions. Numerical results show that our proposed scheme can even outperform other benchmark schemes implemented under perfect CSI conditions.},

As in this region, the signal received power (SRP) heavily depends not only on the separation distance between user equipment (UE) and BS but on concrete coordinates of UE, more comprehensive wavefront engineering methods than beamforming need to be used. To enable seamless switching between the antenna’s operational regimes, reliable algorithms determining the location of UE with respect to the BS are needed. In this letter, we utilize the tools of machine learning and propose a simple yet reliable state detection algorithm and test it using two scenarios: (i) UE moves along guiding rail, and (ii) UE moves freely in hand of a user. Our results show that a long short-term memory (LSTM) network provides the best performance having detection accuracy higher than 90% even in the case of UE in hand scenario and reaching unity for UE on rail. Simple tree-based algorithms can detect the change between near- and far-fields with accuracy reaching 80-85% and 95-97% for these scenarios. Thus, we recommend utilizing LSTM algorithm with detection window size of 100–300 allowing for fast (200–400 ms) state detection and facilitates online implementation.},

While deep learning methods have shown significant potential for automatic RFF feature extraction and identification, their reliance on large labeled datasets limits their practical applicability. This letter proposes a contrastive self-supervised learning framework integrating von Neumann entropy and exponential moving average (CSEE). With the support of CSEE, an RFF extractor can be pre-trained using unlabeled auxiliary datasets from the source domain. CSEE can directly control the eigenvalue distribution in the final representation’s autocorrelation matrix, thereby optimizing representation properties such as rank and isotropy while reducing information redundancy, thus preserving critical signal-domain features. In the target domain, only a few samples are needed to fine-tune the model to achieve good recognition accuracy. We conducted cross-domain SEI experiments using ADS-B as the source domain with LoRa and AIS as two separate target domains. The results show that with just 30 fine-tuned samples, the CSEE-pretrained RFF extractor achieved nearly 90% identification accuracy, surpassing other self-supervised learning methods. These findings demonstrate the strong generalization capability of CSEE across different target domains. The codes are available at https://github.com/NavLabLqs/CSEE.},

  abstract     = {This letter investigates the significance of designing a reliable, intelligent, and true physical environment-aware precoding scheme by leveraging an accurately designed channel twin model to obtain realistic channel state information (CSI) for cellular communication systems. Specifically, we propose a fine-tuned multi-step channel twin design process that can render CSI very close to the CSI of the actual environment. After generating a precise CSI, we execute precoding using the obtained CSI at the transmitter end. We demonstrate a two-step parameters’ tuning approach to design channel twin by ray tracing (RT) emulation, then further fine-tuning of CSI by employing an artificial intelligence (AI) based algorithm can significantly reduce the gap between actual CSI and the fine-tuned digital twin (DT) rendered CSI. The simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed novel approach in designing a true physical environment-aware channel twin model.},

To enable efficient aggregation over the multiple access channel, we derive analytical solutions for the optimal transmit scalars at the clients and the de-noising scalar at the parameter server.

  abstract     = {Communication signal prediction holds great significance for the optimization and deployment of B5G networks. In this letter, we propose a neural network model with Propagation Path Serialized Representation (PPSR) to predict the signal. Previous works treat the propagation path as a whole, ignoring the position sensitivity of propagation. For example, obstacles located in different positions should have varying effects. To solve this issue, PPSR proposes a serialized representation of the path. It divides the path into multiple propagation units. Each unit is represented by its geographical and position information, transforming the path into a position-sensitive sequence. PPSR then employs an effective sequence processing network model: Transformer, to derive the overall path representation from the propagation units. The Transformer can capture the correlation among different units along the path. Experiment results show that the proposed PPSR outperforms the existing methods in both prediction accuracy and model generalization ability, which mainly owes to the full consideration of the positional sensitivity and correlation among the propagation units on propagation paths.},

To address this challenge, this letter proposes an importance-aware rate control semantic communication (IRCSC) scheme, which dynamically adjusts transmission rates in response to both channel conditions and semantic importance. The scheme employs a contribution-based importance analyzer to rank semantic importance. Additionaly, a novel metric, the semantic transmission integrity index (STII), is proposed to quantify the amount of correctly transmitted information and to correlate it with inference performance. Simulations indicate that, with low computational complexity, IRCSC guarantees a controllable trade-off between performance and rate, delivering higher compression efficiency and improved task performance in high-SNR scenarios.},

Signal feature-based spoofing detection methods effectively identify spoofing signals using early and late correlators to extract signal features. However, using multiple features as machine learning (ML) inputs can lead to the curse of dimensionality. To address this, the study proposes an optimal feature construction method. This method uses principal component analysis (PCA) to generate essential features and a logistic regression (LR)-based approach to construct these generated features into one feature, i.e. principal component regression (PCR). The study then employs a one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D CNN) to compare and evaluate the PCR method against conventional composite features. The results show that the PCR consistently outperforms conventional features, indicating higher spoofing detection effectiveness and the potential to safeguard critical communication infrastructures against spoofing attacks.},

To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel companding method that incorporates Orthogonal Peak Cancellation (OPC). Although OPC may introduce spectral leakage, this leakage does not convey useful information and can be discarded. The proposed approach maintains the original bandwidth, thereby enhancing spectral efficiency. Simulation results demonstrate that, under bandwidth constraints, the proposed method offers improved BER performance compared to conventional companding schemes.},

  abstract     = {Accurate blind estimation of the symbol timing offset (STO) and carrier frequency offset (CFO) in time-frequency overlapped satellite (TFOS) signals is crucial for monitoring such signals without pilot sequences. To address this challenge, this letter proposes a novel high-precision joint blind estimation algorithm for STO and CFO in TFOS signals. Specifically, we construct an objective function parameterized by STO and CFO using the cyclic correlation functions (CCFs) of TFOS signals. Furthermore, we develop the improved water flow optimizer (IWFO) method to efficiently search for the optimal solutions of the objective function, achieving superior convergence performance. Numerical results show that the proposed algorithm requires an extremely low sampling rate, supports multiple modulation schemes, and markedly outperforms benchmark algorithms in terms of estimation accuracy.},

  abstract     = {SDN has emerged as a new approach to network management, enabling intelligent and centralized control in VANETs. Most SDN technologies, however, have been designed exclusively with Ethernet in mind, creating significant challenges for the integration of IEEE 802.11 wireless interfaces. These challenges mainly stem from improper Medium Access Control (MAC) address translation between IEEE 802.3 and IEEE 802.11 frame headers, which often leads to the use of tunneling solutions, and consequently, challenging network control processes when operating in high mobility scenarios. This paper presents a novel approach that avoids such shortcomings, by proposing a new technique called SD4ADDR that enables a transparent and seamless resolution using a set of encapsulation techniques along with an optimized data plane for better control on Vehicle-to- Everything (V2X) communication scenarios. An evaluation was conducted showing a minimal overhead of the solution with the additional encap and decap operations, maintaining, at the same time, the throughput on UDP and TCP.},

The aim of this letter is to characterize the array gain achieved by pinching-antenna systems (PASS). A closed-form upper bound on the array gain is derived by fixing the inter-antenna spacing. Asymptotic analyses of this bound are conducted by considering an infinitely large number of antennas, demonstrating the existence of an optimal number of antennas that maximizes the array gain. To approach this bound, an antenna position refinement method is introduced. The relationship between the array gain and inter-antenna spacing is further explored by incorporating the effect of mutual coupling. It is proven that there also exists an optimal inter-antenna spacing that maximizes the array gain. Numerical results demonstrate that by optimizing the number of antennas and inter-antenna spacing, PASS can achieve a significantly larger array gain than conventional-antenna systems.},

The collection of timestamps plays a crucial role in common centralized clock synchronization, directly affecting synchronization accuracy. However, the exchange of timestamps is susceptible to the impact of packet loss. To address this issue, this letter proposes a matrix completion scheme based on random matrix approximation to recover the lost timestamp information. First, we formulate the clock synchronization problem based on incomplete timestamp information as a low-rank matrix completion problem. By utilizing the principle of random matrix approximation, we can efficiently recover complete timestamp information using partial timestamp information. Furthermore, the recovered timestamp information is then used to estimate the clock skew and clock offset with a maximum likelihood estimator (MLE). Numerical results confirm the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed approach.},

The energy requirement of the smart devices (SDs) is minimized through the joint optimization of task offloading parameters, RIS configuration, and the receive beamforming of the base station (BS). A key contribution is that we find the semi-closed-form receive beamformers as a function of the RIS phases. Hence, the joint optimization is decoupled between convex offloading scheduling and non-convex RIS configuration by alternating optimization (AO). Another contribution is that we convexify the per-subcarrier power constraint by exploiting successive convex approximation (SCA), and acquiring a Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) point solution for the RIS configuration. Numerical results show the superiority of the new approach compared with baseline schemes in energy saving, and reveal that the optimal RIS location hinges on the channel quality differences among the RIS, BS, and SDs.},

  abstract     = {To enhance the security of wireless communications, we propose a constellation splitting-based friendly jamming scheme in this letter. The scheme splits the real and imaginary (or the in-phase and quadrature) components of a complex signal, using the real part to convey private information while embedding artificial noise into the imaginary part. Upon receiving the signal, the legitimate receiver can separate the real and imaginary components to extract the private information, while the eavesdropper’s signal remains obscured by the artificial noise. We analyze the bit error rate (BER) of the proposed scheme, with results showing that the eavesdropper’s BER remains at a high level.},

  abstract     = {In practical massive Internet of Things (IoT), the backscatter device (BD) in ambient backscatter communication (AmBC) systems can be illuminated by multiple ambient sources. However, multiple sources cause severe multi-source direct-link interference (M-DLI) to the BDs while providing multi-source backscattering. The signal-to-noise-plus-interference ratio (SINR) is sensitive to the transmit power of the sources. To fully benefit from multiple sources, this letter introduces transmit power coordination (TPC) strategies to suppress M-DLI and enhance backscattering by tuning the transmit power of the sources within their available ranges, which is particularly suitable for densely deployed passive BDs. To conduct the TPC strategies, the primary objective is to minimize the bit-error-rate (BER) in the multi-source AmBC system by solving a Rayleigh quotient (RQ) maximization problem. Simulation results show that the proposed TPC-assisted receive beamforming method achieves more efficient symbol detection than traditional AmBC detectors and outperforms conventional multi-antenna techniques, especially under low direct-link signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions.},

Unlike prior works that assume the SNR of the received signal is known and input a predetermined SNR value into a deep learning (DL) network, MVSC introduces an implicit SNR estimation module, allowing the network to infer channel conditions for SNR adaptation. To further improve performance, we propose the MVSC4, a joint-optimized of MVSC, which is trained using a multi-task learning strategy that simultaneously optimizes image reconstruction, SNR estimation, signal denoising, and image classification. This joint optimization enhances the network’s robustness to varying SNR conditions, particularly in low-SNR environments. Comparative experiments on CIFAR-10 and Kodak datasets demonstrate that MVSC4 outperforms both CNN-based and Transformer-based methods in terms of Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) and Multiscale Structural Similarity (MS-SSIM). The results demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed approach.},

To minimize the average SL, different transmission designs are analyzed, in which the optimal solutions of SNR and block-length are provided. Numerical results validate our analysis and reveal the trade-off between reliability and security and the impacts of the block-length, SNR, and packet-generating rate on average SL, of which SNR and the block-length account for main factors.

In this study, a cross-layer update scheduling method for pipelined layered MET-QC-LDPC codes is proposed to achieve improved conflict resolution. Through a probabilistic analysis, we show that by pairing layers with relatively small common degrees and performing alternating updates between the paired layers, better conflict resolution can be achieved than the layer-by-layer updating approach. Experimental results demonstrate that, at medium to low code rates, 50% to 75% of memory conflicts can be mitigated through the proposed cross-layer scheduling compared to the layer-by-layer scheduling approach, without compromising decoding performance.},

This letter investigates an RIS-assisted wireless powered sensor network (WPSN) where sensors distributed in an area harvest energy from an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and subsequently transmit their data to the fusion center (FC) using the Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) protocol, aided by an RIS mounted on the UAV. In the proposed model, the wireless power transfer (WPT) time is predetermined as a fraction of the total data transmission time and is excluded from the optimization variables. The objective is to maximize the sum throughput by optimally allocating time to the sensors and adjusting the phase shifts of the RIS elements. The resulting non-convex optimization problem is solved by decomposing it into two subproblems: first, determining the optimal phase shifts; and second, developing an algorithm for optimal time allocation using the Lagrange dual method and Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions. Excluding the WPT time from the optimization variables enables us to develop an efficient algorithm for time allocation with significantly reduced execution time compared to scenarios where WPT time is also an optimization variable, while maintaining comparable performance.

In each iteration, the ISD reconstructs and cancels IAI and ISI, then applies the Gauss-Seidel (GS) iteration method to solve the TS domain equations following interference cancellation. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed ISD, showing its ability to significantly reduce interference in the MIMO-OTFS system.

  abstract     = {This letter proposes an efficient method to reduce path splits in the successive cancellation list (SCL) decoding. We construct the boundary consisting of single-bit and multi-bit nodes that have a low error probability within the SC-decoding tree. The nodes on the boundary are considered with only two candidates per path instead of descending to their child nodes. To establish the boundary, we investigate the error probability of multi-bit nodes in the SC-decoding tree. The proposed method reduces the overall decoding cycles by approximately 70% while maintaining almost the same error-correcting performance as the conventional SCL decoding method.},

The approach explicitly factorizes the characteristic polynomial into two lower-degree polynomials, preserving the distinction between odd and even matrix orders without resorting to approximations. The ability to efficiently compute these eigenvalues is critical for optimizing channel capacity, transmit beamforming, and other key operations in massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, which are essential for improving data rates, reliability, and spectral efficiency in wireless communications. This work derives the approximate eigenvalues using the Cauchy interlacing theorem. It then validates the accuracy of the proposed eigenvalue expressions by comparing them with existing expressions in the literature and applying them to massive MIMO capacity estimation, showing improved precision.},

Aiming to maximize system capacity, we conceptualize the issue as a multi-branch bipartite graph matching problem with specially designed vertices, and propose an ‘access-right’ based two-step matching mechanism for satellite channel allocation (ARSMM). ARSMM runs in two steps. Firstly, the mechanism employs a Hungarian algorithm based on determining ‘access-right’ to obtain satellite-UE scheduling. Secondly, it introduces a matching adjustment algorithm based on three criteria, respectively, to accommodate the varying channel demands of the UEs. Numerical simulation results indicate that ARSMM markedly improves resource utilization efficiency and system capacity compared to the baseline algorithm. Moreover, it achieves near-parity with the Genetic Algorithm while significantly improving processing speed to millisecond-level efficiency.},

  abstract     = {Underwater acoustic (UWA) communications generally rely on cognitive radio (CR)-based ad-hoc networks due to challenges such as long propagation delay, limited channel resources, and high attenuation. To address the constraints of limited frequency resources, UWA communications have recently incorporated orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA), significantly enhancing spectral efficiency (SE) through multiplexing gains. Still, the low propagation speed of UWA signals, combined with the dynamic underwater environment, creates asynchrony in multiple access scenarios. This causes inaccurate spectrum sensing as inter-carrier interference (ICI) increases, which leads to difficulties in resource allocation. As efficient resource allocation is essential for achieving high-quality communication in OFDMA-based CR networks, these challenges degrade communication reliability in UWA systems. To resolve the issue, we propose an end-to-end sensing and resource optimization method using deep reinforcement learning (DRL) in an OFDMA-based UWA-CR network. Through extensive simulations, we confirm that the proposed method is superior to baseline schemes, outperforming other methods by 42.9 % in SE and 4.4 % in communication success rate.},

To meet the growing demand for low-latency communication with acceptable complexity, belief propagation (BP) decoding emerges as an attractive option, although its ECP is known to fall short of those high-latency alternatives.

Moreover, we investigate the design of the polar code rate profile and corresponding Tanner graph representation to enhance the benefits of RL. Numerical results demonstrate a performance gain of more than 1 dB for polar codes with a length of 128 and a rate of 0.5 compared to conventional BP decoding alone at high $E_{b}/N_{0}$ values, demonstrating the promise of the proposed approach.},

Experimental results show that the proposed GAN-RpeSC has significant advantages in improving image transmission quality, with a 0.3 dB improvement in peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) compared to the ViT module alone.},

An effective strategy is introduced for the joint optimization of communication parameters, sensing beamforming designs, and reflecting coefficients, with the goal of enhancing the minimum signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) among all UEs. To address the complexity of this non-convex optimization problem, a robust alternating optimization method is designed. The numerical results confirm that the proposed approach significantly boosts the minimum SINR in CF-ISAC systems, demonstrating the advantages of utilizing RISs.},

This motivates the proposal of SeaAKA, a novel protocol designed to achieve efficient authentication in 6G networks. The SeaAKA protocol implements seamless group-based cross-layer authentication through a novel voting mechanism that coordinates physical-layer authentication (using lightweight approaches) with upper-layer verification (employing Shamir’s secret sharing). This integration reduces computational and communication overhead during repeated authentication cycles while maintaining high accuracy. Security analysis using BAN logic confirms SeaAKA’s resilience against replay attacks along with data integrity/privacy preservation. Evaluations demonstrate SeaAKA’s superior efficiency over existing methods, reducing communication overhead from 4.244 to 0.0006 ms and computational overhead from 2,432 to 512 bits.},

However, with the development of information technology, requirements for data flow have become diverse. Particularly, when multi-type data flow (MDF) is used, games, videos, calls, etc. are all requirements. Thus, there may be a constant switch between these requirements, and also multi-type requirements at the same time. Consequently, the demands of users change over time, which prevents the traditional teletraffic analysis from being applied directly to infrastructure construction for MDF. This letter proposes new probabilistic models to discuss the blocking probabilities of MDF, whose requirements depend on the time of demand duration, and analyzes the models in three states: non-tolerance, tolerance and delay, in order to meet a more general and practical data flow utilization. When the requirement random variables are co-distributed with respect to time, we prove the practicability of the Erlang Multirate Loss Model (EMLM) under MDF cases, from a mathematical perspective by discretizing time and error analysis. An algorithm of pre-allocating resources is given to guild the construction of base resources for MDF.},

If the UE does not have global navigation satellite system (GNSS) capability, pre-compensation of the Doppler shifts cannot be made. Thus, synchronization signals are required which could be detected subject to large frequency offsets. We propose superposed pairs of interleaved Zadoff-Chu (SPI-ZC) synchronization sequences, each ZC sequence being interleaved by a linear permutation polynomial (LPP). The LPP renders a large set of sequences and sequences with improved peak-to-sidelobe-ratio (PSR) in the periodic correlation function, which improves the probability of correct synchronization.

To tackle the challenges associated with the detection of unauthorized AAVs and the efficient scheduling of authorized AAVs, this letter introduces a novel performance metric, termed sensing capacity, for integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems. This metric, which quantifies the capability of a base station (BS) to detect multiple AAVs simultaneously, leverages signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and probability of detection (PD) as key intermediate variables. Through mathematical derivations, we can derive a closed-form solution for the maximum number of AAVs that can be detected by the BS while adhering to a specific SNR constraint. An approximate solution based on PD constraints is proposed to facilitate the efficient determination of the threshold for the maximum number of detectable AAVs. To generalize the analysis, we extend our investigation to practical scenarios with closely-spaced AAVs, incorporating inter-AAV interference effects. The accuracy of this analytical approach is verified through extensive simulation results.},

This letter investigates Central Processing Unit (CPU) power utilization at the NodeB (base station) level, focusing on User Equipment (UE) connection states by making use of a USA testbed (i.e., POWDER testbed).

We present key findings from simulated and physical NodeB experiments conducted on the USA testbed, with real hardware. The findings include the relationship between power utilization and forced throughput, the impact of an increasing number of UEs on power utilization, the effects of different UE connection states (active, idle, or not connected), and the behavior of uplink and downlink throughput in both simulated and physical setups.

Unlike existing methods, our method considers a dynamic scenario involving mobile primary users (PUs) and secondary users (SUs) and addresses the complexities introduced by user mobility. The transformer architecture utilizes an attention mechanism, allowing the proposed method to model the temporal dynamics of user mobility by effectively capturing long-range dependencies. The proposed method first computes tokens from the sequence of covariance matrices (CMs) for each SU. It processes them in parallel using the SU-transformer to learn the spatio-temporal features at SU-level. Subsequently, the collaborative transformer learns the group-level PU state from all SU-level feature representations. The main goal of predicting the PU states at each SU-level and group-level is to improve detection performance even more. The proposed method is tested under imperfect reporting channel scenarios to show robustness. The efficacy of our method is validated with simulation results that demonstrate its higher performance compared to existing methods in terms of detection probability $P_{d}$ , sensing error, and classification accuracy (CA).},

We adopt advanced antenna combination selection strategies to further decrease complexity and enhance BER performance. Moreover, a low-complexity detector is designed in this investigated scheme while maintaining the acceptable BER. This detector also reduces complexity and mitigates the side effects of imperfect CSI estimation. The analytical performance of the LEO-GSSK scheme is presented in this letter, along with some interesting insights and conclusions given in simulation results. Besides, to approach practical wireless environment, the imperfect CSI estimation is considered in simulation results. The theoretical analysis and simulation results indicate that the LEO-GSSK scheme with novel antenna combination selection and detector designs, outperforms traditional schemes, offering a promising solution to meet the high data rate and reliable connectivity demands of satellite communications.},

  abstract     = {Frequency up-conversion is an essential step in wireless communication systems. Meanwhile, frequency multipliers are increasingly becoming an integral part of communication chains operating at millimeter-wave (mmWave) and sub-terahertz (sub-THz) frequencies. They offer a viable alternative to traditional mixers, which are highly constrained by their instability and high phase noise at such high frequencies. Despite the frequency multipliers’ advantages and the fact that they are commonly recommended by hardware designers, there is a lack of comprehensive theoretical guidelines detailing their impact on digital communications. One key aspect is their tendency to induce bandwidth expansion, a phenomenon not observed with mixers. When an N-fold frequency multiplier is used, a common practice among hardware designers is to allocate a bandwidth scaled by a multiple of N, which is deemed large enough to keep signals integrity. We provide an analytical framework to quantify the exact scaling factor of the bandwidth expansion. Contrary to common belief, we show that the bandwidth expansion scales as $ \sqrt {N} $ , using three counterexamples, namely Gaussian, Sinc, and raised cosine pulses. These findings can help conserve radio resources and further decrease the noise effect.},

In the system studied, a sender emits periodic pulses of signal molecules that propagate through the environment, while a receiver observes these pulses to determine the sender’s direction. We propose the Pulse Timer Algorithm (PTA), a novel approach that leverages the Doppler shift, where the observed intervals between pulses change depending on the receiver’s motion relative to the sender. By setting a timer upon pulse detection, the PTA enables the receiver to maintain its direction of movement toward the sender if pulses arrive before the timer expires or change direction if no pulse is detected. Comparative analysis with the Pulse Interval Comparison Algorithm (PICA) demonstrates the PTA’s superior performance in guiding the receiver to the sender efficiently.},

  abstract     = {Holographic multiple-input multiple-output (HMIMO) is an emerging technology for 6G communications, in which numerous antenna units are integrated in a limited space. As the HMIMO array aperture expands, the near-field region of the array is dramatically enlarged, resulting in more users being located in the near-field region. This creates new opportunities for wireless communications. In this context, the evaluation of the spatial degrees of freedom (DoF) of HMIMO multi-user systems in near-field channels is an open problem, as the analytical methods utilized for evaluating the DoF in far-field channels cannot be directly applied. In this letter, we propose a novel method to calculate the DoF of HMIMO in multi-user near-field channels. We first derive the DoF for a single user in the near field, and then extend the analysis to multi-user scenarios. In this latter scenario, we focus on the impact of spatial blocking between HMIMO users. The derived analytical framework reveals that the DoF of HMIMO in multi-user near-field channels is not in general given by the sum of the DoF of the HMIMO single-user setting because of spatial blocking. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. In the considered case study, the number of DoF reduces by 21.2% on average due to spatial blocking.},

Closed-form expressions for outage probability and ergodic capacity are derived for maximum ratio combining (MRC) receivers, complemented by asymptotic analysis in high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regimes. Extensive simulations validate the analytical results and demonstrate a critical trade-off: while increasing the number of APs yields marginal outage probability improvement due to THz backhaul limitations, it substantially enhances ergodic capacity through effective spatial multiplexing.},

Subsequently, an improved density peak clustering (DPC) algorithm is used to identify the density distribution of PU signal strength and accurately predict PU coverage areas, exhibiting robustness against channel fading and noise. Finally, a radio map coverage prediction based CSS (RMCP-CSS) detector is proposed, which efficiently fuses predicted PU coverage for enhanced spectrum sensing.

  abstract     = {Filter shape index modulation (FSIM) is a promising approach that unlike most existing index modulation schemes does not sacrifice resource utilization by deactivating available resources but rather uses pulse shaping filters as indexing parameters. This principle is the key to enhance spectral efficiency and/or energy efficiency. However, the filter bank design relaxes the Nyquist criterion for zero intersymbol interference (ISI) to have more distinguishable filters and the inherent controlled ISI can be managed at the receiver side. This letter presents FSIM-Net, a simple neural network (NN)-based detector that enables joint detection of filter indices and QAM/PSK symbols in the presence of filters’ inherent ISI. FSIM-Net is trained offline in an additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel and tested under various conditions by decoupling of inherent ISI and channel effect handling. The proposed receiver demonstrates superior performance especially in more realistic scenarios while simplifying the FSIM receiver architecture and avoiding potential error propagation compared to the conventional one.},

  abstract     = {Space-to-ground optical communication (STGOC) utilizes laser beams to establish bidirectional links between satellites and ground stations (GSs), which are sensitive to cloud blockage. In practical STGOC downlink scheduling, the uncertainty of link availability caused by cloud motion and dissipation is inevitable. We are the first to address STGOC downlink scheduling under the uncertainty of link availability, where the objective function aims to maximize the amount of data downloaded from the satellites. We provide a formulation of the scheduling problem based on Scenario Generation Approximating (SGA) while preserving the formulation linearity. A Greedy Heuristic-based algorithm is designed to solve the problem. Simulation results indicate that considering uncertainty can enhance data throughput, with the average optimality gap being 0.61%, while the running time is reduced compared to Gurobi and Kuhn-Munkres-based methods.},

  abstract     = {The vehicular slicing network with dynamic multi-service (VSN-DMS) enables vehicles to support multiple services with dynamically changing types. In this architecture, vehicles can access multiple base stations (BSs) and leverage different network slices (NSs) to meet the requirements of various services. However, frequent service variations and vehicle mobility introduce high handover (HO) costs and inefficient decision making. This letter proposes a novel two-timescale optimization framework to jointly optimize vehicle service (VS) association and subcarrier (SC) allocation. Specifically, in the long-timescale, we propose a federated deep reinforcement learning (FDRL) algorithm to optimize VS association. Unlike conventional reinforcement learning approaches that require centralized data collection, FDRL enables distributed model training across vehicles while aggregating parameters in the cloud. This mitigates the issue of insufficient training data caused by frequent VS changes, while also ensuring vehicle data privacy. In the short-timescale, we propose a versatile alternating coalitional game and swap-matching game algorithm (ACGSM) to optimize SC allocation. By iteratively executing coalitional formation and swap-matching mechanisms, ACGSM efficiently improves the quality of the solution while adapting to dynamic network conditions. Simulation results demonstrate the convergence of FDRL and show that the proposal outperforms benchmarks in improving long-term QoS and reducing the number of HOs.},

FSO was conducted through a controlled channel in the lab under six distinct turbulence levels, and the efficacy of using ML to classify turbulence levels was examined. ML-based turbulence level classification was found to be >98% accurate with multiple ML training parameters. Classification effectiveness was found to depend on the timescale of changes between turbulence levels but converges when turbulence stabilizes over about a one minute timescale.},

However, existing RB-based SLIPT systems are limited to single-receiver configurations. This work introduces a multi-receiver RB-SLIPT system capable of simultaneously transmitting energy and information to multiple receivers. An analytical model based on multi-mode rate equations and diffraction transmission theory is developed to evaluate the energy transfer and communication performance in multi-receiver scenarios. Numerical simulation results demonstrate that in a dual-receiver scenario, the proposed system is capable of transmitting 2 W of optical power to each receiver while achieving a communication capacity of 5.8 bit/s/Hz.},

To address this problem, we propose a task-oriented concept for source information validity and source compression algorithms. Specifically, we consider semantic communication models in single- and multi-source systems and use the semantic context as well as correlation among sources to reduce redundant transmissions of information. We also study the relationship of code rates between Shannon, distributed, and semantic source coding, detailing the properties of the task and source under equal rates.

In contrast to the existing works, we first propose a novel outage probability definition to exactly measure the outage performance of this RSMA system. Then, based on the proposed outage probability, we take the Rayleigh fading channel as an example for performance analysis, where we analyze the security-reliability tradeoff by deriving an analytical expression for the optimal average sum outage rate (ASOR) under a target eavesdropping probability. Moreover, we also derive a simple but tight closed-form approximation for the optimal ASOR in the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime.

Due to the sparsity of the delay-Doppler (DD) domain, most existing algorithms utilize compressed sensing (CS) for OTFS channel estimation, while requiring a known channel sparsity. However, in cases that the sparsity is not readily accessible, the estimation accuracy of these CS algorithms decreases dramatically. In this letter, we propose a Smoothed $\ell _{0}$ (SL0) algorithm free of prior knowledge about channel sparsity for OTFS channel estimation. We obtain a novel vector expression of the input-output relationship in the DD domain and formulate it as a sparse signal recovery problem. In the case of unknown sparsity, a low-complexity SL0 algorithm is introduced to solve the problem with a faster reconstruction speed.

Additionally, the received signal is decomposed into two branches along different dimensions, and an SBL combination method with weighted average fusion and a fixed-point update rule is employed to further improve the performance.

  abstract     = {Radio frequency wireless power transfer (WPT) is a promising technology to charge low-power devices in future wireless systems. In this letter, energy-efficient WPT in wideband systems is studied, ensuring that each device meets its minimum energy harvesting (EH) requirement under both perfect and imperfect channel state information (CSI) scenarios. To this end, the digital beamformer, the true time delayers (TTDs), and the phase shifter-based analog beamformer are jointly optimized. Since the energy beamforming flexibility depends on the base station (BS) antenna’s architecture, the BS employs two hybrid beamforming architectures, sub-connected (SC) and fully-connected (FC) TTD, which charge EH devices in the near-field region. Since minimizing the transmit power is non-convex and decision variables are highly coupled, an alternating optimization algorithm based on semi-definite programming and semi-definite relaxation is proposed to solve the original problem. Furthermore, a matrix scale reduction scheme is leveraged to decrease computational complexity. Simulation results show that the SC architecture performs better than the FC architecture in both perfect and imperfect CSI scenarios. Additionally, the SC architecture decreases convergence time relative to the FC architecture by more than ten times.},

Existing methods tackle this challenging problem either by employing convex optimization techniques with high complexity, or by decoupling the problem into two subproblems: heuristic scheduling followed by separate precoding design, which often results in noticeable performance loss. In this letter, we propose a novel low-cost joint design approach for scheduling and precoding, which, compared to existing methods, can achieve superior performance while maintaining low computational complexity. Specifically, we formulate an approximate throughput maximization joint optimization problem leveraging signal-to-leakage-and-noise ratio (SLNR). This formulation facilitates the joint design by allowing us to directly determine the optimal precoding in closed forms and equivalently transform the joint design into a reformulation that relies solely on multiuser scheduling. We then propose a low-complexity iterative algorithm where closed-form solutions are derived in each iteration.},

These improvements ensure both the diversity gain and enhanced bit error rate (BER) performance. Further, a low-complex maximum likelihood (ML) detection is proposed for bit recovery.

Then, we exploit the imperfect channel state information to formulate an optimization problem, aiming at minimizing the long-term average power, while meeting quality-of service constraints, transmit power budget and data-queue stability constraints. To solve this mathematically complex problem, we apply the Lyapunov optimization technique to convert the original problem to a per-slot penalized power minimization problem, and propose an iterative algorithm combining with Bernstein inequality to acquire the BF weight vectors.

  abstract     = {In this letter, we present automated modulation classification (AMC) for reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted multiple input multiple output-orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (MIMO-OFDM) systems under imperfect channel state information (CSI), residual carrier frequency offset (CFO) and symbol time offset (STO) errors. We leverage a triple attention-aided vision transformer (TrpViT) architecture, which uses a vision-centric approach within the transformer network to enhance global information acquisition. The TrpViT is implemented by utilizing three complementary attention mechanisms spatial, dilated, and channel attention in a unique attention block. This unique attention block extracts spatially local features while expanding the scope to capture more comprehensive signal features. The adopted attention mechanisms effectively capture long-range spatial dependencies and channel interactions within input signals by optimizing the model complexity. The performance of the proposed method is compared against existing models and it has been demonstrated that the proposed method accurately classifies higher modulation schemes for RIS-assisted MIMO-OFDM systems. The computational complexity of the proposed model is also compared with the existing state-of-the-art.},

  abstract     = {Orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) modulation, because of its excellent performance in fast time-varying channels, has been proposed as an alternative to orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing modulation in high-mobility scenarios. Time and frequency diversity can be fully exploited in OTFS systems with proper signal detection. However, most existing signal detection algorithms are based on message passing (MP) algorithms, and their signal detection performance rapidly deteriorates when the channel has low sparsity. In this letter, we first model the OTFS signal detection problem as an optimization problem and propose an alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM)-based algorithm to solve the problem. On this basis, we further propose a modified ADMM-based algorithm by replacing the penalty term to address the performance loss caused by constraint relaxation. The numerical results show that the proposed algorithms are effective in terms of convergence and detection performance.},

The UAV swarm communication is also an important scenario but challenging due to the limited spectrum resources and serious interference among UAV swarms. This letter proposes a topology optimization method for UAV swarm communication, where each UAV transmits data to a collection center directly or via other UAVs while considering malicious jamming. The proposed method jointly designs the information transmission path of all UAVs and transmission power to simultaneously maximize the minimum communication network capacity among all UAVs.

Meanwhile, we propose a method for optimizing decoder parameters using the density evolution (DE) analysis, which allows the TMP decoders to achieve performance close to that of the belief propagation decoders.

However, most of the existing sparse MIMO have design limitations, lack a generic approach, and generate many holes in co-array, especially with coprime sparse arrays. To this end, we propose a ubiquitous MIMO (U-MIMO) system, which employs a new supplementary tri-level (STiL) receiver (Rx) and a transmitter (Tx) of increased inter-element spacing. The STiL scheme can be designed for any number of Rxs and applies to different sensor arrays. The inter-element spacing of the proposed Tx is increased by the total number of virtual lags in the difference co-array of STiL Rx to produce a longer sum co-array of the difference co-array (SCDC) for the U-MIMO system. As a result, the proposed approach not only overcomes the design constraints but achieves higher DOFs with no or minimum number of holes in SCDC, even when coprime arrays are used. The closed-form expressions are provided for precise sensor locations and calculating the DOFs. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the U-MIMO system using different sensor arrays.},

  abstract     = {Beyond diagonal reconfigurable intelligent surface (BD-RIS) is a family of RIS architectures more flexible than conventional RIS. While BD-RIS has been primarily analyzed assuming uni-polarized systems, modern wireless deployments are dual-polarized. To address this gap, this letter investigates the fundamental limits of dual-polarized BD-RIS-aided systems. We derive the scaling laws governing the performance of BD-RIS and the Pareto frontier of the trade-off between performance and circuit complexity enabled by BD-RIS. Theoretical results show that the group-connected RIS with group size 2 provides remarkable gains over conventional RIS in both Rayleigh and line-of-sight (LoS) channels, while maintaining a reduced circuit complexity.},

  abstract     = {Conventional Internet of Things (IoT) technologies such as RFID, Bluetooth, and Wi-Fi exhibit compromise between energy-efficiency and communication range. Long Range (LoRa) technology is pillared on guaranteeing battery lifetimes for up to ten years while promising reliable communication at the scale of ten kilometers. Such capabilities exhibit an exclusive potential of LoRa to proliferate a vast set of localization-based IoT use cases. This letter evaluates the theoretical and practical capabilities of LoRa-based distance ranging which is a fundamental constituent of Time Difference of Arrival (TDoA)-based localization. The letter first derives the theoretical Cramer-Rao Lower Bound (CRLB) for ranging of LoRa signals. A simulation model is then developed that incorporates practical reception aspects such as frequency offset estimation errors. The distance errors attained from simulations are compared against the theoretical bounds and the impact of frequency offsets is evaluated. Furthermore, an experimental Software Defined Radio (SDR) setup is devised for practical evaluation of distance ranging over a span of Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) values.},

The internal parameters and the number of layers of the TRHyper based channel neural decoding algorithm can be updated without retraining. We design the size of each TRHyper layer according to the size of the factor tensor in tensor ring format. During the training phase, we reuse the storage space for the learning weights of the main decoding network, so the proposed TRHyper no longer require additional storage space for its learning weights. Numerical results show that for low-density parity check (LDPC) codes, the performance of the TRHyper based channel neural decoder is similar to that of the original decoder, while for Bose-Chaudhuri-Hocquenghem (BCH) codes, the performance slightly exceeds the original decoder.},

However, existing multi-stage codebook design methods limit the potential coding gain. Besides, although the minimum Euclidean distance (MED) is commonly used as the performance criterion for additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channels, existing works indicate that the MED does not always reflect the actual error performance. This letter proposes a novel structured codebook design for joint parameter optimization based on the union bound, which addresses the mismatch of MED and enhances the error performance. Specifically, we develop strategies for constructing the one-dimensional constellations, CMMs, bit labeling set, and treat these factors as optimizable parameters. The union bound is employed as the design metric to jointly optimize the aforementioned parameters with genetic algorithm (GA). Simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed codebook design method.},

The most significant and notable difference between the two is the optical power, which is several orders (7 or more) of magnitude distinct from each other. There are several approaches to address this issue – in this letter, at a glance, the realistic and practical approach, which relies on the selection of high-grade optical filters, was chosen. Rigorous, however affordable, optical filtering is required to avoid any possible crosstalk, not only from the classical data signals but also from the spontaneous nonlinear Raman scattering effect. In our experimental verification, it has been demonstrated that the selection of high-grade transmission components is a crucial element in the success of multiplexing strong and weak optical signals in a single fiber. In real-world applications, this approach significantly reduces infrastructure costs by eliminating the need for additional fiber.},

However, conventional PE algorithms often assume a constant or slowly varying channel, limiting their effectiveness in rapidly changing environments. In this letter, we propose a transformer-based deep PE network specifically designed for time-varying channels. To compensate for carrier frequency offsets (CFOs), we incorporate an adaptive parameter correction module. Moreover, the network implements a pre-extractor to capture multi-scale channel features, enabling it to handle time-varying conditions effectively.

Thus, we propose a high-precision localizer of jamming via preprocessing the covariance matrix. First, we introduce 2-Level-Toeplitz (2LT) structure matrix for 2D coarray signal, and derive it in terms of the entries of a Toeplitz matrix. Second, we parameterize the 2LT matrix and borrow the structured covariance estimation technique to obtain the least squares close-form solution. Finally, we reconstruct the noiseless augmented covariance matrix and apply 2D DOA estimation method. Our simulations show that structured covariance matrix enhances the performances of 2D DOA estimation with sparse arrays for jamming signals. Specifically, the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of our estimator consistently approaches the Cramér-Rao Bound (CRB) for different signal-to-noise ratio values and an increasing number of jamming devices.},

For the outer algorithm, we introduce the Dinkelbach operator to transform the fractional programming problem into a tractable subtractive form, involving the beamforming (BF) vector, AN vector, and IRS reflecting phase shift. In the inner algorithm, the integer problem is decomposed into two simpler sub-problems, then sub-optimal solutions can be obtained by iteratively optimizing the sub-problems. The simulation results verify that using AN can efficiently enhance the SEE in IRS-aided MISO systems, and the advantage of incorporating AN becomes even more pronounced in the presence of multiple eavesdroppers.},

  abstract     = {Relays can significantly improve the performance of over-the-air computation (AirComp) networks, especially when the sensors and the fusion center (FC) are far apart. However, the relay’s energy supply is a common constraint factor of relay-assisted AirComp networks. To address the power constrained issue, we introduce power-splitting (PS) relays into an AirComp network, where the relays can harvest energy from the transmitted signals of the sensors and the FC by the PS scheme and then forward the signals to the FC by using the harvested energy. Our objective is to minimize the computational mean square error (CMSE) at the FC by jointly optimizing the transmit coefficients at the sensors, the amplify and forward (AF) coefficients and PS ratios at the relays, and the de-noising factor at the FC, under the individual power constraints at the sensors and relays. The optimization problem is highly non-convex and difficult to solve. By exploiting the inexact block coordinate descent (IBCD) algorithm and the constrained concave-convex procedure (CCCP), we propose an IBCD-CCCP algorithm to solve the optimization problem effectively. Numerical results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of our scheme as compared to the baseline methods.},

To overcome these issues, we propose ZCLoRa, which leverages the Zak transform and exploits its sparse representation capabilities, enabling effective signal denoising. The Zak-transformed signal is processed by a convolutional neural network (CNN) for enhanced symbol decoding. We evaluate the performance of ZCLoRa in terms of symbol error rate (SER), showing significant improvements in decoding accuracy while maintaining the low complexity and power efficiency essential for IoT devices.

Similar to fingerprint methods that utilize features such as angle of arrival (AoA) and receive signal strength indicator (RSSI), CrossNet leverages neural networks to extract positional information from channel state information (CSI). However, instead of relying on direct matching within a database, CrossNet learns the implicit relationship between CSI and location through training, enabling more accurate and robust localization. The purpose of joint channel estimation and localization is to obtain more precise positioning information from more accurate channel estimation. We built a single-input single-output (SISO) downlink communication system on the DeepMIMO dataset and generated the necessary data for our experiments. We conducted multiple comparative experiments to evaluate the performance of CrossNet. Extensive comparative experiments demonstrated that CrossNet effectively utilizes pilots for user equipment (UE) localization and significantly improves localization accuracy through joint channel estimation.},

  abstract     = {This letter investigates the channel estimation for near-field line-of-sight (LoS) extremely-large multiple-input-multiple-output (XL-MIMO) communications, where both the transceivers are equipped with uniform linear arrays (ULAs). For near-field LoS channels within millimeter wave and sub-teraherz frequency bands, electromagnetic waves typically propagate with little diffraction or scattering, implying the propagation direction of each plane-wave component remains almost invariant under the Fourier plane-wave series expansion. This invariance indicates a strong correlation between the propagation directions of transmitted and received plane-wave components, called geometric prior in this letter. Initially, we utilize the wavenumber-domain sparsifying basis to decompose the channel into several plane-wave components. Then, we deduce the potential locations of non-zero entries in the wavenumber-domain channel matrix for any relative orientation angle between the ULAs. Subsequently, a two-stage channel estimation framework is further proposed. Specifically, the first stage aims to derive the orientation angle, and the second stage performs compressed sensing within a reduced search space. Simulation results are provided to validate the robustness of our proposed angle and channel estimation.},

Considering multiple two-user pairs, we formulate a worst-case achievable sum rate maximization problem by jointly optimizing the transmit power of ground users and the receive BF of UAV. The difficulties of this problem arise from the complex trigonometric form of the angle-of-arrival (AoA) uncertainties caused by UAV jitter. To address these challenges, we first derive an approximation method based on the second-order Taylor series expansion to simplify the AoA uncertainties, and then convert the resulting random quadratic forms into deterministic forms by applying S-Procedure. Based on these, we propose a penalty function-based successive convex approximation algorithm to obtain a suboptimal solution to the original problem.

In addition to applying phase tuning, the active elements apply an amplification to its incident signal, which can alleviate the double-fading effect inherent in RIS systems. The choice of the elements to be made active conveys information bits through indexing. Additional bits can be conveyed through symbols from a modulation alphabet. In this letter, we propose methods to design improved HRM signal sets that achieve better bit error performance. The idea is to schedule the activation of tiles of elements in an ordered way that picks tiles with highest effective response and ignores those with lowest effective response. Specifically, we propose a signal set design procedure that efficiently packs non-equidistant signal points on the positive real line when all active elements use the same amplification factor. We further improve this signal set by obtaining the optimum amplification factors that maximize the minimum Euclidean distance of the signal set.

Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed FFIC-EP detector yields significant performance improvements compared to conventional methods, providing a flexible trade-off between performance, complexity, and interconnection costs, especially in scenarios with low BS-antenna-to-user ratios.},

However, these methods have to integrate large amounts of data for training and often struggle to adapt to new and unseen scenarios. This letter proposes a domain generalization method based on domain adversarial training (DAT) and mutual information (MI) estimation, where cross-environment generalization localization is achieved by extracting domain-invariant features, eliminating the need for training data from new scenes.

In this letter, we use a cost-efficient topology to scale up the CF-mMIMO system, which allows the new AP (NAP) to connect to the CPU through existing APs (EAPs), called chain topology. As the EAP needs to forward signals from NAPs to the CPU, we assume each EAP can connect only a limited number of NAPs. Utilizing stochastic geometry tools, closed-form expressions of fronthaul length for star and chain topology are derived, respectively. Based on them, we find that the chain topology can significantly reduce the system cost. Moreover, the benefits of the chain topology become increasingly evident as the system scales up.},

On this basis, we present the maximum-minimum spatial spectrum of the NC signals (NC-MMSS) detection, which can detect the signal of primary user (PU) and provide corresponding angle of arrival (AoA) information. Then the theoretical expressions of probability of false alarm, decision threshold, and probability of detection are derived.

Traditional techniques including orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) and non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) are not suitable under such conditions due to their susceptibility to interference and Doppler effects. To address these challenges, this letter integrates rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) with orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) modulation, offering a novel robust solution for achieving high data rates and improved spectral efficiency. Further, we propose a novel dual block deep learning (DBDL) receiver for RSMA-OTFS, leveraging long short-term memory (LSTM) networks to enable signal detection without relying on successive interference cancellation. The DBDL receiver operates through two parallel deep neural networks, facilitating simultaneous decoding of common and private messages as a single process. We evaluate the symbol error rate (SER) performance of the DBDL receiver, demonstrating its parity with the optimal maximum likelihood (ML) receiver. Furthermore, we compare RSMA-OTFS with RSMA-OFDM, NOMA-OTFS, and NOMA-OFDM in terms of SER and rate region. Our results establish RSMA-OTFS as a promising solution due to its superior rate region performance across all other techniques, albeit at a slight expense in its SER compared to NOMA-OTFS.},

  abstract     = {We have developed a resource allocation scheme that minimizes the training process of federated machine models in the wireless powered communication networks. The new resource sharing method allows energy harvesting (EH) clients (EHCs) to train their local models for extended periods that overlap with data transmissions of other EHCs. Training latency minimization leads to mixed integer non-convex problem, which is tackled by exploiting the sensitivity properties of the corresponding Lagrange multipliers. If the local training models at all EHCs use equal size datasets, the optimal transmission order is in the decreasing order of the EHC-base station channels gains. The proposed resource allocations significantly reduce the training latency compared to the state-of-the-art benchmark schemes.},

The key underlying idea is to augment the bipartite graph by introducing hidden non-binary variables to strengthen the message-passing decoder. This is achieved by grouping items into bundles of size q within the test matrix, while keeping the testing procedure unaffected. The decoder, inspired by some works on counter braids, passes lower and upper bounds on the bundle values along the edges of the graph, with the gap between the two shrinking with the decoder iterations. Through a density evolution (DE) analysis and finite length simulations, we show that the proposed scheme significantly outperforms its binary counterpart with limited increase in complexity.},

Existing semantic image communication methods are mostly based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) or Transformers, which focus on different structural semantics. Specifically, CNNs with local convolution operations excel at capturing local semantic features, while Transformers based on multi-head attention mechanism, are better at modeling long-range dependencies and global semantic information. To effectively fuse these two models and leverage both advantages, we propose a parallel Transformer-CNN complementary (TCC) block, where CNNs and Transformers are combined to enhance the extraction of both local and global semantic information. Furthermore, we propose a TCC-based SemCom (TCC-SemCom) scheme for wireless image transmission. Experimental results verify that TCC-SemCom significantly outperforms existing schemes in terms of peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and multi-scale structural similarity index (MS-SSIM).},

Thus, this letter explores an ultra-low-complex solution for a multi-user, multi-target integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system equipped with an ELAA base station (BS). It maximizes the communication sum rate while meeting sensing beampattern gain targets and transmit power constraints. As this problem is non-convex, a Riemannian stochastic gradient descent-based augmented Lagrangian manifold optimization (SGALM) algorithm is developed, which searches on a manifold to ensure constraint compliance. The algorithm achieves ultra-low complexity and superior runtime performance compared to conventional algorithms. For example, it is 56 times faster than the standard benchmark for 257 BS antennas.},

This approach enables fully decentralized training and execution, minimizes information sharing between agents and significantly reduces communication overhead, which is typically the burden of interference management. The proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art multi-agent RL techniques where training is done in a decentralized manner.

  abstract     = {Radio Frequency Fingerprinting (RFF) is viewed as a potential strategy to enhance wireless security by utilizing inherent hardware characteristics of transmitters. Recently, Deep Learning (DL)-based RFF methods have been extensively studied and significantly improved identification performance. However, new challenges are introduced, particularly content dependency. This dependency emerges when signals contain unique transmitter identifiers (IDs), such as the ICAO addresses in Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) system. In such cases, DL models may prioritize these IDs over the intrinsic hardware fingerprint information, resulting in inflated accuracy. Moreover, as these IDs are vulnerable to tampering, their reliability and robustness are substantially compromised. To overcome this, we propose a novel content-agnostic RFF method that incorporates a consistency-guided robust learning framework. The proposed method employs a masking mechanism to zero out signal segments associated with transmitter IDs and processes both original and masked signals through a shared feature embedding, ensuring minimal content dependency while thoroughly extracting fingerprint information across the entire signal. To enhance its effectiveness, we introduce semantic consistency regularization to align the feature semantics of original and masked signals. Additionally, attention consistency regularization, leveraging class activation mapping, is employed to constrain the attention distribution across the two signal variants. These complementary strategies effectively mitigate the risk of over-reliance on transmitter IDs, ensuring comprehensive extraction of fingerprint information. Simulation results demonstrate robust identification despite transmitter ID tampering, and highlight its content independence.

Specifically, the OTFS-RSMA scheme categorizes users into high-speed users group and low-speed users group based on their mobility and then uses multicast to send cross-domain signals to the respective user groups, with RSMA used for transmission within the groups.

By comparing to the gamma substitute that has been widely used for approximating the lognormal shadowing model, we demonstrate that the InvG substitute is more mathematically tractable and rigorously prove that the InvG substitute, however, cannot yield a lower KLD than the gamma substitute when applying the same parametric mapping criterion.},

In this work, a Feature Contrastive Transfer Learning (FCTL) framework is proposed for few-shot long-tailed sonar image classification. The proposed framework combines transfer learning and contrastive learning to improve model performance under limited labeled data. First, a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) is pre-trained on a large-scale image dataset to learn general feature representations. Then, contrastive learning is employed to maximize the similarity between positive sample pairs and minimize the similarity between positive and negative sample pairs. Specifically, positive samples are generated through a Gaussian feature enhancement method, while the remaining samples in a batch are negative. In addition, a balanced sampling strategy is employed to optimize the unbalanced feature distribution of long-tailed samples. Experiments on two different sonar image datasets demonstrate that the FCTL framework outperforms existing methods in few-shot long-tailed sonar image classification tasks.},

Currently existing pointing error models are lacking in capturing the mmWave/THz radiation characteristics and/or the impact of antenna design and array design. Therefore, in this letter, a simple analytical pointing error model for highly directional mmWave/THz transmission is proposed. By utilizing the Gaussian beam approximation for both the array element radiation pattern and the array factor, the presented model incorporates antenna design parameters (maximum gain and 3 dB beamwidth) and array design parameters (number of array elements, element spacing, and 3 dB beamwidth). This approximation is validated via electromagnetic simulations in CST Microwave Studio. Afterwards, the statistics of the pointing error are derived according to the Gaussian beam approximation, and it is demonstrated that the pointing error follows a special case of the negative log-Gamma distribution with the shape parameter of 2 and the scale parameter depending on antenna/array design and jitter variance. It is shown that the proposed model aligns perfectly with the simulation results. Moreover, the outage performance of an aerial communication scenario is analyzed to examine the impact of pointing errors. The results have revealed that the antenna and array design parameters are as influential as the jitter variance, and they cannot be neglected.},

This letter delves into the compensation of carrier phase error (CPE) and its impact on OTFS modulation performance. To achieve this, a time-frequency (TF) domain-aided phase noise estimation scheme is proposed. First, a superimposed pilot scheme is introduced, in which the superimposed phase-tapped reference symbols (PTRS) are employed in the TF domain for estimating the CPE. Subsequently, a method that utilizes pilots in the DD domain to estimate the DD domain channel, and PTRSs in the TF domain to estimate the CPE is proposed. Through an iterative algorithm bridging these domains, the proposed scheme adeptly compensates for CPE in the DD domain. Simulation results demonstrate superior performance in terms of normalized mean squared error (NMSE) and bit error rate (BER), particularly in scenarios involving oscillator phase noise in both 28 GHz and 70 GHz systems.},

Besides, the desired signal is contained in the received signals, which leads to the phenomenon of self-canceling during the beamforming-based interference suppression. In this letter, a covariance matrix reconstruction-based wideband adaptive beamforming algorithm is proposed to maintain excellent interference suppression performance with low computational complexity. Different from the prior methods, a frequency-angle conversion for wideband beamforming is proposed to convert the wideband signal into several narrowband signals. Thus, an interference-plus-noise covariance matrix (IPNCM) for wideband beamforming can be reconstructed by strategies from narrowband beamforming. Meanwhile, a Gauss-Legendre quadrature (GLQ) is introduced to approximate the integral operation, which provides high accuracy and low computational complexity compared to the polynomial summation. Furthermore, a spatial response variation (SRV) constraint is introduced to reduce the number of constraints and obtain more degrees of freedom to promote interference suppression ability. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed beamformer with low computational complexity.},

  abstract     = {Ambient backscatter communication (AmBC) is a new advanced technology that utilizes ambient radio frequency signals to enable the communications of battery-free devices and has attracted much attention recently. Existing works develop the high-order modulation in signal domains including the time domain, the frequency domain and the space domain. However, the work in the code domain for AmBC remains missing. In this letter, we extend the high-order modulation to the code domain, i.e., high-order code shift keying (CSK). However, the detection that correlates the received signals with the candidate code cannot work due to the unknown source signals. To detect the active code index, the correlation energy detection (CED) is proposed in which the received signal energy instead of the amplitude is utilized. In this process, CED does not need the channel state information and source power knowledge. Simulation results show that the proposed CED can handle the complex source signal and achieve a desirable bit error rate (BER). The second-order CSK without the training sequences outperforms the on-off keying modulation with training sequences in terms of BER.},

  abstract     = {In this letter, hybrid automatic retransmission request with incremental redundancy (HARQ-IR) is applied to assist integrated sensing and communication (ISAC). The long term average throughput (LTAT) of HARQ-IR-assisted ISAC is maximized via power allocation while ensuring both communication and sensing reliability as well as total average power budget. Since the LTAT maximization is a non-convex problem, the asymptotic outage approximation is leveraged for problem relaxation. Subsequently, successive convex approximation (SCA) is exploited to convert it into a successive geometric programming (GP) problem. However, the GP-based solution underestimates the LTAT due to the large approximation error of the asymptotic outage probability at a low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). To address this issue, the original problem is transformed to a Markov decision process, which can be solved with deep reinforcement learning (DRL), e.g., deep deterministic policy gradient. Numerical results show that the DRL-based method delivers comparable performance to the GP-based one at high SNR while performing much better than the GP-based method at low SNR, albeit at the cost of higher complexity.},

To safeguard the confidentiality of transmitted semantics and effectively counteract eavesdropping threats, this letter proposes a secure deep learning-based semantic communication system, SecureDSC.

By incorporating a symmetric encryption module and an attacker-oriented adversarial network, SecureDSC guarantees the secure transmission between legitimate users in the semantic communications.

In this letter, we propose a novel low-complexity distributed WMMSE (LCD-WMMSE) algorithm, which is implemented over a decentralized architecture based on ring topology. Although each distributed unit (DU) in LCD-WMMSE works only with the local channel state information (CSI), LCD-WMMSE algorithm is still able to approach the performance of traditional WMMSE. Moreover, we show that LCD-WMMSE is also scalable since its required interconnection bandwidth is independent of the number of transmitter antennas, making it promising to various scenarios of massive MIMO.

Considering the mean-squared error (MSE) for estimation performance metric, the Bayesian Cramér-Rao lower bound (BCRB) is widely used in literature as a proxy of the MSE; however, the BCRB is not generally tight even asymptotically except for restrictive distributions. Instead, we characterize the full tradeoff between information rate and the exact MSE using the asymptotically tight BCRB (ATBCRB) analysis, a recent variant of the BCRB. Our characterization is applicable for general channels as long as the regularity conditions are met, and the proof relies on constant composition codes and ATBCRB analysis with the codes. We also perform a numerical evaluation of the tradeoff in a variance estimation example, which commonly arises in spectrum sensing scenarios.},

Towards this end, we formulate the secrecy energy efficiency (SEE) maximization problem and propose an alternating optimization-based two-level algorithm to solve it, where the semi-definite programming (SDP) combined with successive convex approximation (SCA) is adopted. Simulation results reveal that the proposed scheme has an 84.9% SEE gain over the passive RIS scheme for $N=150$ and gradually decreases when N increases.

To improve the design flexibility, the sensing beam pattern is distributed among different subcarriers for optimization, with phase vectors introduced to transform the modulus summation into a linear summation. Additionally, by decoupling the multi-variable constraint, we employ the alternating direction method of multipliers to decompose the original problem into manageable subproblems, which are iteratively optimized.

  abstract     = {In this letter, a robust transmit scheme is proposed to facilitate the co-design of communication and control in multi-loop wireless control systems (WCS), where the controller equipped with multi-antenna adopts beamforming (BF) technology to suppress various interference and improve link reliability simultaneously. To this end, we first establish an optimization problem to minimize the weighted sum of control cost deviation and energy consumption, while satisfying the control stability of each loop and the constraints of transmit power budget and internetwork interference level. Since the original problem is non-convex, we then convert the control stability constraint into a probabilistic constraint form with the lower bound probability of successful transmission. Furthermore, by jointly using the Bernstein Inequalities and successive convex approximation approach, we propose a robust BF scheme to implement communication and control co-design for multi-loop control system. Finally, simulation results demonstrate that our proposed method can significantly reduce the total system cost while maintaining the control stability and the interference power less than the acceptable level.},

  abstract     = {The growing number of connected devices in 6G networks requires advanced multiple access (MA) techniques and caching strategies to efficiently manage interference and enhance data rates. Caching offers a promising solution by storing frequently requested content at the network edge, reducing latency and alleviating backhaul congestion. Integrating caching with MA techniques is paramount for realizing the next-generation networks. Rate-splitting MA (RSMA) has emerged recently as a key candidate for future networks, due to its flexibility in managing interference and enhancing spectral efficiency. This paper presents a study on the performance of cache-aided RSMA (CA-RSMA) systems, which enhances the signal-to-noise-plus-interference (SINR) ratio. A multi-antenna equipped transmitter uses superposition coding, and two single-antenna equipped receivers use their cached content to remove the interference, which improves the SINR. We derive analytical expressions for key metrics, including probability of successful decoding (PSD), outage probability (OP), rate region and the weighted sum rate (WSR) for CA-RSMA. Furthermore, we formulate constrained optimization problems to maximize the PSD and WSR, in terms of the power allocation coefficients. Simulation results validate our analysis, and we show that CA-RSMA outperforms the conventional RSMA, non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA), space-division multiple access, in terms of the considered metrics. A performance comparison shows that CA-RSMA outperforms CA-NOMA in terms of RR and WSR at an expense of PSD.},

An adequate number of access points (APs) can meet the data rate requirements of user equipment (UE). Based on these insights, an iterative joint power allocation and passive beamforming algorithm (JPAPB) is developed for non-coherent transmission, considering selecting partial APs for UE and fronthaul capacity limit.

To address this issue, we introduce a weighted graph-based cooperative spectrum sensing method in this letter. Specifically, a signal-to-weighted-graph (STWG) mechanism for multi-user is proposed, which converts the signals of different users into a single weighted graph. To characterize the features of the weighted graph, graph sparsity is employed to represent the graph connectivity, upon which a test statistic is constructed. Moreover, a simple but practical method is proposed to estimate the detection threshold.

In this work, we first analyze the effects of inter-Doppler interference on the performance of OTSM systems. We then propose a sparse compensation maximum ratio combining (SC-MRC) detection algorithm to mitigate computational complexity. Specifically, a channel sparsification procedure is implemented by eliminating amplitude values that fall below a predetermined threshold, thereby substantially reducing the computational complexity associated with matrix multiplication. A low-complexity adaptive compensation scheme is introduced to mitigate the associated performance degradation.

However, existing signal detection methods for RIS-RSM assume perfect channel state information (CSI), which is impractical due to the passive nature of RIS. To overcome this, we first transform the unsupervised detection problem of RIS-RSM into a clustering problem and apply unsupervised clustering algorithms from machine learning to eliminate the need for CSI acquisition.

  abstract     = {The increasing demand for indoor location-based services (LBS) and the widespread use of mobile devices have spurred the development of accurate indoor localization systems for smartphones. Implementing these systems requires real-time responsiveness, non-cooperative communication with targets, and reliable localization capabilities. However, conventional active and passive localization systems face challenges, such as the necessity of target cooperation or latency caused by low measurement frequency. Additionally, the uncertainty in localization evaluation is often overlooked. In response to these issues, we present a WiFi-assisted non-cooperative fingerprint localization system (WiNCDN) that utilizes a dropout-based neural network. WiNCDN quickly gathers a large number of responses from WiFi devices by employing a hiding mechanism in the 802.11 protocol. Moreover, the system can make informed decisions based on localization confidence. Our findings demonstrate that WiNCDN enables real-time target tracking in various scenarios, including line-of-sight (LoS) and non-line-of-sight (NLoS) situations. Compared to existing methods, the results indicate that WiNCDN achieves a better balance between accuracy and robustness.},

  abstract     = {For polar codes, bit-flipping strategy can significantly improve the error-correction performance of the belief propagation (BP) decoding. However, the existing BP flipping (BPF) decoding algorithms require many attempts, due to their inefficiency in locating the erroneous positions. This leads to high decoding complexity, limiting their practical applications, especially for long polar codes. In this letter, an enhanced BPF (EBPF) decoding algorithm is proposed. It requires fewer flipping attempts, but yields an advanced decoding performance. By better utilizing the reliability and divergence of bit estimations, a novel weighted metric (WM) is introduced to identify the possible erroneous positions. During each new decoding attempt, the EBPF decoding takes turns to flip these positions. Our simulation results show that, with the same number of flipping attempts, the proposed decoding outperforms the generalized BPF (GBPF) decoding and the state-of-the-art BP correction (BPC) decoding.},

  abstract     = {In the intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) aided near-field systems, the IRS reflection phases, influenced by the coupling between the IRS units, significantly affect the performance. To improve the performance gains of near-field systems, the channel models based on IRS partitioning scheme are proposed for air-to-ground (A2G) millimeter-wave (mmWave) systems. The corresponding IRS reflection phases are designed, consisting of both the IRS unit-dependent reflection phases and the sub-surface-dependent reflection phases. The designed reflection phases not only compensate for phase variations introduced by the mismatches in the azimuth and elevation angles of IRS units but also for the phase variations due to the existence of distance differences from transceiver to the centers of sub-surfaces. Using the proposed partitioning scheme, the influence of the coupling between the IRS units on the reflection phase can be effectively mitigated. To further explore the impact of the IRS partitioning scheme on performance, a power leakage ratio, which is defined as the ratio of the leakage power using the partitioning scheme to the total received signal power, is introduced. Numerical results show that the received signal power of the proposed channel model matches that of the near-field model using the ideal reflection phases very well.},

We calculate the path metric range and log-likelihood ratio of each sub-channel. Then we select the frozen bits to maximize the probability of the correct path in the list.

The obtained analytical results, corroborated by Monte Carlo simulation, show that the spatial diversity of the receiving antennas significantly impacts the noise amplification limitation inherent to TDI. Therefore, unlike the single-input single-output (SISO)-TDI with ZF equalization, the SIMO-TDI can provide significant gain over SIMO-OFDM. For example, the BER improvement of the TDI using two-antenna was about 7 dB when compared to OFDM with the same number of antennas, which is drastically different from the SISO scenario.},

Unlike most RIS-assisted SSK schemes, which necessitate adjusting the RIS phase configuration at the symbol rate, the RIS-SSK-PB scheme permits phase adjustments at a slower rate, provided it is not slower than the inverse of the channel coherence time. This approach significantly reduces system overhead and mitigates hardware constraints. The main novelty in the proposed schemes lies in the idea of optimized channel-dependent RIS partitioning. Two RIS-partitioning schemes are first proposed and formulated as mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) problems. Suboptimal algorithms based on linear programming relaxation are subsequently presented to achieve much lower complexity with negligible performance degradation. Extensive numerical simulations demonstrated the superior performance of the proposed schemes.},

To address these issues, we propose a sensing information-assisted CSI feedback method to recover the off-grid downlink CSI at the BS. Specifically, the proposed method utilizes the sensing information from distinct data modality to form the off-grid prior information. Subsequently, by leveraging the off-grid prior information and the received CSI, the complex path gain of the downlink CSI is recovered. Finally, a high resolution grid is constructed to recover the off-grid CSI matrix, thereby enhancing the recovery accuracy. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method effectively mitigates the off-grid effect of the downlink CSI at the BS.

  abstract     = {As a paradigm shift in the scheme of wireless access, non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) can achieve massive connectivity and improve spectral efficiency, but introduces high complexity at the successive-interference-cancelation (SIC) receiver. In order to ensure low implementation complexity, SIC decoding has been designed by using a single criterion. The instantaneous-signal-power (ISP) criterion has been widely applied in NOMA, and the user with stronger ISP is first decoded. However, the ISP criterion ignores the impact caused by the data rate requirements in NOMA systems. Recently, we have proposed a new SIC criterion, namely the Relative ISP (RISP) criterion, to improve the ISP criterion to consider the impact of the target-data-rate (TDR) of each user. RISP is defined as a form of the ratio of ISP to TDR. In this letter, for the general multiple-user case at high signal-to-noise ratio, we mathematically prove that the RISP criterion has the better outage performance than the ISP criterion.

Although IRS has great promise, it is severely hindered by the beam squint problem resulting from the frequency-independent nature of the passive reflecting elements, especially in ultra-wide THz bands. To address this problem, we introduce time delay modules to the IRS and focus on the weighted sum rate maximization problem through the joint optimization of transmit beamforming, IRS phase shifts, and time delays. To solve the formulated optimization problem, an alternating optimization algorithm that decomposes the original problem into three subproblems is proposed. Specifically, we apply semidefinite relaxation and successive convex approximation techniques to solve each subproblem. Simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed scheme over recent literature works. Particularly, it achieves near-optimal performance with slightly increased hardware cost.},

Therefore, we employ both link layer FS and low-overhead physical layer actions for joint anti-jamming and establish distinct decision timescales based on these overheads. Specifically, we design distinct networks for different actions, utilizing cognitive information as rules to guide the agent optimization direction for resource deployment. Simulation results indicate that our method improves the throughput by 112.87% compared to the same timescale algorithm, which demonstrates the effectiveness of associating cross-layer actions at different timescales under highly dynamic interference conditions.},

Constellations consisting of equiprobable levels with exponential-like distribution are obtained, which possesses asymptotic optimality in the sense that the high-SNR capacity of average-intensity constrained optical intensity channel can be approached by such constellations with increasing size. All $2^{b}$ levels ( $b\in \mathbb {N}$ ) of the obtained constellation can be represented by a basic level and $b+2$ bits, thereby reducing the required resolution of the digital-to-analog converter (DAC) without affecting the asymptotic optimality. Achievable information rate evaluations verify the asymptotic optimality. As an example, error performance results of a simple 16-level LDPC coded modulation scheme show that a shaping gain of 0.65 dB can be obtained by applying the proposed constellation design.

The numerical results show that CPM-NOMA can achieve about $3\sim 6$ (dB) PAPR performance gain compared to conventional schemes. In the absence of nonlinear distortions, CPM-NOMA can obtain comparable or even better BER performance than conventional schemes with similar computational complexity. In the presence of nonlinear distortions, CPM-NOMA can offer robust and power-efficient downlink transmission with smaller PAPR and BER performance losses, and is also suitable for efficient PAs, but not for conventional schemes. Finally, CPM-NOMA can also achieve the trade-off between spectral efficiency, power efficiency and BER.},

  abstract     = {To ensure ultra-reliable, low-latency communications (URLLC) despite blockages, we propose using simultaneously transmitting and reflecting (STAR) reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs). These surfaces can transmit and reflect signals, expanding coverage on both sides of the RIS. However, phase shifter adjustments in STAR-RIS are limited by coupling constraints. We introduce a codebook design for phase-shift adjustment that accounts for these constraints. Leveraging this design, we jointly optimize base station beamforming and STAR-RIS phase-shifting to maximize the number of admitted URLLC users in a downlink multi-user communication system. Numerical results show that the proposed STAR-RIS codebook surpasses existing designs and effectively admits more URLLC users.},

Existing precoder designs for quantization-free systems are sub-optimal for such quantized systems, while the existing precoder designs for quantized systems consider single-cell settings and perfect channel state information (CSI). To address these gaps, we study the downlink linear precoder optimization problem in a cellular system under the distortions introduced by low resolution DACs based on a minimum mean square error (MMSE) approach, while accounting for imperfect CSI obtained in the uplink under distortions introduced by low resolution ADCs. The problem is analytically solved resulting in an optimal quantized multi-cell MMSE precoder that reduces both intra-cell and inter-cell interference under quantization errors, and yields better bit error rate performance than applying the existing conventional multi-cell and quantized single-cell linear precoders to a quantized multi-cell massive MIMO system.},

Specifically, the received signal is modeled as a low-rank third-order tensor fitting a typical polyhedral model which contains a factor matrix of channel parameters. Then, we design a structured tensor decomposition method to estimate the channel parameters by using the Vandermonde property of factor matrices.

  abstract     = {The passive reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) requires numerous elements to achieve adequate array gain, which linearly increases power consumption (PC) with the number of reflection phases. To address this PC problem, this letter introduces a rotatable block-controlled RIS (BC-RIS) that preserves spectral efficiency (SE) while reducing power costs. Unlike the element-controlled RIS (EC-RIS), which necessitates independent phase control for each element, the BC-RIS uses a single phase control circuit for each block, substantially lowering power requirements. In the maximum ratio transmission, utilizing statistical channel state information (CSI) to rotate blocks and coherently superimpose signals with optimized reflection phase of blocks, the BC-RIS achieves the same averaged SE as the EC-RIS. Rotating RIS blocks with the statistical CSI allows for slow mechanical rotation speeds. To counteract the added power demands from rotation, influenced by block size, we have developed a segmentation scheme to minimize overall PC. Furthermore, constraints for rotation power-related parameters have been established to enhance the energy efficiency of the BC-RIS compared to the EC-RIS. Numerical results confirm that this approach significantly improves energy efficiency while maintaining performance.},

Furthermore, the EE declines rapidly when the radar beampattern gain threshold increases to a larger value.},

The THz link serves as the backhaul communication link and is characterized by an $\alpha -\mu $ fading channel, path loss, absorption loss, and pointing errors. The sub-6 GHz RF carrier has been utilized for end-user connectivity. We incorporate hardware impairments (HI), channel state information (CSI) and, successive interference cancellation (SIC) errors at the receiver to capture realistic operating conditions. We have presented a mathematical framework for outage probability and average bit error rate and the asymptotic results to evaluate the proposed system’s effectiveness. The results are analyzed for various system parameters to provide further insights into system performance. Further, Monte Carlo simulations are performed to validate the analytical results.},

Our approach eliminates adversarial perturbations before the adversarial samples are fed into the deep learning model for localization. The localization performance of the proposed DCGAN is evaluated through experiments conducted with commodity Wi-Fi devices in representative indoor environments. Experimental results demonstrate that the DCGAN model effectively mitigates adversarial interference while maintaining excellent localization accuracy under two white-box attacks and one black-box attack.},

Furthermore, while the cell-less network concept, which eliminates cell boundaries, is under investigation, practical deployments often grapple with significantly limited backhaul connection capacities between base stations. This letter explores techniques to maximize the sum-rate performance within the constraints of these more realistically equipped multicell networks. We propose an innovative approach that dramatically reduces the need for information exchange between base stations to a mere few bits, in stark contrast to conventional methods that require the exchange of hundreds of bits.

Then, a simplified optimal power allocation algorithm is given by maximizing the constellation constrained (CC) capacity at high SNR for obtaining optimal superposed constellation. Comparing with the superposed 32-phase-shift keying (PSK) scheme, our proposed scheme employing successive interference cancellation (SIC) for detection has a lower decoding complexity. Moreover, a wider power coefficient ratio range at the threshold of mutual information (MI) greater than 4.98 is achieved by our proposed scheme. It also demonstrates that the MI and BER performances of proposed scheme outperform than those of the other three schemes when the power coefficient ratio is optimal at high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR).},

In the high input power regime, the gap between upper and lower bounds is within 0.5 nats per channel use, and the lower bound can be achieved with Gaussian input. In the lower input power regime, the capacity can be asymptotically approached by employing antipodal input. It is shown that the AWCN decoder can be applied to additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channels with negligible rate loss, while the AWGN decoder when applied to AWCN channels cannot ensure reliable decoding. For the vector receiver case, it is shown that a linear combining receiver front end loses the channel combining gain, a phenomenon drastically different from AWGN vector channels.},

To address this issue, we propose a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-aided UCN for URLLC.

Since the problem is intractable and non-convex, we develop an alternating optimization algorithm based on the inner approximation framework to solve it efficiently.

To address these issues, we propose a meta RL method for frequency-hopping spread spectrum (FHSS) jamming decision-making, aided by inexpert demonstrations. Firstly, the policy network is meta-trained with multiple diverse tasks to obtain initial network parameters with good generalization. Subsequently, we combine RL and behavioral cloning (BC) to extract useful information from demonstrations, along with learning rate adaptation to achieve efficient policy exploration without the task-customized jamming reward. Simulations confirm that our proposed method not only adapts to unseen jamming tasks with just a few fine-tuning steps under general binary rewards condition, but also achieves higher accumulated jamming rewards and results in lower normalized throughput for users, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.},

This letter proposes a diffusion model-based approach for Wireless Networked Control Systems (WNCSs) to minimize power consumption by optimizing the sampling period, blocklength, and packet error probability within the finite blocklength regime. The problem is simplified to optimizing blocklength through optimality conditions, and a dataset of channel gains and optimal blocklengths is generated via an optimization theory-based solution. The Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) is employed to generate optimal blocklength values, conditioned on channel state information (CSI). The core idea is to train the diffusion model to generate blocklength values from noise, essentially replicating the process by which the optimization solution is derived. Extensive simulations reveal that the proposed approach surpasses existing DRL-based methods, achieving near-optimal performance in terms of total power consumption. Additionally, the proposed method reduces critical constraint violations by up to eighteen times, further highlighting the enhanced accuracy of the solution.},

A semantic communication (SemCom) technique is implemented at the UAV to extract scene graphs from captured images. The UAV then transmits the scene graphs (rather than the orignal images) to the BS. The small size of the scene graphs allows the UAV to transmit multiple images to the BS within a short duration. However, the scene graph extraction consumes computing resource, which may reduce the performance of the task offloading of the UEs. Therefore, we aim to optimize the UAV’s computing resource allocation and the fractions of the tasks offloaded from the UEs to achieve the min-max between i) the total latency of image collection, scene graph extraction, and scene graph communication, and ii) the computation offloading latency over the ground UEs.

  abstract     = {This letter explores an intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) enhanced wireless powered Internet of Things (WP-IoT) network, wherein massive IoT nodes are wirelessly charged by radio frequency signals and then transmit information by means of an IRS to promote the system performance. To evaluate the network performance, we aim at maximizing the total throughput while adhering to constraints pertaining to fairness-aware individual signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), the time allocations (TAs) as well as the unit-modulus IRS phase shifts. However, the intricate coupling of these variables renders the optimization problem nonconvex, thus posing a challenge for direct solution. To deal with this dilemma, we first resort to employing the Lagrange dual method and Karush-Kuhn–Tucker (KKT) conditions to transform the sum of logarithmic objective function into sum of fractional counterpart, and further derive the analytical solutions of TAs for downlink wireless energy transfer (WET) and uplink wireless information transfer (WIT). Then, the Riemannian manifold optimization (RMO) is utilized to iteratively derive the IRS phase shifts in term of semi-closed-form expression. Lastly, numerical simulations are conducted to examine the efficacy of the proposed algorithm in enhancing performance in comparison to the existing benchmark schemes.},

An alternating optimization framework aided by the minorization-maximization method is adopted to address this non-convex optimization problem.

The orthogonal time-frequency space (OTFS) technique has recently been proposed to deal with challenges in the delay-Doppler domain. Hence, for the first time, this letter introduces a novel emitter identification (EI) framework using radio-frequency (RF) fingerprints of HME/V using OTFS. A convolutional neural network (CNN) is exploited to extract the RF fingerprints from in-phase and quadrature-phase (IQ) components of the received OTFS-modulated signal to identify different emitters accurately. Further, we also analyze the impact of the same/different set of digitally modulated baseband signals such as binary phase shift keying (BPSK), on-off keying (OOK), 4-amplitude shift keying (4ASK), and 8-amplitude shift keying (8ASK) within the OTFS, employed by the emitters. Experimental results depict the efficacy of the proposed EI framework for HME/V even under low signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs).},
