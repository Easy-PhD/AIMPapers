  abstract     = {One of the primary catalysts fueling advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) is the availability of massive, curated datasets. A commonly used technique to curate such massive datasets is crowdsourcing, where data are dispatched to multiple annotators. The annotatorproduced labels are then fused to serve downstream learning and inference tasks. This annotation process often creates noisy labels due to various reasons, such as the limited expertise, or unreliability of annotators, among others. Therefore, a core objective in crowdsourcing is to develop methods that effectively mitigate the negative impact of such label noise on learning tasks. This feature article introduces advances in learning from noisy crowdsourced labels. The focus is on key crowdsourcing models and their methodological treatments, from classical statistical models to recent deep learningbased approaches, emphasizing analytical insights and algorithmic developments. In particular, this article reviews the connections between signal processing (SP) theory and methods, such as identifiability of tensor and nonnegative matrix factorization, and novel, principled solutions of longstanding challenges in crowdsourcing—showing how SP perspectives drive the advancements of this field. Furthermore, this article touches upon emerging topics that are critical for developing cutting-edge AI/ML systems, such as crowdsourcing in reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) and direct preference optimization (DPO) that are key techniques for fine-tuning large language models (LLMs).},

  abstract     = {The Kalman filter (KF) and its variants are among the most celebrated algorithms in signal processing. These methods are used for state estimation of dynamic systems by relying on mathematical representations in the form of simple state-space (SS) models, which may be crude and inaccurate descriptions of the underlying dynamics. Emerging data-centric artificial intelligence (AI) techniques tackle these tasks using deep neural networks (DNNs), which are model agnostic. Recent developments illustrate the possibility of fusing DNNs with classic Kalman-type filtering, obtaining systems that learn to track in partially known dynamics. This article provides a tutorial-style overview of design approaches for incorporating AI in aiding KF-type algorithms. We review both generic and dedicated DNN architectures suitable for state estimation and provide a systematic presentation of techniques for fusing AI tools with KFs and for leveraging partial SS modeling and data, categorizing design approaches into task oriented and SS model oriented. The usefulness of each approach in preserving the individual strengths of model-based KFs and data-driven DNNs is investigated in a qualitative and quantitative study (whose code is publicly available), illustrating the gains of hybrid model-based/data-driven designs. We also discuss existing challenges and future research directions that arise from fusing AI and Kalman-type algorithms.},

This article provides a comprehensive review of both the theory and applications of a recently developed FP technique known as the quadratic transform, which can be applied to a wide variety of FP problems, including both the minimization and the maximization of the sum of functions of ratios as well as matrix-ratio problems.},

While the specific designs and settings of ADCs can vary depending on the application, it is crucial in many modern applications to minimize the devices’ power consumption. The significance of low-power ADCs is particularly evident in fields like mobile and handheld devices reliant on battery operation. Key parameters that dictate ADCs’ power are the sampling rate, dynamic range (DR), and number of quantization bits. Typically, these parameters are required to be higher than a threshold value but can be reduced by using the structure of the signal and by leveraging preprocessing and the system application needs. In this article, we discuss four approaches relevant to a variety of applications.},

  abstract     = {Massive multiple-input, multiple-output (mMIMO) has emerged as a key enabler for 5G and beyond wireless communications, offering the potential to meet the ever-growing demands of an increasingly connected world. Unlike traditional MIMO systems that employ a limited number of antennas at the base stations (BSs), mMIMO utilizes a significantly larger number of antennas, often numbering in the hundreds or even thousands. This massive antenna deployment enables simultaneously serving many tens of users without any need for additional frequency resources. Overall, by leveraging spatial multiplexing and precoding/combining techniques in conjunction with efficient power allocation, mMIMO can mitigate interference, enhance signal quality, and hence, achieve remarkable gains in both spectral and energy efficiency. More specifically, the optimization of power allocation plays a crucial role in minimizing interference within mMIMO systems, offering two principal implementation avenues: instantaneous channel state information (CSI) and statistical CSI-based schemes. Instantaneous CSI-based power control schemes exhibit notable performance gains, particularly in scenarios characterized by significant variations in channel quality across individual subcarriers. These variations arise due to differing channel conditions, such as fading, that affect each subcarrier independently. By adapting power allocation based on instantaneous CSI, the system can more effectively optimize transmission parameters, improving overall system performance. The deployment of instantaneous CSI-based power control schemes necessitates computationally intensive signal processing operations, requiring substantial resources to handle real-time CSI updates and the associated overhead. Conversely, statistical CSI-based schemes enable efficient implementation of advanced power allocation algorithms within large-scale mMIMO systems, where the algorithms are updated much less frequently. Nevertheless, these schemes may deviate from optimal results in certain practical mMIMO configurations, necessitating the adoption of instantaneous CSI-based schemes. In addition, they may be limited in practical implementation where instantaneous CSI-based resource allocation and management schemes are widely adopted. This “Lecture Notes” article provides a comprehensive comparison between statistical CSI-based power allocation and instantaneous CSI-based power allocation designs for mMIMO systems from performance, complexity, and practical implementation aspects.},

  abstract     = {Statistical signal processing involves extracting information from random observations, a task that relies heavily on metrics that quantify the information present in the data. These metrics are crucial for practitioners and researchers in fields such as radar, sonar, and communications. Over time, several key information metrics have been introduced, often using different names. This tutorial describes essential information metrics—the Kullback–Leibler divergence (KLD), Fisher information (FI), and mutual information (MI)—exploring their relationships and demonstrating their relevance to estimation and detection problems. The article illustrates these concepts using the example of a constant-amplitude signal in white Gaussian noise (WGN) and discusses the asymptotic behavior of these metrics in more general scenarios. Additionally, it presents the minimum discrimination information (MDI) theorem, which states that the probability density function (PDF) minimizing the KLD under a mean constraint belongs to the linear exponential family. The tutorial concludes with an exploration of the conditionality principle, revealing the insightful relationship among the KLD, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and MI and its implications for improved detection in a multipath environment.},

  abstract     = {Terahertz (THz) band communications is envisioned as a key technology for future wireless standards. Advances in hardware design, channel models, and signal processing have all contributed significantly to advancing the field. Practical THz wireless has been demonstrated in high data-rate backhaul links. However, the next great leap for adopting THz-band frequencies in widespread communication systems must cover a massive canyon. Such communication systems must operate in the massive near field of the high-gain devices that are required to overcome the very high spreading losses of THz frequencies while providing all the promises of very high data rates and sensing resolution. Recent years have seen progress toward near-field THz, with investigations centered around the physical layer, combining both wave and communication theory to provide meaningful solutions to the challenges of THz signal propagation in the near field. In this article, an in-depth look is presented on the aspect of near-field THz. The aspect of signal propagation is first explained from a symbiosis of array and wave theory, following which it is conclusively shown how canonical beamforming is decimated in the near field. It is further explained why THz wireless must necessarily be near field, at least in some cases. Then, a vision of beamshaping is presented in which wavefront engineering is presented to address the design of new beams, specifically beamfocusing, Bessel beams, and Airy beams, which each offer distinct attractive advantages in creating THz links. Issues related to their generation and reception and issues involving narrowband limitations are presented. Finally, the article ends by discussing some of the more promising and upcoming applications of these beams as well as the exciting challenges and opportunities in this new and intriguing research area.},

  abstract     = {Integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) is a promising technology in solving the exacerbated spectrum congestion problem. Future developments of ISAC are expected to provide high-data-rate communications and high-resolution sensing, which demand a large frequency bandwidth and a large-scale (XL) antenna array. This has a two-fold consequence. The electromagnetic (EM) properties change from far-field uniform planar wave (UPW) to near-field uniform spherical wave (USW) propagation, and the waveform must now follow the wideband signal model in lieu of the commonly assumed narrow-band signal structure. The consideration of near-field wideband ISAC has recently prompted a reevaluation of the design techniques, including channel modeling and parameter estimation as well as precoding technologies. In this article, we review the principles of near-field wideband sensing and communications and describe the progress made in devising suitable precoding techniques. Various approaches to ISAC system design, including fully digital and hybrid analog‒digital precoders, are discussed along with their respective benefits and limitations. The efficacy of the design is judged by the achievable accuracy in target range and angular direction estimates, the power focusing, and the communication quality of service (QoS). We provide at the end a perspective on possible future research and trends in this area.},

  abstract     = {As sixth-generation (6G) wireless networks approach, leveraging the millimeter-wave (mmWave) and terahertz (THz) bands’ abundant spectrum becomes crucial, promising ultrahigh data rates and enabling immersive communication experiences. This transformation, characterized by the integration of ultramassive multi-in multi-out (UM-MIMO) systems, facilitates significant increases in throughput and capacity by utilizing densely packed antenna arrays. The resulting shift from traditional far-field communication, with its planar wavefronts, to near-field communication, where spherical wavefronts predominate, necessitates a reevaluation of conventional beamforming and channel estimation methods. Effective codebooks, based on the spherical wavefront phenomenon, are vital for both channel estimation and beam focusing, providing predefined sets of beam steering vectors or codewords needed to efficiently probe the channel and direct the beams toward desired directions. This article explores the development of polar-domain codebooks tailored for these near-field conditions. We reveal the exact boundaries of near-field communication, design polar codebooks based on our sparsity analysis findings, and demonstrate their efficacy in channel estimation and beam training without relying on user range information. These codebooks significantly reduce dimensionality, offering a practical solution to the challenges of minimal pilot overhead. Through two case studies, one on channel estimation and the other on beam training using the defined polar-domain codebooks, we illustrate the potential of these methodologies to enhance system performance and spectral efficiency in near-field wireless systems.},

This fact gives rise to unusual propagation phenomena, such as spherical wavefronts and beam focusing, creating the impression that new spatial dimensions—called degrees of freedom (DOF)—can be exploited in the near field. However, this is a fallacy because the theoretically maximum DOF are already achievable in the far field. This article sheds light on these issues by providing a tutorial on spatial frequencies, which are the fundamental components of wireless channels, and by explaining their role in characterizing the DOF in the near and far fields. In particular, we demonstrate how a single propagation path utilizes one spatial frequency in the far field and an interval of spatial frequencies in the near field. We explain how the array geometry determines the number of distinguishable spatial frequency bins and, thereby, the spatial DOF. We also describe how to model near-field multipath channels and their spatial correlation matrices. Finally, we discuss the research challenges and future directions in this field.},

Recent investigations have focused on these aspects in the context of extremely large arrays and wide bandwidths, giving rise to novel challenges in channel estimation, beamforming, beam training, sensing, and localization. While NF optics has a longstanding history, advancements in NF phase retrieval (PR) techniques and their applications have lately garnered significant research attention.
