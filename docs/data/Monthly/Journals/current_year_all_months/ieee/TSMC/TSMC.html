The primary challenge concerns how to construct time-varying functions to counteract the effects of unmeasurable error coming from system output as well as the persistently increasing nonlinearities. By employing a full-order state observer and the dual gain approach, we design an output feedback regulator over the entire time domain to guarantee the existence and uniqueness of the closed-loop system’s solution and the almost sure asymptotic convergence of the state. This methodology achieves both the domination of the unknown growth rate and the unified system design, irrespective of sensor sensitivity. Finally, practical and numerical simulation examples demonstrate the feasibility of the presented approach.},

Existing methods for handling partially unknown TPs often introduce excessive conservatism using scaling techniques that may violate the fundamental stochastic constraints. To address this issue, we propose a novel polynomial-based gain-scheduling control framework that integrates a polytopic probability reconstruction strategy. This strategy rigorously preserves the stochastic completeness of TP matrices (TPMs) while reducing conservatism in controller design. By leveraging homogeneous polynomial theory, we further establish a codesign methodology for both polynomial Lyapunov functions and fuzzy controllers, significantly expanding the feasible solution space. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that the proposed method achieves substantially reduced conservatism compared with conventional aggregated approximation approaches. Numerical simulations reveal the improvement compared with classical aggregated treatment approaches. Hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) experiments on active suspension systems validate the effectiveness and robustness of the designed control strategy, especially $\gamma _{\mathrm { min}}$ achieved a reduction optimization of 87.5%.},

However, numerous complex constraints and a dynamic environment make reasonable scheduling very difficult. To this end, this article studies the dynamic human–machine hybrid reconfiguration manufacturing scheduling problem (DHMRSP) and proposes a novel deep reinforcement learning (DRL) scheduling method. Specifically, a dual-agent Markov decision process (MDP) is established, which can handle seven complex constraints and three disturbance events. Then, a heterogeneous competition graph attention network (HCGAN) is designed, where the meta-path-based subgraph conversion reflects the resource-operation competition, and three modules use node-level attention and semantic-level attention to realize important information embedding. Afterward, a dual proximal policy optimization (PPO) algorithm with HCGAN and mixed action space (HM-DPPO) is proposed, where the allocation agent and reconfiguration agent achieve collaborative learning by taking joint action and sharing graph embeddings and reward. Experimental results prove that the proposed approach outperforms rules, genetic programming (GP), and three DRL methods on different instances and can effectively handle various disturbance events.},

Existing models, including the classical zeroing neural dynamics (ZNDs) model and its variants, have been used to address the TDLME problem. However, those models require time-dependent matrix inversion, which is computationally demanding, and they primarily focus on measurement-related noise, overlooking other sources of system uncertainty. To overcome these challenges, we propose an inverse-free reciprocal-type ZND (RTZND) model. This model integrates an energy-based error function with the ZND framework, eliminating the need for matrix inversion and incorporating error-feedback-related noise through its closed-loop control structure. We establish the convergence and robustness of the RTZND model using Lyapunov stability theory and assess its performance under external disturbances. Numerical simulations confirm its effectiveness and improved computational efficiency in solving the TDLME problem. We further confirm its applicability through two case studies, a time-dependent linear system and a nonlinear system modeled by the single machine infinite bus (SMIB) system, highlighting the RTZND model’s practical value in addressing TDLME problems.},

To improve manipulation performance under multiple constraints, this article presents a novel constrained sampling-based MPC (CSMPC) method using path integral. First, hierarchical optimization combining policy sampling projection and the Lagrange multiplier method is used to handle equality hard constraints for high-precision manipulation tasks. Second, collision avoidance and smooth motion are modeled as inequality soft constraints, where collision detection and time series prediction are used to ensure the safety and smoothness of dynamic interaction. Finally, an adaptive noise method is built to improve the stability of physical robot manipulation. The simulation and experiment results demonstrate that the proposed method enables a 7-DOF robot manipulator to achieve precise manipulation while avoiding dynamic obstacles.},

Considering both operational efficiency and motion smoothness, we propose a motion control method for excavator manipulators based on time-energy-jerk integrated optimal trajectory planning. The nondominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II) algorithm is used to optimize interpolated trajectory based on five-time B-splines in the joint space. To ensure that excavators can accurately execute the planned optimal trajectory, the corresponding arms must be controlled with high precision. The oil inlet flow and the oil return pressure controllers are designed based on the independent metering hydraulic system. The flow controller is designed based on time-logarithmic barrier Lyapunov function to determine the virtual control rate and uses the Levant filter for filtering. The corresponding error transformations are employed to avoid the problem of the explosion of complexity in the traditional backstepping controller designs while ensuring that transient behavior of system tracking errors remains within specified boundaries. The uncertain components and nonlinear functions in the manipulator system are approximated by neural network (NN). Additionally, the pressure controller is used to keep the oil return pressure low to reduce system’s energy consumption. Finally, comparative simulations are conducted to verify the superiority of the proposed controller.},

  abstract     = {The capability for robotic systems to rearrange objects based on human instructions represents a critical step toward realizing embodied intelligence. Recently, diffusion-based learning has shown significant advancements in the field of data generation while prompt-based learning has proven effective in formulating robot manipulation strategies. However, prior solutions for robotic rearrangement have overlooked the significance of integrating human preferences and optimizing for rearrangement efficiency. Additionally, traditional prompt-based approaches struggle with complex, semantically meaningful rearrangement tasks without predefined target states for objects. To address these challenges, our work first introduces a comprehensive two dimensional (2-D) tabletop rearrangement dataset, utilizing a physical simulator to capture interobject relationships and semantic configurations. Then, we present DreamArrangement, a novel language-conditioned object rearrangement scheme, consisting of two primary processes: employing a transformer-based multimodal denoising diffusion model to envisage the desired arrangement of objects, and leveraging a vision–language foundational model to derive actionable policies from text, alongside initial and target visual information. In particular, we introduce an efficiency-oriented learning strategy to minimize the average motion distance of objects. Given few-shot instruction examples, the learned policy from our synthetic dataset can be transferred to the real world without extra human intervention. Extensive simulations validate DreamArrangement’s superior rearrangement quality and efficiency. Moreover, real-world robotic experiments confirm that our method can adeptly execute a range of challenging, language-conditioned, and long-horizon tasks with a singular model.

  abstract     = {In dynamic time-linkage optimization, current decisions influence the future state of environments. To make good decisions that have a positive impact on future states, existing methods usually build a model to predict the future rewards of solutions for decision making. However, these prediction models present low accuracy since decision data are not enough to train such a complex model. To address this issue, this article proposes a contrastive-learning-based decision making (CLDM) method, which builds a contrastive model to learn the relationship between solutions but not absolute rewards and adopts a quick decision strategy to select solutions. In CLDM, a clustering-based time-linkage detection (CD) strategy is developed to measure the intensity of the time linkage, which determines whether to make decisions based on future rewards. To represent the relative relationship between solutions, a large number of contrastive samples are constructed using the limited historical decisions. A contrastive model is trained for solution comparison in terms of the combination of current fitness and future rewards. Candidate solutions are clustered into multiple groups to filter poor ones, and a few solutions are preserved to rank using the contrastive model. The winner is taken as the decision solution. Integrating CLDM into particle swarm optimization (PSO), a new algorithm named contrastive-learning-based PSO (CL-PSO) is put forward. Experimental results on multiple dynamic time-linkage optimization instances demonstrate that CL-PSO outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of solution quality. CL-PSO can also well solve the mobile robot path planning problem.},

In this study, a controller is designed to ensure system stability initially, while also achieving a closed-loop system for easy tracking error analysis. By deriving the expression of tracking error, a broad range of nonovershooting tracking conditions is identified through analytical analysis.

Because of numerous features at different scales in hybrid networks, how to fuse these multiscale features and promote their complementarity is crucial for enhancing FSR. However, existing hybrid network-based FSR methods ignore this, only simply combining the Transformer and CNN. To address this issue, we propose an attention-guided multiscale interaction network (AMINet), which incorporates local and global feature interactions, as well as encoder–decoder phase feature interactions. Specifically, we propose a local and global feature interaction (LGFI) module to promote the fusion of global features and the local features extracted from different receptive fields by our residual depth feature extraction (RDFE) module. Additionally, we propose a selective kernel attention fusion (SKAF) module to adaptively select fusions of different features within the LGFI and encoder–decoder phases. Our above design allows the free flow of multiscale features from within modules and between the encoder and decoder, which can promote the complementarity of different scale features to enhance FSR. Comprehensive experiments confirm that our method consistently performs well with less computational consumption and faster inference.},

A resilient event-triggered mechanism (ETM) is proposed to reduce the communication burden while effectively countering these cyberattacks. The membership functions are assumed to be mismatched due to the impact of the network environment and sampling behavior. Furthermore, the system dynamics are modeled using Itô-type stochastic differential equations, which include deterministic fuzzy complex networks (CNs) as a special case. Unlike previous studies on stochastic systems, the auxiliary vector function method is employed to introduce more time-varying delay information into the piecewise Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional (LKF), thus reducing conservatism. Consequently, a series of delay-dependent sufficient conditions is derived to ensure the exponentially mean-square stability (EMSS) and strict dissipativity of the filtering error system.

  abstract     = {A robust adaptive control problem of fully actuated systems (FASs) with perturbed input matrices, unknown time-varying parameters, and partial knowledge of uncertainty bounds is considered. Unlike the existing results on FASs with perturbed input matrices, the restriction that the bound of the nonlinear uncertainty must be known is removed and a certain unknown constant is now allowed to be included in the bound. A novel robust adaptive controller is developed, where the adaptive term adapts to the effects of the time-varying unknown parameters in the FAS and the unknown constant in the uncertainty bound, and the robust term overcomes the influence of the remaining uncertain part caused by the perturbed input matrix. The designed controller enables the states of the closed-loop system and the estimation errors to be globally bounded. Finally, the developed method is successfully applied to the control of both a numerical example and an electromechanical system, and the effectiveness is proven by the comparative simulation results with the existing methods.},

Existing research on the DDP of Boolean networks (BNs) has predominantly concentrated on deterministic BNs (DBNs), which inadequately model the complexities of real-world systems, particularly those exhibiting stochastic behavior and uncertainty. We introduce two definitions tailored to PBNs: disturbance decoupling in distribution and disturbance decoupling with probability one. Utilizing an algebraic representation framework, we derive algebraic conditions for both types of disturbance decoupling. Additionally, we employ a vertex partitioning approach to establish graphical conditions pertinent to these disturbance decoupling types. Our investigation further reveals the connections between DBNs and PBNs concerning disturbance decoupling. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our theoretical results, we present three examples.},

  abstract     = {Visible–infrared person re-identification (VI-ReID) focuses on accurately matching individuals across different imaging modalities. Existing studies focus on generating modality-consistent images at the pixel level through the use of generative adversarial networks (GANs) to mitigate the impact of modality discrepancies. However, these methods face significant challenges in overcoming the limitation that synthesized samples from different modalities may suffer from semantic distortion. In this work, we propose an online one-stage style fuzzy normalization (SFN) method to generate modality-fuzzy features in the latent space while regularizing the model’s predictions. Specifically, SFN adaptively mixes the feature statistics of two random modality instances of the same identity in a single forward pass during training. In this process, to enhance the richness of modality interaction information, we design a novel causality balance loss, which enforces the generated fuzzy features to be independent of their initial modality while simultaneously encouraging them to align more closely with the other modality. Furthermore, we introduce an identity-aware consistency loss to regularize the predictions between the original and SFN-generated features to ensure semantic consistency. In contrast to prior work, SFN is a plug-and-play module that does not rely on any generative-based models, making it highly adaptable to various network architectures. Extensive experiments were performed on three public cross-modality datasets to ensure fair and reliable comparisons. The empirical results demonstrate the clear superiority of our method over previous state-of-the-art methods.},

In the weight allocation phase, individual weights are evaluated using network structure and the PageRank algorithm. For relationship propagation, indirect trust relationships are computed via a weighted average method, leading to a more precise social network model. In the evolution analysis, an improved Hegselmann–Krause (HK) model demonstrates evolutionary stability. Two types of conformity behavior are simulated: active conformity behavior within clusters and passive conformity behavior via opinion leaders across clusters. Experimental studies on public health policy validate the effectiveness of the proposed model. The results show that this model more accurately captures the complex behavioral patterns of individuals in large-scale social networks and exhibits strong evolutionary stability.},

  abstract     = {Network reconstruction, which involves inferring a network’s topology from observational data, is a critical challenge in network science. Because observational data are often limited, prior knowledge is often employed to enhance the accuracy of network reconstruction, including constraints related to sparsity, symmetry, or network dynamics. In many cases, we may possess prior knowledge regarding the number of types of edges within networks, yet the specific solutions of these types of edges remain unknown. For instance, while it is evident that two types of edges (i.e., positive and negative) exist in signed networks, the possible solution for each edge type is frequently unclear, rendering existing methods, such as the signal Lasso approach, ineffective. In this work, to effectively leverage this readily available prior knowledge, we propose a novel network reconstruction framework based on the Gaussian mixture model (GMM), which integrates Bayesian models and employs the GMM to model the distribution of unknown edges as prior probabilities. The method is effective for both unsigned and signed networks and achieves high accuracy even with limited prior information, without requiring specific solutions for each edge type, particularly in cases of network sparsity or noisy data.},

The proposed approach integrates boundary functions with a constraint-handling mechanism, enabling guaranteed tracking performance within a fixed time horizon while satisfying output constraints. Unlike existing approaches, the controller does not rely on accurate system models, parameter estimation, or external observers, and avoids the computation of virtual control derivatives, resulting in reduced computational complexity. Moreover, the control scheme maintains robustness against time-varying actuator faults and environmental disturbances without auxiliary adaptation or learning mechanisms. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness and superior performance of the proposed approach compared with existing methods, validating its capability to maintain tracking accuracy and closed-loop stability under adverse operating conditions.},

First, a compensation reward based on the historical similarity between the RL agent and human guidance history is designed to ensure the continued influence of human guidance. To avoid cumulative errors in value function approximation caused by fitting the new reward, including the compensation reward, a novel RL paradigm is proposed, which bypasses value function fitting and directly optimizes the policy using historical similarity. This paradigm develops a new historical similarity-based learning objective for RL to leverage human guidance more efficiently and achieve alignment with human behavior. Furthermore, the proposed paradigm enables the fine-tuning of the RL agent to address the long-tail problem. Experimental results demonstrate the advantages of the proposed method in terms of sustainable guidance and optimal performance in the autonomous driving, achieving a 15% increase in optimal performance compared with existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.},

  abstract     = {In group decision-making (GDM), the opinions of decision-makers (DMs) are prone to having controversies and conflicts. Identifying individual personality traits can better predict the individual adjustment behavior of DMs in GDM and, therefore, construct the corresponding feedback strategies to guide opinion interaction and consensus building. To do that, large language models (LLMs) are utilized to analyze the individual Big Five personality traits revealed by online text information. Then, a conflict quadrant diagram (CQD) is developed to explore the conflict resolution behaviors manifested by DMs as influenced by their personality traits. Subsequently, a series of interaction rules corresponding to diverse conflict behaviors within the CQD are constructed, and then a personality traits-driven feedback model is proposed to generate personalized recommendation advice for group consensus interaction, with the overarching aim of effectively enhancing the level of group consensus. Finally, a simulation experiment on LLM-based agents is conducted to verify the opinion convergence process, and some sensitivity and comparative analyses are also provided. Overall, this article contributes to the innovative application of LLMs in solving GDM problems by prompt engineering to generate outputs and validate models and carries out in-depth explorations on integrating individual personality traits into the group consensus-building process.},

  abstract     = {In general, the motion control problem of redundant robot manipulators (RRMs) can be transformed into a constrained time-varying quadratic programming (TVQP) problem. Recently, various recurrent neural networks (RNNs) with predefined time convergence (PTC) abilities have been proposed to solve this constrained TVQP problem in real-time. However, there is still a lack of a unified paradigm to guide researchers and engineers design such RNNs more effectively based on specific requirements. To bridge this gap, we propose a unified paradigm derived from a novel segmentation evolution formula incorporating a special $\mathfrak {B}$ –Class function. This paradigm enables the construction of various RNNs, collectively referred to as unified arbitrarily predefined-time convergent RNNs (U-APTC-RNNs). Compared with most existing RNNs, the constructed U-APTC-RNN has two significant advantages: 1) it has the arbitrarily PTC (APTC) ability, meaning its actual convergence time can be arbitrarily and precisely predefined without setting other model parameters and 2) using a novel piecewise computation strategy, redundant nonlinear calculations are effectively minimized, leading to a notable reduction in computational costs. The stability and APTC ability of the constructed U-APTC-RNN are demonstrated through detailed theoretical analysis. Numerical simulation experiments confirm the APTC capabilities of various U-APTC-RNNs constructed using the proposed unified paradigm. Comparative experiments show that U-APTC-RNN has more competitive convergence performance and lower computational cost than other state-of-the-art RNNs with PTC abilities. Finally, simulation and physical motion control experiments on the Jaco and UR5 robotic arms demonstrate the superiority and practicality of the proposed U-APTC-RNN.},

First, we formulate a new distributed optimization model, called finite-time DAOC (FT-DAOC), where each cost function contains an extra aggregative variable. Then, a class of new finite-time distributed algorithms is designed for MVSs with time-varying cost functions under time-varying digraphs. Moreover, as vehicles may work in settings with time-varying unknown control gains and unknown disturbances, we extend the newly presented distributed algorithms to solve finite-time aggregative optimal consensus issues for MVSs with multiple time-varying constraints. Finally, the validity of the newly illustrated algorithms is analyzed theoretically, and two simulation examples are provided.},

Building on a stochastic physical dynamics model, the proposed approach distinguishes itself by employing a moving target defense (MTD) strategy to enable proactive protection, which is an aspect rarely addressed in existing related works. The system model is formulated as a family of controllable submodels based on controllability. These controllable submodels are regarded as moving targets. A residual-based attack detector is introduced to justify whether an attack occurs or not. When an alarm is triggered, the current running controllable submodel is switched to another controllable one. Furthermore, an MTD-based security controller is devised to proactively mitigate actuator attacks. Sufficient conditions for the design of security control gains are formulated, using which the CPSs can preserve the mean-square exponential stability with the desired disturbance rejection level. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy is demonstrated through a comparative simulation based on a practical physical system.},

  abstract     = {Cryptocurrency services, as one of the most successful applications of blockchain technology, have recently garnered significant attention from the graph learning community. Its large-scale dynamic transaction records contain a variety of behavioral patterns and rich knowledge involving accounts, making the dynamic cryptocurrency transaction network embedding (DCTNE) a hot, yet thorny research topic. As the trading accounts increase and time accumulates, considerable transaction services are dispersed into various time slots, leading to very sparse transaction data within a time slot, that is, the transaction service data is high-dimensional and incomplete (HDI). To efficiently mine high-value knowledge from HDI data, this article proposes a proximal-ADMM-incorporated nonnegative latent-factorization-of-tensors (PNL) model for DCTNE that adopts threefold ideas: 1) incorporating the proximal terms into the alternating-direction-method-of-multipliers (ADMMs)-based learning scheme to reduce the oscillations for high estimation accuracy and fast convergence; 2) implementing a parallel training process with hyperparameter self-adaptation for high computational efficiency; and 3) proving that the proximal-incorporated learning scheme guarantees the convergence to a Karush–Kuhn–Tucker (KKT) stationary point. Experimental results on eight real-world DCTNs show that the PNL significantly outperforms several state-of-the-art (SOTA) models, demonstrating not only high efficiency and accuracy in performing DCTNE, but also strong potential to enhance the operational reliability and stability of cryptocurrency transaction systems.},

However, it is tough to identify the attacks with unknown statistical models by a traditional detection scheme. This article is concerned with the resilient set-membership estimation for 2-D systems over sensor networks subject to cyberattacks and unknown-but-bounded noises. First, using the dynamic watermarking (DW) technique, a novel attack detection method is proposed to guarantee the security of information transmission among sensors. Compared to existing results on attack detection, the developed mechanism is capable of adapting to the ellipsoid-dependent set-membership estimation framework that incorporates the set ideas. Second, a group of scalable resilient set-membership estimators are derived for large-scale sensor networks. Each sensor has access to an ellipsoidal estimation set containing the true state of the system, in which the proposed design procedure is independent of global information about the network topology. Third, a set of parameter optimization algorithms is introduced in a recursive manner, which allows the sensor network to obtain a satisfactory estimation performance utilizing the designed estimation gain and detection mechanism. Lastly, a simulation example is shown to evaluate the availability and superiority of the proposed technique.},

  abstract     = {Traffic signal timing optimization (TSTO) is a significant problem in smart cities. Evolutionary computation (EC) algorithms have been widely studied to solve the TSTO problem. However, as existing EC-based algorithms usually use iterative-based evolution and simulation-based evaluation to optimize the timing plan for certain traffic situations, they still suffer from two difficulties, which are the time-consuming optimization process in certain traffic situations and the weak adaptation ability to unseen traffic situations. Therefore, this article proposes a novel learning for adaptation (LA) framework for real-time TSTO by changing the optimization process from evolution to adaptation. The LA learns a map model from the traffic volume input to the traffic signal timing. Then, the learned map model is expected to adapt to unseen traffic situations faster and better. The LA framework includes a data collection stage and a model learning (ML) stage. First, in the data collection stage, a multisource transfer-based particle swarm optimization (MTPSO) algorithm is proposed to avoid the under-optimizing issue. Second, in the ML stage, a multilevel smoothness regularization (MSR) method is proposed to deal with the over-fitting issue. The proposed LA framework with MTPSO and MSR is named as LMM method. This way, the TSTO process is changed from time-consuming evolution to time-efficient adaptation, which is significant in practical real-time applications. Comprehensive experiments with ten different synthetic and real-world road networks under different traffic volume distributions are carried out. The results show that the LMM method adapts better to unseen traffic volume inputs and can achieve real-time TSTO.},

This capability allows quadrupedal robots to select suitable foothold locations and adjust their gait for optimal performance. We address the problem of gait adaptation using trajectory optimization (TO), which takes into account the simplified switched system’s dynamics and optimizes the different phases of motion in which we split the robot’s movement. The robot dynamic model is a single rigid body (SRB) with a rigid contact model and foot positions. We apply contact and friction cone constraints to ensure a physically feasible motion of the real robot. We tackle the optimization using the direct multiple shooting (DMS) method. Leveraging kinematic inversion to map the base and feet positions into joint positions, velocities, and accelerations, we design a controller that combines iterative learning control (ILC) and proportional derivative (PD) feedback control. The iterative controller compensates for the sim-to-real gap, allowing the real robot to learn the task during the execution of the latter. We evaluate the performance of the proposed approach on two different quadrupedal robots and on different terrains.},

However, to our best knowledge, timetable robustness, as another critical factor in TTR, is often ignored in existing work. To fill this gap, this study proposes a learning-based method for rapidly restoring train delays with robustness guarantees. Compared with the existing work, our approach offers several benefits. First, we design a network architecture for learning-based methods when solving the robust TTR problem. The dual-headed network can deal with the reordering and re-timing operation simultaneously in the TTR problem. Second, we reformulate the robust TTR problem into a constrained Markov decision process (CMDP), and a Lagrange-based proximal policy optimization (LPPO) algorithm is employed to train the designed network. Through testing on real-scale problems, the learned model can not only provide the rescheduled timetable within seconds but also strike a fine balance between operation efficiency and the scheme’s robustness.},

As the number of participants continues to grow, the likelihood of undesirable outcomes increases, posing a great requirement for effective community detection algorithms. To provide platform owners with actionable and timely management strategies, this article proposes a multimodule-based dynamic community detection (MDCD) algorithm to facilitate the achievement of efficient, high-quality, and sustainable innovation. The MDCD algorithm uses a multimodule task learning framework containing four different modules, including heterogeneous temporal aggregation (HTA), representation reconstruction (RR), link prediction (LP), and node clustering (NC) modules, to gradually detect the community structure accurately. First, the HTA module obtains the initial node representation by capturing both spatial heterogeneity and temporal dependencies. Second, the RR module considers reconstructed topology and node attribute information to update the node representation via an encoder–decoder collaboration mechanism. Third, the LP module further optimizes the node representation by exploiting the predicted graph links, which helps increase the accuracy of community detection. Finally, the NC module leverages two metric learning methods to optimize a learnable clustering process based on the predicted node presentations, which helps platform owners achieve comprehensive results across multiple dimensions of innovation performance. The experimental results from real-world crowdsourcing platforms indicate that MDCD shows effectiveness in simultaneously improving the multidimensional innovation performance of crowdsourcing platforms and increasing solver engagement.},

  abstract     = {This article examines a neuroadaptive consensus control issue for heterogeneous port uncrewed container transporter (HPUCT) platoon with model uncertainties and actuator saturation. First, a novel robust finite-time estimator, which combines approximation with sliding mode technique, is introduced to approximate the complex nonlinear dynamics and observe external disturbances in HPUCT. The innovative design of the terminal sliding mode surface contributes to achieving stability in state measurement errors within a finite time. Subsequently, utilizing Lyapunov functions, a robust adaptive sliding mode controller is formulated for the consensus control of vehicles, which can ensure internal stability and string stability for the entire vehicle platoon. Additionally, to tackle the issues of saturation, the control strategy is modified by designing an auxiliary system. Finally, comparative simulations confirm the effectiveness of our designed estimator-based robust neuroadaptive consensus controller.},

  abstract     = {In power systems, taking economic actions in accordance with the N-k criterion despite the failure of the components is becoming important in today’s smart grid. In this context, developing strategies against load shedding during unexpected events plays a critical role in ensuring energy sustainability. In this article, a loop-in-loop model that includes a rolling horizon-based distributed coordination is established among the transmission system operator (TSO), distribution system operator (DSO), and an industrial parking region operator (IPRO) connected to the transmission network (TN) to address unexpected TN contingencies. The model minimizes the total operational costs for each operator while also minimizing load shedding in the distribution network during contingency situations by leveraging the dc fast discharge capacity of heavy-duty electric trucks (HDETs) with a high-capacity battery located in the industrial parking region. In addition, a contingency system operator (CSO) is introduced to manage contingency and optimally reward the discharge of HDETs through a pricing mechanism. Consequently, in the rolling horizon-based real-time contingency management, the proposed approach reduces the economic losses for the TSO and the amount of shedding load for the DSO compared with uncoordinated operations. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed strategy achieves up to 33.18% reduction in load shedding and 28.18% cost savings compared with the baseline scheme, confirming its effectiveness under contingency scenarios.},

It solves problems of strong coupling, communication redundancy, and collision avoidance in large-scale networks and enables many followers to implement new interactive behaviors in multiple convex hulls formed by leaders. First, for a constructed four-layer topology with group directed spanning tree, hierarchical bipartite time-varying FCC protocols with a collision avoidance term are designed to achieve collision-free bipartite group tracking control in a multiconvex hull. Then, appropriate control parameters are designed in protocols to promote effective information transmission between layers and groups. Compared with existing FCC strategies, hierarchical bipartite time-varying FCC strategies improve the control performance of MASs. Finally, the effectiveness of all protocols is proved through Lyapunov’s theorem and linear matrix inequality. The feasibility of protocols was verified through simulations.},

The model-reference (MR) control problem is defined to achieve the desired closed-loop specifications, including the iso-damping, and the reference model is designed on the basis of fractional-order calculus. The optimization problem for the MR control is formulated using the one-shot input/output data while considering the bounded-input–bounded-output (BIBO) stability from a bounded reference input to a bounded output. The iso-damping robust controller is obtained by solving the optimization problem. The representative advantages of the proposed approach over the conventional methods are the simplicity, practicality, and reliability from the viewpoint of the unnecessity of the plant model and explicit consideration of the BIBO stability from a bounded reference input to a bounded output.

  abstract     = {This article provides a solution to time-varying formation (TVF) tracking control problems of nonholonomic mobile robots (NMRs) with asymmetric input constraints. Different from existing works, the configuration of the formation for NMRs is time-varying, which requires formation tracking errors to keep convergent even if the configuration of the desired formation changes over time. A novel sliding mode controller is proposed to handle this problem, and the closed-loop stabilities of NMRs under given control protocols are proven by Lyapunov theory. As special cases of TVF, the above control methods can be directly applied to flexible formation and fixed formation studied in existing works. It should be pointed out that if the desired formation is fixed, the angular velocity of the tracking target is not necessary when designing the corresponding control algorithm. In addition, there is no singularity in the methods provided in this article. By collaborative selection of parameters in these control protocols, the adjustment ranges of linear and angular velocities associated with the leader or virtual leader are almost the same as that of followers. Numerical simulations and hardware-in-the-loop (HiL) simulations further verify the theoretical results.},

A Bayesian method constructs posterior belief by selecting likely phase transition candidates heuristically and combining biomechanical signal knowledge with pattern recognition techniques. The approach is validated and benchmarked against prevailing deep learning (DL) methods using two datasets, each containing data from two inertial measurement units (IMUs) attached to the midshanks of test subjects. The first dataset includes six participants, while the second dataset includes ten, all walking at their comfortable speeds. Additionally, the method is validated in real time for nine test subjects walking at varying speeds (2.2–3.5 mph).

  abstract     = {Medium-scale expensive multiobjective optimization problems (EMOPs) present a significant challenge to most existing surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithms (SAEAs). Because the algorithms must balance convergence and diversity with a limited number of fitness evaluations (FEs), while managing the uncertainty in surrogate predictions within the medium-scale decision space. Therefore, this work proposes a surrogate-assisted multiobjective evolutionary algorithm based on two-level model management (SAMOEA-TL2M) to effectively address medium-scale EMOPs. In SAMOEA-TL2M, infill solutions are selected using the proposed two-level model management strategy. In the first level, the estimated non-dominated solutions with good shift-based density estimation (SDE) values are selected for the balance of convergence and diversity. In the second level, the estimated non-dominated solutions and high uncertainty solutions are considered. To quantify uncertainty, an inverse distance weighting (IDW) is introduced. Moreover, an accuracy rate indicator (ARI) is proposed for the optimization state assessment, providing guidance for adaptively executing the two model management levels. Extensive experiments on three widely used instances and time-varying ratio error estimation (TREE) problems with up to 120 dimensions demonstrate the superiority of SAMOEA-TL2M over five state-of-the-art SAEAs in solving medium-scale EMOPs.},

  abstract     = {Effective communication is pivotal for successful team collaboration in cooperative multiagent tasks. However, mainly due to the partially observable nature of the environment, indiscriminate message requests among teammates may lead to confusion for individual agents, impeding effective collaboration and diminishing the overall efficiency of the system. Most previous work has employed gates or attention mechanisms to extract relatively important messages. However, these methods often fail to explicitly assess each message’s value, or the process of calculating is intricate and convoluted. This may result in ineffective communication and cause miscoordination in complex scenarios. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel metric named counterfactual message value (CMV), which quantifies each message’s contribution to an agent, enabling the effective elimination of redundant messages. In addition, we present a practical multiagent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithm, termed CMV communication (CMVC), which could effectively facilitate the learning of agent–agent communication protocols. It predicts the CMVs of teammates for an agent solely based on its local observation, enabling the agent to initiate communication with those exhibiting positive CMVs. To differentiate message impact levels, we design a message aggregator in CMVC that aggregates messages based on their individual CMVs. We evaluate CMVC in various tasks, including cooperative navigation, predator–prey, and the StarCraft multiagent challenge (SMAC). The results indicate that CMVC is prominent in reducing redundant messages and has the ability to learn more advanced collaboration strategies, in contrast to several existing state-of-the-art methods.},

Second, a solving flow is proposed based on the iteration-correction strategy for configuration prediction or force sensing. This strategy provides a new idea for the analysis of the static friction direction when the statics model is used for quasi-static prediction. Simulations and experiments show that the proposed segment-progress statics method is effective for configuration prediction or force sensing of concentric cable-driven manipulators. Moreover, the effect of the friction gain on the accuracy of statics model is found by analyzing the curvature of the manipulator. The piecewise constant curvature (PCC) assumption is also concluded to be only applicable to small end forces but not to large end forces for concentric cable-driven manipulators.},

Existing approaches, including multiagent reinforcement learning (MARL) and native SbPG, struggle with scalability, coordination inefficiencies, and the complexity of tuning combined objective functions in real-world settings. DS2-SbPG integrates potential games and Stackelberg games, which improves the cooperative tradeoff capabilities of potential games and the multiobjective optimization handling by Stackelberg games. Notably, all training procedures are conducted in a fully distributed manner. DS2-SbPG offers a promising solution to finding optimal tradeoffs between objectives by eliminating the complexities of setting up combined objective optimization functions for individual players in self-learning domains, particularly in real-world industrial settings with diverse and numerous objectives between the subsystems. We formally prove that DS2-SbPG constitutes a dynamic potential game with guaranteed convergence. Experimental validation on a laboratory-scale testbed demonstrates the effectiveness of DS2-SbPG and its two variants: one with a single-leader–follower structure and another (Stack DS2-SbPG) for multileader–follower scenarios. Both variants significantly outperform native SbPG, achieving up to 10.61% reduction in power consumption while enhancing overall system performance, which signals the potential of DS2-SbPG in real-world applications.},

  abstract     = {This article is concerned with the sampled-data-based robust safety control (SDRSC) problem for switched systems. A novel sampled-data-based single barrier function (SDSBF) method is proposed to ensure the safety of switched systems with unknown disturbances under zero-order-hold (ZOH) controllers. The SDSBF method permits subsystems to lack safety over the whole safe set, which relaxes the traditional requirement that all subsystems are safe. Also, the influence on safety of switched systems caused by the difference of sampling instant and switching instant is analyzed, and a switching signal with dwell time is introduced to quantify and estimate this influence. Furthermore, both safety and stability of switched systems under ZOH controllers are obtained by the union of SDSBF and single Lyapunov function (SLF), without requiring the safety and stability for subsystems. To find SDSBF and SLF, an executable condition, including a switching law with dwell time, is established based on convex combination techniques, avoiding the Zeno phenomenon. Finally, an application on vehicle driving is provided to verify the proposed methods.},

  abstract     = {Compared to traditional manufacturing, there are several unique characteristics in cloud manufacturing (CMfg): more candidate suppliers, more material types, more supply modes, and broader geographically distributed suppliers. These characteristics lead to a huge set of candidate supply plans with several uncertainties in logistics. It is a great challenge to effectively and efficiently select appropriate suppliers for each type of material. In this article, we consider a supplier selection and material sourcing problem with multiuncertainties in logistics to minimize the total cost of a CMfg manufacturing enterprise. The delivery time is stochastic along with the consideration of stochastic disruption and loss in logistics. Based on state-and-transition modeling, a stochastic dynamic programming model is developed for the problem under study. By integrating proximal policy optimization (PPO) with recurrent neural network (RNN) and expectation model (EM), a stochastic optimization method PPO-REM is proposed to minimize the cost by effectively selecting suppliers and intelligently making make-or-buy decisions under uncertainties. The proposed method is evaluated by comparing to other reinforcement learning (RL) methods and existing methods for similar problems over a comprehensive set of numerical experiments with some real-world data. Experimental results show that the proposed PPO-REM converges faster with a higher reward than other RL methods, and it costs the least as compared to existing methods for similar problems.},

The distributed FTSC combines a dc voltage controller and a power sharing controller. The main objective is to restore the average dc voltage of the converters to dc voltage reference of MTDCTS within a fixed time. Additionally, it also enables power sharing among the converters based on their individual capacities. Compared to conventional distributed consensus control (DCC), fixed-time control (FTC) presented in this article exhibits a shorter convergence time and is unaffected by the initial state of MTDCTS. In this article, each converter communicates exclusively with its adjacent converters via a communication network that may undergo changes over time, which helps alleviate the strain on the communication network. To test the FTSC, a five-terminal MTDCTS with two wind farm converters (WFCs) is created in power systems computer aided design (PSCAD)/electromagnetic transients including DC (EMTDC).},

Building on the SEAF, we propose two advanced zeroing neurodynamics (ZN) models: the finite and fixed-time convergent ZN (FFTCZN) and the arbitrary-time convergent ZN (ATCZN). Unlike traditional models, the FFTCZN model reaches a convergence state within a fixed and finite time frame, while the ATCZN model achieves arbitrary-time convergence, enabling it to reach the convergence state within an arbitrary time frame. Their respective convergence properties, including superior convergence speed and robustness, are verified through rigorous mathematical analyses and experimental validations. Furthermore, two novel controllers are developed to achieve the drift-free path tracking for the manipulator, exhibiting excellent tracking precision and strong resilience to persistent noise.},

Multimode switched systems can describe a wider range of complex processes, but most of the existing switching laws are fixed and lack flexibility. To address these issues, on the one hand, a transitive ILC (T-ILC) method is proposed to mitigate the effect of data network delay; on the other hand, a novel tracking performance-driven switching law (TPD-SL) is proposed. T-ILC can ensure the correct order of data through timestamps and memory identification. TPD-SL can ensure that the system switches to the subsystem with better tracking performance according to the change rate of the tracking error. Furthermore, we adopt an event-triggered communication method to save network computing resources. The stability of the system is demonstrated under the T-ILC and TPD-SL, and the relationship among network delay, event-triggering, and synchronous switching (controller switching aligned with system mode transition) versus asynchronous switching (controller switching with delayed mode transition) is analyzed.

  abstract     = {neural architecture search (NAS) can automatically design well-performing architectures of deep neural networks (DNNs), which have been widely investigated for real-world applications. However, NAS is computationally expensive because vast DNNs are trained to obtain the performance during the search process. Performance predictors can directly obtain the performance of DNNs without training, thus having great potential to overcome this barrier. However, existing performance predictors are typically offline, and are trained with rare architectures labeled. As a result, their predictive ability is limited due to ignoring the promising DNN architectures generated in the NAS process. In this article, we propose a Gaussian process-based online performance predictor (GPOPP) tailored to evolutionary NAS. To achieve this, GPOPP selects the proper architectures to update itself during the search process upon expected improvement as an acquisition function. Further, as architectures cannot be directly used as training data, GPOPP includes a binary encoding schema that can convert the architectures into a suitable format. Although the original intention of designing GPOPP is to provide an alternative way to build promising performance predictors that may compromise performance, the experiments show that GPOPP can outperform most state-of-the-arts. For example, GPOPP-assisted NAS gains 76.1% in accuracy on ImageNet with only 1.1 graphic processing unit (GPU) Days. In addition, the ablation studies also demonstrate the effectiveness of the components designed in GPOPP. The source code is available at https://github.com/songxt3/GPOPP.},

To solve this issue, an optimal pitch control method based on adaptive dynamic programming (ADP) is proposed for MOWTs, which comprehensively considers both power generation and load mitigation performance. First, the motion equation of the tower together with monopile under wind-wave environment is constructed on the foundation of the Euler–Lagrange equation. For the convenience of the controller design, a novel nonlinear affine MOWT mathematical model is presented, and an ADP-based optimal pitch controller is proposed to solve the multiobjective optimal control problem. Then, the uniformly ultimately bounded (UUB) stability of the system is proved by the Lyapunov theory. Finally, to validate the feasibility of the proposed control method, a national renewable energy laboratory (NREL) 5-MW offshore code comparison collaborative (OC3) MOWT has been emulated using the OpenFAST platform developed by the NREL.},

Intershaft bearings serve as the critical part of power transmission. Therefore, their accurate and reliable fault diagnosis is of paramount importance to ensure secure and dependable functioning of the engine. In this field, scarcity of labeled fault data owing to high collection costs is a common challenge. To address this, this article proposes a semi-supervised cross-domain diagnostic method for aircraft engine intershaft bearings, utilizing a virtual domain-driven approach to achieve high accuracy with limited labeled data. Specifically, a dynamics-based simulation model is developed to generate source domain data, reducing the dependency of deep learning models on experimental platforms and lowering platform construction costs. Additionally, a hyperbolic geometric metric learning strategy is designed to capture hierarchical features in high-dimensional data, which handles the correlation between different fault types and enhancing classification accuracy. Furthermore, a domain-class adversarial decoupling mechanism is developed to mitigate the domain bias, enabling the precise representation of fault modes and maximizing the utility of unlabeled virtual domain data. Using datasets from both real-world aircraft engine scenarios and public resource experiments validate the proposed method, illustrating its superior performance compared to state-of-the-art techniques on public domain benchmark datasets.},

  abstract     = {In this article, robust $H_{\infty }$ synchronization problem for a class of networked re-entrant manufacturing systems (RMSs) is investigated by utilizing state feedback control and distributed adaptive state feedback control approaches. Different from the isolated single re-entrant manufacturing line, a networked RMS with three-tiered architecture is presented, which contains the production line, the production workshop and the workshop network. Based on the mass conservation law, the dynamics of the production line and the production workshop are established by a first-order linear hyperbolic PDE and a first-order semi-linear hyperbolic PDE, respectively. On one hand, in view of communication delays and external disturbances that might exist in the system, a delayed state feedback controller is constructed to address robust $H_{\infty }$ synchronization of the networked RMSs. On the other hand, considering the uncertainty with coupling gain and the unavailability of global information, a distributed cooperative controller with the edge-dependent adaptive gain is further developed to ensure robust $H_{\infty }$ synchronization of the networked RMSs. Numerical simulations validate the effectiveness of both proposed control schemes.},

  abstract     = {In the era of booming e-commerce and Internet of Things technology, robotic mobile fulfillment systems (RMFSs) have gained more and more use in logistics industry. While these systems enhance labor efficiency, they introduce numerous optimization challenges. Order picking is a human–robot collaborative process in RMFS. It involves three critical and interrelated operational optimization issues: 1) pod selection; 2) resource scheduling; and 3) manual picking. Each of them is an NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem. Their integration is a significant challenge for operational optimization in RMFS with multiple picking stations and represents a novel problem that was not studied before to our best knowledge. To tackle this complex problem and fill the research gap, we first model it as a mixed integer program to derive exact solutions for small-scale and illustrative cases. For industrial-scale cases that cannot be solved by exact methods given limited time, we propose a tailored learning-strategies-enhanced local search algorithm. It integrates a 3-D bi-section encoding strategy, a three-stage decoding policy, a learning-based adaptive neighborhood selection method, and two learning-based tabu mechanisms. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method, achieving 2.9% to 33.2% performance improvement over six competitive peers. This highlights its superiority in solving the concerned problem, providing significant potential for addressing practical order picking optimization challenges in RMFS.},

The main challenge lies in different historical information available to each controller, namely, the input information is shared while the measurement information is private. To overcome this difficulty, a novel optimal Nash strategy in the input/output form is derived without measurable system states. Then, the OPFB Q-learning iteration algorithm is developed to learn the optimal controllers online only by the knowledge of available input and measurement information, rather than the system dynamics and states. The key is solving the equilibrium equations under asymmetric information, which is achieved by reformulating them into a constrained minimization problem, yielding the numerical solution of the optimal controller pair. The presented idea is new to the best of authors’ knowledge. Numerical examples are shown to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.},

Although researchers have discussed the application of ZNN in chaos synchronization, these ZNN-based chaos synchronization controllers are rarely used in real-world applications. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, no researchers have applied the ZNN-based chaos synchronization controllers in secure voice communication. In this study, we established a novel chaos synchronization controller based on the proportional–integral-convergence-parameter ZNN (PICP-ZNN) model, which is both computationally efficient and intelligent. It was then used in secure voice communication. To demonstrate the superior features of the proposed PICP-ZNN model, we presented both theoretical analysis and numerical experiments to show its fixed-time convergence, robustness, and adaptiveness. In addition, a detailed comparison with other state-of-the-art variable-convergence-parameter ZNNs was presented to highlight our contribution further. The upper bound of the settling time is also estimated in both noisy and noise-free environments. Overall, this study offers a novel ZNN-based secure communication scheme. The PICP-ZNN models may serve as a novel source of inspiration for enhancing the variable-convergence-parameter ZNN even further.},

This article proposes an innovative predefined-time output feedback control scheme for active vehicle suspension systems that achieves superior vibration mitigation with reduced energy consumption. By employing the time-varying scaling function technique, a predetermined-time extended state observer is developed to estimate unmeasurable velocities and lumped disturbance, while a second-order predefined-time filter is designed to avoid the explosion of computational complexity. Furthermore, using the effect characterization method and the X-mechanism reference dynamics, beneficial couplings/disturbances and nonlinearities can be reserved instead of direct cancellation, which leads to significant energy conservation up to 58% compared to other methods. Then, the predefined-time output feedback control is proposed to ensure that settling time can be arbitrarily user-specified using only one parameter, which is independent of initial conditions and control gains. Comparative experiments are performed to present the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed control method.},

An effective model predictive control (MPC) scheme, integrating needle bending compensation and manipulative techniques, is proposed to ensure the safety, accuracy, and stability of acupuncture manipulative trajectory tracking control. Based on acupuncture’s working scenarios, a dexterous 2-DOF acupuncture mechanism is designed. Then, the kinematic and acupoint models are established. To enhance the controller’s robustness, trajectory tracking constraints are included as soft constraints in the objective function before needle insertion, leading to the development of a trajectory-constrained MPC (TCMPC) model. This model not only improves the tracking accuracy and convergence speed but also ensures the stability of the solution. Additionally, a needle bending correction trajectory control method, considering needle deformation, is derived to perceive and correct the needle bending deformation under complex force environments. Furthermore, an adaptive impedance control method, integrating feedforward-feedback control (FFC), is proposed to simultaneously control force and track manipulative techniques under various contact environments. The uniform ultimate boundedness of the closed-loop system is verified using the Lyapunov theory. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed methods and prototypes is validated through numerical simulations and practical experiments.},

This article investigates state estimation, attack reconstruction and attack detection for uncertain CPSs with unknown but bounded (UBB) noise. First, uncertain CPS dynamics are characterized using Takagi–Sugeno fuzzy logic. To address critical modeling challenges arising from complex non-Gaussian stochastic processes, the UBB processes are systematically analyzed. Within this framework, false data injection (FDI) attacks on actuators or sensors are regarded as unknown inputs that can compromise the integrity and authenticity of the system information. Second, a new switching-type zonotopic unknown input observer (SZUIO) is proposed to enhance estimation accuracy while mitigating attack impacts. This observer handles system uncertainties and partial unknown inputs through a switching mechanism that activates multiple operational modes, thereby relaxing state estimation constraints and reducing conservatism. Moreover, the optimal SZUIO for each time step is selected from a set of candidate observers, based on the dynamic information of membership function. Third, to enhance proactive defense against attacks, an integrated framework is proposed for state estimation, attack reconstruction and detection in uncertain CPSs. Finally, the feasibility of the proposed method is demonstrated through examples.},

  abstract     = {In data-driven fault diagnosis, feature selection not only reduces model complexity but also plays a pivotal role in improving prediction accuracy. Existing studies typically employ binary labels to indicate whether a sample exhibits a specific fault, yet this approach fails to capture the severity of the fault. Moreover, features extracted from vibration signals often contain significant noise and redundancy, which adversely affects the training of models. To address these issues, we propose an alternating optimization strategy for feature space and label space. In the label enhancement stage, continuous-valued labels capturing subtle differences in label values through sample-label similarity. In the feature selection stage, a regularization constraint based on feature coefficient correlation is introduced to achieve progressive elimination of redundant and noisy features. Through iterative optimization, label enhancement and feature selection mutually reinforce each other, leading to improved diagnostic accuracy. Building upon this strategy, this article proposes a novel multilabel feature selection method, label-enhanced feature selection (LEFS). Experimental results on real-world datasets for bearing and gearbox fault diagnosis validate the effectiveness and advantage of the LEFS method.},

A convex design condition is derived to ensure that the estimation error dynamics are input-to-state stable with respect to variations in the attack sequences. To improve the accuracy of the estimators, an optimization problem is formulated to minimize the estimation error under these conditions. In addition, different strategies are proposed to mitigate the effects of the attack sequences on the system by using the estimated attack sequences as part of an attack-tolerant control framework. The proposed approach demonstrates its effectiveness in enhancing system resilience, contributing to the security and reliability of CPSs under adversarial scenarios.},

  abstract     = {With the remarkable success of generative models like ChatGPT, artificial intelligence generated content (AIGC) is undergoing explosive development. Not limited to text and images, generative models can generate industrial time series data, addressing challenges, such as the difficulty of data collection and data annotation. Due to their outstanding generation ability, they have been widely used in Internet of Things, metaverse, and cyber–physical–social system to enhance the efficiency of industrial production. In this article, we present a comprehensive overview of generative models for industrial time series from deep-generative models (DGMs) to large-generative models (LGMs). First, a DGM-based AIGC framework is proposed for industrial time series generation. Within this framework, we survey advanced industrial DGMs and present a multiperspective categorization. Then, we systematically propose the roadmap to construct industrial LGMs from four aspects: large-scale industrial dataset, LGMs architecture for complex industrial characteristics, self-supervised training for industrial time series, and fine-tuning of industrial downstream tasks. Furthermore, we introduce an evaluation benchmark that systematically assesses fidelity, diversity, and utility. We include a case study on aircraft engine maintenance, demonstrating the application of DGMs in industrial predictive maintenance. Finally, we conclude the challenges and future directions to enable the development of generative models in industry.},

  abstract     = {In green supply chain initiatives, small suppliers often struggle to achieve collaborative adjustment goals due to limited budgets, even when overall resources are sufficient. This reflects a common challenge in group decision making (GDM) under individual budget constraints. To address this, a novel framework is proposed for achieving group consensus in social networks with limited individual budgets. First, the minimum cost consensus model (MCCM) is extended by introducing a budget relaxation method to explore the potential of Pareto improvement when strict budget constraints hinder consensus. To realize this potential, an asymmetric Nash bargaining cost allocation model with compensation factors is developed to fairly distribute consensus costs within individual budgets. On this basis, an asymmetric Nash bargaining compensation mechanism in ego-networks is designed, reflecting the reality that in decentralized decision-making scenarios, compensation typically occurs among directly connected individuals due to stronger trust, more frequent interactions, and shared interests. This mechanism enables decision-maker to negotiate and reallocate resources within their local social circles, balancing individual and collective benefits and enhancing the feasibility of cooperation. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is demonstrated through an illustrative example.},

  abstract     = {The performance and safety of the battery are affected by temperature. To maintain the battery temperature within a suitable range, the battery thermal management (BTM) system in electric vehicles (EVs) consumes considerable energy, which significantly reduces the driving range of EVs. Due to the slow dynamics of the thermal system, a long prediction horizon is required to prevent overheating of the battery and achieve low energy consumption. However, the large uncertainties associated with long-term velocity prediction significantly affect performance and robustness. This article proposes an approximate scenario-based model predictive control (ASCMPC) framework to improve the battery temperature control robustness under long-term preview uncertainty and reduce energy consumption while decreasing computation time. The scenario-based model predictive control (SCMPC) determines the control law by optimizing multiple previous velocity examples on the same route, which reduces energy consumption and satisfies battery temperature constraint in the presence of preview uncertainties. But SCMPC inevitably increases the number of optimization problem; thus, a trained deep neural network (DNN) is adopted to obtain an approximate SCMPC control law for easy online implementation. The effectiveness of the approximate controller is verified using Hoeffding’s inequality. Co-simulation results show that the proposed ASCMPC enhances the enforcement of battery temperature constraints and reduces energy consumption by 2.18%–2.76% compared to nondeterministic MPC under the uncertainty of preview information and different ambient temperatures, which also has less computation time.},

  abstract     = {Formation control of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) has been regarded as the basis of many sophisticated marine missions. However, the complex marine environment and the high communication energy consumption make it hard to achieve this task. This article is concerned with an energy-efficiency formation issue of AUVs via angle measurement. Particularly, the single vector hydrophone is used to measure the single-frequency signal emitted by AUVs, through which the relative angles among AUVs can be estimated. Based on this, a minimally angle rigid topology generation algorithm is designed to balance the tradeoff between communication energy efficiency and topology connectivity, while a model-free inverse reinforcement learning (IRL)-based formation controller is developed to steer AUVs to reach the target while maintaining a specific shape. The innovations are summarized as follows: 1) the angle measurement in this article can eliminate the reliance on the position information of AUVs; 2) the minimally angle rigid topology in this article can improve the formation stability and reduce the communication energy consumption as compared to the neighboring rule-based solutions; and 3) the IRL-based controller can avoid manually designing cost functions and improve environmental adaptability as compared to traditional-learning-based controllers. Finally, simulation and experimental results are both conducted to verify the effectiveness.},

  abstract     = {The spread of epidemics is a complex process influenced by multiple social relations, including families, schools, and companies. Group interactions represented by a simplicial complex have been shown to impact the dynamics of epidemic transmission significantly. However, the previously proposed higher order contagion models only consider the propagation process within the higher order structure but lack a description of the consistency of the node states in the structure. To address this problem, we provide solutions to create a solvable network model that shows network clusters and node state consistency tendencies, capable of capturing the coexistence of interacting groups. We analyze the bistable region and epidemic threshold of the higher order propagation dynamics and explore the effect of the state update of the nodes on the model in: 1) random regular simplicial networks; 2) triangular simplex-lattice networks; 3) star-simplicial networks; and 4) heterogeneous simplicial networks. Our theoretical analysis, complemented by Monte Carlo numerical simulations, demonstrates that the proposed model accurately captures phase transitions and the bistable region created by higher order interactions. In addition, we find that the incorporation of intersimplex interaction mechanisms greatly reduces the epidemic threshold of the system and produces a larger bistable region, in which the dynamics of the system are heavily affected by the density and location of the initially infected nodes. Our findings contribute to a better understanding of higher order interactions in complex networked systems.},

The actual system modes are usually not accessible directly for controller design due to some practical environment constraints, and the modes of the sliding surface and controller are characterized as observed modes. The hidden Markov model (HMM) is first utilized to detect the system mode information, which also describes the asynchronous phenomenon of the jump mode between the sliding surface/controller and the original plant. Based on the observed modes, a suitable sliding surface is designed via consisting of both the system states and the control input. By sufficiently exploiting the dynamical features of the fuzzy MJSs and associating with the sliding surface, new sliding surface existence conditions are proposed, which also ensure the stochastic stability (SS) and desired dissipative performance for the sliding motion. Then, a novel asynchronous dynamic SMC law is proposed to drive the fuzzy MJS states into a neighborhood of the designed sliding surface.

This article proposes a novel integrated economic predictive control (EMPC) method, to account for the mutual coupling economic optimization objectives and overlapping feasible regions in mode decision-making and dynamic control. In the proposed EMPC formulation, the prediction and optimization are carried out on all of the switched-admissible modes, which have been predetermined together with the stabilization conditions at the preliminary stage. The switching signal and input sequences are combined-optimized for achieving the best accumulated economic cost defined on the optimal predicted trajectories. The switching feasibility, and local/global stability under specified dwell-time constraints are guaranteed by the stabilization constraints designed in EMPC. Through theoretical analysis and simulation comparisons, the proposed approach is demonstrated to tackle with the infeasible problem that inevitably arises in the classic hierarchical decision-making architectures; moreover, it exhibits better closed-loop accumulated economic cost in the illustrated cases.},

Real-world case studies and numerical experiments validate the method’s effectiveness in scenarios that reflect realistic office characteristics and scales.

For the former, based on an additional internal dynamic variable and the parametric Lyapunov equation (PLE), a dynamic event-triggered state-feedback control (DETSFC) protocol is devised, which not only does not exhibit the Zeno behavior but also can guarantee that the MAS realizes the LBC. Similarly, we further utilize the state observer and the dynamic event-triggered control (DETC) method to address the LBC for the MAS with unknown agent state. Finally, the double-integrator MAS and the linearized reduced-order aircraft are used to verify the advantages of the obtained theoretical results.},

The system is characterized by multiple unknown control directions, which pose challenges to its performance. In contrast to traditional Nussbaum-type methods, we propose a novel Nussbaum-type function to handle multiple Nussbaum-type gains, ensuring robust asymptotic tracking. Additionally, two event-triggered mechanisms are developed to alleviate the computational complexity of adaptive Nussbaum design. The static event-triggered mechanism significantly improves the system’s responsiveness to dynamic changes by employing dynamically decreasing thresholds. Building on this, a dynamic event-triggered mechanism is introduced, incorporating an internal variable that continuously adjusts the triggering conditions over time. Furthermore, the proposed design not only achieves asymptotic tracking control but also ensures that both event-triggered mechanisms avoid the Zeno phenomenon. To validate the proposed design schemes, a simulation example of a marine surface vehicle is presented.},

However, the model lacks adaptive learning capabilities and cannot fit labeled data effectively in classification tasks. This study aims to introduce an adaptive learning mechanism into fuzzy rough set theory to enhance its data-fitting capability. To this end, this study seamlessly integrates fuzzy rough set theory with neural networks and proposes a novel fuzzy rough neural network model. This model adaptively learns fuzzy similarity relations in rough set models using the backpropagation algorithm. The proposed network model comprises five layers: the input, membership, fuzzy lower approximation, fully connected, and output layers. The fuzzy similarity relations between the input samples and training samples are computed in the membership layer. These relations are utilized in the fuzzy lower approximation layer to describe the degree to which the samples belong to different classes. The fuzzy rough lower approximations of the input samples are finally fused in the fully connected layer using feature weight coefficients. In the backpropagation stage, the gradient of the objective function is used to correct the fuzzy similarity relations and feature weight coefficients. This study theoretically proved that the proposed fuzzy rough network has a generalized function approximation property and can approximate any decision function. Experimental analysis showed that the proposed method is effective and performs better than most of the existing state-of-the-art algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Evolutionary many-task optimization (EMaTO) endeavors to solve more than three optimization tasks simultaneously by leveraging similarities among tasks. While existing algorithms have shown promising results, they face significant challenges in low-similarity scenarios. First, existing transfer techniques, which rely on population location and distribution, become ineffective. Second, the difficulty of selecting appropriate knowledge increases significantly. To address these challenges, we introduce a new concept: distribution direction knowledge, i.e., the evolutionary direction (ED) of elite solutions. It enables the target task to learn the search experience of source tasks with similar evolutionary trends. To utilize this knowledge effectively, an EMaTO algorithm with distribution direction-assist two-stage knowledge transfer (DTSKT) is proposed. First, an ED-based multisource selection strategy is proposed to obtain appropriate knowledge in different circumstances. Second, we design a two-stage knowledge transfer (TSKT) strategy to search promising regions, consisting of exploration-oriented and exploitation-oriented knowledge transfer. In addition, to directly obtain distribution direction knowledge, the estimation of distribution algorithm is applied as the basic optimizer, explicitly revealing the ED of populations by employing probability distributions. Afterward, to validate the ability of DTSKT to handle tasks with different similarities, we utilize a test problem generator to create a more challenging many-task benchmark suite, named STOP. The results on the WCCI20 and STOP benchmark suites, along with a real-world application, demonstrate that DTSKT generally outperforms seven state-of-the-art algorithms.},

After that, the optimal control strategies are derived by solving the Hamilton–Jacobi–Isaacs (HJI) equation linked to a special nonquadratic cost function. The Nash equilibrium analysis and finite-time capturability are conducted. To learn the optimal pursuit–evasion strategy pair, a fixed-time convergent reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm is proposed, which leverages a novel residual design to facilitate weight updates by collecting and evaluating current and historical data based on information quality. Compared with the existing RL methods that suffer from sluggish convergence due to an asymptotic learning rule and the stringent persistent excitation (PE) condition, the proposed RL relaxes the PE to an easily achievable and online verifiable finite excitation (FE) condition, allowing rapid weight convergence within a fixed period. Simulations and comparisons validate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method, showing a 61% reduction in convergence time in contrast to the prevailing RL schemes.},

In this pioneering study, “assistive normality (AN)” is introduced to characterize the cross-stage spatiotemporal features of exoskeleton-assisted gait in hemiplegic patients, and a multidimensional, low-data-cost metric framework is developed to quantify AN. Three subdivided metrics, including gait restoration (GR), phase-deviation weighting (PDW) and multijoint coordination (MJC), are proposed to assess coupled system interaction behavior across different intervention stages during rehabilitation. A homologous difference evaluation paradigm (HDEP) is introduced to capture pathological differences between healthy and hemiplegic subjects on the basis of the reusability of experimental data, providing an approach for the nominal assistance calibration and assessment of specific exoskeleton devices. In a pilot study with eight healthy individuals and nine hemiplegic patients, between-group metric differences were analyzed to determine the calibrated AN of an exoskeleton. The results provide calibration references for quantitative metrics and demonstrate the ability of framework to characterize the temporal dynamics of human–exoskeleton interactions. The proposed AN framework offers a generalizable approach to assistive robotics, potentially enhancing evaluation of human-robot interaction and advancing clinical rehabilitation applications.},

  abstract     = {Texture surface anomaly detection finds widespread applications in industrial settings. However, existing methods often necessitate gathering numerous samples for model training. Moreover, they predominantly operate within a closed-set detection framework, limiting their ability to identify anomalies beyond the training dataset. To tackle these challenges, this article introduces a novel zero-shot texture anomaly detection method named global-regularized neighborhood regression (GRNR). Unlike conventional approaches, GRNR can detect anomalies on arbitrary textured surfaces without any training data or cost. Drawing from human visual cognition, GRNR derives two intrinsic prior supports directly from the test texture image: local neighborhood priors characterized by coherent similarities and global normality priors featuring typical normal patterns. The fundamental principle of GRNR involves utilizing the two extracted intrinsic support priors for self-reconstructive regression of the query sample. This process employs the transformation facilitated by local neighbor support while being regularized by global normality support, aiming to not only achieve visually consistent reconstruction results but also preserve normality properties. We validate the effectiveness of GRNR across various industrial scenarios using eight benchmark datasets, demonstrating its superior detection performance without the need for training data. Remarkably, our method is applicable for open-set texture defect detection and can even surpass existing vanilla approaches that require extensive training.},

To this end, a nonaffine nonlinear relationship of consensus error regarding the control protocol is established.

To play out full performance of integrated chassis, this study proposes a novel extended stability envelope analysis method to quantify the effect of different chassis actuator combinations on vehicle lateral dynamic. In energy phase plane, the state change direction with influence of control inputs are employed to judge whether a given state will go beyond the tire’s grip limit. Accordingly extended stability envelopes of some typical actuator combinations, i.e., active front steering (AFS) and active rear steering (ARS), AFS and torque vectoring control (TVC), ARS and TVC, are determined. Meanwhile, principle to quantify the overlapping effectiveness range and unique effectiveness range between ARS and TVC is introduced, accordingly effectiveness factors used for coordination control are discussed. In summary, the proposed method in this article has considerable potential for coordination control of integrated chassis, by providing comprehensive analysis method to estimate the extended stability boundary and quantify the effectiveness range with influence of actuators taken into account.},

  abstract     = {While previous studies have examined how blockchain adoption affects stakeholders’ decision-making, the vertical demand information-sharing among supply chain members within a blockchain framework remains underexplored, which raises the question of how a blockchain-enabled retailer shares the demand information and how the blockchain technology may work in a supply chain. This study investigates the impacts of introducing blockchain technology on the information-sharing strategy and equilibrium choice. We find that, in the scenario of blockchain technology, information sharing may not occur when the product quality is higher since sharing may benefit the upstream and hurt the downstream. When the quality is lower, information sharing can be better off for all members given the conditions: 1) the market dispersion is larger or 2) the market dispersion is smaller and the cost is higher. In the scenario of no information-sharing, the implementation of blockchain technology is always better off for the supplier due to the increase in the wholesale price and order quantity, while conditionally benefiting the retailer if the implementation cost of blockchain technology is lower. We also find that consumer surplus is lowest in the case of no information-sharing and no blockchain because of the higher price and nontraceability of information.},

  abstract     = {Recently emerged label noise-resistant graph representation learning (LNR-GRL) has received increasing attention, which aims to enhance the generalization of graph neural networks (GNNs) in semi-supervised node classification with noisy and limited labels. Most of the existing LNR-GRL tend to introduce more complex sample selection strategies developed in nongraph areas to distinguish more noisy nodes to alleviate their misguidance. However, these proposed methods neglect the importance of inaccurate graph structure relationships rectification, and information collaboration between inaccurate graph structure relationships and noisy node label rectification in improving the quality of noisy node identification and its rectified node labels. To solve the above-mentioned issues, we propose a novel multiplex experts governance collaboration (MEGC) framework for LNR-GRL. Specifically, an unsupervised graph structure governance expert is first designed to rectify inaccurate graph structure relationships. Based on the rectified graph structure, a simple label noise governance expert is proposed to accurately identify noisy node labels and further improve the quality of noisy nodes’ rectified labels and unlabeled nodes’ pseudo-labels. Finally, the above-proposed governance experts can be effectively combined with GNNs to jointly guide their training via the introduced cross-view graph contrastive loss and cross-entropy loss, which can maximally limit the effect of noisy node labels and discover more effective supervision guidance from data itself for GNNs optimization. Extensive experiments on three benchmarks, two label noise types, four noise rates, and four training label rates demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method in comparison to the existing LNR-GRL methods.},

First, the resilient event-triggering and quantization schemes against DoS are developed, allowing the triggering parameter and quantization density to be dynamically adjusted. Subsequently, we introduce a time-dependent piecewise Lyapunov function that remains nonincreasing at discontinuity points. This function, along with an auxiliary functional, is dedicated to establishing criteria for the stability with $L_{2}$ gain property of switched systems, under which the frequency of DoS attacks no longer directly impacts the exponential stability decay rate. In contrast to the general min-switching rule, the min-derivative switching strategy in this article is formulated based on the derivative of Lyapunov function and serves to make the time-dependent Lyapunov function decrease. Moreover, the switching law ensures that switches occur only at discrete sampling instants, thereby avoiding Zeno behavior. Finally, two simulation examples are provided to illustrate the feasibility and superiority of our approaches.},

  abstract     = {Formal verification becomes increasingly critical to ensure system functionality, reliability and safety as they grow in complexity. Existing methods tend to focus on a single dimension of system aspects—such as control flow, data flow or timing constraints—or, at most, consider two of these perspectives without integrating all three. In addition, data flow models generally represent high-level data abstraction without including operational details within underlying contexts. The inability of these models to capture system behavior undermines their reliability, ultimately increasing the likelihood of the corresponding systems malfunctioning. To address these issues, we propose a formal verification method based on a timed Petri net with database tables (TPDT-net). First, we model the system using TPDT-net and generate its state reachability graph (SRG). Next, we extend timed computation tree logic (TCTL) by introducing database-related data element operators, thus proposing a database-oriented TCTL (DTCTL) model checking method. In addition, we formalize the system correctness problem as corresponding DTCTL formulas, which are analyzed based on the SRG. This approach transforms correctness verification into a satisfiability problem of DTCTL formulas within the SRG. Finally, we validate the practicality and effectiveness of the proposed method through case studies and experiments.},

  abstract     = {DNN have demonstrated vulnerability to adversarial attacks in object detection tasks. While significant progress has been made in single-spectrum attacks, cross-spectral adversarial attacks remain challenging due to the complex tradeoffs between visible and infrared domains. To address this, an evolutionary multiobjective cross-spectral attack (MoXAttack) framework, for developing adversarial patches in closed-box cross-spectral scenarios is proposed. MoXAttack incorporates a multipopulation constraint-handling technique, which uses both penalty functions and feasibility rules to guide the search process. Spectrum-aware genetic operators are introduced to enhance solution diversity and feasibility. The framework automatically optimizes the smooth to cross-spectral shared patch shape using curvature energy. In addition, MoXAttack utilizes singular value decomposition for visible spectrum texture perturbations and adjustable thermal shielding material thickness for infrared spectrum control. Experiments on the LLVIP dataset demonstrate that MoXAttack achieves competitive performance across multiple object detection models. Ablation studies reveal the positive impact of improved components on attack effectiveness. The multipatch strategy improves attack success rates by at least 17%, while optimized patch shapes outperform conventional geometric shapes by at least 25% in terms of mean average precision drop. In the physical world test, the proposed method shows stability in different viewing angles.},

There are three main contributions in SADE-SS: first, a novel parameter adaptation strategy is incorporated into the framework of SADE to improve its scalability by leveraging information from approximated fitness values. Second, a search space tightening strategy is proposed to strengthen the local exploitation capacity by identifying promising local search spaces. Third, a switching strategy is proposed to manage the global and local surrogate-assisted searches, aiming to balance exploration and exploitation capacities. Experiments on expensive benchmark functions with dimensions ranging from 30 to 400 were conducted to verify the effectiveness of SADE-SS for HEOPs. Moreover, ablation experiments were conducted to validate each proposed component. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that SADE-SS can secure highly competitive performance over state-of-the-art SAEAs for HEOPs.},

First, we employ the adaptive control technique to design a distributed observer, which provides an estimation of the leader for partial agents, thereby eliminating the need for the global information. Then, we propose a novel data-based adaptive dynamic programming (ADP) approach, associated with a double-integrator operator, to develop an online data-driven learning algorithm for learning the optimal control policy. However, existing optimal control strategy learning algorithms rely on the persistent excitation conditions (PECs), the full-rank condition, and the offline storage of historical data. To address these issues, our proposed method learns the optimal control policy online by solving a data-driven linear regression equations (LREs) based on an online-verifiable interval excitation (IE) condition, instead of relying on PEC. In addition, the uniqueness of the LRE solution is established by verifying the invertibility of a matrix, instead of satisfying the full-rank condition related to PEC and historical data storage as required in existing algorithms. It is demonstrated that our proposed learning algorithm not only guarantees optimal tracking with unknown dynamics but also relaxes some of the strict conditions of existing learning algorithms.

  abstract     = {high-dimensional and incomplete (HDI) matrices are commonly encountered in a variety of big data-related industrial applications, which describe complex interactions between entities. The complete interaction relationship in the HDI matrix is essential to deal with various problems such as pattern recognition in industrial applications. Therefore, estimating the missing data in the HDI matrix is crucial. latent factor analysis (LFA) models have achieved advanced results in solving such problems. However, the existing LFA models cannot model the nonlinear structure hidden in the HDI matrix. neural networks (NNs) can handle the nonlinearity in the HDI data, but their high estimation accuracy relies on high computation cost and storage burden. To address the aforementioned problems, this article proposes a novel NNLFA model. It contains the following primary ideas: 1) it can model the nonlinear structure of the HDI matrix efficiently through NNs and 2) it incorporates the NNs into the LFA model to improve estimation accuracy while maintaining high computational and storage efficiency. To validate the superiority of the NNLFA model, experiments with six state-of-the-art models are conducted on six practical industrial application datasets. The experimental results indicate that the NNLFA model enhances estimation accuracy by up to 33.3%. In addition, NNLFA model shows strong competitiveness in terms of both time and storage efficiency when compared to baseline models.},

  abstract     = {Artificial intelligence (AI)-based multiplayer systems have attracted increasing attention across diverse fields. While most research focuses on simultaneous-move multiplayer games to achieve Nash equilibrium, there are complex applications that involve hierarchical decision-making, where certain players act before others. This power asymmetry increases the complexity of strategic interactions, especially in the presence of mismatched uncertainties that can compromise data reliability and decision-making. To this end, this article develops a novel event-triggered reinforcement learning (RL) approach for hierarchical multiplayer systems with mismatched uncertainties. Specifically, by establishing an auxiliary augment system and designing appropriate cost functions for the high-level leader and low-level followers, we reformulate the hierarchical robust control problem as an optimization task within the Stackelberg–Nash game framework. Furthermore, an event-triggered scheme is designed to reduce the computational overhead and a neural-RL-based method is developed to automatically learn the event-triggered control policies for hierarchical players. Theoretical analyses are conducted to 1) demonstrate the stability preservation of the designed robust-optimal transformation; 2) verify the achievement of Stackelberg–Nash equilibrium under the developed event-triggered policies; and 3) guarantee the boundedness of the impulsive closed-loop system. Finally, the simulation studies validate the effectiveness of the developed method.},

First, a reinforcement learning-based distributed optimal control law is designed by constructing the identifier-critic-actor learning networks.

  abstract     = {This work addresses the flexible job shop scheduling with finite skilled workers, extending classical flexible job shop scheduling by incorporating operation decomposition, finite worker, and worker transfer. These new problem features significantly increase the complexity of solving, as several operations requiring multiple workers can lead to worker competition, causing delays in other operations that depend on the same workers. Previous studies focused on either operation decomposition or worker transfer but did not address the issue of worker competition. To tackle this challenging optimization problem, we propose a knowledge-guided hierarchical evolutionary algorithm (KHEA) with multiview cooperative neighborhood search. The key contributions of this work are as follows: 1) a hierarchical solving framework is proposed to reduce the solving difficulty. This problem is decomposed into three levels. The first level ignores the worker assignment and the second level starts optimizing it. The final level then refines the global solution; 2) a knowledge-guided crossover operator with a feedback schema is designed to improve the efficiency of crossover operations; and 3) a multiview cooperative neighborhood search strategy is proposed to reduce the idle time caused by worker competition. This involves designing a new disjunctive graph that accounts for worker competition to identify the critical path. The information from both machine-view and worker-view Gantt charts is cooperatively utilized to minimize idle time. Our method, KHEA, was tested on two benchmarks across 28 instances and 16 large-scale instances, with equal running time for comparisons. Compared to state-of-the-arts, KHEA obtains significant superiority.},

  abstract     = {decision transformer (DT), as a conditional sequence modeling (CSM) approach, learns the action distribution for each state using historical information, such as trajectory returns, offering a supervised learning paradigm for offline reinforcement learning (Offline RL). However, due to the fact that DT solely concentrates on an individual trajectory with high returns-to-go, it neglects the potential for constructing optimal trajectories by combining sequences of different actions. In other words, traditional DT lacks the trajectory stitching capability. To address the concern, a novel DT (PCDT) for Offline RL is proposed. Our approach begins by pretraining a standard DT to explicitly capture behavior sequences. Next, we apply the sequence importance sampling to penalize actions that significantly deviate from these behavior sequences, thereby constructing a pessimistic critic. Finally, Q-values are integrated into the policy update process, enabling the learned policy to approximate the behavior policy while favoring actions associated with the highest Q-value. Theoretical analysis shows that the sequence importance sampling in pessimistic critic decision transformer (PCDT) establishes a pessimistic lower bound, while the value optimality ensures that PCDT is capable of learning the optimal policy. Results on the D4RL benchmark tasks and ablation studies show that PCDT inherits the strengths of actor–critic (AC) and CSM methods, achieving the highest normalized scores on challenging sparse-reward and long-horizon tasks.

  abstract     = {State-of-the-art brain–computer interfaces can carry out neural recording from hundreds of channels with high resolution. Such massive data makes it easy to study the brain better than ever before, but on the flip side, it leads to increased chip size, power consumption, heat dissipation and risk for patient safety. As such, compression of the data prior to transmission from the implant could be key to improving reliability and usability of such microsystems. In recent years, starting from sparsifying transforms all the way to compressive autoencoders (AEs), this compression has been offered by substantial arithmetic on the implant side, which in turn incurs its own inevitable costs. In this work, we analyze spike waveforms to prioritize subintervals by their importance. Thereupon, we design a temporal undersampling pattern matching the importance of each subinterval for compressive sensing of spikes. Following such sensing, we reconstruct spikes using a deep neural network (DNN) trained to capture spike representation from the undersampled measurements, with possible adaptation to individual subjects. This approach offers what we believe is the first spike compression-reconstruction framework that imposes no arithmetic on the compressing side, yet on the restoration side, performs at least on par with most on-chip arithmetic-heavy techniques. For instance, given a spike length of $N=64$ at eightfold compression, the famed symmlet-4 method yields a mean signal-to-noise-and-distortion ratio (SNDR) of 7.14 dB at a total compression arithmetic cost of $16N$ sums and products per spike, while for the proposed method, the figure is 8.38 dB at 0 sums and products.},

  abstract     = {The machine downtime occurring during routine production (MDT_RP) because of recessive disturbances (RecDs) can cause huge economic losses and slow down production. In modern industries, condition monitoring, prognosis, and maintenance policies are widely applied to minimize machine failures caused by dominant disturbances (DomDs). However, MDT_RP, because of RecD, has rarely been explored. RecD multivariate time series data faces the challenge of changing information with many noisy and abnormal data points, making it difficult for sequential methods (SMs) to forecast MDT_RP accurately. To address this gap, a novel smoothing and matrix decomposition (MD) based stacked bidirectional gated recurrent unit (STMD_SBiGRU) is proposed for MDT_RP forecasting. Existing SMs have disadvantages in that they are highly affected by noisy data, which significantly affects their feature information extraction capability. The generated error gets amplified during forward propagation, thus interfering with the parameter’s optimization. The proposed STMD_SBiGRU has the advantage of capturing the maximum variance in the dataset by using various MD methods, as well as reducing abnormalities by applying various smoothing factors. This dual innovation of integrating MD and smoothing facilitates the effective distribution of parameters across multiple stacked layers and directions in a proposed model, thus avoiding complexity and overfitting problems of conventional SMs while improving network generalization performance. The extensive experimental work demonstrates that STMD_SBiGRU can forecast MDT_RP with better performance and is highly robust to noisy data compared to other data-driven methods.},

  abstract     = {This article addresses the stabilization of neutral stochastic delay systems (NSDSs) employing aperiodically intermittent controllers (APIC) based on delay feedback and asynchronous switching. To tackle issues arising from the neutral term, we introduce a special auxiliary system (AS) that is not a neutral system, and is distinct from existing literature [41]. Utilizing the Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional approach and the iterative method, the stability criterion for the AS is given, which consists of the bound of three delay functions and the duty-cycle. If the stability criterion is satisfied, the AS will achieve mean-square exponentially stability, offering a viable APIC design scheme for non-NSDSs. Additionally, employing the equivalence technique (ET), this article obtains an additional bound for the system delay function, denoted by $\tau ^{*}$ . When the system delay function $\tau (t)\lt \tau ^{*}$ , we demonstrate that the NSDS with intermittent feedback is mean-square exponentially stable if the non-neutral AS is stable. This method is called as AS method based on non-neutral type (ASMbNT). With one comparison, this article reveals that the ASMbNT proposed in this article not only addresses the problem considered in [41], but also yields improved results. Lastly, to demonstrate the effectiveness and validity of the proposed approach, a numerical example is presented.},

  abstract     = {The existence of compound velocity and acceleration windups in clusters of nonholonomic mobile robots can seriously constrain the smoothness and stability of the overall motion. This article proposes a leader–follower-based distributed formation control framework for smooth and robust clustering of multiple nonholonomic mobile robots under compound windups of velocity and acceleration and unknown perturbations. The decoupled position and orientation kinematics and substrate wheel velocity dynamics are modularly devised via feedback linearization techniques to enable upper-level cooperative error regulation and lower-level wheel velocity trajectory tracking. The auxiliary dynamic system based on the velocity envelope generated by compound motion windups and the WMR kinematic is integrated into the collaborative error, adaptively mitigating the detrimental windup effects. The adaptive saturated extended state observer is utilized to flatly estimate unknown perturbations in the wheel velocity dynamics with enhanced robustness. Finally, the overall stability analyses are done based on Lyapunov’s theorem, and contrastive simulations and plentiful experiments are conducted to attest to the validity and availability.},

  abstract     = {Model-based reinforcement learning (RL), which learns an environment model from the offline dataset and generates more out-of-distribution model data, has become an effective approach to the problem of distribution shift in offline RL. Due to the gap between the learned and actual environment, conservatism should be incorporated into the algorithm to balance accurate offline data and imprecise model data. The conservatism of current algorithms mostly relies on model uncertainty estimation. However, uncertainty estimation is unreliable and leads to poor performance in certain scenarios, and the previous methods ignore differences between the model data, which brings great conservatism. To address the above issues, this article proposes a mildly conservative model-based offline RL algorithm (DOMAIN) without estimating model uncertainty, and designs the adaptive sampling distribution of model samples, which can adaptively adjust the model data penalty. In this article, we theoretically demonstrate that the Q value learned by the DOMAIN outside the region is a lower bound of the true Q value, the DOMAIN is less conservative than previous model-based offline RL algorithms, and has the guarantee of safety policy improvement. The results of extensive experiments show that DOMAIN outperforms prior RL algorithms and the average performance has improved by 1.8% on the D4RL benchmark.},

This task can be framed as a “reverse Turing test” in which a computer has to detect if an input instance has been generated by a human or artificially. To tackle this task, we study ten public datasets of handwritten symbols (isolated characters, digits, gestures, pointing traces, and signatures) that are artificially reproduced using seven different synthesizers, including, among others, the Kinematic Theory ( $\boldsymbol {\Sigma \Lambda }$ model), generative adversarial networks, Transformers, and Diffusion models. We train a shallow recurrent neural network that achieves excellent performance (98.3% Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC) score and 1.4% equal error rate on average across all synthesizers and datasets) using nonfeaturized trajectory data as input. In few-shot settings, we show that our classifier achieves such an excellent performance when trained on just 10% of the data, as evaluated on the remaining 90% of the data as a test set. We further challenge our classifier in out-of-domain settings, and observe very competitive results as well. Our work has implications for computerized systems that need to verify human presence, and adds an additional layer of security to keep attackers at bay.},

In this article, we propose a new approach to analyzing secure collaboration plans of multiple workflow processes with TDRs and user conflicts: 1) we propose the computing patterns for basic structures in workflow processes with TDRs and shared users; 2) we develop the next-generation parametric sprouting graph (NPSG) based on the above patterns; and 3) we obtain the optimal secure collaboration plan based on NPSG. Compared with the existing methods, our approach can effectively deal with the problem of collaboration plans with TDRs and shared users.

  abstract     = {Imaging systems working under poor lighting conditions often suffer from poor visibility, compromising the reliability of vision-based systems. To address this problem, recent studies have developed data-driven low-light image enhancement (LIE) techniques to improve visibility. However, these LIE methods typically require large amounts of training samples, and the learned representation may not be valid for real-world scenes due to data discrepancies. In this work, we propose DP-LIE, an unsupervised LIE method driven by both data and priors. Unlike the existing methods that learn unexplainable high-dimensional features for end-to-end mapping, DP-LIE focuses on learning prior-guided parametric maps with definite meanings, enabling the low-light images to be brightened from an interpretable prior-based perspective. To this end, we design a simple yet effective prior-guided network-assisted LIE formulation, which elaborately bonds the data-driven representations with the traditional priors. The embedded priors narrow the solution space of the LIE model, allowing it to be efficiently trained with fewer samples. Notably, even trained with just a single low-light input image, the proposed method (denoted as DP-LIE-S) achieves comparable performances with existing unsupervised LIE methods. Moreover, experiments demonstrate that the proposed DP-LIE method exhibits excellent generalization performance across diverse imaging devices and promises better detection results for vision-based detection systems in nighttime scenes.},

First, one PM configuration is made for each wafer type, i.e., the suitable number of PMs is selected for processing wafers, ensuring that the natural workload is balanced at each step for a type of wafers. Then, the other PM configuration is made, i.e., adopt a virtual module method for balancing the natural workload at bottleneck processing steps of different types of wafers. Based on two-layer PM configuration, this work derives necessary and sufficient conditions for a CT’s schedulability, which are less restrictive than the current state-of-the-art ones. It proposes a polynomial-time algorithm for computing its minimum periodic schedule when it is schedulable. Several examples are given to show our algorithm’s superiority over existing ones.},

Many existing approaches involve offline training and classifiers or depend on prefabricated models, lacking the adaptability needed to support diverse users and real-time scenarios with varying gait cycles. Meanwhile, balancing intervention on human limbs between compliance and assistance during learning is still an open problem. To address these issues, this article proposes a real-time learning method for walking assistance without classifiers, automatically adapting to alterations in motion patterns. The control law, based on adaptive admittance control and the equilibrium state, ensures stable assistance during learning with intuitive parameter tuning and allows for switching of gait during assistance. Utilizing selective memory recursive least squares in a neural network enables rapid learning and precise prediction of human users’ motion intention, without pretraining. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves a prediction error within 6° after half a minute of learning with a prediction ahead time of 120 ms, outperforming classic approaches. The assistance performance is consistent despite varied control parameters, indicating a certain level of robustness.},

The proposed regulative learning rate strategy outperforms traditional fixed-rate gradient descent approaches found in existing works. With the objective of minimizing the performance index, the optimal value function and the optimal controller are derived from the approximate solution of the HJB equation. To alleviate the resource demand and enhance the flexibility of the threshold function, an adaptive event-triggered (AET) scheme integrating the idea of sampling control and event-triggered strategy is applied to the optimal control initially. Compared with the static event-triggered strategy, the AET method contains increasing engineering value. A piecewise Lyapunov function is constructed based on optimal value function, estimated error introduced by neural network (NN) weight, and the classic Lyapunov-Krasovskii function. Thus, uniform ultimate boundedness for tracking error is proven theoretically. Moreover, the maximum tolerable strength of cyberattacks is provided from the stability analysis.

Specifically, this framework constructs a probabilistic graphical model for Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) in latent space and utilizes the variational lower bound of hidden states for policy improvement. Furthermore, this work theoretically proves the convergence of the HTI framework, ensuring its effectiveness in handling nonstationary environments. The proposed framework is integrated with the state-of-the-art MCTS-based algorithm sampled MuZero and evaluated on multiple control tasks with different nonstationary dynamics transitions.

The Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman (HJB) equation is solved by the UKF-based MsHDP algorithm, which has the advantages of faster convergence speed and handling unknown disturbances in the system. The convergence of the developed algorithm is proved under certain conditions, and the system stability is guaranteed. To reduce the communication needs, a dynamic event-triggering mechanism is designed. Then, an event-based estimation-critic structure is proposed to implement the UKF-based MsHDP algorithm, where the UKF is used to estimate the future state of uncertain systems and the critic neural network (NN) is used to approximate cost function.

  abstract     = {An output-feedback safe tracking control (OFSTC) scheme is investigated for nonlinear systems with sensor faults based on adaptive critic learning algorithm. By introducing a first-order filter, a mapping relationship between sensor faults and actuator faults is established, and an augmented system is constructed by integrating system state and filter output. Through the incorporation of robust adaptive terms, an output-based fault observer is developed to online identify sensor fault information, ensuring that observation errors converge asymptotically to zero. For optimal STC realization, an augmented tracking system is constructed by integrating the dynamics of tracking error, reference trajectory, and filter output. A modified cost function is designed to explicitly include sensor fault estimation and a discount factor based on the augmented tracking system. Then, the optimal STC strategy is derived by solving the Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman equation using an adaptive critic structure with two tuned laws cooperatively. The application of the Lyapunov stability theorem demonstrates that the closed-loop system converges within a small neighborhood of the equilibrium point.

To achieve this, the convergence coefficients are designed to be piecewise varying, and the end-effector task is divided into two phases. In the initial phase, only the end-effector position task is considered and the fixed coefficient convergence method is adopted, which can take into consideration both end-effector task and secondary task optimization. In the second phase, the end-effector position and orientation are taken into account concurrently, and time-varying coefficients are used for end-effector task. The convergence coefficients are time varying to enhance the convergence speed, particularly when the errors are small in the later phase of task planning. This can ensure the optimization of secondary tasks when the manipulator is insufficient-redundant, and accomplish the end-effector task planning in a relatively fast speed.

  abstract     = {This article investigates the problem of bipartite synchronization (BS) for coupled coopetitive memristive neural networks (MNNs) using a switching event-triggered gain-scheduled control strategy. First, a mathematical model of coupled MNNs exhibiting both cooperative and competitive interactions is formulated based on directed signed graph theory. To handle the antagonistic nature of these interactions, an orthogonal transformation is employed to develop a formally unified error system. Then, a switching event-triggered scheme (SETS) is designed, which leverages the coopetitive relationships among nodes to reduce communication costs. Meanwhile, a gain-scheduled controller, which incorporates the cooperative-competitive relationships is designed to achieve the BS. Specifically, the controller consists of both linear and nonlinear components: the linear component ensures system stability, while the nonlinear component compensates for residual terms arising from the heterogeneous structure of MNNs. Furthermore, the nonlinear control gains are scheduled via a function that depends on the error state, its derivative, and the sampled error, thereby reducing the conservatism of the synchronization conditions. A piecewise interval-dependent Lyapunov functional tailored to the characteristics of SETS is constructed. By employing inequality techniques, sufficient conditions for BS are derived in the form of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs), enabling the joint design of the linear control gains and the triggering matrix. To validate the proposed method, both a numerical example and a potential practical application are provided. In addition, two comparative studies are conducted to highlight the advantages of the proposed SETS and the interval-dependent Lyapunov functional, respectively.},

However, despite the prevalence of job-to-product assembly process in industrial fields, the investigation of distributed assembly welding shop scheduling problem (DAWSP) remains unexplored. Meanwhile, given the energy-intensive characteristic of welding operations, addressing energy consumption in welding shop is crucial for achieving environmental sustainability. Thus, this study investigates the energy-efficient DAWSP (EDAWSP), focusing on minimizing total energy consumption (TEC) and makespan. The proposed approaches include a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model and a knowledge-guided co-evolutionary algorithm (KCEA). In KCEA, a knowledge coefficient is defined to build a bridge that connects the welding part and assembly part. By incorporating knowledge coefficient and weight-sum approach, an effective initialization strategy is proposed for producing a superior initial population. To effectively complete evolutionary process, a co-evolutionary operator is devised based on bi-population strategy. To improve KCEA’s exploitation capability, a local search is developed within the variable neighborhood search (VNS) framework, utilizing six critical-path-based neighborhood structures. Besides, an energy-saving strategy is presented to further minimize TEC without increasing makespan. Finally, a series of comparison experiments are executed. The experimental results illustrate that all improved components of KCEA contribute to its performance, and KCEA outperforms other six optimization algorithms in solving EDAWSP.},

By constructing a new time-dependent multiple Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional (TDMLF), sufficient conditions are then developed to ensure the strict $(\mathscr {X}_{1}, \mathscr {X}_{2},\mathscr {X}_{3})$ - $\gamma $ dissipativity for the considered SDNNs, even in cases where all subnetworks are nondissipative. Subsequently, the proposed approach is implemented for the synchronization of SDNNs, where a bumpless transfer proportional-integral-like (PI-like) control approach is first adopted. In addition, the corresponding criterion is also proposed, which guarantees that the resultant closed-loop synchronization error systems (SESs) not only satisfy strict dissipativity but also achieve a certain bumpless transfer performance (BTP). Ultimately, the practicability and superiority of the proposed design approach are thoroughly substantiated through two simulation examples.},

First, a flexible job shop lot-splitting scheduling model with the optimization objectives of total energy consumption, makespan, and total processing cost is formulated. Second, a hybrid approach of the KLSM and the IMOEA is designed to solve the model. The solution space of the problem is fully explored based on the moth-flame operator. Co-evolutionary operators are performed to promote information interaction among populations, hence both the population diversity and the convergence effect of the algorithm are improved. Moreover, a post-adjustment strategy based on adjacent processes is developed to reduce unnecessary fixture changes. Finally, extended experiments between some KLSM-based well-known and novel algorithms, including the proposed IMOEA, MOEA/D, NSGA-II, MOPSO, SGECF, SCEA, and SLMEA are conducted in benchmark problems and a real-world case of machine tool plant. The results show that the proposed method outperforms its competitors on co-optimization of lot-splitting, machine allocation, operation sequencing, and fixture assignment of the $\gamma $ -shop scheduling, which can effectively reduce total energy consumption, makespan, and total processing cost.},

This limitation can result in negative transfer. To address this issue, this article proposes a multisource feature separation and weighted (MFSW) network for lithium-ion battery capacity estimation. First, private and common features of both source and target domains are disentangled through feature separation. An adversarial mechanism is employed to guide the common feature extractor to learn domain-invariant features. Then, the features are further aligned using a multiorder metric. Finally, a multisource dynamic weighting method is introduced to adaptively adjust the weight of each source domain. Compared with other multisource domain adaptation methods, the proposed method reduces the average MSE and MAE by 56.3% and 28.8% on the MIT dataset, and by 44.0% and 38.6% on the XJTU dataset, respectively. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method effectively mitigates negative transfer and exhibits superior performance and robustness.},

  abstract     = {Complex industrial processes often run under varying operating conditions. Learning-based control methods are difficult to adapt to these unknown variations. Therefore, it is necessary to update the model and control strategy adaptively. However, in traditional control frameworks, due to the limitation of computational and storage resources of edge devices, control strategies are difficult to update once deployed, which leads to model mismatch after operating condition change and seriously reduces the control performance. To solve this problem, this article proposes a novel cloud-edge collaborative control method. Specifically, a cloud-assisted parallel subspace identification method is proposed, which fully utilizes the powerful computational capability of the distributed cluster in the cloud to achieve fast and accurate model identification. Then, an explicit control strategy is proposed, which solves the control law as a piece-wise affine function offline. The process model and explicit control law are sent down to the edge, enabling fast and precise control under limited resource constraints. An operating condition change detection method based on the process model is proposed, and the edge detects the emergence of new operating conditions by the prediction error. Meanwhile, to fully excite new operating condition characteristics, a joint control and excitation signal generator (JCESG) is designed. JCESG ensures accurate identification of new operating condition model under limited data, which in turn greatly shortens the operation condition switching process and ensures fast modeling and precise control in new operating conditions. Notably, considering that the proposed method can adaptively realize model identification and control law update, it is capable of adapting to the continuous change of operating conditions, and the sufficient excitation of JCESG greatly reduces the data volume requirement for model update, which further ensures that the method adapts to the full range of operating conditions. Finally, extensive experiments verified the superiority of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {Group decision-making (GDM) is a crucial approach to ensuring the scientific nature and impartiality of decisions. However, strategic manipulative behaviors driven by self-interested motives often undermine the fairness and effectiveness of decision outcomes, leading to results that deviate from expectations. While most prior studies have focused on theoretical analysis, there remains a significant gap in effective measures to prevent such manipulative behaviors. Moreover, current consensus models predominantly emphasize cost optimization, with less attention paid to the acceptability of feedback. To address these challenges, this study introduces an optimal consensus adjustment mechanism based on the Nash bargaining (NB) solution, aiming to prevent manipulation and self-interested behaviors in GDM. Specifically, we first analyze the opinion manipulation problem within the framework of the minimum adjustment consensus model (MACM). We then construct the Nash product to mitigate the risk of weight manipulation. Subsequently, we examine the nonuniqueness issue in the allocation of minimal total consensus adjustments from the perspective of cooperative game theory. Building on this, we incorporate regret theory to characterize the risk aversion and loss sensitivity of decision-makers (DMs) and propose a consensus adjustment mechanism based on the NB game. Finally, we establish three novel optimization methods to allocate optimal individual consensus adjustments. Case studies and comparative experiments demonstrate the superiority of these methods.},

To deal with this challenge, by applying the adding a power integrator method, a decentralized adaptive controller is built with a switching parameter to compensate unknown parameters. Based on fixed-time control framework, a logic-based switching rule is established to tune the switching parameter online, in which the Lyapunov-like boundary functions are utilized to replace the Lyapunov function containing inexact values brought by unmodeled dynamics. Then, with the aid of Lyapunov stability theorem, it is proved that the system output never violates the prespecified constraints and all state variables converge to zero within a fixed time.

However, the robustness of SCN is significantly reduced when processing the data disturbed by outliers. Aiming at improve the noisy data regression performance of SCN, this article presents a novel robust decorrelated SCNs ensemble model (RDSCNE). Such a robust decorrelated ensemble framework adopts weighted negative correlation learning (WNCL) and a robust regularization technique, which can guarantee the generalization performance for noisy data processing. Specifically, we first present a WNCL framework based on kernel density estimation (KDE) to build SCNs ensemble model, so that the negative effects of noise can be suppressed through KDE to calculate penalty weights of each training sample for the computation of ensemble weights. Meanwhile, $l_{1}$ norm loss function combined with $l_{2}$ regularization technique is employed as the objective function of base components. This approach is designed to process outliers with sparse characteristics and alleviate the over-fitting phenomenon. Then, augmented Lagrange multiplier (ALM) method is used to calculate the objective function. Experimental results over some regression datasets with Gaussian outliers demonstrate that the proposed RDSCNE model has better robustness than the various SCN variants.},

This study proposes a novel asynchronous consensus evolution mechanism (ACEM) designed to enhance large group emergency decision-making (LGEDM) under uncertainty, with specific application to the EV SoCSC. Unlike traditional synchronous approaches, ACEM enables decision makers (DMs) to contribute asynchronously, reducing wait times and accelerating consensus formation. The mechanism integrates uncertain scenario analysis with an optimization framework that dynamically allocates decision steps with relative weights, ensuring adaptability to complex and dynamic environments. We further develop a time-aware adaptive clustering (TAAC) algorithm to segment DMs based on decision quality and response speed, enhancing both the speed and the accuracy of consensus building. Simulation results indicate that ACEM significantly reduces decision latency and improves consensus efficiency under uncertain disruption scenarios. This work provides a robust framework for agile decision-making, enabling manufacturers to enhance SoCSC resilience in uncertain disruptions.},

Traditional oversamplers are inadequate in ascertaining the quantity of new samples and can not mitigate the impact of noise on new samples. To solve these two problems theoretically, we propose an optimization framework for imbalance-ratio and position (OIRP). OIRP constructs two optimization models utilizing data on feature distribution, class ratio, quantity, and dimensionality to determine the optimal quantity to generate and the optimal position of new samples. These two models are demonstrated to possess optimal solutions. OIRP is employed to enhance current oversampling algorithms. It is adaptive, devoid of parameters, and universally applicable.

To address these challenges, this article proposes a constrained multimodal multiobjective differential evolution algorithm, which incorporates a similar-niching-based reproduction operator and a novel environmental selection mechanism. The proposed algorithm initiates by segregating the population into distinct niches, thereby promoting independent evolution within each niche. This segmentation enhances the exploration of multiple discrete feasible regions, thus improving the capacity to find diverse Pareto optimal solutions. Moreover, the algorithm selects the most similar niche to collaboratively generate solutions, further enhancing its ability to generate effective feasible solutions. To improve the diversity within the population, the proposed environmental selection mechanism gives preference to solutions that enhance the distribution of the next-generation population. By considering the diversity in both two spaces, the population retains more pareto optimal solutions. Based on the Friedman test results of the comparison experiment with other representative algorithms and the champion algorithm of the CEC2023 CMMOPs competition, the proposed algorithm attained the top ranking, thereby reinforcing its demonstrated superiority.

The conventional error constraint methods that require adjusting 2n design parameters to ensure all errors enter the specified accuracy within a preassigned settling time greatly increase the complexity of controller design. By blending the modified shifting function and the barrier Lyapunov function, the presented control scheme only needs to adjust n parameters to achieve full errors prescribed-time convergence. Besides, the dead-zone input is divided into a linear term and an interference-like term. A disturbance observer is devised to estimate and compensate the compounded perturbations, including external perturbations, fuzzy approximation errors and interference-like term, which significantly enhances the accuracy of the feedback compensation mechanism. It is proved that all signals of the closed-loop system are bounded. Finally, the availability of the proposed control strategy is testified via a simulation example of an RLC circuit.},

  abstract     = {This article studies nonconservative stability conditions of continuous-time switched linear systems under mode-dependent dwell time (MDT). To establish a unified analysis approach for switched systems with stable and/or unstable subsystems, a concept called “dictionary” is introduced to characterize admissible MDT switching sequences. Subsequently, two equivalent nonconservative conditions of the global uniform asymptotic stability (GUAS) are obtained based on quadratic Lyapunov functions (LFs). Moreover, the stability results are transformed into convex conditions for facilitating the controller design. In addition, the developed stability results are applied to $L_{2}$ -gain analysis and $H_{\infty }$ controller design for the continuous-time switched linear system subject to external disturbances. Simulations are provided to validate the effectiveness and the superiority over existing results.},

MBSE has the potential to promote consistency, communication, clarity and maintainability within systems engineering projects. MBSE also has the potential to address one of the well-known issues of the systems engineering process—the late discovery of errors or design faults. In this article, the development of the “Spacecraft early analysis model” (SEAM) is detailed and the current version is presented. The SEAM is a model-based framework developed by the authors to define, execute and analyze spacecraft structure and behavior during preliminary design. The SEAM comprises multiple modules (Project, Requirements, Mission, System, Operations) that enable the definition of the spacecraft and its supporting systems, and enables each to be updated independently. The SEAM incorporates a novel behavioral pattern that structures the modes and functions of the spacecraft using state machines and activities. Using this pattern, the behavior itself is not prescribed, as is common in similar model-based representations of spacecraft. The user defines individual functions and modes, and the user then simulates the behavior of the spacecraft in response to a concept of operations (ConOps). In this article, the need for the SEAM, the development approach, the SEAM composition and the limitations of the SEAM are presented and discussed.},

  abstract     = {Motion platforms are integral to enhancing user immersion in vehicle simulators by reproducing vehicle accelerations through virtual reality. A key challenge in this domain is ensuring that users perceive critical motion cues accurately. Due to the physical limitations of motion platforms, Motion Cueing algorithms (MCA) often fail to transmit specific acceleration signals that are important for the purpose of the simulator (e.g., training), leading to a loss in motion fidelity. This gap, widely acknowledged but insufficiently addressed in prior research, directly impacts the user’s perception of realism. To address this issue, we propose a heuristic-based enhancement to the classical washout algorithm (CWA) that prioritizes the retention of these critical signals while maintaining system stability. To evaluate the effectiveness of this approach, an experimental study was conducted with 40 participants who tested the system with and without the proposed heuristics. Participants provided real-time feedback and completed post-test questionnaires. The results indicate that the heuristic-enhanced CWA significantly improves users’ ability to perceive signals that were previously lost, thus bridging the identified research gap and advancing the state of motion simulation.},

We explore the modified reachability trees of UPNs from a new lens by defining two classes of circuits, and exploit an algorithm to engineer a supervisor that ensures liveness and maximum permissiveness.

  abstract     = {We consider the optimal inventory control problem of a periodically reviewed supply chain with perishable goods. The deterioration process is characterized by an unknown decay factor time-varying over a given arbitrarily large uncertainty subset of all admissible values. In this context we face the problem of defining an effective inventory control policy reconciling control requirements like maximizing the satisfied customer demand, avoiding overstocking, attenuating the bullwhip effect. The conflict of these requirements and the uncertainty on the time varying decay factor define a highly involved problem that necessarily calls for an optimal and robust control synthesis approach. To define a general synthesis procedure of the inventory control policy, we take into account the time varying uncertainty on the decay factor through weak “a priori” assumptions that are verified in the vast majority of practical cases, regardless of the actual dynamics of the deterioration process. To reduce the conservatism of any robust optimization procedure we propose a novel approach based on a data driven reconfigurable min-max model predictive control (MPC). In brief, the synthesis procedure consists of the following steps: 1) the whole set of possible values assumed by the time-varying decay factor is partitioned into a family of small subintervals; 2) the subinterval containing the current and unknown decay factor is identified on the basis of a data-driven test; 3) a supervisor exploits this information to instantly update the current configuration of a reconfigurable min-max MPC strategy. We provide theoretical guarantee of asymptotic stability and satisfaction of the hard constraints on the inventory control policy. The numerical simulations confirm the validity of the proposed method.},

The growth conditions for the uncertain nonlinearities are more inclusive compared to those found in most previous studies. The exponents of high-order systems can take arbitrary rational numbers, which can be represented by two positive odd integers, and they are not all exactly larger than 1. Based on the conventional backstepping idea, the method of adding a power integrator is adopted to design an adaptive controller that renders the closed-loop system stochastically finite-time stable (SFTS). Due to the general nonlinearities, high-order exponents, and stochastic characteristics, the design process requires more effort, so domination instead of cancellation techniques is used.

  abstract     = {Clinical decision support systems (CDSSs) have been widely utilized to support the decisions made by cardiologists when detecting and classifying arrhythmia from electrocardiograms. However, forming a CDSS for the arrhythmia classification task is challenging due to the varying lengths of arrhythmias. Although the onset time of arrhythmia varies, previously developed methods have not considered such conditions. Thus, we propose a framework that consists of 1) local and global extraction and 2) local-global information fusion with attention to enable arrhythmia detection and classification within a constrained input length. The framework’s performance was evaluated in terms of 10-class and 4-class arrhythmia detection, focusing on identifying the onset and ending point of arrhythmia episodes and their duration using the MIT-BIH arrhythmia database (MITDB) and the MIT-BIH atrial fibrillation database (AFDB). Duration, episode, and Dice score performances resulted in overall F1-scores of 96.45%, 82.05%, and 96.31% on the MITDB and 97.57%, 98.31%, and 97.45% on the AFDB, respectively. The results demonstrated statistically superior performance compared to those of the benchmark models. To assess the generalization capability of the proposed method, an MITDB-trained model and MIT-BIH malignant ventricular arrhythmia database-trained model were tested AFDB and MITDB, respectively. Superior performance was attained compared with that of a state-of-the-art model. The proposed method effectively captures both local and global information and dynamics without significant information loss. Consequently, arrhythmias can be detected with greater accuracy, and their occurrence times can be precisely determined, enabling the clinical field to develop more accurate treatment plans based on the proposed method.},

A notable challenge, however, is the tendency of autonomous control strategies to override the surgeon’s direct command occasionally. To address this issue, we propose a novel haptic feedback-based cooperative control strategy that enhances the surgeon’s command of laparoscopic field of view (FOV) movement in robot-assisted laparoscopic surgery. Specifically, we first established a dynamic model of the laparoscope-holding robot, which serves as a link between the movement of the laparoscopic FOV and the surgical instruments to deliver haptic feedback to the surgeon. Next, a motion observer was developed to transform 30 Hz visual feedback into 1 kHz haptic feedback by integrating visual tracking data with kinematic information, ensuring smoother and more continuous haptic feedback. Finally, we propose two distinct collaboration modes: the plane tracking mode (PTM) ensures instruments remain within the laparoscopic image, and the space tracking mode (STM) synchronizes the laparoscope with instrument movement. The laboratory experiments validated the effectiveness of the proposed method in enhancing the cooperative performance of robot-assisted laparoscope systems while animal experiments demonstrated the feasibility of the PTM design.},

  abstract     = {Multimode motion capability in self-reconfigurable wheeled mobile robots (SRWMRs) can be achieved by designing various control modes and the corresponding switching strategies adapted to different motion objectives. While SRWMR is capable of strong traction and moving at a fast speed by utilizing robot creeping (RC) and wheel rolling (WR) modes, respectively, the autonomous RC mode control is challenging due to the parameter definition of mode-switching control (MSC). Therefore, to obtain the main control parameters in an SRWMR, an ROSTDyn Vortex platform is developed to analyze the traction, slippage, and sinkage variation of the modes on varied soil terrains. To autonomously activate the RC mode while the robot is in WR mode, an MSC method is proposed by utilizing fuzzy logic algorithms, taking into account the slip ratio of wheels and their change in rate. Furthermore, for RC mode, to enhance the motion efficiency by adaptively changing the wheelbase length on different types of soil terrains, the control indices on energy consumption and forward movement are presented with the consideration of the defined slip ratio indices. According to the results of simulation experiments, including climbing slopes and escaping from the wheel sinking on the designed soil terrains with varied sloping degrees and stiffness, the autonomous RC control was effectively achieved by the proposed MSC, leading to body traction enhancement. In addition, a 31% reduction in energy consumption was achieved by RC mode with adjustable parameters, compared to the regular RC control.},

However, traditional approaches are constrained by factors, such as the reliance on accurate dynamic models and the risk of operator fatigue during prolonged tasks. Additionally, while data-driven intelligent approaches reduce the need for prior knowledge, they have yet to adequately address the time delay issues inherent in these systems. To overcome these challenges, we introduce the belief state actor-critic (BSAC) method, the first deep reinforcement learning approach tailored for space teleoperation capture tasks within a bilateral control framework. We first establish a generalized agent-based architecture for space teleoperation, shifting decision-making from human operators to autonomous agents. Following a comprehensive analysis of the time delay challenges, we propose the BSAC algorithm, which integrates state augmentation and belief state techniques to mitigate the effects of delays in teleoperated Markov decision processes. Extensive experiments are conducted on the MuJoCo simulation platform, modeling a real hardware system across various scenarios. The learned policies are then successfully transferred and validated in a real-world setup, demonstrating the effectiveness and robustness of BSAC. In summary, our results support the feasibility of agent-based frameworks capable of overcoming time delay challenges in space teleoperation.},

  abstract     = {Ever since the reinforcement learning (RL) method was proposed, the optimal control problem for multiagent systems (MASs) has been intensively explored in light of the limitation of the control resource. However, most of the consequences have overlooked the denial-of-service (DoS) attacks which are often encountered in engineering scenarios. Thus, the current investigation makes the first attempt to explore the optimized containment control issue with a dynamic event-triggered mechanism for heterogeneous stochastic MASs subject to DoS attacks. For the purpose of achieving optimal control, the optimized backstepping technique is developed by resorting to a simplified RL algorithm based on the identifier-critic–actor structure. Then, a novel dynamic event-triggered mechanism is put forward to update the control input signals only at triggering instants so as to reduce the communication burden. Furthermore, by means of stochastic Lyapunov stability theory, it is verified that all signals in the closed-loop system are cooperatively semi-globally uniformly ultimately bounded in probability, in the simultaneous presence of disturbances and DoS attacks. Finally, the validation of the presented strategy is demonstrated via a simulation example.},

A piecewise DREM estimator is designed for the uncertain parameters under conditions strictly weaker than the persistently excited condition, exhibiting the ability to capture the actual system dynamics in finite time. Accurate parameter estimation guarantees the performance of the controller utilizing the DREM estimator. Then, an adaptive optimal controller for any given reference trajectory is designed within the framework of receding horizon control. The system state and control input are theoretically guaranteed to remain bounded during tracking. The adaptive controller is restructured in a nonminimal state space to achieve output feedback without a state estimator.

Meanwhile, the transformation from task space to joint space is built based on the pseudo-inverse of the Jacobi matrix, which avoids the singular value problem brought by computing the inverse kinematics. The adaptive control method utilizes parameter estimation to eliminate the inaccuracy problem brought by the pseudo-inverse of Jacobi matrix transformation. Then, this article provides solutions to the formation control and the formation along the trajectory control. Correspondingly, the Lyapunov analysis process proves the system’s stability and the parameter estimation’s boundedness, which confirms the sufficient conditions for realizing the prescribed-time formation control of the MRSs.

  abstract     = {With the growing demand for robots in emerging fields, such as smart medical and home services, their ability to interact with soft environments has received increased attention. Nevertheless, an overlooked issue is that the inadequate description of soft environments using a linear model may significantly diminish the accuracy of interaction control. In this article, a neural-network-based impedance control framework is proposed for robots to physically interact with soft environments and optimize interaction performance. Specifically, a nonlinear definition of soft environments is introduced based on the Hunt–Crossley (HC) model, with parameter identification utilizing a data-driven technique. Regarding system performance evaluated by a cost function, the determination of interaction behavior described by the impedance model is transformed into an optimal control problem. Moreover, to address model uncertainties, the original optimal control problem is redefined using a modified cost function with a constructed auxiliary system. Then, a critic network is employed to approximate the nonlinear optimal solution, thereby avoiding complicated mathematical derivations. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed impedance adaptation strategy is validated through both simulations and experiments. Numerical results indicate that both the convergent cost and total cost are significantly reduced based on the proposed method compared to the linear-model-based impedance control, particularly for materials with viscoelastic properties, achieving a reduction of up to 30%.},

This article establishes a hierarchical distributed robust formation strategy for multiple quadrotor aircrafts, in which trajectory tracking and attitude formation are, respectively, controlled in different layers. An upper trajectory tracking controller is proposed to generate desired position for lower anti-disturbance attitude formation controller, where a bi-level adaptive terminal sliding mode controller with disturbance observers are, respectively, designed. In lower control layer, the desired velocity is generated by velocity control part to ensure quadrotor aircraft to track desired position while maintaining certain formation shape, whereas the acceleration control part is responsible for driving actual velocity of each quadrotor aircraft to desired velocity. Stability analysis shows that the prescribed formation can be realized if unknown disturbance is bounded and time constants in different layers are selected appropriately. Compared with existing results, the proposed strategy enables multiple complex tasks to be realized in different layers to improve formation accuracy and achieve interference suppression. The effectiveness is verified through both Gazebo simulation and actual experiment.},

First, a multitime scale integrated optimal control (MTSIOC) framework, including a time scale collaborative objective function, is established. Then, multitime scales of nonlinear systems are coordinated to the fast time scale to ensure real-time optimization and control. Second, to address the problem of low accuracy in predicting fast time scale model driven by the slow time scale data information, a data-knowledge-driven prediction model is introduced to predict the future dynamics of the system at the fast time scale. Furthermore, a knowledge compensation strategy is designed to supplement missing fast time scale specific information. Third, a collaborative optimization algorithm is utilized to solve the setpoints and control laws simultaneously. Besides, the convergence of the data and knowledge-driven prediction model and stability of DK-MTSIOC are proved.

Then, a new proportional delay differential inequality (PDDI) is established through norm definition and Lipschitz condition for the vector form MCNNs mentioned-above. Several algebraic forms of synchronization criteria for the system proposed are achieved by applying the new PDDI. Each of these criteria is represented by only one inequality, rather than in the form of components, which facilitates validation. Compared to the commonly used method for constructing Lyapunov functionals in studying MCNNs, it is more concise. Ultimately, numerical examples are used to inspect the results acquired, and the GPS of one example is applied in image encryption and decryption.

In each strategy, an iterative learning estimation law and a control law are designed individually. Using these two strategies, both unknown parameter estimation and target trajectory tracking are achieved simultaneously in finite iterations. A recursion-based biaxial nonlinear convergence analysis method is proposed to establish strict proofs for the finite-iteration convergence. In addition, the necessary number of iterations for zero-error tracking performance is derived through a detailed analysis of the evolutionary dynamics at different time points. Thus, a comprehensive design and analysis framework is established for FILC. Illustrative simulation examples are presented to verify the theoretical results.},

The algorithm also features a batch adaptive bidirectional expansion mechanism, enabling the simultaneous extension of multiple nodes within joint space. Leveraging CIN for batch collision estimation, CIMAP accelerates the discovery of feasible paths. Additionally, CIMAP includes a phased path optimization mechanism that identifies local shortcuts through CIN, improving path efficiency. A geometric collision checker ensures safety, performing necessary repairs when required. To assess CIMAP’s effectiveness in continuous motion planning, we compared its performance against four existing algorithms (CN-RRT, B-RRT, GB-RRT*, and NPB-RRT*-DC) across various obstacle scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that CIMAP achieves an average motion planning time of under 0.7 s, improving planning efficiency by at least 89% compared to the baseline algorithms, while maintaining shorter path lengths.},

However, insufficient attention has been paid to how decision-makers (DMs) interact and to the utility they derive from such social interactions. Therefore, a consensus decision process considering social interaction probability and individual utility is proposed. First, this article explores the direct and indirect social interaction patterns among DMs. A quantum-like Bayesian network (BN) is constructed within the SN environment and combined with similarity effect to infer the probabilities of social interactions. Second, individual utility functions are developed based on two dimensions: 1) decision outcomes and 2) social interaction gains. Third, a two-stage consensus feedback model is proposed. It matches reference opinions by assessing the necessity of establishing new SRs and uses adaptive feedback coefficients to balance group consensus with individual utility. Finally, an illustrative example verifies the feasibility of the proposed model. Subsequent comparisons and simulations further demonstrate its effectiveness and advantages.},

  abstract     = {To address the classification problem of short time-window steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEP), a novel deep-convolutional neural network (CNN) fused with residual squeeze and excitation blocks (RSEs) and multiscale convolutions is proposed. Given the difficulty in distinguishing frequency domain features of short time-window signals, AttentCNN-Multiscale begins with a filter bank (FB)-based time-domain feature extraction module. The FB comprises several sixth-order Butterworth filters with varying bandpass ranges. Then the feature tensors extracted by these filters are aggregated using a CNN with RSEs. For further feature learning, four 2-D CNNs and a multiscale convolution module are employed, with the final output generated through an adaptive fully connected layer. To demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of AttentCNN-Multiscale, extensive experiments and comparisons are conducted on two large public datasets and our dataset. Additionally, a novel bionic intelligent soft gripper is designed and integrated with the proposed AttentCNN-Multiscale network to form a closed-loop system, enabling different grasping functionalities for various objects and demonstrating the application potential of the network in medical rehabilitation.

  abstract     = {Redundant manipulators have shown great potential in the application of robots. These manipulators possess additional degrees of freedom beyond what is essential for completing specific tasks, presenting an opportunity to optimize energy usage. However, the existence of additional degrees of freedom also brings control challenges. Due to the ability to address problems of time-varying tracking, zeroing neural network (ZNN) is gradually widely used in the control of redundant manipulators. Discrete models are often used in engineering, and the sampling gap selected during discretization is an important factor that affects the tracking precision. Large sampling gaps require less computational consumption but yield lower tracking precision, whereas small sampling gaps result in higher precision but at a greater computational cost. In this article, a minimum energy consumption scheme (MECS) for the time-varying tracking control task of redundant manipulators is presented first. By applying the ZNN design formula, the continuous ZNN (CZNN) model is established to solve the MECS. Subsequently, Euler discretization formula is utilized to transform the CZNN model into its discrete form, known as the discrete ZNN (DZNN) model. Then a dual-input-single-output fuzzy control system is designed to obtain suitable sampling gaps. The fuzzy-control-aided ZNN (FCAZNN) model enables redundant manipulators to track desired paths with the expected precision. Finally, a series of experiments are carried out in this article to demonstrate the advantages of FCAZNN model, including both computer simulations and physical experiments.},

  abstract     = {In this article, the cooperative control issue is investigated for multitrain system with actuator saturation and state constraints. Considering the uncertainty of the high-speed train dynamics model and the nonstrict repetition of the operating process, a robust adaptive iterative learning control (RAILC) method is proposed for multitrain system cooperative control, where a control-based nonlinear auxiliary system is introduced to realize the finite-time compensation of train actuator saturation. Furthermore, a novel barrier RAILC (BRAILC) method is developed to achieve actively speed and position state constraints, which can ensure the multitrain system maintaining operates within the safe range. As the best of the author’s knowledge, this is the first time that the robust control and adaptive iterative learning control (AILC) are applied in a multitrain system. The Lyapunov function and composite energy function (CEF) are used to analyze the system convergence along the time and iteration axis, respectively. In the time axis of each iteration, the speed and position tracking errors of multiple high-speed train are convergent, and the system state is constrained, thus the proposed controller is reliable in engineering. Furthermore, through iterative learning law, the speed and position tracking error will converge to zero along the iteration axis, which gives the system the ability to intelligently utilize historical data. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed control method is demonstrated through numerical simulations using data from China railway high-speed 380B (CRH380B) train.},

To address those issues, this article introduces a decision-making, path planning, and tracking integrated predictive control method (DMIC). First, DMIC incorporates vehicle actuation system characteristics, road conditions, and environmental information to design a dynamic characteristic-based risk indicator, which is applied to design different control modes. DMIC then applies continuous activation functions to activate optimized states and control inputs under various control modes, forming an integrated event-triggered continuous decision-making objective function. Afterward, DMIC employs the receding horizon optimization to calculate the front-wheel steering angle and wheel torques based on the integrated predictive model and time-varying constraints. Verification on a driver-in-the-loop (DiL) platform demonstrates that DMIC can accurately and smoothly switch among different optimization states, ensuring crash avoidance with arbitrary approaching vehicles under varying road conditions, thereby maintaining smooth vehicle responses, enhancing the driving stability and ride comfort, while meeting real-time and robustness requirements.},

Based on minimum velocity norm optimization criterion, the problem of motion generation for distributed multimanipulator system in obstacles environment is transformed into a time-varying quadratic programming problem.

Pretraining reinforcement learning (PRL) enables robots to adapt quickly to various tasks by exploiting reusable skills. The existing PRL methods often rely on datasets and human expert knowledge, struggle to discover diverse and dynamic skills, and exhibit generalization and adaptability to different types of robots and downstream tasks. This article proposes a novel PRL algorithm based on the central motor system mechanisms, which can discover diverse and dynamic skills without relying on data and expert knowledge, effectively enabling robots to tackle different types of downstream tasks. Inspired by the cerebellum’s role in balance control and skill storage within the central motor system, an intrinsic fused reward is introduced to explore dynamic skills and eliminate dependence on data and expert knowledge during pretraining. Drawing from the basal ganglia’s function in motor programming, a discrete skill encoding method is designed to increase the diversity of discovered skills, improving the performance of complex robots in challenging environments. Furthermore, incorporating the basal ganglia’s role in motor regulation, a skill activity function is proposed to generate skills at varying dynamic levels, thereby improving the adaptability of robots in multiple downstream tasks. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm has been demonstrated through simulation experiments on four different morphological robots across multiple downstream tasks.},

This article explores the stochastic LQ optimal control problem, which includes control-dependent multiplicative noise and delays, along with quadratic constraint. Through the application of duality theory, we streamline the optimal control problem is reduced to a parameterized, unconstrained stochastic LQ control problem incorporating delays. By solving the Riccati-ZXL equation, the optimal control and cost function are explicitly formulated. Notably, the optimal parameter is determined by solving a semi-definite programming (SDP) problem. The main contribution is presenting the optimal control as a nonlinear function of both the initial state and the state’s conditional expectation.

Then, a backstepping-based robust adaptive controller is developed for each agent to exponentially track the reference trajectory. By resorting to the Lyapunov stability theory, the developed robust seeking strategies drive all agents’ actions to the NE exponentially. Moreover, considering the circumstance that only the information of the agent’s action is available for control law design, an adaptive output-feedback NE seeking strategy is further developed by constructing K-filters to estimate the immeasurable states.

Despite leveraging visual and auditory data, current models demonstrate RGB bias in feature prioritization, as evidenced by explainability analyzes, thereby limiting their generalization for behavioral understanding. Additionally, modality inconsistency and inefficient fusion mechanisms impair model transparency and training stability. To bridge these gaps, this study proposes modality-aligned preprocessing (VAJ) that structurally unifies visual-auditory features through conflict resolution and input optimization, explicitly suppressing color dominance while enhancing interpretable feature representations. Complementing this, we design DTVDS, an interpretable detection framework integrating knowledge distillation to transfer distilled behavioral insights from a cumbersome teacher network to an efficient student model. This dual strategy not only addresses computational overhead but also clarifies decision logic through simplified inference pathways. Evaluations on XD-Violence and UCF-Crime benchmarks demonstrate superior performance, with AP (89.64%) and AUC (88.35%) outperforming existing methods. Qualitative evaluations further validate interpretability, revealing modality-coherent attention maps and human-aligned rationale visualization.

  abstract     = {Most industrial equipment works under variable conditions, variable conditions would increase the within-class difference and reduce the cross-class difference of fault samples. The existing methods mainly consider steady speed scenarios and the global domain adaptation while ignoring the within-class and cross-class distribution alignment, the fault distribution variation leads to the deterioration of diagnosis performance. In this article, a self-supervised pseudo-label learning-enabled (SPL) cross-domain diagnosis method is proposed for fault diagnosis under time-varying speeds. Specifically, the Cauthy maximum mean-square discrepancy is designed for global distribution-level feature alignment by reducing the domain discrepancy. The pseudo-label training and consistency regularization are established for decision boundary adjustment by optimizing the probability distribution difference between the target domain and its perturbed output. Besides, uncertainty-reweighted class confusion minimization is introduced in within-class and cross-class distribution alignment to decrease negative transfer caused by huge within-class discrepancies and small cross-class differences, which can effectively improve the diagnosis accuracy of the hard-to-identify confusion samples. Experiments on time-varying fault diagnosis tasks show the superior performance of the proposed method. The proposed SPL framework improves average diagnosis accuracies by at least 8%.},

  abstract     = {Protein complexes play a crucial role in regulating various biological processes that govern cell activities. Numerous computational algorithms have been proposed to identify protein complexes from protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks. However, many of these algorithms face limitations in effectively leveraging multiview biological information of proteins, restricting their ability to capture the intricate characteristics of protein complexes in PPI networks. While deep learning-based algorithms have significantly advanced the identification of protein complexes, they often integrate graph representation learning techniques into traditional clustering algorithms without explicitly capturing the dependency between protein embeddings and resulting complexes. To address these issues, we present a multiview fusion neural network, named FMvPCI, for protein complex identification via fuzzy clustering. In FMvPCI, we introduce a novel multiview graph convolution encoder to effectively manipulate and fuse the biological information of proteins from different perspectives. Subsequently, the optimization of FMvPCI incorporates our expectations about protein complexes through the concept of fuzzy clustering. This approach unifies the embeddings of proteins and their cluster memberships within a coherent framework. Leveraging a heuristic search strategy, FMvPCI can discover overlapping protein complexes based on the cluster memberships of proteins. A series of experiments on five different PPI networks collected from two species have been conducted to evaluate the performance of FMvPCI by comparing it with state-of-the-art identification algorithms, and the results demonstrate the superior performance of FMvPCI by significantly improving the identification accuracy for protein complexes.},

By incorporating such irrationality, it proves that under certain conditions, underweighting probabilities improves the expected convergence speed while overweighting probabilities reduces it. Second, these new results are applied to discuss the expected convergence speed to the stochastically stable Nash equilibrium (SSNE) set in potential games with a typical irrationality model, namely, probability sensitivity.

In this study, we aim to improve training efficiency by exploring the intrinsic relationship between sample efficiency and stability. To achieve this, we propose the Stability Contribution Index (SI), which assigns sample priorities based on their impact on stability and employs them to weight the value loss, thereby promoting stable learning and improving efficiency. The effectiveness of our method is validated through comprehensive experiments on two distinct benchmarks: 1) the continuous control domain DMControl and 2) the discrete control environment ProcGen. Compatible with both off-policy and on-policy DRL algorithms, our approach significantly improves sample efficiency and overall performance by fostering greater stability during training. Additionally, experimental results show that our method outperforms well-established sample-efficient reinforcement learning techniques across multiple settings.},

  abstract     = {Learning from crowds aims to train a robust and generalizable model with a noisy crowdsourced dataset from multiple annotators. Due to its simplicity and practicality, the target model and label correction mechanism are co-trained in a parameter-coupled manner. However, this end-to-end training suffers from the inherent flaws in data. The crowdsourced dataset is naturally noisy and redundant: 1) some annotations may violate the annotator’s transition matrix and mislead the training procedure and 2) the size of the annotation set is much larger than the instance set, and some instances may be backpropagated multiple times without performance gain. To address these issues, we propose a sample selection method called CrowdSketch for deep learning from crowds. Specifically, to mitigate the annotation noise, we find possibly high-quality data with small local contrastive loss (clean) and high divergence loss between prediction probabilities (important) on a two-branch network. After that, to alleviate redundant data, an importance score is developed based on $l_{2}$ -norm of errors. The originality of this work stems from the designed selection criteria and specified two-branch architecture for crowdsourcing. Besides, by removing the noisy data, the risk of nonoptimum in dataset pruning is reduced. Extensive experiments are conducted on real-world crowdsourcing datasets. The experimental results, which show average accuracy improvements of 1.27% on LabelMe and 1.52% on CIFAR-10H, demonstrate the effectiveness of CrowdSketch.},

Such ambiguity and uncertainty can be explained as the random dynamic changes of individual time series and are reflected in the clustering memberships of time-series data. Focusing on these issues, this article proposes a novel algorithm to tackle ambiguity and uncertainty in time-series clustering by capturing their dynamic features under the framework of belief function theory. Specifically, it employs an evidential Markov model for each time series to formalize dynamic features as a transition mass matrix, and an evidential clustering algorithm then derives a credal partition to group the data. Ablation studies validate the effectiveness of each component, and experiments on 128 UCR datasets demonstrate the strong performance of the proposed algorithm.},

First, the approximation characteristics of fuzzy logic systems are employed to design corresponding adaptive fuzzy control laws, which approximate the unknown parts of the system to approximate known values. Then, by utilizing the fuzzy inputs from multiple agents and defined rules, the system adapts to external mismatched disturbances. Next, a novel time-scale function is designed as part of the controller gain. Unlike traditional gain functions, this function ensures the system achieves consensus within a predetermined time while avoiding infinite growth, thereby ensuring the boundedness of the control signals. Introducing this function into the controller, along with the adaptive fuzzy control laws and intermediate control laws, constructs an adaptive control law to achieve control over each agent and achieve PT consensus of the uncertain system. In the controller design, the complexity of proving system stability is reduced by avoiding fractional-order Lyapunov differential inequalities, and each agent has corresponding control parameters.

It can adaptively learn the impedance gain of unknown environment in the presence of uncertain robot dynamic model based on different task properties, simultaneously keeping the tracking error and interaction force optimized and minimized. The ABBFNN controller combines adaptive node increments to approximate uncertain dynamic model and introduces additional global bias and adaptive gain adjustment to improve the approximation accuracy and the rate of convergence significantly. VOIA seamlessly integrates a finely tuned proportional-integral-derivative (PID) variable target stiffness and an impact compensator, ensuring accurate responses to varying environmental conditions and improved disturbance rejection. Moreover, a momentum-based force observer is utilized within the framework for interaction force estimation, eliminating the need for force sensors and simplifying the system. Simulations and experiments validate the effectiveness and practicality of the proposed optimal interaction control framework, demonstrating its potential to propel robots toward interactions with unknown environments.},

This is more general than the existing integration design of fault estimation as well as fault-tolerant control, as it better reveals the interaction between the agent system and its fault estimator. To achieve interactive Stackelberg equilibrium, an auxiliary controller for fault estimator is designed, which exhibits non cooperative properties with the fault-tolerant controller of the agent.

The coefficient matrices of the considered fault signals obey a hidden semi-Markov switching rule, which can encompass the existing actuator and sensor fault models. Further, two critic neural networks are established to obtain approximate solutions of interactive Stackelberg equilibrium online by employing the adaptive dynamic programming technology.

Addressing this problem, a novel model for multilayer networks has been proposed that leverages the underlying graphs derived from edge-transitive association schemes. Then, based on the stability interval originating from the master stability function (MSF) approach for the Rössler system, an optimal point with the most negative MSF value is selected as the most stable point on the Pareto Frontier. Two distinct solution methods for optimizing the synchronizability measure, based on linear programming (LP) and the direct solution, have been provided. The effectiveness of these methods is demonstrated on cycle and hypercube multilayer networks through both analytical results and simulations.},

  abstract     = {This article addresses the practical prescribed-time fault-tolerant tracking control (PFTC) problem for a class of nonlinear systems characterized by uncertain control gains and external disturbances. A novel prescribed-time regulator (PTR) is proposed to construct the controller, thereby achieving the tracking control objective with arbitrary accuracy within the prescribed tracking time. The phenomenon of complete actuator faults is also considered, and a fault-tolerant control strategy with immediate actuator switching is designed to mitigate their impact. Furthermore, a self-regulating control gain based on an error-feedback mechanism is introduced to restrain the control input while improving the overall control performance. To overcome the issue of “complexity explosion” arising from the derivation of virtual controllers, a class of nonlinear filters is designed to estimate the values of the virtual controllers. The PFTC strategy proposed in this article ensures the following: 1) all the signals in the closed-loop system remain bounded; 2) the tracking error is practical prescribed-time tracking stable; and 3) after detection of actuator faults, the tracking error reconverges to the desired range within the prescribed recovery time. Lastly, a simulation example is provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy.},

Making a film trailer by hand is time consuming. However, the emerging artificial intelligence generated content (AIGC) technique has shown significant potential to enhance the efficiency. This article presents a novel model named TVMTrailer, which consists of a text-video generation network (TVGNet) and a video-music generation network (VMGNet). TVGNet employs an encoder-decoder framework, utilizing movie footage and synopses to generate movie trailers. Besides, VMGNet is proposed to generate sound track of our trailer. It combines video and audio features, and uses a transformer model for associative learning to adaptively generate audio clips with features, such as emotion, rhythm and beat. The effectiveness of TVMTrailer is demonstrated through experiment conducted on the proposed dataset and a comprehensive collection of over two thousand video-audio pairs from classic movies.},

Two problems are addressed in this article: 1) optimal consensus and 2) optimal resource allocation, in which both the local objective function and the coupled equality constraint vary with time. The proposed unified consensus algorithm achieves the predefined-time optimization by leveraging the predefined-time stability theory under mild assumptions. Specifically, by transforming into the Lagrange dual problem, the optimal resource allocation problem is solved by the unified consensus algorithm from the perspective of dual variables. It is worth mentioning that the proposed unified consensus algorithm does not rely on the second-order information of objective functions, including the partial derivative of the gradient concerning time and the Hessian information.

  abstract     = {Recently, the minimum cost consensus model (MCCM) has received considerable attention in group decision-making. However, the prevailing trend in early MCCMs is mainly centered on model-centric approaches, which would produce unit adjustment cost and individual options. With the widespread adoption of information technologies and the availability of extensive datasets, accompanied by the advancement of machine learning, constructing MCCMs based on data-driven and machine learning methods, such as neural network (NN), is more practical and reliable. Additionally, considering the inherent variability in models and data, granular computing (GrC) and GrC-based NN can effectively resolve uncertainty. Therefore, this article presents an MCCM based on GrC and online reviews. First, the granular NN (GNN) is trained with online reviews to obtain decision-makers’ weights and unit adjustment costs based on the user information. Subsequently, through assessing the sentiment polarity of decision-makers’ reviews, their opinions are elicited and dynamically adjusted in the form of intervals. Furthermore, the bilateral granular consensus is defined to characterize the impact of decision-makers’ preferences on consensus from both sides. Finally, group decision-making on movies and television productions on douban.com is conducted using the proposed method. Sensitivity analysis demonstrates the flexibility of our consensus approach, and the comparative analysis shows its effectiveness.},

To increase the profits of taxis, proper cruising routes should be recommended to help vacant taxis find passengers faster. Besides, the cruising tendencies of taxi drivers differ due to the personal cognitions. To this end, we propose a hybrid learning framework-based profit-maximizing personalized route (PMPR) recommendation method for vacant taxis (HL-PPRRM) to obtain and recommend the PMPRs for vacant taxis. HL-PPRRM consists of the local learning on vacant taxis and the global learning on cloud server. Specifically, vacant taxis locally learn the historical cruising routes to predict the personalized routes, while the cloud server globally learns the occupied records to predict the future taxi demand. The obtained PMPRs tally with the cruising tendencies of taxi drivers roughly, and the occupied durations of taxis can be effectively prolonged when vacant taxis cruise along PMPRs. Extensive simulations and comparisons demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed HL-PPRRM, i.e., with the hybrid learning framework, the profits of taxis can be significantly increased, and the average displacement error of PMPRs is very small.},

The system integrates a driving reversal device (DRD) and a hip energy storage walking device (HESWD) to improve performance. The DRD allows a single motor to drive both hips during the movement phase, while the HESWD stores negative work generated by the human hip joint and uses it as positive work during the “blank” phase of underactuated walking. Specialized motor trajectory planning and optimization are used to meet the active assistance phase requirements. A radial basis function (RBF) neural network-based trajectory tracking control method adapts to changes in human gait. Treadmill experiments demonstrate that the tracking error is below 0.4146°.

  abstract     = {Fraudulent claims in the automobile industry pose a significant threat to the financial stability of insurance companies and erode the trust between policyholders and insurers. Organized fraud, which involves intricate schemes and multiple parties, presents a substantial challenge in detection due to imbalanced datasets. While existing techniques such as over-sampling and under-sampling have been proposed to address this issue, they often lead to overfitting, loss of information, and reduced accuracy. However, assigning a suspicious label to each policyholder is more changeable, as it can identify potential risks and prevent fraudulent activities before they occur. In response to these challenges, we propose a novel heuristic approach called Organized Fraud detection with Graph theory and Poisson process (OrFGP) that identifies suspiciously organized fraud groups within an accident network and provides credibility levels for accidents and associated individuals. We first demonstrate that car accidents follow a Poisson random process. We then combine this process with graph theory to introduce an accident network. In the network, our objective is to identify regular behavior between accidents, which, based on the stochastic nature of accidents, can indicate organized fraud. OrFGP uses probabilistic concepts in conjunction with local network connectivity metrics to evaluate the credibility of accidents and individuals. The results indicate that OrFGP outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, particularly in imbalanced datasets. In fact, OrFGP achieves an accuracy of 98% and improves the F1-score by at least 3%.},

To improve the limitations of existing algorithms, this study proposes a new process monitoring algorithm named Jarque-Bera-based ANCA. This new algorithm makes many improvements to ANCA scheme, and the designed loss function combines the influence of both kurtosis and skewness on the data distribution, which not only maintains the advantages of the ANCA algorithm in solving nonlinear problems, but also provides superior monitoring performance in non-Gaussian processes. Furthermore, the superior performance of the proposed new algorithm is verified through simulations using non-Gaussian and nonlinear numerical examples, the Tennessee Eastman process, and catalytic cracking units.},

It is proven that the semi-global output consensus problem can be addressed through the proposed controller. Different from the existing work, the consensus protocol presented in this article further saves communicational and computational resources, because the SET mechanisms are deployed to each channel of MASs which merely need to discretely monitor the event-triggered (ET) conditions at sampling instants and transmit the information at triggered time. Besides, the Zeno behavior can be trivially prevented. Finally, a simulation example is depicted to demonstrate the validity of the proposed theoretical results.},

  abstract     = {This article introduces a finite-time adaptive bipartite consensus tracking control algorithm leveraging an improved nonlinear mapping (NM), capable of implementing the prescribed asymmetric full-state constraint requirements for nonlinear heterogeneous multiagent systems (MASs) under actuator deception attacks. First, a locally optimal bipartition strategy is proposed in this article to enable bipartite consensus tracking control within unbalanced directed graph. Unlike most previous full-state-constrained controls employing the barrier Lyapunov function (BLF), the proposed algorithm is derived from building a state-dependent NM function that can achieve one-to-one mapping for the original function and constructing a new coordinate transformation, leading to the solution of full-state-constrained performance control without the feasibility conditions on the control signals. By means of the proposed practical finite-time stability criterion, the novel design aims at constructing finite-time controllers that can ensure the existence and nonsingularity of the finite-time term in each control signal, which are oblivious in the existing results on finite time control. What’s more, the designed controller even under actuator deception attack achieves that: 1) the bipartite consensus tracking errors converge to a small area containing zero in a finite time; 2) the prescribed asymmetric full-state constraints are obeyed. At last, the availability of the proposed design solution is clarified by virtue of single-link robot systems.},

  abstract     = {In this article, the distributed optimal containment (DOC) control of wheeled mobile robots (WMRs) is investigated via adaptive dynamic programming. To begin with, a novel performance index function which contains containment errors and their derivatives is designed for each following WMR without requiring the discount factor, which simplifies the controller design process and enhances the practicality of the control method. Subsequently, the DOC control of WMRs is formulated as a differential graphical game whose Nash equilibrium can be formed by using the optimal responses of all following WMRs. Moreover, a critic-only structure is built to obtain an approximate DOC control law, which provides a solution for the coupled Hamilton-Jacobi–Bellman equation of each following WMR. Stability analysis demonstrates that the containment error of each following WMR is uniformly ultimately bounded. Finally, a group of WMRs are utilized to verify the effectiveness of the present DOC control scheme.},

In the literature, this problem has been widely studied by assuming that the communications between a plant and a diagnostic agent, i.e., a diagnoser, are reliable and instantaneous. However, for a networked system, the information generated by a plant is transmitted through a shared communication network such that communication delays and losses are inevitable. This article formulates and studies the fault diagnosis problem in networked discrete event systems (NDESs) modeled by labeled Petri nets, where communication delays and losses are considered. Such a problem is also called robust fault diagnosis in this article. An important notion closely related to robust diagnosis, named networked diagnosability, is introduced, indicating that any occurred fault in a NDES is definitely determined after a limited number of observations. For a NDES, a tool called a networked basis diagnoser is excogitated to solve the robust diagnosis problem. A necessary and sufficient condition for verifying the networked diagnosability of a plant is derived by using the developed diagnoser.

  abstract     = {The expansion of blockchain applications, particularly on platforms like Ethereum, brings escalating security challenges as account anonymity provides breeding grounds for criminals to commit crimes and cause significant economic losses. As the mainstream architecture of de-anonymization technology, graph neural networks (GNNs) provide empirical tools for law enforcement agencies to investigate illegal activities. However, the limited expressiveness of current GNNs leads to performance degradation for Ethereum account de-anonymization. To address this challenge, we propose an innovative Local-Global Awareness (LGA) framework, which consists of a Local Structure-Aware (LSA) module and a Global Information-Aware (GIA) module. LSA integrates subgraph-level encoding strategies with local attention to enhance the capture of microscopic interactions. As a complementary measure, GIA introduces global attention to facilitate the understanding of macroscopic information. The LGA framework meticulously captures subgraph-level account behavior patterns at a granular level while simultaneously incorporating global contextual insights, demonstrating higher-level expressive power and receptive fields over conventional GNN. The efficacy of the LGA framework is corroborated by experimental evaluations conducted on the lw-AIG dataset. Our framework achieves exceptional performance, significantly outstripping state-of-the-art GNN-based methods in terms of the micro F1 score metric, with relative improvements ranging from 0.14% to 6.63%. Through its detailed and comprehensive analysis of account interactions, the LGA framework aims to provide a potent solution to the complex security challenges faced in the expanding blockchain landscape.

  abstract     = {The progressions in blockchain technologies have propelled the advancement of the Internet of Things (IoT), particularly the Industrial IoT (IIoT) system, toward a decentralized structure. This shift is driven by the need to address the privacy and security vulnerabilities inherent in centralized organizations. In a blockchain-based IoT system, the IoT nodes are tasked with both mining and data collection activities concurrently. However, due to the limited resources of these nodes, a rational resource allocation mechanism is imperative to maximize social welfare. Insufficient allocation of resources to mining can significantly reduce the overall Hashrate of the blockchain, thereby jeopardizing its security. Conversely, prioritizing resource allocation to mining can diminish the value of collected data, resulting in a decrease in overall social welfare. To tackle these challenges, this article proposes a transaction fee mechanism that levies charges on data consumers based on the resources utilized by the nodes for data collection. The objective is to achieve a balanced allocation of resources between mining and data collection while ensuring the security of the blockchain. Specifically, we model the interactions among the system designer, data consumer, and IoT nodes as a three-stage Stackelberg game. By characterizing the equilibrium of the game, we derive optimal strategies that lead to the maximization of social welfare. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is validated through extensive experimental results.},

Additionally, an extended energy harvesting scheme is introduced to address the limitations of energy storage and supplement during the signal forwarding process. This article aims to design an appropriate filter for estimating the states of the objective 2-D systems. Unlike previous studies that focus on precise filtering at high-costs, this research incorporates an ellipsoidal constraint in a probabilistic sense to describe the dynamics of the estimation errors, which can better meet more filtering requirements and is more intuitive for practical engineering applications. Based on this, sufficient conditions are established by recursive linear matrix inequalities to ensure the existence of such a filter. Furthermore, an optimized algorithm is proposed to minimize the ellipsoidal bound of the estimation error, and a sequence of optimal filter gains is calculated. Finally, a numerical example is provided to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed filtering method.},

First, the considered MJBN is divided into several sub-MJBNs, where signals switch according to irreducible transition probability matrices. Second, the stability of these sub-MJBNs is mapped onto that of deterministic periodic BNs. This transformation facilitates the formulation of a network-structure-based stability criterion for MJBNs by converting the inherently random stability characteristics of the networks into those of deterministic networks. Third, applying this criterion, static pinning control (SPC) is devised to stabilize MJBNs, where effective pinning nodes are identified by finding a feedback vertex set in the corresponding n-vertex digraph. Consequently, this method addresses the challenges associated with large-scale MJBNs effectively. To demonstrate the practical applicability of our theoretical findings, two biological examples are presented.},

Topology is a paramount determinant for characterizing system performance. To bridge the gaps between the topology structure and stabilizability, we propose a technique to achieve the desired independent strongly connected component (iSCC) partition by adding edges to change the topology structure. Besides, based on iSCC partition as the central tool for grasping the stabilizability of node and edge dynamics, it has been proven that the stabilizability realization of first-order multiagent systems directly depends on the topology structure. Furthermore, the relationship between node stabilizability and edge stabilizability is explored from a graph theory perspective through the transformation mechanism from a node digraph to an edge digraph. In particular, the stabilizability results of second-order multiagent systems reveal that the stabilizability of node dynamics and edge dynamics depends not only on the topology, but also on the feedback coefficients $k_{1}, k_{2}$ . Ultimately, simulation experiments are provided to verify the correctness and effectiveness of the proposed control protocol.},

  abstract     = {A key challenge in reinforcement learning is how to guide agents to efficiently explore sparse reward environments. In order to overcome this challenge, the state-of-the-art methods introduce additional intrinsic rewards based on state-related information, such as the novelty of states. Unfortunately, these methods frequently fail in procedurally-generated tasks, where a different environment is generated in each episode so that the agent is not likely to visit the same state more than once. Recently, some exploration methods designed specifically for procedurally-generated tasks have been proposed. However, they still only consider state-related information, which leads to relatively inefficient exploration. In this work, we propose a novel exploration method, which utilizes cross-episode policy-related information and intraepisode state-related information to jointly encourage exploration in procedurally-generated tasks. In term of policy-related information, we first use an imitator-based unbalanced policy diversity to measure the difference between the agent’s current policy and the agent’s previous policies, and then encourage the agent to maximize this difference. In term of state-related information, we encourage the agent to maximize the state diversity within an episode, thereby visiting as many different states as possible in an episode. We show that our method significantly improves sample efficiency over state-of-the-art methods on three challenging benchmarks, including MiniGrid, MiniWorld, and the sparse-reward version of Procgen.},

  abstract     = {For expensive constrained optimization problems (ECOPs), the evaluation of the objective and constraints are both expensive. Due to the low computational cost of the surrogate model and the excellent search capabilities of evolutionary algorithms, surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithms (SAEAs) have become a popular approach for solving ECOPs. When solving ECOPs, the errors in the objective and constraint surrogates will inevitably mislead the direction of evolution, making it difficult to find feasible solutions and avoid local optima. To defeat this issue, we propose an SAEA capable of adjusting the evolutionary direction to search in the correct direction as much as possible. Specifically, the correlation between objective and constraint is first analyzed, and then adaptive adjustments are made based on this correlation to revise the evolutionary direction throughout the three stages of the evolutionary process. For reproduction, an offspring enhanced generation strategy is proposed to generate promising and diverse offspring. For sampling, a dynamic infill sampling criterion is designed to select the most suitable solutions for expensive evaluations, thereby accelerating convergence. Finally, an adaptive environment selection strategy is designed to choose parents with more potential for improvement. The proposed method is evaluated on commonly used benchmark test functions and four engineering examples, with experimental results indicating its superior performance compared to other advanced methods.},

In order to achieve this goal, a fuzzy transfer reservoir learning machine (FT-RLM) is proposed based on the well-known leaky integrator echo state network (LI-ESN). In particular, in order to determine which source domains should be enhanced by the mix-up strategy after reservoir transformation, with the theoretical derivation of the mix-up ratios for source domain selection, FT-RLM begins with the use of the mix-up strategy based on the calculated mix-up ratios for source domain enhancement. After that, in order to deal with uncertain decision boundaries between classes, FT-RLM takes the proposed transfer-learning-based fuzzy classifier called parametric-transfer-based Takagi-Sugeno–Kang fuzzy system (TSK-FS) which is trained on both the enhanced source domains and the target domain. Experimental results on real-world datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed FT-RLM when faced with the above two phenomena in multiple source reservoir transfer learning scenarios under RC-related resource-constrained environments.},

Although a variety of computational algorithms have been proposed to perform accurate clustering analysis on AGs, most of them are incapable of inferring the cluster labels of nodes through links, thus falling short of explaining node behaviors on how to formulate overlapping clusters. Moreover, the vast amount of links considerably decreases the computation efficiency if they are explicitly taken into account for AG clustering. To overcome this problem, we present a novel variational Bayesian learning model, which avoids generating a complete AG by only simulating the generative process of its skeleton with the prior knowledge on the cluster labels of links. When addressing the inference problem, we develop an efficient algorithm, namely, LCAAG, for determining the optimal cluster labels of nodes by estimating local community structures of links. The convergence of LCAAG has been proved theoretically. Compared with several state-of-the-art algorithms, LCAAG has demonstrated its promising performance in terms of both accuracy and scalability on five different scaled benchmark datasets.

  abstract     = {Unbalanced classification problems have attracted significant academic attention due to their widespread existence in the real world. The lack of recognition accuracy of minority class samples and the “curse of dimensionality” are two major difficulties in unbalanced classification problems. Existing unbalanced classification methods run the risk of losing the original feature information and are prone to bias toward the majority class. Multiform optimization is famous for capturing useful knowledge from alternative forms to help solve the original task. Motivated by this, this article introduces a multiform evolutionary framework that addresses the issue of multiobjective feature selection in unbalanced classification scenarios. It aims to utilize the advanced experience of selecting features on balanced datasets to assist in the search for feature subsets that can more accurately identify minority classes on the original dataset. Specifically, a knowledge transfer strategy is proposed to draw on the search experience of the auxiliary task from the oversampled dataset to help the cost-sensitive learning task based on the original dataset jump out of the local optimum. In addition, an offspring repairing mechanism is proposed to filter redundant features by considering the frequency of selected features. Experimental results on 23 real-world benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed method can select fewer features and achieve better classification results compared to six state-of-the-art multiobjective feature selection algorithms and three classical oversampling algorithms. Furthermore, the difference in performance of four base classifiers is investigated through a series of comparative experiments.},

Since the DoS attacks block the signal transmission between agents, the leader’s states and output are inaccessible to the followers, a distributed command governor is designed to estimate them. To avoid the collisions among the agents or between the agents and the dynamics obstacles, the integral-type barrier Lyapunov function (BLF) is employed to develop a secure collision-free adaptive fuzzy formation controller based on the designed governor. It is shown that the developed secure collision-free formation control approach can not only achieve the formation objective, but also avoid the collisions under DoS attacks. Finally, we apply the developed secure collision free formation control method to multiple Euler-Lagrangian (EL) systems, the simulation and comparison results verify its effectiveness.},

In practical scenarios, it is noteworthy that accurately modeling the system matrix is often challenging, and traditional detection methods frequently result in false positives and missed detections. Therefore, this article introduces a novel approach for accurately detecting FDI attacks in the presence of parameter uncertainties. Assuming that system parameters reside within a convex polytope, three distinct FDI attack detection estimators with varying performance levels are proposed. Subsequently, a convex optimization problem is established to obtain the necessary gains for the detectors. The results demonstrate that the proposed detection method achieves higher accuracy under uncertain parameters. Furthermore, the method allows for flexible selection based on application-specific requirements, whether prioritizing accuracy or efficiency. Finally, the effectiveness and applicability of the proposed techniques are demonstrated through simulation examples using the F-404 aerospace engine system model.},

Then, a cost function is formulated for this observer, and the gain of the correction term is optimized in a data-driven way to enhance the accuracy of the estimation. Based on the auxiliary variables, a distributed predictive controller is presented. Unlike existing control schemes, the proposed controller compensates for the delayed data in an active way, and the rolling prediction process is carried out in a distributed manner, facilitated by the designed auxiliary variables.

  abstract     = {Flexible and reconfigurable manufacturing systems with independent multiskilled cells are pivotal for mass customization under volatile demand, yet internal/external uncertainties persistently disrupt planning, scheduling, and execution (PSE), causing idle time and workflow instability. This study proposes a hybrid synchronization framework with hierarchical real-time data feedback to address heterogeneous demand-capacity synchronization (HDCS), reconciling demand volatility, system reconfigurability, and dynamic human capacity. The framework first adopts the ticket-enabled queuing mechanism of the graduation intelligent manufacturing system (GiMS) to enable seamless PSE integration, ensuring resilient operations. Next, it hybridizes a global optimization model with local adjustment mechanisms, utilizing multigranularity data to balance global optimality and local practicality under uncertainty. Finally, it implements a human-cyber-physical digitalization architecture to establish smart human-machine collaborative assembly. Validated through a case study, the method enhances cost-efficiency by 1.7%, punctuality by 29.5%, and resource utilization by 3.9% compared to conventional rescheduling strategies, demonstrating superior adaptability to uncertainties. The results validate its effectiveness in advancing human-centric smart manufacturing aligned with Industry 5.0 objectives, offering an integrated solution to HDCS challenges through synergistic coordination of hierarchical control, hybrid optimization, and human-machine collaboration.},

An intelligent selector and an intelligent bidder (IB) are designed for each consumer to perform operation selection and determine the corresponding bid price, respectively. A job shop agent is established to collect bids and allocate resource through winner determination. To assist the IB to learn the correlation between consumers and the multi-agent job shop scheduling environment without revealing preferences, a graph neural network is adopted to extract observations. A reward function based on critic value guides the negotiation process among IBs. Extensive computational experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves high social welfare outcomes.

Then, a novel asymmetric Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional (LKF) is constructed for analysing the exponential stability of SSs with time-delay.

It should also be pointed out that the obtained criteria can loose some restrictions of the existing results and have wider applications. Particularly, we allow the cumulative strength of multiple impulses over a period to be greater than 1, which is more applicable to some extent compared with most of the existing literatures.

A basic reproduction number dependent on both the viral transmission state and public opinion dynamics is constructed to analyze the conditions for virus eradication or pandemic persistence. These findings indicate that during severe epidemics, people are very concerned about the epidemic, leading to an increased vigilance, thereby significantly slowing the spread of the virus. On the other hand, during milder epidemics, people do not respond adequately to the threat of the epidemic, and thus are less vigilant and have less impact on the spread of the virus.

To solve this multiobjective problem, a learning competitive swarm optimizer (LCSO) is proposed that integrates two novel mechanisms: 1) environmental-competitive learning through probability models capturing product-task relationships and 2) comprehensive learning utilizing reinforcement learning to guide local search based on nondominated solution states. The hybrid approach balances convergence speed and solution diversity by combining solution-space and policy-space learning perspectives. Experimental results demonstrate LCSO’s superior performance over compared methods, achieving 25% improvement in energy-time tradeoff compared to other state-of-the-art multiobjective optimizers in solving related problems. The proposed method particularly excels in optimizing complex energy-time tradeoffs while maintaining better solution diversity and convergence across different problem scales.},

PMs belonging to the same machine group should have identical processing capacities. Additionally, all PMs are designated with downward processing compatibility. This means that the wafers requiring relatively low pattern precision can be processed by the PMs used to deal with high pattern precision. After executing a photolithography process, a circuit pattern is transferred from an auxiliary resource called a reticle onto the wafer surface. Moreover, when processing wafers with different reticle and processing environment requirements, the machine setup is necessary. With those complex processing requirements, the objective is to minimize the difference between the longest and shortest working time of PMs so as to balance the workloads among all PMs. To do so, a mixed-integer linear programming model is built and then solved by using CPLEX for the small-sized problem. For medium- and large-sized problems, a designed estimation of distribution algorithm integrating a Kmeans clustering is constructed to improve the productivity of the photolithography area. Comparison results show that the proposed method outperforms the compared algorithms regardless of problem sizes.},

Then, based on the new SETBTS, the generalized bumpless transfer criteria are given to state the control amplitude level at the switching instants. Next, switching Lyapunov functional method is utilized to obtain sufficient criteria to ensure the globally uniformly exponential stability and the bumpless transfer performance for the considered systems.

First, an algorithm is developed that utilizes state feedback and projection operations, along with auxiliary variables, to precisely estimate the optimal state and its derivatives in a distributed manner. Furthermore, the decision variable is subject to several inequality constraints, and there are no restrictions on the initial value. Taking into account the impact of nonlinearity resulting from drift coefficients, diffusion coefficients, and external disturbances on the system’s stability, the existing works cannot be directly applied to this study. Through the utilization of the Itô formula and convex analysis, a novel analytical approach has been demonstrated to establish the asymptotic convergence of decision variable to the optimal value in mean square. This method distinguishes itself from the conventional convergence analysis techniques.

The energy required for signal transmission can be supplied through EH techniques deployed at sensors and relays. This study focuses on designing a recursive state estimator aimed at guaranteeing accurate estimation performance. An upper bound for the estimation error covariance matrix is formulated via two recursive equations, and subsequently minimized by properly designing the estimation gain.

Recent advancements in deep-learning-based image compression have fostered semantic compression between machines. However, the deployment of an overparameterized encoder on Internet of Things (IoT) devices remains a challenge due to their restricted computing and storage capabilities. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel approach named compressed sensing (CS)-based asymmetric semantic image compression (CS-ASIC), explicitly designed for resource-constrained AIoT systems. This asymmetric semantic compression scheme intends to surpass the limitations of IoT devices, thereby facilitating efficient semantic compression for machine vision tasks. CS-ASIC notably includes a lightweight front encoder founded on deep image CS techniques, which utilizes rich image priors to learn measurement matrices for sampling. In tandem, a deep iterative decoder is designed cooperatively with the linear encoder offloaded at the server to enhance image reconstruction and semantic analysis across various semantic analysis tasks. Furthermore, we introduce a groundbreaking lossy CS semantic rate-distortion theoretical framework that justifies a compromise in rate for extended semantic distortion. Extensive experimental results underscore the superiority of the proposed CS-ASIC concerning the signal-semantic rate-distortion tradeoff, and its lower encoding complexity over existing codecs in an AIoT simulation environment.},

  abstract     = {Video object detection is essential for human-interaction applications, including bimanual manipulation sensing (BMS). The effects of video detection in practical applications still need to be improved, as they are restricted by long-range spatiotemporal dependency analysis. How do humans sense bimanual manipulation in videos, especially for deteriorated clips? We argue that humans analyze the current clips based on earlier memory, namely, long-term spatial and temporal dependencies (LTSTD). However, most existing methods have yet to report significant results, as the limited exploration of these dependencies limits them. Developing an easy-to-integrate module is generally preferred for future applications rather than designing a complex end-to-end framework. Therefore, we propose a dynamic neighborhood feature multiplexing mechanism for online video object detection in this article, which is better at learning LTSTD in flexible and robust ways, boosting existing detection results, called DNFM. Specifically, we develop dynamic memory enhancement neural networks for better long-term feature aggregation with negligible additional computation costs. We multiplex each frame feature to aggregate key enhanced representations under the guidance of dynamic memory recall. The DNFM contributes to various famous detectors in BMS and other challenging detection tasks, and particular attention has been devoted to “low-quality” frame detection. Experimental results show that, while achieving state-of-the-art detection performance, DNFM clearly illustrates the easy-to-integrate operation for boosting the video object detection results.},

  abstract     = {Trust region policy optimization (TRPO) is an iterative reinforcement learning algorithm that both maximizes a surrogate objective based on a generalized advantage function and enforces a trust region constraint between two consecutive policies based on the Kullback-Leibler divergence in each iteration. On the one hand, its surrogate objective only approximates the positive theoretical improvement and thus relaxes the theoretical guarantee. One the other hand, currently, TRPO is approximately solved via a linear approximation for its objective and a quadratic approximation for its constraint, which results in an upper bound for the linear search of the step size. However, this solution strategy does not provide a lower bound for the step size search. Intuitively, a lower bound could be determined manually, but such a setting has no physical meaning. To this end, we present an alternative solution in this article, which is to exchange the objective and the constraint in TRPO according to reciprocal optimization technique, and then derive a reciprocal TRPO. Applying a similar approximation solution of TRPO to our reciprocal TRPO produces a lower bound for the step size search that has a physical interpretation for improving the surrogate objective or return. Further, we aggregate the original TRPO with this reciprocal TRPO to construct a twin TRPO, whose step size has a lower bound from our reciprocal TRPO and an upper bound from TRPO, to facilitate the policy optimization and achieve a least return improvement. Extensive experiments on twelve benchmark environments show that our twin TRPO is superior to six existing techniques: the original TRPO, proximal policy optimization, off-policy TRPO and two entropy regularized TRPOs, as well as our reciprocal TRPO.

  abstract     = {Based on output triggering, an adaptive prescribed-time tracking control strategy is proposed for a class of uncertain strict-feedback nonlinear systems with unknown control gains in this article. The nondifferentiability of the virtual control signals is identified as the most prominent design difficulty in this research. In order to solve the above difficulty, a new fuzzy state observer is built by using triggered output signal and fuzzy logic systems (FLSs), which in turn generates alternative continuous states. Simultaneously, the estimated signals are utilized to design virtual control signals, making certain that the virtual control signals have a well-defined first derivative. On this basis, by introducing a time-varying constraint function, a new adaptive prescribed-time fuzzy controller is constructed, so that the controller can still be applied to continuously operating systems after the predefined time. Additionally, we introduce the command filtering technique to mitigate repeated differentiation of virtual control signals during the backstepping design process. Combining the constructed logarithmic Lyapunov functions and bounded control technique with backstepping design, it is possible to guarantee that the established adaptive prescirbed-time event-triggered control method satisfies the following: 1) within the predefined time, the tracking error converges to the user-specified region and 2) the full range of signals involved in the closed-loop system is kept bounded.At last, the results of the single-link arm simulation example verify the reasonableness and effectiveness of the established control scheme.},

Novel parameter-dependent negative-determination conditions (NDCs) for cubic matrix-valued polynomials are derived by using convex approaches. In comparison with the existing methods, the positive-definite constraint on the constructed Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional (LKF) is relaxed by using the sum of several matrices to maintain positive definiteness instead of this requirement on every single matrix involved in the LKF. Less conservative stability conditions are established by using the constructed LKF and the proposed parameter-dependent NDCs for cubic matrix-valued polynomials.

First, a dynamic linearized data model (DLDM) is established, where the estimation of the pseudo-Jacobian matrix (PJM) in prior methods neglects noise suppression. To overcome this gap, a PJM adaptive robust estimation method using a noise-tolerant zeroing neural network (NN) is designed, guaranteeing residual-free convergence and enhancing robustness against data noise. Furthermore, an iterative sliding mode observer is developed to estimate the coupling between multiple variables, aiming to obtain a decoupled DLDM for synthesizing controllers. Next, the iterative learning controller (ILC) utilizing wavelet NNs is designed, and its convergence characteristics are analyzed theoretically. Integrating ILC with decoupling strategies simplifies controller design and provides new perspectives for analyzing the convergence of the MIMO system. Finally, the developed scheme’s performance are validated through case studies. Real-time feasibility is assessed using the dSPACE rapid prototyping system.},

However, despite these benefits, differences in the distribution capabilities of various supplier enterprises can lead to inconsistencies in the overall service quality of distribution tasks. Therefore, in collaborative distribution, it is crucial to ensure the overall service quality while maximizing benefit. To address this challenge, this article formalizes the collaborative distribution problem (CDP) in the logistics chain via the environments — classes, agents, roles, groups, objects (E-CARGO) model. A novel solution is designed for CDP by extending the group multirole assignment (GMRA) model. This solution incorporates the qualification matrix adjustments (QMA) algorithm to systematically prioritize suppliers based on their qualifications, thereby maximizing benefit while ensuring the overall service quality of collaborative distribution tasks. Large-scale random experiments show that the proposed method effectively balances the tradeoff between the benefit and overall service quality in the CDP under various data distributions.

  abstract     = {Decentralized stochastic gradient algorithms efficiently solve large-scale finite-sum optimization problems when all agents in the network are reliable. However, most of these algorithms are not resilient to adverse conditions, such as malfunctioning agents, software bugs, and cyber attacks. This article aims to handle a class of general composite optimization problems over multiagent systems (MASs) in the presence of an unknown number of Byzantine agents. Building on a resilient aggregation mechanism and the proximal-gradient mapping method, a Byzantine-resilient decentralized stochastic proximal-gradient algorithmic framework is proposed, dubbed Prox-DBRO-VR, which achieves an optimization and control goal using only local computations and communications. To asymptotically reduce the noise variance arising from local gradient estimation and accelerate the convergence, we incorporate two localized variance-reduced (VR) techniques (SAGA and LSVRG) into Prox-DBRO-VR to design Prox-DBRO-SAGA and Prox-DBRO-LSVRG. By analyzing the contraction relationships among the gradient-learning error, resilient consensus condition, and convergence error in a unified theoretical framework, it is proved that both Prox-DBRO-SAGA and Prox-DBRO-LSVRG, with a well-designed constant (resp., decaying) step-size, converge linearly (resp., sublinearly) inside an error ball around the optimal solution to the original problem under standard assumptions. A tradeoff between convergence accuracy and Byzantine resilience in both linear and sublinear cases is also characterized. In numerical experiments, the effectiveness and practicability of the proposed algorithms are manifested via resolving a decentralized sparse machine learning problem under various Byzantine attacks.},

Unlike most existing works that focus only on DoS attacks in fixed or single-type channels, this work considers a more general attack mode, where attacks can occur in the input, output, or both simultaneously. During an attack, the signal in the affected channel is interrupted, rendering it inaccessible. Even if the system is safe, only quantized output signal is available. To address this, a novel state estimator is designed that switches different observer gains depending on the attacked channel. On this basis, we develop an output-feedback adaptive control algorithm that utilizes the estimated signals and incorporates a dynamic filtering technique. The control strategy effectively resists IDoS attacks, ensuring that all closed-loop signals remain semiglobally uniformly ultimately bounded (SUUB), and the stability error converges to a small residual set near the origin. Numerical simulation further confirmed the advantages and effectiveness of the proposed scheme.},

This approach suffers from a number of limitations, particularly when hardware resources become heterogeneous: lack of readability, reuse, and extensibility of the models. By delegating the resolution to an external solver, the link between the problem model and its projection in the solver is lost.

In a networked system, agents cooperatively estimate the target system state disturbed by process noise. However, due to the existence of measurement noise, each agent can only access partial and disturbed measurement output information. Meanwhile, given the limitations of resources in the networked system and the difficulty of acquiring global information, the event-based robust adaptive distributed observer is proposed. Specifically, by introducing robust adaptive coupling gains, a fully distributed design is achieved, eliminating the dependence on global information. Through the design of event-triggered mechanism, an event-based communication manner is implemented to reduce communication and energy resource consumption. Moreover, in view of the heterogeneity of the undetectable subspace and the differences in parameter design among agents, this article introduces a coordinate transformation and constructs a new Lyapunov function to further analyze the stability of the estimation error. Then, theoretical analysis shows that during cooperative estimation under directed graphs, the norm of estimation error can asymptotically converge to a compact set without Zeno behavior. Finally, a simulation example is provided to verify the effectiveness of the proposed event-based robust adaptive distributed observer.},

It replaces, in each round, a subset of the open-loop (OL) eigenvalues and minimizes simultaneously the condition number of the closed-loop eigenvector matrix (EVM). It is shown that, in those rounds where a real eigenvalue of order 1 is replaced, the minimization of the condition number can be converted into an equivalent convex minimization problem and thus a globally optimal feedback gain matrix can be obtained. When all the OL eigenvalues to be replaced are real ones of order 1, the proposed circulation design generally turns out to be a very simple method for the entire ESA, which possesses good numerical reliability since matrix inverse operations are completely avoided.

The simplified feet models committed to the single shape of the foot can not be used on robots equipped with diverse feet or modern adaptive feet. This work proposes a novel foothold optimization method that efficiently searches for optimal contact points for different foot shapes using a polynomial approximation. The system leverages a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on simulated data to predict a cost for each candidate foothold. We show that a single neural network can work with different and new foot mechanical designs without retraining the system. We experimentally validate our system on the ANYmal robot using both ball feet and adaptive soft feet, in indoor and outdoor environments, finding that our system improves stability, in terms of pitch and roll angles of the base, with respect to a state-of-the-art method.},

Aiming at this issue, this article investigates a differential flatness-based trajectory optimization method for fixed-wing AAVs (DFTO-FW). The customized trajectory representation is presented through differential flat characteristics analysis and polynomial parameterization, eliminating equality constraints to avoid the heavy computational burdens of solving complex dynamics. Through the design of integral performance costs and derivation of analytical gradients, the original trajectory optimization is transcribed into a lightweight, unconstrained, gradient-analytical optimization with linear time complexity to improve efficiency further. The simulation experiments illustrate the superior efficiency of the DFTO-FW, which takes subsecond CPU time (on a personal desktop) against other competitors by orders of magnitude to generate fixed-wing AAV trajectories in randomly generated obstacle environments.},

In out-of-sample predictions, we find that A-GDT is experimentally superior to all models which it generalizes; specifically, cumulative prospect theory (CPT), subjective expected utility (SEU), alpha-maxmin expected utility ( $\alpha $ -MEU), vector expected utility (VEU), and expected utility theory (EUT). We ran an experimental study of 150 decisions under ambiguity by 310 subjects by operationalizing payoffs, probability, and ambiguity. We show that subjects exhibit behavior that contradicts many decision models, such as CPT, SEU, $\alpha $ -MEU, and EUT; but not A-GDT. In out-of-sample studies with the same number of parameters, the A-GDT model predicts both representative (aggregate) agent and individual preferences substantially better than other well-known ambiguity models. Specifically, a three-parameter A-GDT is substantially superior to CPT and all other important models. Furthermore, significance testing in a paired comparison of models shows that subjects’ behavior matches the A-GDT model markedly better than other models. A new rate-of-degradation analysis demonstrates that A-GDT’s predictions are far more stable than other models as the in-sample size is decreased. In addition, the A-GDT model not only can resolve typical Ellsberg-like behavior, but it can also resolve hypothetical and real-life ambiguity problems with multiple sources of ambiguity including the paradoxes by Machina.},

First, in the upper network layer, event-triggered observers are designed to reconstruct the leader’s information by using the states exchanged intermittently among the neighboring observers. Then, in the lower physical layer, an adaptive fault-tolerant controller is designed, whose update instant can be directly computed based on the received upper layer information. This not only has the potential to further reduce the update frequency of controller, but also avoid the continuous monitoring on measurement errors. Besides, utilizing this control framework can prevent the faults from being propagated along the communication network.

In the first step, a reference system model is constructed for each agent.

  abstract     = {The process industry is a key manufacturing process that consumes a vast amount of energy consumption. On the premise of ensuring process stability, controlling process variables to operate the process close to the optimal working condition plays a critical role in reducing energy consumption. Reinforcement learning (RL), using trial and error to learn control strategies, has received much attention. However, the substantial fluctuations of process variables and the switching delay gap of the process industry result in a high-dimension state-action space, making it difficult to learn control strategies efficiently, and there is no guarantee of control stability. To get around these issues, first, a generic knowledge-extracted method for process industry RL control is proposed. It does not require laborious expert knowledge acquisition processes. Second, to improve learning efficiency, the implicit knowledge is extracted using decision trees from operation trajectory data and embedded into agent controllers. Third, an explicit knowledge-oriented reward constructing method is designed to guarantee control stability. A case of the zinc electrowinning process is provided to validate its superiority. The result shows that it can reduce power consumption while stabilizing process variables within the spec limits, without a laborious expert knowledge acquisition process.},

With the filtered signals, a finite-time adaptive neural controller is developed to generate the desired control moment and achieve rapid tracking of high-AOA commands, where both neural network (NN) and disturbance observer (DOB) are integrated to estimate composite disturbances. To enhance learning performance, an adaptive evaluation signal is constructed using online recorded data to update NN and DOB parameters. The deflections of thrust vector nozzles and aerodynamic control surfaces are finally obtained by solving an optimal control allocation problem. The practical finite-time uniformly ultimately bounded stability is proved through Lyapunov analysis.

Furthermore, we integrate control barrier functions (CBFs) into the policy optimization to enhance the ability of dynamic obstacle avoidance, ensuring safety in complex environments. Additionally, we adopt staged rewards, potential-based rewards, and auxiliary rewards to overcome the sparse reward problem, providing the agent with richer and more effective learning signals.

Especially, the original nonlinear system model is first represented in terms of fuzzy rules, and the optimal control problem is transformed into a fuzzy controller design problem for a linear Markov jump fuzzy system without knowledge of the system matrices and input matrices. The policy iteration (PI) algorithm is a powerful RL tool to design adaptive optimal control policy. However, the PI algorithm acquires a stabilizing control policy as its initial policy, which depends extremely on the system dynamics, when system knowledge is unknown, finding an initial stabilizing policy is rather difficult or even impossible. To overcome this shortcoming, in this article, a new off-policy PI-based RL algorithm, i.e., the data-driven homotopic RL (DDHRL), is developed in this article. This DDHRL algorithm improves the traditional PI algorithm, and it is used to obtain the adaptive optimal controller based on the sample data without knowing the system dynamics, and the most significant advantage of the proposed DDHRL is that, by adding a constant sequence, the condition of seeking an initial stabilizing control policy can be avoided. This is in sharp contrast with the traditional PI-based algorithms. The convergence of the DDHRL algorithm is proved, and its feasibility and good performance are validated by simulation examples.},

  abstract     = {This article proposes a novel Q-learning algorithm that relies solely on input-output data to address the output regulation control problem of complex discrete-time systems affected by exogenous signals. Unlike traditional methods, this algorithm does not require detailed system information, state knowledge, or data about external systems or exogenous signals. Additionally, the control strategy does not depend on state information, but on input-output data processed by a set of filters. We provide upper and lower bounds on the discount factor, eliminating the need to solve the Riccati equation. These bounds ensure that the value function remains finite, and we prove the stability of the system when using control inputs derived from the value function with the given discount factor. Furthermore, the Q-learning algorithm, when applied with input data containing probing noise, is shown to yield Q-function estimates that are independent of the probing noise. Finally, a simulation involving a grid-connected inverter is presented, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in a practical setting.},

  abstract     = {One of the core tasks of design for testability (DFT) is to generate an optimal test strategy based on the test mode, to isolate faults quickly and accurately. There are currently two modes: 1) sequential test mode (STM) and 2) parallel test mode (PTM). For complex systems, limited testing resources are difficult to meet parallel test conditions, so STM is mostly used. The multisignal flow graph is a widely used model for generating optimal sequential test strategy (STS) in DFT. However, this STM-based model overlooks the possibility of conducting some tests in parallel, resulting in lengthy test time and greatly affecting the reliability and security of the systems. To solve this problem, an optimal sequential-parallel test strategy (SPTS) generation method is proposed. First, a new test mode of global sequential testing and local parallel testing is proposed to generalize the original model. Second, to overcome the combinatorial explosion caused by the new model, we approximate the discrete model to continuous and derive a probability heuristic function. Then, a neural network-intelligent algorithm structure is established to simplify the complex recursion of the heuristic function. Finally, this heuristic function is used to guide the generation of SPTS, which has a shorter test time than STS. Simulation results show that the reduction in time is related to the type and number of locally parallel tests, and reaches 39.5% in a real case.},

The integration of virtual input and the proposed RLQSF law design enables simultaneous angular tracking and vibration elimination. To make up for the defective actuators with part loss of efficacy and evaluate the unknown fault parameters, an adaptive estimation law with a projection mapping operator is adopted. With the help of the Lyapunov direct approach, the angular position tracking errors and the flexible vibration of RFCRMs are demonstrated to converge to a tiny confined compact set with fewer communications.

This algorithm generates dynamic binary task-driven signals for each agent, enabling near-optimal online grouping of MAS with arbitrary proportions. Second, we introduce a cooperative strategy that employs a shared decision-making mechanism and utilizes feedback linearization without global position information. This strategy generates motion planning signals to coordinate the agents’ actions, achieving overall cooperative behaviors such as tracking, capturing, and intercepting.

In order to reduce output sampling while ensuring a given estimation accuracy, this article proposes an event-triggered sampling strategy for the state estimation of SBNs. Under this strategy, the output is sampled when the one-step prediction mean error exceeds a prespecified threshold. An iterative algorithm for the state probability distribution is proposed based on the algebraic form of SBNs, which determines the optimal state estimation. A matrix inequality method is proposed to calculate the worst-case mean estimation error based on its monotonicity with time. Then, the range of sampling triggering thresholds that minimize the worst-case mean estimation error is obtained. This article demonstrates that the event-triggered sampling strategy can make a tradeoff between estimation error and sampling rate. It explains that the full sampling estimator is a special event-triggered sampling estimator. Finally, the proposed method is applied to BN models of the lac operon in Escherichia coli to analyze the relationship among the sampling triggering threshold, the sampling rate, and the estimation error.},

The measurement signals are encrypted before transmission and decrypted upon reception by the remote estimator. A newly devised attack model is developed to characterize the injection attacks, which occur randomly and involve a combination of multiple attack strategies. By employing matrix inequality techniques, a unified set-membership estimation scheme is developed when both the privacy-preserving scheme and the MIAs coexist. Subsequently, based on the sufficient condition of constraining the estimation error within an ellipsoidal range, an optimization problem is formulated to achieve the optimal estimation performance at each time step, along with the development of a recursive algorithm for computing the required estimator parameters.

However, there is a gap between virtual and physical environments in terms of how clean an observed state is. In addition, state adversarial attacks can seriously impact the performance of MADRL. Hence, how to improve the robustness of MADRL algorithms is an important research topic. In this article, we propose an optimal policy-based state adversary attack method that would make the MADRL algorithm more robust when it is applied in the training process of agents. Two case studies related to Industry 5.0 and a general case study are presented in which robustness training against the optimal adversarial attack is tested.

This necessitates the investigation of LSGDM within the framework of TWD. Given the essential role of the consensus on loss functions in three-way group decision (TWGD) and the significant impact of bounded rationality on decision results, this article, therefore, aims to present a consensus-reaching process (CRP) model for the prospect theory-based utility functions in LSGDM and thus build a novel large scale behavioral TWGD model for solving LSGDM issues under dual hesitant fuzzy (DHF) uncertainty. Specifically, the behavioral DHF TWD based on prospect theory is first built, wherein the threshold parameters are figured out by maximizing expected prospect value, instead of minimizing expected loss. Then, the social network based on social degree considering the co-opetition relationship is constructed, and a social network analysis method is implemented to cluster decision-makers. Accordingly, the CRP model for the prospect value adjustment is designed. Afterward, a large-scale behavioral TWGD model is proposed to tackle an LSGDM issue, resilient supplier selection.

First, the original time-varying constrained states of MASs, which are influenced by external disturbances and have a coupled communication topology, are transformed into unconstrained states using the nonlinear transformed function (NTF). This transformation ensures that the limitations of various physical states for agents are not exceeded. Second, the transformed unconstrained states are used to construct the PTDOB for fast observation of external disturbances. Then, based on the proposed PTDOB and the backstepping control technique, an adaptive fuzzy PT cooperative controller is designed. This controller not only ensures the convergence of MASs within PT but also prevents the states from exceeding the time-varying bounds. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy is demonstrated through its application to multiple single-link robotic arms as illustrative examples.},

Many existing solutions do not consider the maximum effective communication distance and bearing angle constraints between vehicles. This article proposes a novel prescribed performance method to handle distance and angle constraints to achieve vehicle stability under deception attacks. A key aspect is that the above two constraints are successfully transformed from inequality-constrained form to equivalent equation unconstrained form through introducing error transformations, and we prove that the errors of distance and angle are strictly contained within the boundary of the performance function. Another key aspect is to use adaptive bias radial basis function neural network (RBFNN) to approximate unknown nonlinear functions and deception attacks in the system and integrate the approximated results into recursive construction to design adaptive laws and multilane merging control laws. Analysis shows that all signals in a closed-loop system are practical prescribed time stable. Simulations validate that our control method has a faster convergence time than the existing advanced two-dimensional (2-D) vehicle approach and can adaptively adjust convergence to predefined sets under different attack intensities.},

  abstract     = {This article introduces a robust AI-driven hybrid vision/force control (HVFC) method for industrial robots. The proposed HVFC method exploits Superpoint, a pretrained deep convolutional neural network (DCNN), as the AI agent to extract interest points for image-based visual servoing (IBVS), making it a target-object-free method. This tackles the limited workspace issue of eye-in-hand robots interacting with a workpiece due to the short distance between the camera and the workpiece, including a target object or landmarks. A learning-by-demonstration (LBD) method is also developed to generate the desired interest points associated with the desired path on the workpiece for interaction. To handle the issue of a high and variable number of interest points for use in IBVS, a set of six independent image features is extracted from the detected interest points, resulting in an invertible image interaction matrix, leading to global stability and a robust control process. To perform HVFC, a hierarchical orthogonal sliding manifold is defined, allowing force control in the normal direction and IBVS in the rest. Further, a filtered terminal integral sliding-mode controller is developed to stabilize the manifold, resulting in high tracking accuracy and robust performance against uncertainties and measurement noises. The experimental results of polishing and sanding the surfaces of a flat plastic board, a wooden airplane propeller, and a metal pegboard demonstrate the feasibility and superiority of the proposed HVFC-LBD method over conventional counterparts in terms of workspace expansion, robustness, and tracking accuracy.},

  abstract     = {In this article, the stability analysis and synthesis issues of networked control systems with asynchronous sensors and controllers are studied, where the stochastic variable obeying a certain probability distribution is introduced to characterize the clock offset between the sensor and the controller. First, a continuous-time framework covering random clock offsets and consecutively lost packets is established. An appropriate discrete-time stochastic augmented model is then constructed to investigate the analysis and synthesis problems of resulting continuous-time framework. Therefore, we prove that the stochastic stability of the discrete-time model implies the stochastic stability of resulting continuous-time system. Based on the discrete-time stochastic augmented model, the random and highly nonlinear terms are decoupled with the help of the law of total expectation, Kronecker product operation, and reduced-order confluent Vandermonde matrix. Subsequently, we present the stability condition in the form of linear matrix inequality and design the desired gain matrix such that the original continuous-time system is stochastically stable. Finally, two numerical examples and a practical example are utilized to clarify the practicability of the designed strategy.},

In this article, a stipulated-time stability for nonautonomous dynamic systems is proposed, which is then extended to stipulated-time boundedness for uncertain systems. By using a class of bounded time-varying functions, Lyapunov-like conditions to ensure a dynamic system to exhibit stipulated-time stability/boundedness are developed. It is interesting that previous Lyapunov-like theorems for predefined-time (PDT) stability can be unified into our framework to achieve stipulated-time stability. To validate the framework, a stipulated-time controller is first designed for a general affine system, which requires a smaller initial control signal than that of PDT control. Furthermore, a generalized design of stipulated-time distributed observer for leader-following multiagent systems is proposed.},

Instead of existing event-triggered control (ETC) schemes where only bounded stabilization can be obtained, adaptive event-triggered asymptotic stabilization control can be achieved in this article. For this, a new tangent barrier Lyapunov function (BLF) method is developed to ensure that the state satisfies its corresponding time-varying constraint conditions. Then, the unknown system parameter problems can be resolved by using the adaptive compensation technique. Considering the resource constraint of the communication channel and computation burden, a new ETC strategy is advanced to tackle the communication load and optimize system performance. Moreover, the asymptotic stabilization control can be realized through the developed boundary ETC. Lastly, simulation results are displayed to verify the designed boundary control algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Multiagent scheduling has recently been reinvigorated by the burgeoning application of swarm, receiving significant attention due to its new characteristics. The market-based method is a fast distributed scheduling method that is naturally suitable for agent swarm, while its multiround communication is inevitably affected by the environment and the performance deteriorates. This article proposes an idea of computing-for-communication (CFC) with improving or even appropriately increasing computation to reduce communication rounds and improve the performance meanwhile, which does not add additional communication protocols and traffic but may moderately increase the amount of computation and storage. First, a new scoring function and a local optimization method are proposed to improve the agent’s schedule and resolve the conflict among agents in advance. Second, an agent location inference method and task-related agent selection strategy are presented for local optimization, which is expected to avoid the increase of communication in locations and the waste of computation on irrelevant agents. Third, some modifications for removing and adding tasks are proposed to further improve the performance of scheduling. Finally, extensive Monte Carlo experiments demonstrate the commendable performance of the proposed method in comparison with the representative consensus-based bundle algorithm (CBBA) and performance impact algorithm (PI).},

Incomplete information exacerbates this complexity, leading to frequent conflicts, such as redundant agents performing the same task. Different from the existing single-type game model, this article introduces a distributed mixed cooperative-noncooperative (DMCN) model that considers nondifferentiable constraints. In order to deal with nondifferentiable task layer constraints, we use approximation operators and splitting schemes to transform the original optimization function into the primal-dual differentiable function. In order to obtain more stable solutions, a distributed approximate gradient descent optimization algorithm and conflict resolution mechanism are proposed, which enhances the convergence of our method. We use Lyapunov theory to verify the exponential convergence of the algorithm in the time range.

The communication networks’ open setting and sharing nature give rise to security issues and impact the performance of MASs. Malicious DoS attacks attempt to disrupt the information exchange and undermine consensus by compromising the availability of transmitted data. Moreover, the control input can be saturated as a result of physical device limitations or safety concerns. To tackle these challenges, a state-prediction-based dynamic event-triggered mechanism (DETM) control protocol is designed to guarantee the secure consensus of MASs while reducing redundant communication, avoiding continuous monitoring of adjacent states, and ensuring effective utilization of limited bandwidth resources. Zeno behavior is eliminated by confirming the existence of a positive lower bound on interevent intervals. Sufficient conditions are established for the co-design of the DETM and controller to accomplish the desired goal.

  abstract     = {Owing to the immaturity of current artificial intelligence techniques, practical multiagent systems (MASs) often require supervision and intervention from humans. However, it is unrealistic for a human to monitor the entire MAS and provide appropriate input in some circumstances. A viable approach is to allow a human to control an agent as the leader which in turn influences the other autonomous followers. To this end, a critical issue is how to learn human behavior to improve the autonomy of followers for collaborating with human effectively, since the autonomous followers do not have prior knowledge of human behavior. In this article, the human leading behavior learning problem is studied for a class of human-in-the-loop (HiTL) MASs that are not fully connected. A linear quadratic differential game framework is applied to formulate the collaborative control problem in the HiTL MAS where the human behavior is represented as a cost function whose weighting matrix is unknown to the followers. In the HiTL MAS, we select a follower that has strong computing power called follower 1 to learn the human behavior via an online adaptive inverse differential game (IDG) approach. Based on concurrent learning (CL) technique, an adaptive law is developed for follower 1 to determine the human feedback matrix online, and at the same time the interaction strategies for the autonomous followers are also calculated by follower 1 in case of the constrained communication topology. Subsequently, the weighting matrix in the human cost function is recovered by addressing a linear matrix inequality (LMI) optimization problem. Finally, a numerical example is presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

First, two novel F-T stability lemmas are presented in the form of generalized Halanay inequalities. Second, based on the obtained lemmas, some simple and easy-to-use F-T synchronization criteria are rendered for the considered NNs under two different Lyapunov functions. The results obtained in this article greatly reduce system constraints and are therefore more applicable.

  abstract     = {This article investigates the stability analysis and controller design of load frequency control (LFC) power system with demand response (DR) considering communication delays, which integrates DR resources to facilitate ancillary frequency regulation services. Initially, the multiarea LFC continuous-time model with DR is transformed into multiarea discrete time model by setting reasonable control input. Then, the linear operators are used to represent the uncertainty of communication delays and aperiodic sampled-data periods in system, and then the discrete system is transformed into a feedback interconnected system composed of uncertainty operators and linear time-invariant system. Subsequently, the uniform exponential stability condition of the system is given by using integral quadratic constraint theory and Bohl-Perron principle. On the basis, a new control scheme is designed and an iterative algorithm of the controller is given considering transmission delay and aperiodic sampling with decoupling technology. Finally, simulation results in one-area, two-area, and 39-bus test system also verify that the proposed method has effectiveness and superiority in the LFC system with DR.},

Voluntary vaccination behavior is influenced by factors, such as age and interaction patterns. Differences in health consciousness and risk perception based on age result in heterogeneity in vaccination behavior among different age groups. Higher-order interactions among individuals of various ages facilitate the dissemination of vaccine-related information, further influencing vaccination intentions. To investigate the impact of individual age and interaction patterns on vaccination behavior, we propose an epidemic-game coevolution model in which age structure and higher-order interactions are considered. Based on the theoretical framework of epidemic-game coevolution, this work calculates the evolutionarily stable strategies and dynamic equilibrium under imitation dynamics in the well-mixed population. Extensive numerical experiments show that infants and the elderly exhibit conservative attitudes toward vaccination, and the vaccination levels of these two groups have no significant impact on the vaccination behavior of other age groups. The vaccination behavior of children is highly active, while the vaccination behavior of adults depends on the relative cost of vaccination. The increase in vaccination levels among children and adults leads to a decrease in vaccination levels in other groups. Furthermore, the infants exhibit the lowest level of vaccination, while the children have the highest vaccination rate. Higher-order interactions significantly enhance vaccination levels among children and adults.},

To address this, we propose a novel framework called brain-guided self-paced curriculum learning (BG-SPCL) that leverages user-state information to effectively constrain the learning space for the user intention decoder (curriculum learning) and dynamically adapts the learning curriculum based on the decoder state information self-paced learning (SPL). In the curriculum learning stage, we extract the level of user distraction from brain signals and determine the feasible curriculum region. In the SPL stage, sample difficulty is inferred from the decoder loss, and the sample weights are dynamically adjusted such that the decoder progressively learns more difficult samples. We evaluated the effectiveness of our approach by conducting extensive experiments on three public brain-machine interface (BMI) benchmarks, which constitute an HMI scenario where the user’s brain signals are naturally available. Our results showed superior performance of the proposed method compared to baseline in both offline and online learning settings with no labeled user data, demonstrating the potential for practical application of our framework in both BMI and HMI systems.

A traction drive system with sensor and actuator faults is first described as a dynamic process. Then, the disturbance-decoupling residual generator is developed by constructing a subspace for deterministic disturbances. Based on the generated residual signals, the corresponding ambiguity sets are constructed to characterize the distributional uncertainties of noises. Moreover, the design of the target FD system is formulated as a distributionally robust optimization (DRO) problem. By solving the DRO problem, a robust FD approach is developed. It is worth noting that this method not only delivers satisfactory detection performances, but also enhances robustness against both deterministic disturbances and distributional uncertainties of stochastic noises. The reliability and validity of the developed method are illustrated by a numerical simulation and an experimental study on an actual traction drive system.},

  abstract     = {A cable-driven segmented manipulator (CDSM) has considerable potential in narrow space operations because it has a slender and light body with flexible mobility. However, the existing CDSM segment driving mechanisms are coupled to each other. The driving distance of the rear segment cable is superimposed with that of the front segment cable, which renders the cables’ drive distance inconsistent. Moreover, the system kinematics, dynamics, and control become extremely complex. In this article, a novel decoupling driving mechanism is proposed to solve the coupling problem, simplifying the modeling and control of the CDSM. The routing of the driving cable is designed based on the characteristics of the symmetrical offset (i.e., the same magnitude but opposite in direction) of the cable length applicable to joints with one and two degrees of freedom. By modifying the direction of the driving cable in the middle of the proximal segment, the driving cable length of the distal segment is unaffected by the change of the angle of the front segment. Moreover, to increase the drive stroke, a multiturn winding mechanism is designed, reducing the volume and mass of the driving box. Accordingly, an improved forward and backward reaching inverse kinematics is proposed for CDSM based on virtual joints. Compared with the Jacobian pseudo-inverse method, the computational efficiency is improved. Finally, the proposed mechanisms and methods are verified via a CDSM prototype. The results indicate that the proposed manipulator compared with typical manipulators has larger movement range, higher end velocity, and guaranteed accuracy due to the proposed decoupled driving and fast kinematics resolution.},

To simultaneously improve both the vertical and longitudinal ride comfort of vehicles, a dual timescale model predictive control (MPC) preview active suspension system (ASS) and longitudinal dynamics coupled controller is developed. On a short time scale, the coupling control of the vehicle’s ASS and longitudinal acceleration is achieved using road preview information, enhancing both vertical and longitudinal ride comfort, thereby improving response speed. On a longer time scale, road prediction information obtained via Gaussian processes (GPs) is utilized for vehicle speed planning, aiming to mitigate vertical excitations caused by road profile variations while minimizing frequent speed changes. However, when road preview information is continuously used as disturbance predictions in MPC, it undermines the recursive feasibility and stability of MPC. To address this, a scaling method is devised to account for disturbances incorporated into the predictive model. Theoretical foundations ensure both recursive feasibility and asymptotic stability. The effectiveness and advantages of the dual timescale MPC preview active suspension and longitudinal dynamics coupled control are validated through simulations and bench tests.},

Based on the historical group decision data, this study proposes a novel minimum cost consensus model with preference learning and fairness concerns (MCCM-PLFC), which characterizes the modification motivation of decision makers in a utility-driven way. A preference learning framework is first proposed to determine the parameters of utility functions of decision makers, where fairness concerns are modeled based on the return bias among the decision makers. Then, in a Stackelberg game consensus framework, the MCCM-PLFC is constructed to minimize the consensus cost of the moderator with consideration of the utility-driven behavior of decision makers. In addition, a best-response update algorithm is designed to solve the equilibrium solution among the decision makers and an adaptive differential evolution algorithm is used to solve the MCCM-PLFC.

In order to meet these requirements, this article proposes an improved Mamba-2-based intelligent modeling method to obtain the precise deep peak shaving process model of thermal power-molten salt heat storage coupled system. Based on the state space duality, the Mamba-2 shows great prediction accuracy and speed in dealing with the multiple long-time sequences. To efficiently model the wide-range and rapidly changing deep peak shaving sequences, the context learning capacity, computational efficiency and convergence speed of Mamba-2 must be improved. First, the sparse attention mechanism that can selectively process some of the tokens is established to promote the modeling precision of Mamba-2. Moreover, the novel least-squares interpolation (Lion) optimizer is successfully utilized to accelerate the training process in Mamba-2 for the first time. Then, both the inputs and outputs sequences inside Mamba-2 are normalized to facilitate the modeling accuracy improvement of thermal power-molten salt heat storage coupled system. The improved Mamba-2 with stable state space model, prominent modeling precision and speed effectively provides guarantee for the deep peak shaving of unit. Finally, the superior model accuracy of the proposed intelligent modeling method is verified based on the on-site deep peak shaving sequences of 660 MW thermal power unit and 40 MW molten salt heat storage system.},

Most existing studies consider the scenarios with homogeneous robots and tasks. To model the application scenarios where different types of robots are required, we propose a heterogeneous MPDA problem, which incorporates different types of robots and tasks with dependency. Correspondingly, a novel metaheuristic algorithm called multistage particle swarm optimization is designed and consists of two parts: 1) a multistage strategy and 2) a specially designed particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. The multistage strategy imposes temporary constraints to force cooperation between robots, which can reduce and smoothen the search space. The proposed PSO contains a mixed updating mechanism consisting of a continuous velocity updating rule and a discrete position updating rule, which is effective for updating the permutation-based solutions of MPDA. The experiments on a newly designed benchmark test set show that the proposed algorithm is more effective and efficient than the state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract     = {Due to the passage of time and uncertain demand changes, the two-level supply chain finance system transforms into a dynamic and uncertain multimodel discrete system. The continuous fluctuations in the capital levels of node companies significantly impact both the business activities of these companies and the stability of the system. Effective capital equilibrium switching control can adjust the system’s steady state. Consequently, this article introduces a strategy for dynamic capital equilibrium based on a fundamental model of the system’s capital. Additionally, a capital equilibrium switching strategy, composed of a robust control strategy and a capital equilibrium strategy, is designed based on the Takagi-Sugeno model to achieve stability. Furthermore, multiple sets of simulation tests not only validate the effectiveness of the capital equilibrium switching strategy under different external demand distributions but also confirm the scientificity and reliability of the method proposed. Finally, this article analyzes the impact of internal capital scheduling on both the capital equilibrium and the overall system.},

  abstract     = {High-level decision-making for multiple uncrewed aerial vehicles (multi-UAV) mission planning is crucial, especially with the rising demand for long-term services in geo-distributed environments. However, the interrelated issues of multi-UAV deployment and task allocation are often addressed separately. This article integrates these two problems and introduces a hierarchical framework for effective decision-making. This is achieved by proposing balanced capability (BC), a customized metric tailored for long-term multi-UAV missions with geographically dispersed targets. By considering the global objective and self-organized coordination, a joint optimization model is established from a game-theoretical perspective. Additionally, a novel tangent and cotangent search algorithm (TCSA) is proposed to steer cooperative players toward the global objective in the upper layer, while in the lower layer, a modified distributed task allocation algorithm (MDT2A) incentivizes each autonomous player to efficiently maximize their individual benefits. Simulations validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, with comparative results highlighting the superiority of the algorithms.},

For single-armed CTs with just one CCO that could be completed in one system cycle time, researchers have proposed several scheduling approaches. In practice, more than one CCO may be required concurrently, thus failing the existing ones under such cases. Furthermore, the duration of a cleaning operation may be larger than one system cycle time, which highly complicates the scheduling of such tools. This work addresses this challenge by proposing several scheduling approaches and algorithms for single-armed CTs with several CCOs, each of which exceeds the duration of one system cycle. Suggestions are given for engineers in semiconductor fabrication plants to take the most suitable scheduling approach and algorithm for enhancing the productivity of CTs given their specific scenarios.

The appropriate integral barrier Lyapunov functions (IBLFs) are selected to prevent the states from exceeding the asymmetric constraint boundaries associated with multi-information, which include historical states, time and neighbor outputs. The event-triggered mechanism (ETM) with varying threshold is employed to reduce the update frequency of the controller, thereby achieving the purpose of saving network resources, including communication bandwidth and computation abilities. Under the backstepping technique framework, the required control scheme is designed by integrating the adaptive controller with triggering mechanism. And it is proven that the controlled plant with state constraint conditions is stable, the consensus tracking errors can eventually remain near the origin, and the Zeno behavior does not exist.

Then, in order to construct an iterative learning control law for mating with the dynamic-static feature, the error compensation is designed synchronous with that of the input and the gain is argued for a quadratic minimization. By extracting the lifted tracking error as nonzero and zero segments, the optimized gain is explicated by system Markov parameters and the error. Rigorously algebraic operation delivers that the tracking error is asymptotically bound for a value that is linearly relevant to the threshold of the initial states shifting, which means that the addressed optimal learning scheme is robust to the initial state uncertainties. Further inference conveys that the tracking error is asymptotically vanishing while the initial state shifting is sequentially decaying and the tracking error is linearly monotonously convergent when the initial state is settled, respectively.

It is known that perfect activity circuits (PACs) are important structural objects in Petri nets. We define a new one called the maximally extended PAC (MPAC) that can be used to characterize deadlocks as PAC does. The number of MPACs is much smaller than that of PACs. The stalled production of a part of an AMS is caused by the occurrence of a blocking marking (BM) state, where a resource circuit-wait pattern is formulated with respect to MPAC. We use an integer linear program (ILP) to compute a problematic MPAC, and a monitor is designed to prevent all BM states caused by it. Then, a robust controller is synthesized in an iterative manner. Such a controller can be used to guarantee the continuous production of all part types even if some resources fail.

The DSCCE model utilizes an embedding reconstruction model to establish the relationship between fault and their semantic attributes, which is accomplished the task through the transfer of fault semantic attribute descriptions. Initially, DSCCE encodes fault samples and semantic attribute descriptions into an embedding space through two embedding networks. Then, the model employs canonical correlation analysis with two embedding features to assess the consistency between semantic attribute vectors and fault samples. Simultaneously, correlation constraints are applied between fault embedding feature subsets to enhance differential information. Subsequently, the classifier is trained using embedding features to complete the task of zero-shot fault diagnosis.

A resilient MPC algorithm is designed, where switching between different cost functions is considered and the control input sequences optimized are used to compensate for information loss caused by DoS attacks. We demonstrate that under certain conditions on the duration of DoS attacks and system parameters, the closed-loop system can be guaranteed to be uniformly ultimately bounded (UUB) in the attack scenario. Moreover, in the nonattack scenario, it exhibits robust asymptotic stability. By properly setting tightened constraints and cost functions, the recursive feasibility of the optimization problem can be ensured for any admissible attack scenario and disturbances realization. The maximum duration of DoS attacks that can be tolerated in the C-A channel is derived by feasibility analysis.

Existing defenses rely entirely on a trusted central server, raising concerns if the server fails or acts maliciously. This article introduces a novel vaccination-based technique, empowering clients to defend their models independently with minimal computation and no communication overhead. Our approach is effective even when only a subset of benign clients adopt the protocol, offering a practical, client-centric solution to enhance FL security. Experimental results demonstrate that our method reduces the attack success rate (ASR) to as low as 4.17%, compared to over 47% for state-of-the-art defenses like FoolsGold, while maintaining a high main task accuracy of 82.94%, closely matching the baseline accuracy of 83.21%. Furthermore, even when the proportion of malicious participants exceeds 60%, the backdoor trigger is not part of the vaccine trigger or only one client follows the vaccination protocol, the ASR remains below 7.8%.},

  abstract     = {Traffic light recognition is crucial for autonomous driving. While significant progress has been made in favorable conditions, recognition performance in night-time scenes remains a challenge. One straightforward approach is to apply enhancement methods that improve degraded images prior to object detection. However, since most enhancement methods are tailored for human perception; they may not consistently improve recognition accuracy for machine learning techniques. To address this, we propose an enhancement-guided framework for night-time traffic light recognition, called EG-TLR. EG-TLR consists of a residual denoising module (RDM) and a mixed attention traffic light detection module (MATLDM). The RDM reduces noise in degraded night-time images while preserving essential traffic light features by extracting sparsity information and performing context aggregation. The MATLDM improves feature extraction and recognition performance in complex night-time scenes by incorporating a shadow detection layer (SDL) and a mixed attention module (MAM). Moreover, to address the lack of a dedicated night-time traffic light dataset, we construct the Night-TL dataset utilizing publicly available images. Extensive experiments on Night-TL and LISA datasets demonstrate that EG-TLR achieves an AP50 of 79.83% and an AP50:95 of 36.62%, with an inference speed of 5.9 ms and 16.9 GFLOPs, outperforming other state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, ablation studies and visualization results validate the effectiveness of our proposed method. The Night-TL dataset can be downloaded from: https://github.com/feiqinaqian/Night-TL-dataset.},

  abstract     = {Deep active learning (DeepAL) extends supervised deep learning to human-machine interactive scenarios with limited annotation budgets. Most existing DeepAL approaches for visual recognition fail to consider the intrinsic hierarchical structure and dependencies between labels. In this article, we propose a unified DeepAL framework for the aforementioned challenge, which fuses three tightly coupled techniques: 1) hierarchical dependency representation entropy (HDRE); 2) approximate class-balanced typical sampling (ACTS); and 3) local probability suppression loss. First, the HDRE provides the features of information entropy, interclass dependencies, and constraints effectively. It is used to determine the query priority of unlabeled samples. Second, the ACTS, embedded with the HDRE, is designed for querying, where the optimal sample query size of each class is derived. It excludes samples near the boundary by employing a well-designed hierarchical margin sampling. Third, the local probability suppression loss is a transfer-friendly loss function that enables the deep model to flatly fit data with a hierarchical structure. It compensates for hierarchical dependencies between classes using the local probability suppression constraint, modeling conditional and unconditional probabilities simultaneously. We conducted experiments on five public image datasets, and the results demonstrated the effectiveness of our approach.},

  abstract     = {This article emphasizes an interesting approach to synthesize computational creativity by a process similar to deductive reasoning with a provision for testing the degree of diversity of the generated instances compared to their predecessors. The above two-step process of expansion and testing is developed here using the best-first search (BFS) on an OR-tree, where the nodes denote trial solutions (new creations) and edges represent parent-child connectivity satisfying the rules of the given problem domain. Two alternative extensions of BFS are examined in view of the cost function employed at the nodes to ultimately determine the optimal node in the search tree within a user-defined depth as the solution to the creativity problem. The first algorithm considers maximizing the diversity cost earned by a node with respect to its parent, while the second considers maximizing the difference between the diversity and the penalty cost earned by a node with respect to the root node. The significant contribution of the present research lies in ensuring diversity of the solutions during iterative expansions of the tree as well as the novelty of the optimal solution (best node) across runs of the same program. The relative performances of the two algorithms are compared in the context of their applicability. Performance analysis undertaken reveals that the proposed algorithms outperform their competitors with respect to three important metrics. The proposed algorithms have successfully been employed in developing chapter-end exercises for trigonometric identity proving problems.},

To address the challenge of directly solving the HJ equation, an event-triggered two-stage reinforcement learning strategy is proposed. Upon event triggering, each player’s switching law determines the optimal subsystem to switch to by minimizing the HJ equation. Subsequently, the corresponding learning law for each player updates its respective input via the determined optimal subsystem. The proposed algorithm achieves Nash equilibrium while ensuring system stability. Furthermore, Zeno behavior is avoided, and the computational and communication loads are reduced.

Then, a novel event-triggered cluster consensus protocol is designed for MASs with DoS attacks and structurally balanced signed digraphs, where Zeno behavior can be strictly excluded by the proposed triggering mechanism. Furthermore, to cope with the structurally unbalanced signed digraph, an improved event-triggered resilient consensus protocol is developed by introducing a pinning control strategy. By utilizing the piecewise Lyapunov functional approach, some sufficient conditions are derived for the cluster consensus under structurally balanced and unbalanced signed digraphs, while the selection principles of event-triggered parameters and resilient controller gains are obtained.

  abstract     = {Many industrial parks, which are connected to the main grid, have integrated renewable energy to reduce carbon emission for achieving the goal of Industry 5.0. However, the optimal scheduling is challenging due to fluctuations in renewable energy generation. Hydrogen, which plays an important role in the future development of the power grid in Industry 5.0, offers an attractive option to coordinate with the batteries. This work focuses on the day-ahead scheduling of a hydrogen-based microgrid for an industrial park. A day-ahead scheduling model is established by taking into consideration the detailed nonlinear energy conversion behavior of the electrolyzer and fuel cell, as well as the two-timescale property of a battery energy storage system (BESS) and the hydrogen system, including an electrolyzer, a hydrogen energy storage system (HESS), and a fuel cell. Note that the optimization problem is a mixed integer nonlinear programming, which is challenging to be solved. A novel multilearning rate reinforcement learning algorithm is proposed and its convergence is also proved based on two-timescale stochastic approximation theory. Simulation results, based on real-world traces in Belgium at a 15-min resolution, are presented, which shows that the proposed method has a higher reward, lower-operating costs and less computing time. It is also found that the shorter scheduling period for the BESS can lead to reduced operating costs by decreasing the required purchasing power and the renewable energy curtailment power.},

Initially, generative adversarial networks (GANs) are used to linearize agent dynamics under false data injection (FDI) attacks and external disturbances. Subsequently, a proportional-integral (PI) protocol is employed to achieve overall robust formation. We present rigorous theoretical analyses of both stages, demonstrating the guaranteed convergence of GANs training and the closed-loop formation errors. Our approach is directly validated through a series of physical experiments involving multi-quadrotors, demonstrating robustness against attacks and disturbances during formation flights, without the sim-to-real gap commonly encountered in learning-based control frameworks.},

Actually, in practical applications, the detailed information of Jacobian matrix is often not precisely known. Therefore, this article develops a novel data-driven recurrent neural network (RNN) model that can update the Jacobian matrix and joint angles. By defining two dynamic error functions, two RNN designed formulas are used to obtain a continuous RNN (CRNN) model. Subsequently, the CRNN model is discretized by using Euler forward formula, and a discrete RNN (DRNN) model is generated. Then, a classic sliding mode control (SMC) algorithm is introduced, and DRNN-SMC model is further proposed. Moreover, the corresponding rigorous mathematical derivation and proof are carried out. In addition, simulation tests are carried out by using the Kinova Gen2 manipulator, comparing the DRNN model and PD controller, as well as the DRNN-SMC model and DRNN model, validating the precision of the DRNN-SMC model. Additionally, practical experiments using the Kinova Gen3 manipulator are performed to showcase the applicability and versatility of the DRNN-SMC model.},

First, a human-machine collaborative driving system model that adapts to the characteristics of co-driving mode is built as the basis of the shared control scheme. Then, the unconscious competitive relationship of human-machine is described as the game interaction relationship, with optimal control strategies for both sides being deduced theoretically at the game equilibrium. Additionally, a dynamic adjustment strategy of driving authority considering the longitudinal speed is established based on the assessment of lateral and longitudinal risks. Finally, the driver-in-the-loop test and co-simulation results show that the proposed control strategy has achieved good performance in terms of path tracking, driver’s driving burden, and vehicle stability.},

Under the hierarchical Stackelberg-Nash differential game framework, the optimal control strategies are derived in sequence and further proved to compose the equilibrium points of Stackelberg-Nash differential games. Afterward, based on the ADP technique, a modified single-critic neural network (NN) is implemented and the coupled Hamilton-Jacobi–Bellman (HJB) equation is approximately identified. Under the proposed control scheme, the leader-follower consensus of the considered MAS can be achieved while consuming less control cost.

  abstract     = {Contrastive learning is a promising solution to the problem of data sparsity in the field of recommendation system since it is able to extract self-supervised signals from raw data. The traditional contrastive learning-based sequential recommendation algorithms generate augmentations of original item sequences by utilizing crop, mask and reorder operations. However, those augmentation schemes destroy the underlying semantics of item sequences, resulting in difficulty in accurately defining positive and negative samples. To address this issue, we propose a contrastive translation based sequential recommendation algorithm, namely, CT4Rec. Specifically, CT4Rec generates augmented views of item sequences by injecting noises into embeddings of users and items, which is able to guarantee that the underlying semantics of augmented views are consistent with those of original item sequence. Hence, CT4Rec is able to effectively learn the invariances among the augmented views. In addition, the personalized translation operations are utilized to model the third-order relationships among entities. Moreover, it is difficult for contrastive learning-based recommendation algorithms with static temperature to simultaneously capture the differences among individual users/items and among the clusters of users/items. Hence, we utilize a dynamic temperature strategy to enhance CT4Rec, which endows CT4Rec with the capabilities of group-wise discrimination and instance discrimination. Our validation on five benchmark datasets shows that CT4Rec outperforms SOTA sequential recommendation methods. Our code is released at https://github.com/zar123123/CT4Rec.},

  abstract     = {An online streaming feature selection (OSFS) model is highly efficient in processing the high-dimensional streaming features. In practical big data-related applications, streaming features are mostly highly-incomplete due to various unpredictable reasons like the privacy protection, leading to the issue of online sparse streaming feature selection (OS2FS). The incomplete streaming features can lead to the uncertain relationship between the labels and sparse features during the feature selection process, yet existing OSFS and OS2FS models focus on the certain relationships, resulting in accuracy loss by improperly-selected features. To address this critical issue, this article presents a three (3)-way decision-incorporated OS2FS (3WDO) model with the following two-fold ideas: 1) utilizing the latent factor analysis (LFA) approach to pre-estimate the missing data of the concerned sparse streaming features and 2) integrating the three-way decision (3WD) into the streaming features selection process for appropriately modeling the uncertainty within the label-feature interactions. By doing so, the uncertain relationships between labels and sparse features are characterized by more information and looser tolerance, thereby minimizing the decision risk of feature selection. Experimental results on twelve real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed 3WDO model significantly outperforms seven state-of-the-art OSFS and OS2FS models, which strongly supports its ability of addressing practical issues.},

  abstract     = {Cross-domain recommendation (CDR) is a promising paradigm inspired by transfer learning to solve the cold-start problem in recommender systems. Existing state-of-the-art CDR methods train an explicit mapping function to transfer the cold-start users from a data-rich source domain to a target domain. However, a limitation of these methods is that the mapping function is trained on overlapping users across domains, while only a small number of overlapping users are available for training. By visualizing the loss landscape of the existing CDR model, we find that training on a small number of overlapping users causes the model to converge to sharp minima, leading to poor generalization. Based on this observation, we leverage loss-geometry-based machine learning approach and propose a novel CDR method called sharpness-aware CDR (SCDR). Our proposed method simultaneously optimizes recommendation loss and loss sharpness, leading to better generalization with theoretical guarantees. Empirical studies on real-world datasets show that SCDR significantly outperforms other CDR models on cold-start recommendation tasks. Additionally, our method enhances the model’s robustness to adversarial attacks.},

  abstract     = {Growth of computing capacity at edge drives edge computing as an efficient computing model, and cloud computing is considered as an indispensable computing model as various cloud services emerge. However, edge computing performs gracelessly in persistent tasks and the tasks requiring dispersed data, whereas cloud computing is often accompanied with high latency. To deal with more complex network scenarios, we fuse the two computing models and propose cloud-edge-seamless system (CESS) which enables all infrastructures to orchestrate data as services in a 5G/6G network, realizing infrastructure as a service (IaaS). In CESS, raw data is processed on intermediate processing devices (IPDs) before reaches the cloud. Thereafter, we proposed OBRI scheme to minimize processing and routing delay in which IPD can orchestrate data as a service if it is busy and handle data roughly if it is idle, thus reducing data volumes and total delay according to IPD congestion. Furthermore, there is still a large number of flows queuing on downstream IPDs, then NOB scheme is proposed to reduce delay further, in which IPD sends notice to upstream IPDs when congestion occurs to restrict them to orchestrate data only. Thus, the flow velocity slows down and more flows are orchestrated as services upstream, resulting greater delay reduction. Extensive experimental results show that the proposed CESS is immensely efficient. OBRI and NOB can effectively reduce delay, balance load, and improve quality of experience (QoE). In addition, NOB provides great flexibility and is extremely suitable to process delay-sensitive data.},

To sustain this trend and maintain their long-term commitment to energy platforms, we face the challenge of aligning the primary psychological motivators of prosumers with our developed energy services. Most existing approaches target maximizing prosumer utility based on extrinsic benefits, such as economic rewards. However, the intrinsic motivations which are inherently satisfying for prosumers, have not been thoroughly analyzed. This article explores both extrinsic and intrinsic motivations of prosumers from a psychological perspective and addresses these within the technological field. Self-determination theory is adopted as a psychological framework to analyze prosumer behavior in energy systems. The study quantifies prosumers’ motivations and proposes a quality-of-energy-service measure to reflect individual preferences. Additionally, a leader-follower-based optimization framework is introduced, enabling individual prosumers to make optimal decisions regarding their energy management and trading strategies in a P2P energy market. The proposed system features a deep reinforcement learning agent as the leader, targeting optimal HEM solutions, while the follower aims to find the optimal trading strategy for prosumers in an auction-based P2P trading environment. Numerical results demonstrate that our proposed model outperforms baseline models.},

  abstract     = {Crowd management plays a crucial role in improving travel efficiency and reducing potential risks caused by overcrowding in large public places. Crowd control at entrances is a common way in our daily life to avoid overcrowding, but nowadays the control of crowd inflow at the entrances of public places mainly relies on manual operation. In this article, we intend to propose a dynamic crowd inflow control system (DRIFT) to avoid risks of overcrowding and improve the throughput of public places. First, we formulate an optimization problem that maximizes throughput by adjusting the crowd inflow rate of each entrance in the public place. Through mathematical analysis and related proofs, we introduce a baseline for the aforementioned problem that can calculate the upper bound of static inflow rate. With this baseline, we can easily measure the performance of other dynamic inflow control algorithms. Second, we treat the proposed optimization problem as a real-time decision-making problem, and further propose the DRIFT system based on deep reinforcement learning to address it. Specifically, the strategy of DRIFT is a basic actor-critic framework adapting a shared long short term memory (LSTM) layer to extract scene feature information. Third, we train it through proximal policy optimization (PPO) to improve learning performance. The environment for experiments is a crowd simulation model of OpenAI Gym structure based on real scene data from the 1F floor of the Chengdudong Railway Station and Xizhimen Railway Station. In comparison experiments and ablation experiments, the strategy of our DRIFT outperforms all other comparison strategies, including the most recent strategy using reinforcement learning, in term of system crowd throughput and robustness.},

  abstract     = {Role-based collaboration (RBC) is a novel problem-solving paradigm to facilitate collaboration. Group multirole assignment (GMRA), an extension of group role assignment (GRA), is a critical step in the RBC process, enabling the formation of efficient collaborative teams by reasonably assigning roles to agents. Recognized as a significant determinant impacting assignment and collaboration, conflict has been delineated and incorporated into GMRA. Nevertheless, the specified conflict is characterized as an oppositional conflict (OC), signifying that conflicting agents are engaged in conflict across the entirety of the role set. Rather than completely OC, which is highly specific, a more prevalent relationship involves conflict in certain aspects while remaining conflict-free in others. Therefore, we propose the concept of general conflict (GC) to describe the more common and realistic conflict relationship, offering a broader and novel perspective to depict conflict relationships. Then, we formalize these two problems by considering GC avoidance in GRA and GMRA, called GRA with GC (GRAGC) and GMRA with GC (GMRAGC), respectively. Furthermore, we establish the necessary conditions for the GRAGC and GMRAGC problems through a graph-theoretical lens, accompanied by a thorough analysis of their mathematical nature. Additionally, we propose practical solutions and refine methodologies to address both problems. The effectiveness of the improved algorithms utilizing necessary conditions is verified by simulations, which also provides evidence supporting the advantages of conflict avoidance.},

  abstract     = {Collaborative double boom cranes (CDBCs) play a crucial role in modern industries, offering superior hoisting capabilities and adaptability. However, the intricate dynamic characteristics of CDBCs, combined with demanding working requirements, pose significant challenges for control safety and efficiency. The existing control methods for CDBCs primarily focus on two-dimensional space and lack theoretical guarantees for rapid error convergence, which limits working efficiency. Furthermore, safety concerns arise when collision-free reference trajectories are unavailable or incomplete during dynamic operations. To this end, this article proposes a novel fixed-time tracking control method with obstacle avoidance and prescribed performance for three-dimensional (3-D) CDBCs. As the first collision-free tracking method for 3-D CDBCs, the proposed method stands as a noteworthy contribution aimed at improving safety, accuracy, and efficiency. By simultaneously considering pitch and rotation motions, the proposed method expands the working space and efficiency of 3-D CDBCs. Elaborately designed sliding surfaces ensure fixed-time convergence, thereby improving response speed. For safe complete trajectory tracking, the proposed method can limit transient tracking errors within a prescribed performance function, preventing collisions from unexpected errors. In scenarios with unavailable or incomplete safe reference trajectories, autonomous obstacle avoidance is achieved through potential function design, thereby enhancing operation safety. Additionally, a thorough closed-loop stability analysis is provided based on Lyapunov methods. Finally, experimental results on a built CDBC prototype offer validation for the tracking and obstacle avoidance performance of the proposed method under various working conditions.},

According to the processed model, we propose a novel predictive control algorithm for register control, incorporating a coupling-based selection algorithm to strategize the control weight matrix of the controller against the adverse effects of system coupling. The effectiveness and superior performance of CMB-MPC are demonstrated by experiments and comparisons, and the results indicate that CMB-MPC imparts three distinct advantages. First, it significantly reduces the computational complexity of traditional MPC controllers for the register control of R2R printing systems. Second, it achieves a remarkable enhancement in register accuracy within R2R printing systems, surpassing the capabilities of conventional MPC and fully decoupled proportional-differential control methods.

Triggered position data is used as feedback in the correction terms of ETFTGESO, which consequently reduces unnecessary communication or computational burden. The observer order is expanded by two additional states, which enhance the estimation accuracy. Then, a homogeneous output feedback controller is proposed to achieve finite-time stability of the vehicle. To improve the convergence rate of the position and velocity trajectories, the finite-time control law is updated by integrating a homogeneous integral sliding surface. Rigorous theoretical analysis verifies fast convergence, the influence of control parameters on bounded stable region, and accurate dynamic positioning.

  abstract     = {In the context of distribution inconsistent data classification, addressing distribution shift is crucial, typically accomplished through domain adaptation (DA) techniques. Once distributions are aligned between the source and target domains, the problem transforms into a conventional recognition task. This article introduces a new method called multitarget DA based on Evidence Theory (MET). For a given target domain, a random merger with other target domains is performed, generating distinct new target domains. Domain-invariant features corresponding to each new target domain are learned by minimizing distribution discrepancies separately between the source and different new target domains. The merging of target domains alters the distribution of the new target domain, leading to variations in the retained information within the learned domain-invariant features. For a query pattern in this target domain, multiple soft classification results (CCR) are obtained after aligning the distributions of the source and different new target domains. These soft CCR complement each other, and evidence theory is employed as a tool to represent and combine uncertain information, fusing these results. The weights for this fusion are automatically learned by minimizing the mean squared error between the combined results and the ground truth on labeled source domain data. The final class decision is determined through the weighted evidential combination of multiple pieces of soft CCR. MET is assessed on several datasets (i.e., Office+Caltech-10, VLSC, and V-RSIR) and compared to various advanced DA methods (e.g., GNN, MT, PAL, PTD, and so on) to validate its effectiveness. The experimental results demonstrate that MET usually can obtain a higher classification performance (i.e., the accuracy can be improved by 2% compared to many methods in most cases).},

The main difficulty affecting the accuracy of existing set membership estimation methods for fuzzy system is the inability to obtain accurate model information online due to the unmeasurable premise variables. Therefore, a fault detection method based on membership function dependent (MFD) ${\mathcal {L}}_{2}-{\mathcal {L}}_{\infty }/{\mathcal {H}}_{\infty }$ mixed performance observer and zonotopic analysis is proposed for discrete fuzzy systems with unmeasurable premise variables. First, a novel MFD ${\mathcal {L}}_{2}-{{\mathcal {L}}}_{\infty }/{{\mathcal {H}}}_{\infty }$ performance is proposed, which reduces the conservatism of the traditional approach and provides more freedom to design. Second, on the basis of the proposed performance, the design conditions for the fault detection observer adopting the T-N-L structure are given using fuzzy basis-dependent Lyapunov functions, taking into account the effect of imprecise premise variables. Further, the effects caused by disturbances in the error dynamics of the observer as well as imprecise premise variables are handled using zonotopic analysis. The estimation results of the states and outputs in zonotopic and interval forms are given and applied to fault detection. Finally, the simulation shows that the proposed method provides guaranteed estimation in the absence of system faults and facilitates rapid fault detection when the system is faulty.},

  abstract     = {In this article, the coordination control problem of discrete-time multiagent systems (MASs) affected by uncertainties, namely unknown initial states and external disturbances, is considered. Inspired by the interval observer constructed by the single system, the definition of distributed interval observer for discrete-time MASs is given, in which the control protocol of each agent obtained by solving a modified algebraic Riccati equation depends on the bounded information of the interval observer connected to itself and its neighbors. By the cooperativity theory and Lyapunov stability theory, it is established that the distributed interval observer can not only access some information about MASs at any instant, that is, the upper and lower bounds of each component of the agent state, but also realize the cooperative behavior of MASs under some essential conditions involving network synchronization and the unstable eigenvalue of the system matrix. In addition, with the help of a new time-varying transformation matrix, the new interval observer is constructed to eliminate the non-negative constraint. Finally, two numerical simulations are provided to confirm the validity of the derived results.},

First, the stable criterion is developed, by using the nabla Laplace transform. Compared with the existing case of $\alpha \in (0,1)$ , our work introduces a wide range of dynamic behaviors for future applications. Second, many essential properties are discussed for the developed criterion, including the changing trend of the stable/unstable region regarding the order, the containment relationship between the imaginary axis, the negative semi-axis and the stable region, the evolution of the modulus with the absolute value of argument for the point lying in the critical stable region. Third, the linear matrix inequality (LMI) condition is tentatively derived to evaluate the stability. Finally, the elaborated results are supported by three illustrative numerical examples.},

  abstract     = {The minimum error entropy (MEE) criterion closely relies on the quadratic information potential (QIP) estimates of Renyi’s entropy. Nevertheless, the conventional obtained QIP estimates are numerically unstable, especially when the error samples contain outliers, resulting in the optimal solution of the MEE criterion deviating from the target vector to a certain extent. To address this problem, we introduce the M-estimate method from robust statistics into the QIP estimation process; thus, a robust estimation method called instantaneous M-estimate QIP (IM-QIP) is proposed, and several important properties of IM-QIP are presented. The proposed IM-QIP estimates could be implemented simply while ensuring great robustness. Naturally, we further propose the corresponding instantaneous M-estimate MEE (IM-MEE) criterion and apply it to adaptive filtering. A robust recursive adaptive filtering algorithm, called the recursive IM-MEE (RIM-MEE) algorithm, is proposed and analyzed in this article, along with its stability and theoretical steady-state performance. Additionally, we demonstrate that the RIM-MEE algorithm achieves a smaller theoretical bound compared to the traditional MEE algorithm under heavy-tailed and skewed noise conditions. The simulation results revealed the robustness of the IM-QIP estimates and verified the theoretical expectations and superior performance of the RIM-MEE algorithm.},

However, the massive kernels, deep fusion, and heterogeneous ensemble mechanisms, which are the core of the three frameworks, respectively, lead to overfitting risks. Therefore, in this article, a novel convolution-based TSC algorithm multichannel-based multiview shallow fusion (MC-MSF) within a new shallow fusion ensemble-based MCF is proposed. MC-MSF enhances feature diversity, quality, and classifier diversity while suppressing the overfitting risks via three shallow components. For feature diversity, the original series is mapped to the connected multichannel series spaces, and then diverse pooling features are extracted via a single-layer convolution with fewer kernels. For feature quality, the power of proportion of positive values (PPPV) features with adaptive powers are extracted based on alternating gradient descent, and the multiview shallow feature fusion is implemented to generate fused features. For classifier diversity, diverse linear classifiers are trained on the combined multiview feature vectors to ensemble homogeneously. The state-of-the-art TSC accuracy is achieved by MC-MSF via the sequential operation of three effective shallow components, as verified by comparative experiments on the public UCR and real excavator fault diagnosis application datasets.},

Unlike existing linear attacks that neglect the autocorrelation of attack signals, OLS attacks with colored noises are more destructive while eliminating their impact on the residuals. By leveraging eigendecomposition and matrix splitting methods, explicit solutions for optimal attacks are derived by solving two distinct optimization problems. To illustrate the superiority of such attack behaviors, we further investigate OLS attacks with colored noises and historical innovations, where the leverage of historical data is maximized to enhance attack performances. Finally, we provide an illustration of the effectiveness of these attacks through an example of an uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV).},

In addition, a breakthrough detector and regulator based on the human force reaction process are advised to repress the positional overshooting deriving from force jump at the moment of tissue breakthrough. This method enhances the manipulating smoothness and suppresses puncture needle overshooting. The overshooting is compensated accordingly by the proposed regulator and surgical risk is lowered.

  abstract     = {Federated Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) has received considerable attention due to the increasing need for privacy-conscious data analysis across diverse domains and sources in many real-world applications. Recent developments in federated FCM, however, are still in their infancy and largely unexplored. These methods struggle to handle nonindependent and identically distributed (non-iid) data. Moreover, critical hyperparameters, such as the number of iterations for local updates, are typically set manually, which can significantly affect the performance of federated clustering. To address these challenges, we introduce an Adaptive Federated FCM with an auxiliary model, named AF-FCM. In this approach, prior information from the auxiliary model, along with a proximal term in the local objective, mitigates the effects of the non-iid environment, enhancing both model robustness and effectiveness. Critical hyperparameters are adaptively adjusted using a proposed adaptive particle swarm optimization (APSO) algorithm, guided by a carefully designed fitness function. Within APSO, a nonlinear regression function adjusts the inertia weight, reducing the risk of convergence to local optima. In AF-FCM, global prototypes are refined using momentum gradient descent (MGD). Numerical experiments highlight the effectiveness and generalization performance of AF-FCM across various conditions, including heterogeneity variations, the number of clients, and the number of clusters. Comparative analysis against state-of-the-art federated clustering baseline methods validates the competitive performance of AF-FCM.},

However, traditional GNNs are primarily designed based on the homophily assumption, which means that they show poor performance on heterophilic networks where dissimilar nodes prefer to connect. To address this issue, several heterophilic GNNs have been proposed that employ techniques, such as extending local neighbors and improving GNN architectures. From another perspective, recent studies have shown that, unlike homophilic GNNs, heterophilic GNNs exhibit higher robustness against graph adversarial attacks. In these attacks, the attackers try to inject small perturbations into the graph. Therefore, in this study, we delve into the core designs of heterophilic GNNs, including high-order neighbor, potential neighbor, ego-neighbor separation, and interlayer combination designs. We further analyze the influence of these key designs on the robustness of GNNs. We conducted comprehensive experiments to compare the impact of different designs on baseline and real-world GNN models. The findings of this work can serve as a reference for future studies aiming to design more robust and universal GNNs.},

Taking the bandwidth-limited situation into account, the model of bit-rate constraints and the encoding-decoding strategy are employed to reflect the principles of resource allocation and data schedule. Moreover, two Bernoulli sequences are adopted to depict the topologies switched stochastically and the deception attacks occurred randomly. A novel optimized SEBRCs method for NCDNs is proposed such that, for both stochastic topological structures and deception attacks, the covariance upper bound of estimation error can be derived and the estimator parameter can be determined accordingly. It is worth mentioning that both the related effects caused by attack probability and bit-rate constraints onto estimation performance are clarified from the monotonicity analysis perspectives, where new analysis method is given. Besides, a sufficient criterion is given to guarantee the uniform mean-square boundedness of the obtained covariance upper bound. Finally, the applicability of the presented SEBRCs method is demonstrated via solving the indoor localization problem with multiple mobile robots.},

To address this issue, we investigate a privacy protection scheme based on multifeature fusion tensor (PPS-MFFT). Different from previous studies using a single feature or simple combination of several features, for every face image, PPS-MFFT first constructs a multifeature fusion tensor through hierarchically exploiting the correlations and complementarity between deep-learning features and those handcrafted features for stronger robustness and transferability. Further, on the basis of such tensors, the target images are reasonably chosen to enhance the camouflage effects while maintaining the visual similarities for final perturbed images, which are generated by means of developing a new optimization model for better tradeoff between effectiveness and practicability. Finally, the measurement results validate that both higher protective efficacy (e.g., 16% more in misidentifying the original face images) and acceptable visual effects can be obtained by PPS-MFFT when compared to the existing methods, and thus demonstrate the generality and applicability of our scheme.},

  abstract     = {Robust knowledge acquisition approaches are one of the research hotspots in data mining. The fuzzy dominance rough sets (FDRS) model is an important knowledge acquisition tool for ordinal classification tasks. However, it has been proved in practice that this model usually performs poorly fault tolerance, and only one noisy sample can cause huge interference in acquiring knowledge. Attribute reduction is one of the nontrivial applications of the FDRS. At present, most attribute reduction methods for ordinal classification tasks mainly focus on the dependence of decision to attributes, while ignoring the information provided by the separability of classes and the correlation of attributes for ordinal classification. In view of these two issues, this article first proposes a robust FDRS model with filterable noise samples. Then, the class-separability and attribute-correlation are explored in robust fuzzy dominance rough approximation space, and corresponding attribute evaluation index is designed. Finally, an attribute reduction algorithm is designed to select the attribute subset with the highest classification performance. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm has better robustness and classification performance.},

An optimization model based on these two games results in a consensus model with maximum linear-quadratic payoffs and minimum adjustment (MPMACM). In the proposed MPMACM, the moderator provides compensation strategies and feedback suggestions to guide the DMs to reach the desired consensus level with minimum adjustment, while the DMs adjust their opinions aiming to obtain their maximum payoffs.

By developing backstepping, an event-triggered switched NN observer, event-triggered adaptive NN controllers of subsystems and three novel switching dynamic event-triggering mechanisms (ETMs) are constructed. Multiple event-triggering communications from sensor to controller and observer to controller and controller to actuator are thus achieved under arbitrary switchings. Naturally, more communication burdens can be reduced compared with those existing single or dual event-triggering communications methods for non-switched and switched systems. Note that one difficulty caused by dual asynchronous switchings among candidate subsystems and candidate controllers and candidate observers is overcome. Also, other difficulties caused by finding an adjustable positive lower bound of interexecution times for each ETM and the errors between continuous-time and sampled-data-based basis function vectors of NNs are overcome. A switched one-link robotic manipulator system is employed to illustrate the validity of the scheme developed.},

Our research introduces a refined framework tailored for complex constrained multiobjective evolutionary optimization. The methodology conducts an initial strong-weak analysis to categorize constraints and merges each strong constraint with all weak constraints to form subsets. Each subset, combined with the original objective functions, defines a subproblem. Independent optimization of the original problem and subproblems is carried out by utilizing multiple populations. Information acquired from the subproblems’ populations is transferred into the population of the original issue, thereby expediting the detection of the feasible region and simplifying the resolution of the original problem. The efficacy of our innovative algorithm, when benchmarked against traditional constrained multiobjective evolutionary algorithms across 72 test functions, has demonstrated superior convergence, diversity, and competitiveness.},

This inherent instability poses a significant challenge to traditional incremental-consensus-based distributed optimization or game methods, which rely on a stable and consistent agent population to compute and maintain equilibrium solutions effectively. The necessity for these methods to continuously enforce constraints and the time-intensive process of recalculating equilibria in response to agent dynamics present a substantial bottleneck in the optimization of OMASs. To address this challenge, we develop an innovative incremental consensus-based distributed (ICBD) algorithm to achieve the dynamic Nash equilibrium (NE) for constrained noncooperative game of OMASs. The ICBD algorithm leverages predefined-time stability and integral sliding-mode control to enable rapid recalibration to new equilibria and maintain constraints without the need for prolonged recalculations.

Then, a general class of EZGS dynamics is developed to address equation-constrained distributed optimization, where an auxiliary dynamics is introduced to ensure the final ZGS property from any initialization. It is demonstrated that for typical consensus protocols and auxiliary dynamics, the proposed EZGS dynamics can achieve the performance with exponential/finite/fixed/prescribed-time (PT) convergence. Particularly, the nonlinear consensus protocols for finite-time EZGS algorithms allow for heterogeneous power coefficients. Significantly, the proposed PT EZGS dynamics is continuous, uniformly bounded, and capable of reaching the optimal solution in a single stage. Furthermore, the barrier method is employed to handle the inequality constraints effectively. Finally, the efficiency and performance of the proposed algorithms are validated through numerical examples, highlighting their superiority over existing methods.

Because of the switching character of the CDS with DoS attacks, some well-known data-driven control methods can not be used directly. To tackle this issue, a new relationship between the dormancy and activation periods of DoS attacks is built, which offers a more reasonable description of DoS attacks. Additionally, in the presence of measurement noise, a novel lemma (Lemma 3) is introduced to establish a data-based representation of CDSs using noisy measurement data. Without the need of explicit system parameter identification, stabilization criteria and control gain matrix are derived solely based on the input-state data.

In addition, adaptive dynamic programming (ADP) is introduced and reversible datasets are designed to obtain optimal parameters with unknown drift dynamics. This design achieves model-free control of optimal output feedback for heterogeneous multiagent systems. Finally, the effectiveness of the control schemes is validated using F-16 aircraft and 4-wheel autonomous vehicles as examples.},

The interval type-2 Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy model is adopted to accurately characterize the nonlinear feature in investigated systems and effectively capture uncertain parameters via membership functions. It should be noticed that a new framework comprising a special PDT switching strategy is proposed for distributed DoS attacks with energy limitation. Accordingly, the controlled system is converted into a complex and constrained PDT-switched system. Subsequently, based on weak multi-Lyapunov functions, membership-function-dependent sufficient criteria are offered for judging the globally uniformly exponential stability of the researched closed-loop system, from which the gains of the observer and the controller can be computed. Finally, an algorithm generating PDT switching sequences for distributed DoS attacks is proposed, and simulations are given to substantiate the usability of the developed approach.},

  abstract     = {It remains a challenge to improve the accuracy of impedance rendering while ensuring stability under strong impacts during human-robot interaction. In this work, we aim to render the desired impedance for the flexible joint under an admittance control scheme with prescribed performance function (PPF). Specially, Gaussian kernels are introduced as the slack terms for PPF, so that the control stability can be maintained in the presence of abrupt external torques. Meanwhile, a narrower error envelope is yielded when such torques are absent, which also improves the fidelity of the desired impedance model. To achieve the prescribed tracking performance of the inner position loop, a two-stage backstepping control is proposed by defining two first-order composite error surfaces bridged by a second-order dynamic surface. This promulgates the minimum number of backstepping stages under the available state feedback, thus avoiding “explosion of terms.” In addition, dual-adaptive neural networks are incorporated into the backstepping control to compensate for the matched and unmatched disturbances. Real-time experiments are conducted to validate the appeal of the proposed method.},

To enhance the efficiency of communication resource utilization, an event-triggering mechanism is designed by employing a saturation function. This mechanism allows for the application of three existing triggering strategies in multiple spacecraft systems. Then, a novel asymmetric fractional barrier Lyapunov function (BLF) guarantees adherence to time-varying constraints while addressing the issue of excessive control amplitude associated with large constraint boundaries in conventional logarithmic BLFs (LBLFs).

In this article, without converting signed graph into corresponding unsigned structure via the gauge transformation, the bipartite complete synchronization of heterogeneous fractional networks is explored. Above all, a mathematic model of fractional networks with signed topology and heterogeneous nodes’ dynamics is introduced, in which the topological graph possesses both negative and positive edges to illustrate the competition and cooperation between individuals, and the desired synchronized state is an arbitrarily specified smooth orbit and not necessarily the decoupled state. Additionally, two innovative control schemes with logarithmic quantizer are developed, and several conditions are obtained to reach bipartite complete synchronization of fractional heterogeneous networks just by virtue of the Laplacian matrix of the original signed graph rather than the traditional technique of gauge transformation. The theoretical analysis is eventually confirmed by several numerical results.},

The proposed adaptive barrier-function global PID-type control method is designed to handle both matched and unmatched uncertainties and adjust the control parameters in real time to account for changes in system dynamics and perturbations. It efficiently handles both matched and mismatched uncertainties, ensuring precise tracking performance even amid uncertain dynamics and disturbances. The methodology dynamically adjusts control parameters in real time to accommodate changes in system dynamics, enhancing adaptability and performance. The globality of the suggested controller ensures the absence of a reaching phase and establishes the presence of the sliding mode around the surface right from the beginning. The proposed method has also been expanded to address uncertain dynamic systems with both matched and unmatched disturbances, while accounting for actuator faults and input saturation. The efficacy of the proposed methodology is demonstrated through simulation studies and experimental results on a rotary inverted pendulum (RIP) system, showcasing rapid convergence and exceptional tracking capabilities in practical scenarios. The contributions of this research lie in presenting a novel methodology that significantly contributes to the field of nonlinear control systems, offering a robust framework capable of addressing uncertainties in complex nonlinear systems. The results show that the method achieves fast convergence and excellent tracking performance in the presence of uncertainties and disturbances.

Second, an integral sliding hyperplane is formulated within the estimation space, which serves as the foundation for deriving the sliding mode dynamics, ensuring robustness against disturbances. Recognizing the diversity of transition rates (TRs), an elastic sliding mode controller is designed to accommodate three distinct types of TRs, which is also strategically designed to guarantee reachability and maintain sliding motion. Third, stochastic stability with an $H_{\infty }$ attenuation level is conducted separately for each type of TR. Correspondingly, the development of an algorithm for determining threshold parameters in triggered conditions is presented. Simultaneously, a proof of the nonexistence of Zeno behavior is provided, ensuring the stability and efficiency of the proposed system.

Furthermore, attackers necessarily remain furtive, i.e., their presence should not be discovered by the operator. In order to describe the set of all possible furtive attacks, a joint furtive diagnoser is established. We prove that an LPN under the above attacks is diagnosable if and only if its joint furtive diagnoser does not have the cycles composed of pairs of either faulty states and normal states, or faulty states and uncertain states.

Main objective of this research is to propose a novel neural network-based framework, enhanced by a metaheuristic approach, to achieve robust energy prediction in the context of mobile app development. The metaheuristic approach here aims to achieve two goals: 1) identifying suitable learning algorithms and their corresponding hyperparameters, and 2) determining the optimal number of layers and neurons within each layer. Moreover, due to limitations in accessing certain aspects of a mobile phone, there might be missing data in the data set, and the proposed framework can handle this. In addition, we conducted an optimal algorithm selection strategy, employing 13 base and advanced metaheuristic algorithms, to identify the best algorithm based on accuracy and resistance to missing values. The representation in our proposed metaheuristic algorithm is variable-size, meaning that the length of the candidate solutions changes over time. We compared the algorithms based on the architecture found by each algorithm at different levels of missing values, accuracy, F-measure, and stability analysis. Additionally, we conducted a Wilcoxon signed-rank test for statistical comparison of the results. The extensive experiments show that our proposed approach significantly improves energy consumption prediction. Particularly, the JADE algorithm, a variant of differential evolution (DE), DE, and the covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy deliver superior results under various conditions and across different missing value levels.},

Besides the primary membership function that exists for interval type-2 fuzzy systems (IT2FSs), the IT3FSs possess the secondary membership function to handle the overall uncertainty which enacts the superiority of the proposed work. Notably, the adequate stability criteria are derived in the form of linear matrix inequality (LMI) using the Lyapunov stability theorem. Additionally, the convex relaxation technique is used to strengthen the design flexibility and achieve the faster convergence rate, which converts an optimization problem with a vector variable to a convex program with a matrix variable, via a lifting technique. A noteworthy aspect is that the application of the convex relaxation technique in the context of IT3FSs is proposed for the first time in literature. Finally, the comparative results between IT2FSs and IT3FSs are shown via two illustrative examples, including the inverted-pendulum model, to underscore the efficacy and practical implementations of the developed control methodology.},

However, elderly human subjects are facing significant challenges when attempting to perform grasping task. In this regard, a hand exoskeleton with a proper force control strategy is necessary to improve the performance of assistive technology. In this article, a lightweight, size-adjustable, underactuated, and force-controllable two-fingered exoskeleton prototype is developed for grasping assistance. A novel radial basis function network-based indirect adaptive force controller for robust grasping assistance is proposed along with the prototype design. We have conducted real-time grasping experiments on six elderly human subjects to verify the feasibility of the developed exoskeleton with a novel grasping force control strategy. Furthermore, we have performed force trajectory tracking experiment to validate the efficacy of the proposed force control scheme. Moreover, the robustness of the proposed grasping force control strategy has been validated through a disturbance rejection experiment. Extensive simulation and experimental studies with the developed kinematic model and feasibility tests involving elderly human subjects show that the newly developed hand exoskeleton with the proposed robust intelligent control strategy is efficient for object-grasping tasks aimed at the assistance of elderly human subjects.},

In this article, we propose cross-domain random pretraining with prototypes (CRPTpro), a novel, efficient, and effective self-supervised cross-domain RL pretraining framework. CRPTpro decouples data sampling from encoder pretraining, proposing decoupled random collection to easily and quickly generate a qualified cross-domain pretraining dataset. Moreover, a novel prototypical self-supervised algorithm is proposed to pretrain an effective visual encoder that is generic across different domains. Without finetuning, the cross-domain encoder can be implemented for challenging downstream tasks defined in different domains, either seen or unseen. Compared with recent advanced methods, CRPTpro achieves better performance on downstream policy learning without extra training on exploration agents for data collection, greatly reducing the burden of pretraining. We conduct extensive experiments across multiple challenging continuous visual-control domains, including balance control, robot locomotion, and manipulation. CRPTpro significantly outperforms the next best Proto-RL(C) on 11/12 cross-domain downstream tasks with only 54.5% wall-clock pretraining time, exhibiting state-of-the-art pretraining performance with greatly improved pretraining efficiency.},

  abstract     = {A secret sharing scheme is an important cryptographic procedure that enables the secure distribution of secret information, such as private images, in an untrusted network. However, in all secret sharing schemes, the sizes of the shares increase in proportion to the size of the secret information, because they involve computationally expensive polynomials of degree $n-1$ (n is total number of shares) and increasingly large modulus of modulo operations for security. Moreover, with large share sizes, it is not easy in practice to encrypt them quickly using block cipher algorithms. Therefore, ensuring the security of secret sharing for large-scale visual data with a reasonable share length and efficiently encrypting n shares properly represents formidable challenges. To overcome these challenges in secret sharing schemes, we propose new multiparty random phase wrapping secret sharing systems for visual datasets. Computational optical imaging enables the acquisition of wrapped phase information, ranging from – $\pi $ to $\pi $ , to be expressed in the form of a complex sinusoidal waveform. The proposed scheme allows for large-scale secret data—such as confidential digital images and visual data, including optical images—to be securely and efficiently shared and distributed to multiple parties or agencies utilizing a digital representation of a complex sinusoidal waveform of the secret information. The proposed scheme can be useful in cryptographic key escrow systems and in use with large-scale secret data.},

The goals are to enhance operator safety as well as well-being and, at the same time, to improve efficiency and reduce production costs. To these aims, the speed and separation monitoring (SSM) operation method is employed for the first time in HDI, drawing an analogy to the safety requirements outlined in collaborative robots’ ISO standards. The so-called protective separation distance is used to ensure the safety of operators engaged in collaborative tasks with drones. In addition, we employ the rapid upper limb assessment (RULA) method to evaluate the ergonomic posture of operators during interactions with drones. To validate the proposed approach in a realistic industrial setting, a quadrotor is deployed for pick-and-delivery tasks along a predefined trajectory from the picking bay to the palletizing area, where the interaction between the drone and a moving operator takes place. The drone navigates toward the interaction space while avoiding collisions with shelves and other drones in motion. The control strategy for the drone cruise navigation integrates simultaneously the time-variant artificial potential field (APF) technique for trajectory planning and the iterative linear quadratic regulator (LQR) controller for trajectory tracking. Differently, in the descent phase, the receding horizon LQR algorithm is employed to follow a trajectory planned in accordance with the SSM, which starts from the approach point at the border of the interaction space and ends in the volume with the operator’s minimum RULA. The presented control strategy facilitates drone management by adapting the drone’s position to changes in the operator’s position while satisfying HDI safety requirements. The results of the proposed HDI framework simulations for the case study demonstrate the effectiveness of the method in ensuring a safe and ergonomic HDI within industrial warehouses.},

  abstract     = {Graffiti detection is essential in historic building protection and urban neighborhood management. Graffiti detection has made significant progress in recent years based on the development of deep learning. However, small-scale graffiti, interference from the background, and the false detection of word parts in graffiti make it a challenging problem. This article proposes a Transformer-based high-precision graffiti detection method, namely DIG. Precisely, it consists of three modules: 1) Spatial query selection (SQS), scale-aware IoU loss (SIL); 2) Denoising Task with binary contrastive denoising (BCDN); and 3) IoU-guided box denoising (IBD) modules. To detect small-scale graffiti, this paper proposes SIL to help the loss function to perceive small-scale graffiti and large-scale graffiti fairly. To reduce the false detection of word parts, this article presents the SQS module, which integrates spatial information into the query selection process of the Encoder to filter out falsely detected bounding boxes within the graffiti. To reduce the interference from the background, this article introduces a denoising task with BCDN and IBD modules, improving the model’s ability to distinguish graffiti from the background and accurately select appropriate bounding boxes. A large number of experimental results on the STORM dataset show that our method achieves state-of-the-art results with an $AP_{50}$ of 87.9%. Moreover, DIG achieved competitive results on the FineFM dataset for mask detection. This indicates that DIG can also be conveniently transferred to detect other scenarios.},

In what follows, with the aid of the parallel distributed compensation fuzzy control scheme, the main results of stability analysis and controller synthesis for the closed-loop re-entrant manufacturing control system are derived using a timer-dependent Lyapunov functional with spatio-temporal auxiliary variables. It is found that by means of the proposed fault-tolerant control approach, the RMS can be effectively and robustly driven to a desired production mode with steady feeding and production rates while the upper bound of a quadratic cost function is minimized.

To achieve the expected tracking performance, the design philosophy focuses on developing a prescribed finite-time performance function (PFTPF), capable of preassigning the convergence time and accuracy precisely beforehand. The explored adaptive control algorithm can ensure that the whole signals concerning the closed-loop MASs remain bounded while the bipartite consensus errors converge to a predetermined range around zero within the prescribed finite time.

A novel dynamic ETM is skillfully developed based on the information of quantization and two internal dynamic adjusting variables to further enhance the network bandwidth utilization. The dual asynchronous phenomenon between the plant and controller (asynchronous modes and mismatched premise variables) is addressed. This implies that the designed controller is not required to share the same membership functions and modes as the plant, establishing a more rational structure. The hidden semi-Markov model (HSMM) is attained to characterize the stochastic varying channel fading amplitudes. The Lyapunov function incorporating mode and fuzzy information is constructed to establish sufficient criteria ensuring the strictly dissipative performance and mean-square exponential stability (MSES) of the resulting closed-loop systems, and a new security fuzzy dual asynchronous controller is then developed.

  abstract     = {In evolutionary robotics (ER), the evolution of a robot’s morphology (i.e., physical structure) or controller (i.e., control algorithm or instruction sequence) often entails tackling an extensive number of tasks. The use of evolutionary multitasking (EMT) in ER, which optimizes multiple tasks simultaneously by reusing potentially useful knowledge across diverse tasks, could improve the performance of problem-solving to each task. However, existing EMT methods do not fully use intertask correlations, limiting knowledge sharing. In view of this, this study introduces a novel framework, termed adaptive group-based collaborative optimization, tailored for handling optimization problems involving a large number of tasks within the ER domain simultaneously. The proposed framework divides tasks into groups according to their similarity and then proceeds through two principal stages, namely, intergroup knowledge separation and intragroup knowledge reunion. During intergroup knowledge separation stage, an adaptive method for selecting crossover operators enables source tasks to share useful knowledge to the target task across groups. During intragroup knowledge reunion stage, an adaptive knowledge combination strategy facilitates the target task in assimilating knowledge from multiple sources intragroup. We validated the efficacy of the proposed framework in both planar manipulators and hexapod robot experiments. The results indicate that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art algorithms (i.e., MME, MMKT) on several metrics (e.g., mean fitness and quality diversity metrics). The proposed method can effectively improve the effectiveness and diversity of solutions in solving ER problems with a large number of tasks (e.g., 5 000 or 10 000), and has broad potential in practical ER applications.},

This method enables autonomous decision-making and game equilibrium in group decision scenarios, considering individual preferences amidst constraints like incomplete information and alliance limitations. Leveraging the complementary entropy theorem on superiority, inferiority, and fuzzy measures, we propose a cognitive model for information interaction and attribute fusion. Utilizing the ordered weighted averaging operator and average tree solutions aids in identifying optimal alliance structures. We subsequently discuss evaluating missing information to complete the topological network. Updating the cognitive model and value function, we develop a Gaussian oscillation heuristic algorithm to explore alliance and component strategy spaces. Simulation results are provided and analyzed to illustrate the performance and effectiveness of our approach.},

  abstract     = {This article presents a novel approach to improving multitarget searching in unknown environments using multirobot systems while ensuring adaptability to changing communication conditions. The proposed method addresses challenges arising from limited scope, dynamic circumstances, and inaccurate decision data due to communication disruptions or interference in real-world scenarios. A comprehensive environmental map is generated using a grid-based mapping methodology, encompassing data related to obstacles, coverage, target occupancy, and communication conditions. Considering the constraints imposed by communication conditions, we develop the adaptive communication condition hierarchical distributed model predictive control framework. This framework incorporates a hierarchical communication strategy for multirobot target search. To assess the effectiveness of our approach, a series of comparative experiments are conducted on three distinct maps, each characterized by unique communication environments, obstacle layouts, and target distributions. These experiments employ four commonly used swarm intelligence algorithms. The research findings indicate that implementing the proposed search framework and communication strategy significantly reduces the time and communication costs associated with locating targets in complex and unfamiliar environments. This is particularly relevant for multirobot systems operating under diverse and limited communication conditions, substantially increasing the task’s success rate.},

Subsequently, an adaptive power-law algorithm is designed to realize local FXT optimization for each agent with arbitrary initial state. In the convergence analysis, unlike previous analysis method based on Lyapunov FXT stability criteria, this study employs the definition of FXT stability with Laplace transformation and a method of contradiction, several sufficient conditions are obtained to ensure that the states of all agents converge to the global optimal value within a fixed time, and the upper bound of convergence time is estimated. Furthermore, these adaptive algorithms on undirected graphs are extended to weight-balanced digraphs.

For real-world applications, since the field sensor equipped on the mobile agents for local information detection and estimation has some limited detecting range, it is necessary to guarantee that the nearby agents must stay within this range of the onboard sensor. This is called sensory connectivity maintenance. A function termed as coordination function with sensory connectivity maintenance (CFSCM) is defined to describe the performances of the coordination as well as the sensory connectivity status between the agents. Then, a general control strategy is designed based on the proposed CFSCM for spatial coordination of multiple nonholonomic agents with sensory connectivity maintenance. Moreover, the applications of the proposed control strategy for formation with omnidirectional sensors and flocking with directional sensors are shown, respectively.

Further, by constructing a strict Lyapunov function, it is demonstrated that the two stable equilibria are exponentially stable.

First, a predefined time error transformation function (PTETF) is developed and combined with a barrier function based on constant value constraints for control design, which not only significantly simplifies the derivation process of the proposed predefined time prescribed performance control (PTPPC), but also equips it with the ability of global constraints on the trajectory tracking error. Then, we utilize the fuzzy logic system (FLS) with a single-parameter update mechanism to compensate for the dynamic uncertainty of manipulators, thereby reducing computational complexity and cost. In addition, a fixed time disturbance observer (FxTDOB) is introduced to alleviate the effect of nonparametric disturbances on the tracking performance.

How to break through the bottleneck of data-drive models in terms of limited labeled data and high computational complexity should be one of the main recent focuses in the field of industrial soft sensing. In this article, a deep co-training PLS (deep CT-PLS) model is proposed to extend the ordinary PLS model to the semi-supervised deep form. While the deep model can efficiently extract inherent natures of process data, the co-training strategy makes lots of unlabeled data useful through a two-view cross training and annotation process. In this case, the performance restriction of the deep PLS model can be greatly relieved, with the incorporation of additional unlabeled data, while at the same time the designed model structure keeps in a low computational complexity.

Fine-grained textural features are captured from the wavelet components by the convolution module. A transformer block identifies the relevant activation maps within the volumes, followed by self-attention to effectively learn long-range dependencies to capture the global context of the target regions. A cross-attention mechanism effectively combines the distinctive features acquired by both modules to produce a comprehensive and robust representation of the input data. WaveCoformer outperforms related state-of-the-art networks in publicly available Synapse and Adrenal tumor segmentation datasets, with a mean Dice score of 83.86% and 79%, respectively.

Traditionally, in the remote state estimation with the innovation or raw measurement case, denial of service (DoS) and false data injection (FDI) attacks are investigated thoroughly. Notably, for remote state estimation with local estimate cases considered in this article, most existing works consider DoS attacks but not FDI attacks, negatively affecting remote state estimation performance. Furthermore, current detection mechanisms encounter challenges when identifying such attacks due to the unavailable innovation or raw measurement. As such, we study FDI attacks under this framework and provide the corresponding secure analysis using a dual-perspective approach. Specifically, we propose a detector to detect such attacks using the prior information extracted from the remote estimator. Then, we analyze the existence of stealthy attacks and characterize the corresponding performance evaluation for the remote estimation under such attacks. Following this, we construct the optimal attack scheme, maximizing the expected average and terminal estimation error covariances, respectively. To reduce the above vulnerability, we develop a co-design transmission strategy and offer an analytical detection performance evaluation under different attack scenarios.

  abstract     = {In environments where intelligent video surveillance systems (IVSSs) are deployed, particularly in review room, the detection of electronic devices constitutes a crucial task. Nevertheless, this task presents significant challenges attributed to the high rates of false positives and false negatives in electronic device detection (EDD), compounded by the low resolution of objects when viewed from multiple angles.To address these challenges, we propose a deep learning-based cascaded detection framework. Specifically, we design a mixed region sampling (MRS) method to enhance the foreground perception with background information and image details. We design a nonstrided downsampling method (ASDP) to map the attention spatial features to depth and improve the detection of low-resolution objects with fine-grained features. We enhance the model’s robustness to different viewing angles by feature perturbation during training. Moreover, we use a cascaded strategy to reduce false positives. To evaluate our method, we construct a real review room dataset (EDD) with 28,000 images from multiple angles. Our method improves the multiview generalization performance by 4.48% mAP and 5.62% mAR. On the public datasets Pascal VOC-2007 and visDrone-2019, our method is also superior to other suboptimal methods. We propose a framework for review environment detection, which is accurate, fast, and generalizable to other scenarios.},

  abstract     = {Due to various reasons, outliers, ambient noise and missing data inevitably exist in the industrial processes, and thus the robustness is important when establishing monitoring models. In this study, a robust dissimilarity analytics model (RDAM) is established with Laplace distribution to detect process anomalies in noisy environment. Because of the heavy-tailed characteristic of Laplace distribution, the proposed RDAM method is more robust to ambient noise and outliers when compared to Gaussian distribution-based models. Besides, the missing data problem is also considered and solved in the model development procedure. Using the variational Bayesian inference, the model parameters and latent variables of the RDAM model can be estimated. After that, a monitoring strategy is designed based on the obtained results with both static and dynamic statistics. By this means, both the static deviation of the current sample and the temporal correlation within the process data can be effectively revealed. A simulated example and a real low-pressure heater process are adopted to illustrate the performance of the proposed RDAM method. Specifically, the proposed RDAM method is robust to the ambient noise and missing values, and it has better detection sensitivity for the process anomalies than the selected comparison methods.},

The pursuer copes not only with its maneuverability constraint but also with the target’s deception behavior, in which the target deliberately conceals its private preference information. The target capture game involving deception behavior is formulated as a nonlinear differential game framework where the information structure is incomplete and asymmetric. The solution to this differential game is proposed based on an RL policy that incorporates critic, actor, and virtual actor neural networks (NNs), when taking into consideration the maneuverability constraint and information structure of the pursuer. Moreover, the states of the constrained adversarial system and the weight errors are proven to be ultimately uniformly bounded (UUB). To counter the deception of the target, we adopt unscented Kalman filter (UKF) to obtain the target intention on energy preference, and integrate it into the pursuer strategy. The feasibility of the proposed strategy and its superiority are verified through comparisons with recent works.},

  abstract     = {The industrial system usually contains not only controllable variables (CVs) but also uncontrollable variables (unCVs), e.g., weather conditions and friction. These unCVs have a direct impact on system control performance. Despite the success of current deep reinforcement learning (DRL) control algorithms, most of them neglect the impact of unCVs, which can cause the deterioration of control performance and instability of the system. To perceive and eliminate the impact of unCVs, a performance-aware self-optimizing universal controller (PASOUC) is designed in this article. The PASOUC aims at integrating the representation of unCVs and controller design to perceive and eliminate the impact of unCVs under different conditions, which goes beyond most existing control methods. Technically, a historical trajectory-inspired control performance perceptron is developed to perceive the impact of unCVs on system control performance under different conditions. Subsequently, a new performance-aware reward is designed to integrate the representation of unCVs and controller design while training the DRL controller. In addition, the domain randomization (DR) training strategy is employed to learn a universal control policy, which can access the approximate optimal trajectory under nonideal conditions. In this way, the impact of unCVs can be eliminated. To handle the low efficiency of the DR training, the policy improvement-policy proximal optimization (PI-PPO) is proposed to enhance the convergence speed of the DR training by performing explicit policy improvement. Finally, illustrative examples are presented to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {With increasingly challenging applications for quadrotors, higher requirements are emerging for tracking accuracy and safety. While high accuracy is a prerequisite for complex tasks, safety is ensured through tolerance to actuator faults and resistance to external disturbances. In this article, adaptive robust control (ARC) integrated with Gaussian processes (GPs), i.e., ARC-GP, is proposed to achieve enhanced accuracy, fault tolerance, and anti-disturbance. These three requirements are interrelated and affected by uncertainties. The primary idea of this article is to categorize uncertainties into parametric and nonparametric types, which are then addressed through parameter adaptation and GP, respectively. First, a detailed dynamic model is established, including actuator models that reflect different types of faults corresponding to changes in different physical parameters. Then, parameter adaptation is designed, with direct and indirect methods adopted for different parameters. In particular, the actuator parameters are effectively estimated to achieve targeted fault compensation. Regarding GP for nonparametric uncertainties, its model parameters are also updated via parameter adaptation. The GP thereby also learns parameter estimation errors along with external disturbances. Accordingly, ARC controllers are designed, for which robust feedback terms are constructed to further mitigate uncertainties on the basis of the covariances predicted by GP. The experiments demonstrate that the proposed ARC-GP can actively tolerate various types of actuator faults and better resist wind disturbances.},

First, a novel ETM is designed for continuous-time FNNs with time-varying delays to achieve quasi-synchronization, with which synchronization errors is suppressed to globally exponentially converge to a ball. Second, we introduce the ETM for continuous-time FNNs to discrete-time FNNs, owing to the existence of discrete-time states, the Lypunov function of synchronization errors run over the exponentially decay curve, but it can be suppressed to evolve under another exponentially decay curve. Third, for FNNs on time scales with constant and time-varying delays, we estimate the forward jump operator of the Lyapunov functions and design ETMs to guarantee that the Lypunov functions evolve under the exponentially decay curves, so quasi-synchronization can be achieved. Last but not least, we prove that Zeno behavior will not happen and four numerical examples are introduced to verify the validity and the superiority of the proposed ETMs in reducing information transmission.},

  abstract     = {To address the challenges posed by flight envelope limitation, external disturbances, model uncertainties and actuator failures in quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), we propose an adaptive neural attitude control method that incorporates a Nussbaum function and nonlinear disturbance observer (NDO). By designing the Nussbaum function, we effectively address potential actuator failures while leveraging the NDO enables us to employ feedforward compensation strategy to mitigate perturbation effects. To handle the flight envelope limitation and model uncertainties, we introduce a nonlinear state-dependent function (NSDF) and neural networks (NNs), respectively. The NSDF is utilized to directly constrain the attitude, while the NNs are constructed to estimate the unknown components. Simulation results demonstrate that this approach successfully addresses the flight envelope limitation and maintains robust tracking performance even in the presence of external disturbances, model uncertainties and actuator failures in the controlled system.},

  abstract     = {This article studies a more realistic issue in multiagent systems (MASs) named open topology, where the network scale tends to be variable as agents may join, leave, or be replaced. In order to reveal the influence that the variation of network scale brings on the dynamic behavior of MASs, a novel transition process containing impulse is provided. Then by applying the Halanay-like inequality, the distributed sampled-data control is designed to ensure the consensus property of the MASs under open topology. It is shown that the derived results can degenerate into the consensus criteria for general MASs with fixed-scale topology. Also, the potential packet loss phenomenon existing in controller is considered, which is integrated into the consensus performance via the average packet loss interval (APLI) condition, thereby guaranteeing the robustness of consensus performance against packet loss. Moreover, within the framework of open topology, it is proved that the admissible packet loss for MASs can be estimated in an average sense. At the end, the availability of this article is demonstrated by discussing a numerical example.},

  abstract     = {The optimal control of nonlinear systems is crucial to improve system performance. However, the uncertainties of cost functions and systems dynamics make it difficult to solve the optimal control laws. To cope with this problem, a hierarchical learning-based integrated robust optimal control (HL-IROC) method is proposed in this article. The merits of the proposed HL-IROC method are three aspects: First, a hierarchical learning-based integrated optimal control (HL-IOC) scheme, contains a system dynamic learning layer and a cost function learning layer, is designed to transform the original optimal control problem into an integrated optimization problem with control laws as decision variables. Then, the relationships between cost functions and control laws are captured to overcome the difficulties brought by uncertainties in the optimal control process. Second, a global-local cooperative robust evolutionary optimization (GL-CREO) algorithm is proposed to obtain the optimal control laws. Then, a global-local robust searching strategy is employed to deal with two types of uncertainties for improving the robustness of control laws. Third, the convergence analysis of HL-IOC and GL-CREO is discussed in theory. In the experiments, the effectiveness of HL-IROC is illustrated with a nonlinear system and a wastewater treatment process.},

First, considering the impact of DoS attacks on closed-loop systems, an AET controller against DoS attacks is designed. Unlike other event-triggered controllers, the complete timeline is divided, and the AET controller is built with two switching modes based on the intervals of dormant and active periods of DoS attacks in which the system is located. Second, to reconcile AET controller with actuator saturation, a switched system modeling approach is established that explicitly incorporates saturation constraints into the coupled network dynamics. Third, a switched Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional (LKF) is proposed, with which sufficient conditions are provided to ensured the RPS, and a joint design strategy is developed for the desired triggered matrix and feedback gain using linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). Moreover, the results are generalized to the case of actuator faults, indicating that the system is able to achieve RPS with actuator faults. Finally, the proposed method is verified through an example.},

To address this, positive time-varying smooth function compensating terms are introduced to counteract the effects of uncertain external disturbances and unknown desired trajectories. Then, by fusing consensus errors into the backstepping technique, feedforward controllers are given. On this basis, the controlled nonlinear systems are transformed into an equivalent affine form, and feedback optimal controllers are designed using actor and critic neural networks (NNs) to execute control behavior and evaluate control performance. The whole control laws comprise both feedforward and feedback controllers.

Additionally, since system performance is compromised by disturbances, a fractional-order disturbance observer is designed to counteract the effects of external disturbances and enhance system robustness. Furthermore, differential geometric methods are employed to investigate FONS, constructing appropriate diffeomorphism that provide equivalent systems for decoupled linearization. Then, an optimal control method is studied for a class of strictly feedback FONS, in which Nussbaum-type functions are combined with ADP theory during the backstepping design process.

By constructing an augmented system that contains sensor faults as part of its state, a dissipativity-based FE observer is proposed to achieve sensor and actuator/process faults reconstruction. Combine with the fuzzy Lyapunov function method and dissipativity theory, some brand-new conditions with slack scalars and matrices are attained to ensure that observation error systems are strictly $(\mathcal {R},\mathcal {W},\mathcal {S}) -\delta -$ dissipative. Besides, to improve the transient FE performance, regional pole placement problem is also considered in FE observer design. It is worth mentioning that different from some existing results which assume that actuator faults occur in a constant form, the method given in this article is suitable for more types of faults such as time-varying ones.

First, under hybrid stochastic faults, an observer is constructed to estimate all states, which converts the process stochastic faults into a processable form. Second, an event-triggered mechanism is proposed for the estimated states to reduce their update frequency. To deal with the problem that the triggered estimated states are nondifferentiable, a continuous controller with continuous estimated states is developed, and the event-triggered controller with triggered estimated states is established accordingly. By the use of Lyapunov stability theory, it can be rigorously shown that all signals of the closed-loop systems are bounded in probability.

In such multivehicle systems, SOTIF objectives are particularly challenging, since new issues arise due to the presence of interactions that propagate and intensify the effects and the risk connected to faults/failures/uncertainties, triggered by any platoon member and external conditions. To tackle and solve the SOTIF-oriented platoon control problem, we propose a robust and resilient decentralized control protocol, based on distributed observer which exploits the information shared via the Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication network. The approach allows maintaining acceptable SOTIF performance in adversarial conditions, mitigating the effects of the unreasonable risks originated from sensors/actuators performance limitations/faults and disturbances. The uniformly ultimate bounded (UUB) stability and the input-to-state string stability (ISSS) of the platoon dynamics are analytically proved via the Lyapunov theory. Feasible linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) are obtained as stability conditions, whose solution allows adapting the distributed control/observer gains according to leader-tracking performance and robustness margins. A detailed analysis via the vehicular co-simulation platform mixed traffic simulator (MiTraS) corroborates the theoretical derivations and shows the achievement of the SOTIF platoon goals for a set of nontrivial and uncertain driving scenarios.},

However, almost all of the existing graph-based IMVC methods either introduce the Laplacian constraint with fixed graphs or simply fuse the graphs of all views, which are vulnerable to the quality of the constructed graphs. To address this issue, we propose a new graph-based method, called confident local structure-aware incomplete multiview spectral clustering. Different from existing works, our method seeks to adaptively uncover the inherent similarity structure among the available instances in each view and learn the optimal consensus graph within a unified learning framework. Moreover, to mitigate the adverse effects of imbalance information across incomplete views and improve the quality of consensus graph, we further impose some adaptive weights on the consensus graph learning model w.r.t. each view and introduce some confident structure graphs to explore the most confident similarity information in the model. In contrast to existing works, our approach simultaneously takes into account the pairwise similarity information and neighbor group-based confident structure information. This dual consideration makes our method more effective in achieving the optimal consensus graph and delivering superior IMVC performance. Experimental results on several datasets demonstrate that our method effectively learns a high-quality and clustering-friendly graph from incomplete multiview data, and it outperforms many state-of-the-art IMVC methods in terms of clustering performance.},

However, these methods often necessitate large model sizes, leading to substantial computational and storage resource requirements during training and inference. Unfortunately, existing research has not yet provided a lightweight solution to address this issue. This work aims to develop a generic method that can be seamlessly integrated into existing lifelong DRL methods to facilitate their achievement of lightweight models while also yielding higher returns. While sparse training (ST) methods have been extensively used in the DRL community to achieve lightweight models, they exacerbate the issue of catastrophic forgetting and compromise generalization when applied in lifelong DRL. To improve generalization, we develop a gradient optimization method that leverages sharpness-aware minimization (SAM) to smooth the gradient surface of the model without introducing excessive computational complexity. In addition, to alleviate catastrophic forgetting and promote model convergence, we introduce a priority-based approach that samples effective past experiences from the replay buffer. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves 90% sparsity in five representative lifelong DRL methods while achieving higher episode return and average return (up to 34% improvement) across all episodes compared to the dense models.},

  abstract     = {This work aims at the adaptive fuzzy fault-tolerant control (FTC) issue of nonlinear singular systems subject to external disturbances. First, we decompose the nonlinear singular system into two coupled subsystems: 1) differential subsystem and 2) algebraic subsystem. Then, an error system is denoted through designing state and disturbance observers, and the regularization and impulse-free conditions are derived. Combined with the state and disturbance observers, a novel output feedback-based adaptive fault-tolerant controller with the multi-input fault compensation technique and fuzzy approximation method is proposed, and the boundedness of the nonlinear singular system is guaranteed. Finally, the designed control scheme is utilized to a numerical system and a nonlinear circuit to validate the effectiveness and feasibility.},

  abstract     = {This article investigates the almost sure consensus (ASC) problem for sampled-data multiagent systems (MASs) operating over semi-Markov switching networks (SMSNs) and facing different types of denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. During real-time information exchange among agents, communication failures between agents occur randomly, which may result in each possible network topology occurring with a certain probability, and its sojourn time is also stochastic. This necessitates the consideration of a more general switching signal to describe the stochastic switching phenomenon of networks. In pursuit of this goal, a semi-Markov chain is introduced to characterize the switching signal of stochastic interaction networks, whose sojourn time distribution allows for arbitrary continuous-time distribution and depends on the current and next state. Additionally, this article delves into the impact of two distinct types of DoS attacks on MASs. The first type involves random DoS attacks, which are also modeled by a semi-Markov chain to capture the stochastic nature of attack durations. The second type is deterministic DoS attacks, characterized by their frequency and duration. The proposed new stochastic analysis method, based on the law of large numbers, is used to analyze the ASC for MASs featuring SMSNs under the DoS attacks. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated by evaluating the results obtained from two illustrative numerical examples.},

However, the use of CBRBS as XAI still faces many challenges, e.g., over-reliance on expert experience and applying unreasonable rule synthesis in the existing modeling process. Hence, a novel modeling approach is proposed for constructing CBRBS in the aim of providing a better XAI, in which a joint optimization model is proposed first to describe the mathematical model of parameter and structure optimization, and the corresponding algorithm is further designed to automatically achieve the joint optimization of CBRBS. Afterward, a domain-based calculation method of synthesis factor is proposed to develop a new rule synthesis method for CBRBS, which not only achieves the reduction of inefficient and inconsistent rules but also takes into account interpretability and generalization ability. In experimental analysis, the proposed modeling approach is employed to construct CBRBS for handling rice taste assessment and benchmark classification problems. The comparison results show that the proposed approach makes it possible for CBRBS to achieve a good balance between model complexity and inference accuracy. More importantly, the resulting CBRBS has better accuracy and lower complexity than some existing rule-based systems and classical classifiers.},

By the comparison of the continuous control system and the sample-data control system, the equivalence condition on the stabilities of the two systems is studied. Meanwhile, estimates for the maximum tolerable attack probability and the corresponding largest sampling period are obtained. Moreover, a qualitative analysis of various indicators for the deception attacks and the sampling period is revealed. Following this, the theorized results are applied to linear systems with multiple time delays under nonlinear coupling, and matrix inequalities for identifying the appropriate value of the control gain are provided by the generalized Halanay inequality.

  abstract     = {Industrial robots inevitably incur kinematic errors in the advanced manufacturing and assembly processes, resulting in the severe reduction of the absolute positioning accuracy (APA). Kinematic calibration (KC) is well-known as a vital technique in APA-promoting tasks. However, existing KC models generally adopt a single distance-oriented Loss, e.g., an $L_{2}$ norm-oriented one that neglects the featured $L_{p}$ norms. In response to this critical issue, this study presents an Adaptive p-norms-oriented Kinematic Calibration (ApKC) model on the basis of threefold ideas: 1) studying the effects of diversified $L_{p}$ norms on the industrial robot calibration performance; 2) combining multiple $L_{p}$ norms to obtain the aggregated loss with the hybrid effects by different norms; and 3) implementing the weight adaptation on the norm components of the aggregated loss, and rigorously prove its ensemble capability benefiting the calibration performance. Afterwards, a novel Newton interpolated Adaptive Differential Evolution (NADE) algorithm is further proposed to optimize the ApKC model. Empirical studies on an HRS JR680 industrial robot demonstrate that the achieved ApKC-NADE calibrator can significantly reduce the robot’s maximum positioning error from 4.610 to 0.856 mm. It can vigorously support the high-accuracy application of industrial robots.},

Specifically, this research investigates a neural network structure determined by the mechanical characteristics of a computer numerical control (CNC) machine tool. We explore a method to generate training trajectories that fill the designated feature space or repeatedly pass through hidden layer nodes, ensuring that deterministic learning achieves a sufficient PE level. Then, we validated the effectiveness of the proposed method through experiments conducted on a three-axis CNC machine tool using actual machining trajectories. The experimental results consistently confirmed that the generated training trajectories endow the RBF neural network with more feature information than random NURBS trajectories. Additionally, the tracking error and contour error of the CNC machine tool were significantly reduced.},

The cyber threat countermeasure methods are categorized into three classes: defensive strategies, mitigating strategies, and hybrid strategies. The existing countermeasure strategies belonging to each class are thoroughly discussed and compared. In addition to conceptual and theoretical analysis, the leading countermeasure strategies within these categories are implemented on a common platform and examined using two real-world virtual machine (VM) data traces. Based on this comprehensive study and performance evaluation, this article discusses the tradeoffs among these countermeasure strategies and their utility, providing imperative concluding remarks on the holistic study of cloud cyber threat countermeasures and SRM.

First, novel dynamic control policies (DCPs) are developed for NZSGs by introducing controls into feedback, and an augmented system with augmented performance indices is constructed to derive the DCPs. Then, we theoretically analyze the effect of the DCPs on the control stability and performance indices, and the optimality of PNZSG is proven to be equivalent to the optimality of the original NZSGs. Subsequently, an IRL technique is employed to achieve the developed PNZSG method, and we show that no prior knowledge of the dynamics of NZSGs is needed to deploy the developed PNZSG method because of the augmented system and performance indices. Finally, numerical examples, including cooperative adaptive cruise control (CACC) of a vehicular platoon, demonstrate the correctness of the developed PNZSG method.

An adaptive fuzzy practical fixed-time MASs consistency control algorithm is proposed by combining these techniques with backstepping control.

  abstract     = {In recent years, pretrained language-image models (PLIMs) have delivered advances in video captioning. However, existing PLIMs primarily focus on extracting global feature representations from still images and text sequences, while neglecting fine-grained semantic alignment and temporal variations between vision and text pairs. To this end, we propose a global-local alignment module and a temporal parsing module to reflect the detailed correspondence and temporal perception between the two modalities, respectively. In particular, the global-local alignment module enables cross-modal registration at two levels, i.e., the sentence-video level and the word-frame level, to obtain mixed-granularity semantic video features. The temporal parsing module is a dedicated self-attention structure that highlights temporal order cues along video frames, compensating for the limited temporal capacity of PLIMs. In addition, an adaptive two-stage gating structure is designed to leverage the linguistic predictions further. The linguistic information derived from the first stage prediction is dynamically routed through an adaptive decision gate, allowing for quality assessment of whether the information should proceed to the second stage. This structure can effectively reduce the computational burden for easy samples and further improve the accuracy of the prediction results. The experimental results obtained on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed solution, with improved performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract     = {For learning control systems operating repetitively over a fixed time interval, the iterative methods are effective in accomplishing the perfect tracking task of a specified trajectory, resulting in the methodology of iterative learning control (ILC). In the classic ILC framework, three key steps are often involved: 1) making necessary hypotheses over ILC systems, 2) designing the ILC algorithms, and 3) establishing convergence conditions. However, a basic trackability problem is neglected: whether there exist some inputs that drive the ILC system such that the output is identical to the specified trajectory from beginning to end. This article is targeted at addressing the trackability problem and the related ILC design and analysis issues for continuous-time linear systems subject to vector relative degrees. The frequency-domain criteria are developed to determine the trackability of the given trajectory. In addition, the ILC design and analysis are proposed by utilizing a frequency-domain method, which establishes a close connection between the achievement of the perfect tracking tasks in ILC and the trackability of the given trajectory. Two examples are utilized to confirm the effectiveness of our trackability-based ILC results.},

Due to its operation in high-moisture and salt-infested environments, the system is susceptible to valve malfunctions. Additionally, the presence of strong couplings and slugging disturbances in the system further complicate the development of fault-tolerant control (FTC). To achieve this, this article investigates the fault-tolerant $ H_{\infty } $ control problem in the topside separation system. To recover control performance against actuator faults while reducing disturbance sensitivity, the fault-tolerant $ H_{\infty } $ control problem is formulated for the topside separation system and is expressed as a two-player differential game problem. A Nash equilibrium solution to the fault-tolerant $ H_{\infty } $ control problem is derived by solving the game algebraic Riccati equation (GARE). Considering the tailor-made property and difficulty in full-state sensing in industry, an output feedback reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm is proposed to implement the fault-tolerant $ H_{\infty } $ control method without the need for system dynamics. Simulation studies are performed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.},

All the estimation errors of the observers tend to zero as time tends to infinity.

Meanwhile, considering unmodeled dynamics and nonaffine inputs, we propose an innovative finite-time fuzzy prescribed performance switching tracking algorithm to achieve tracking goal. For realizing the requirements of performance, the algorithm converts the tracking error to a new state by means of a coordinate transformation via the tangent function. In addition, the universal approximation capacity of the fuzzy-logic system is utilized to estimate the unknown nonlinear term effectively. On this basis, the designed adaptive dynamic event-triggered controller can not only ensure that all the signals for the closed-loop system remain bounded in probability but also guarantee that the tracking error will converge to a predetermined small neighborhood. Meanwhile, different piecewise functions are added into the controller to characterize prescribed performance and avoid singularity problems, respectively. Finally, the effectiveness of the tracking control algorithm is fully demonstrated by the simulations of the dc-dc buck power converter.},

In this work, we study how to recognize the diffusion source based on limited observational knowledge. To date, the applicability of existing methods is often challenged when dealing with large-scale networks. To improve the scalability, we here develop a community-based source localization (CSL) model by splitting the network into several clusters from the community perspective. In addition, we study an issue that has received less attention but is rather important, i.e., observer deployment. Specifically, we categorize three types of observers and propose a two-stage placement strategy to enhance the accuracy of localization. Our findings suggest that the optimized deployed observers tend to situate at key positions and have higher betweenness compared to non-observer nodes. Based on the information obtained from deployed observers, we further develop five different strategies to locate the community where the source belongs, and our study shows that the diffusion often occurs within a small number of communities so that the search scope can be effectively refined. We validate our method through simulations on various networks, and the experimental results demonstrate the excellent efficacy and efficiency of CSL in early source localization.},

  abstract     = {Mathematical modelling of visual perception in two dimensions is described. Although perception is ubiquitously mentioned in literature and it is used in various contexts, its explicit measurable presentation has not yet been given beyond verbal descriptions. In this seminal work the visual perception is explicitly defined for clarity. Based on this definition, it is treated as a mathematical entity in the form of probability in a particular circular region. Theoretically, human vision is expressed in advanced probabilistic terms and the enigmatic relation between vision and perception is mathematically formulated. Here, the perception concerns a special range of interest, coined as vision circle, where percepts describe the vision act of human as the retinal ophthalmic sensing. Perceptual intelligence quotient (PIQ) is introduced, that it is subject to measurement. The results of the theoretical considerations are shown to be closely matching the common visual perception experiences as well as the reported visual perception studies, including the variation of peripheral acuity. Two eye-tracking experiments demonstrate that saccadic movement behavior of human is reasonably matching the prediction based on the novel perception theory. The work demystifies the visual perception and understanding its role in sciences. As to the cybernetics, perception plays an important role in the control of complex, integrated processing systems, which are interfaced by indispensable man-machine control systems. In these systems, the role of perception is critical, referring to the hazard situations. The implications of the study are investigated and explained in two such cybernetics applications, too.},

In VPI, a visionary Q-function is constructed by incorporating the successor state into the standard Q-function. Due to the introduction of the successor state, the proposed visionary Q-function captures information about state transitions within the Markov decision process (MDP), thereby providing a forward-looking perspective that enables a more accurate and foresighted evaluation of potential action outcomes. The relationship between the visionary Q-function and the standard Q-function is analyzed. Subsequently, both the policy evaluation and policy improvement rules in VPI are designed based on the proposed visionary Q-function. The convergence proof for VPI is provided, ensuring that the iterative policy sequence in VPI will converge to the optimal policy. By combining the VPI framework with the twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient (TD3) algorithm, a visionary TD3 (VTD3) algorithm is developed. The evaluation of VTD3 is performed on multiple continuous-action control tasks from Mujoco and OpenAI Gym platforms. The results of comparative experiments demonstrate that VTD3 can achieve more competitive performance than other state-of-the-art (SOTA) RL approaches. Additionally, the experimental results indicate that VPI enhances decision-making capability, reduces Q-function estimation bias, and improves sample efficiency, thereby boosting the performance of existing RL algorithms.},

The development of the Transformer has resulted in significant advancements in RGB-D Co-SOD. However, existing methods overlook the considerable computational and parametric costs associated with using the Transformer. Although compact models are computationally efficient, they suffer from performance degradation, which limits their practical applicability. This is because the reduction of model parameters weakens their feature representation capability. To bridge the performance gap between compact and complex models, we propose a hybrid knowledge distillation (KD) network, HKDNet-S*, to perform the RGB-D Co-SOD task. This method incorporates positive-negative logits approximation KD to guide the student network (HKDNet-S) in effectively learning the interrelationships among samples with multiple attributes by considering both positive and negative logits. HKDNet-S* primarily consists of the group cosaliency semantic exploration module and the positive and negative logits approximation KD method. Specifically, we employ a trained RGB-D Co-SOD model as a teacher model (HKDNet-T) to train the HKDNet-S with a limited number of participants using KD. Through extensive experiments on three challenging benchmark datasets (RGBD CoSal1k, RGBD CoSal150, and RGBD CoSeg183), we demonstrate that HKDNet-S* achieves superior accuracy while utilizing fewer parameters in comparison to the existing state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract     = {The opinions of experts often exhibit initial variance in group decision-making process due to the differences in background, knowledge, stance, and other influential factors. Thus, an incentive mechanism is critical to motivate experts to adjust individuals’ opinions and achieve a consensus solution. The incentive mechanism is usually costly and included in the consensus reaching process (CRP), and its effect relies on the behavior interaction between the moderator and experts. Within the Stackelberg game framework, we present the maximum-experts and minimum-cost consensus models with multiple incentives and cost budget. First, from a two-side perspective of the moderator and experts, a consensus model with maximum-return modification and maximum-experts feedback (MRMECM) is built to pursue the maximum number of consensus experts under an established cost budget, where the incentive mechanism is realized with the allocation of unit return to each return-driven expert. Then, a double incentive mechanism (DIM) is designed with the modification and shared return incentives. Subsequently, the MRMECM with DIM is constructed to improve the utilization efficiency of cost budget. Finally, the DIM module is integrated into the maximum-return modification and minimum-cost feedback consensus model (MRMCCM), which aims to minimize the consensus cost in the feedback mechanism. All the proposed consensus models are built as bi-level programming models in a unified Stackelberg game framework. We propose a hybrid approach that combines the best-response update strategy with the differential evolution (DE) algorithm to solve the equilibrium solutions. Consequently, several experimental studies are performed to validate the effectiveness of the proposed models.},

In this article, we propose a predictive sliding control (PSC) algorithm that uses model predictive control (MPC) to determine the optimal SMP. The input to MPC is the SMC law with a sliding manifold variable parameter. In addition, the stability and robustness of the control system are analyzed in detail. The designed predictive sliding controller is applied to angle following of a steer-by-wire system installed on a self-driving vehicle. Experimental results and statistical analysis demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed control algorithm.},

  abstract     = {Phase-change memory (PCM) is a novel type of nonvolatile memory and offers low power consumption, high integration, and significant plasticity, making it suitable for neural synapses. In this article, we investigate the global exponential stabilization (GES) of phase-change inertial neural networks (PCINNs) with discrete and distributed time-varying delays. Initially, a piecewise equation is established to model the electrical conductivity of PCM. Based on this, we use PCM to simulate neural synapses, and a class of PCINNs with discrete and distributed time-varying delays is formulated. A continuous state feedback controller is designed to obtain the ${\boldsymbol {\rho} {\textrm {th}}({\rho \ge 1})}$ moment GES conditions of PCINNs in the Filippov sense by using differential inclusion theory, comparison strategies, and inequality techniques. Additionally, the global exponential stability conditions of phase-change Hopfield neural networks are obtained, expressed in the form of an M-matrix. Finally, three simulation examples are provided to verify the effectiveness of the theoretical results.},

The uniqueness of this method lies in its ability to ensure optimal tracking performance for n-link flexible joint robots within the prescribed-time frame, while the actor and critic fuzzy logic system effectively approximate the optimal cost and evaluates system performance. First, the optimal controllers with the auxiliary compensation term are constructed by utilizing the online approximation of the modified performance index function and RL actor-critic structure. The designed controller can deal with unknown structure impacts and avoid model identification. Besides, in designing the prescribed-time scale function, the introduced constant term not only prevents singularity but also allows flexible setting of constraint regions. The proposed scheme is theoretically verified to satisfy the Bellman optimality principle and ensure the tracking error converges to the desired zone within the prescribed time. Finally, the practicability of the designed control scheme is further demonstrated by the 2-link FJ robot simulation example.},

To handle this problem, a stochastic distributed algorithm based on the clipped distributed strategy and the dual averaging strategy is proposed. Of particular interest follows that we study the high probability convergence of the stochastic distributed algorithm under the assumption that the stochastic gradient follows a heavy-tailed distribution. Heavy-tailed distributions often causes extreme values, which bring difficulties in achieving the high probability convergence. Under mild assumptions on the graph and cost functions, we prove that the difference between the cost function value generated by the algorithm and its minimum value converges with high probability.

  abstract     = {A recursive minimum upper bound estimator (UBE) is proposed in this article for stochastic systems with colored measurement noise (CMN) in the presence of generalized unknown disturbance (UD), which is motivated by noncooperative target tracking in the environment of continuous external interference. The CMN causes system noises to be correlated in time dimension, and the UD makes online calculation of estimate error covariance intractable, both of which give rise to deterioration of classical Kalman-like filtering and smoothing. By considering that constructing the upper bound of estimate error covariance requires looser conditions than directly calculating the theoretical covariance, an UBE is first defined, to obtain the filtered estimate and smoothed estimate together. Then, based on the reconstructed measurement model containing multiple state vectors due to measurement differencing to whiten system noises, the recursive structure of the defined UBE is derived in the case of CMN (CUBE) by introducing a free parameter to be optimized, and the existence condition of CUBE is also discussed. Finally, the minimum UBE with CMN, i.e., CMUBE, is presented by pursuing the minimum upper bound of estimate error covariance online through parameter optimization, in order to further suppress the peak of estimate errors. The advantages of estimation accuracy of the proposed CMUBE over Kalman filter (KF)/smoother, KF with CMN and minimum upper bound filter (MUBF) are demonstrated by an example of noncooperative target tracking in persistent interference environment, in terms of filtering versus smoothing, different values of the initial estimate error covariance and the positive-definite matrix setting a priori, sensor accuracies and different levels of UD.},

The limited availability of labeled samples for each class poses a major challenge. To tackle this, we propose a simple yet effective approach called deep discriminative handcrafted feature regression (DDHFR) to explore intrinsic information and select improved discriminative features in few-shot data by mining knowledge from classical handcrafted features. To explore intrinsic information, we design several deep handcrafted feature regression (DHFR) modules and plugged them separately into different layers of the backbone to use feature engineering knowledge for feature learning optimization at different granularities. To achieve discriminative feature selection, we incorporate an auxiliary classifier (AC) into each DHFR module to enhance the acquisition of discriminative information. Furthermore, we employed self-distillation to boost ability of ACs ot be classified. Experimental results in three backbones on three datasets show that DDHFR can generally improve the performance of existing FSL methods. On average, it improves the recognition accuracy by 1.16% in two common few-shot settings.},

First, such a class of constraints under interest is more practical. Unlike most of the existing constraints that need to be addressed at the moment of inception, the initial value requirement of the constrained object in this work is released. A predefined setting time can be installed in advance through the implementation of a shifting function embedded within the proposed ABLF. Second, the problem of unknown actuator faults is considered where the actuator faults can be both multiplicative and additive. Third, by combining the command filter and backstepping techniques, a twice-transformation design method is presented to construct the desired controller, under which the errors between the virtual control laws and the outputs of the command filters can be compensated thoroughly. Aside from avoiding the “explosion of complexity” issue, the designed controller also achieves the requisite tracking performance. Meanwhile, under such controller, the effect of the actuator faults can be estimated. Finally, the validity of the given scheme is evaluated through the use of a practice example.},

  abstract     = {Online social networks (OSNs) facilitate the rapid and extensive spreading of rumors. While most existing methods for debunking rumors consider a solitary debunker, they overlook that rumor-mongering and debunking are interdependent and confrontational behaviors. In reality, a debunker must consider the impact of rumor-mongering behavior when making decisions. Moreover, a single rumor-debunking strategy is ineffective in addressing the complexity of the rumor environment in networks. Therefore, this article proposes a hybrid rumor-debunking approach that combines truth dissemination and regulatory measures based on the differential game theory under adversarial behaviors of rumor-mongering and debunking. Toward this end, we first establish a rumor propagation model using node-based modeling techniques that can be applied to any network structure. Next, we mathematically describe and analyze the processes of rumor-mongering and debunking. Finally, we validate the theoretical results of the proposed method through various comparative experiments, including comparisons with a random strategy, a uniform strategy, and single strategy models on real-world datasets collected from Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube. Furthermore, we harness two actual rumor events to estimate parameters and predict rumor propagation, thereby affirming the veracity and effectiveness of our rumor propagation model.},

To address these issues, we propose an end-to-end fusion model based on multiscale residual convolutional channel attention and transformer model (MRCC-Transformer). This approach initially leverages a multiscale residual convolutional neural network (CNN) to extract data features across various scales, thereby preventing model degradation and autonomously learning and integrating abundant fault information from multiple monitoring variables. Subsequently, a channel attention mechanism (CAM) is introduced to prioritize focus on pertinent convolutional channels to enhance the network’s effectiveness and discriminative capacity. Furthermore, the Transformer is employed to establish dependencies among distinct features to enhance fault diagnosis accuracy. Lastly, the input data is classified for fault diagnosis. The efficacy of the proposed method was validated through simulation experiments on the Tennessee-Eastman (TE) process and an industrial coking furnace. Comparative results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly improves the accuracy of fault diagnosis.},

By extracting information from explicit and implicit user emotional reviews, our framework enriches the representations of users and items.

  abstract     = {Complete coverage path planning (CCPP) is a trending research area in floor cleaning robotics. CCPP is often approached as an optimization problem, typically solved by considering factors, such as power consumption and time as key objectives. In recent years, the safety of cleaning robots has become a major concern, which can critically limit the performance and lifetime of the robots. However, so far, optimizing safety has rarely been addressed in CCPP. Most of the path-planning algorithms in literature tend to identify and avoid the hazards detected by the robot’s perception. However, these systems can limit the area coverage of the robot or pose a risk of failing when the robot is near a hazard. Therefore, this article proposes a novel CCPP method with the awareness of risk levels for a robot to minimize possible hazards to the robot during a coverage task. The proposed CCPP strategy uses reinforcement learning (RL) to obtain a safety-ensured path plan that evaluates and when necessary, avoid the hazardous components in their environment in real time. Furthermore, the failure mode and effect analysis (FMEA) method has been adopted to classify the hazards identified in the environment of the robot and suitably modified to evaluate the risk levels. These risk levels are used in the reward architecture of the RL. Thus, the robot can cross the low-risk hazardous environments if it is necessary to obtain complete coverage. Experimental results showed a noticeable reduction in overall risk faced by a robot compared to the existing methods, while also effectively achieving complete coverage.},

This work proposes a method for multitarget task allocation and path planning for AAV swarms, addressing the challenges of locating and tracking multiple wildlife with very high frequency (VHF) radio tags while avoiding potential disturbances to the wildlife. Our approach proposes a layered framework for the multi-AAV multitarget wildlife tracking problem: 1) the state estimation layer performs fast receiver signal strength indicator (RSSI) signal acquisition and employs the particle filtering algorithm to localize targets’ positions; 2) the task assignment layer uses a quadratic allocation method for AAVs’ real-time target allocation, starting with reasonable initial target sets via mixed-integer programming and efficiently readjusting targets based on real-time environment; and 3) the motion planning layer introduces an optimization-based approach to generate smooth and executable trajectories that can simultaneously ensure desired safe distances from objects of interest.

Initially, a nonsingular sliding mode surface (SMS) is formulated by incorporating a general ZND along with a differentiable predefined-time activation function. Following this, an approaching law is introduced by utilizing a variable-parameter noise-tolerant ZND and a novel dynamic adaptive parameter. The nonsingular SMS and the approaching law are then combined to construct a nonsingular predefined-time robust controller. The theoretical proofs provided ascertain the predefined-time convergence of the closed-loop system utilizing ZNDPRSMC and its robustness against bounded disturbances. Finally, two trajectory tracking examples of the quadrotor are presented to demonstrate the superiority of the ZNDPRSMC framework.},

The selection of music stimuli and the modeling of dynamic emotions are done using emotional Markov chains. This regulation system can monitor the user’s emotion and play music, selected by the regulation policy until the user can maintain the desired emotion. Our system was verified by two experiments. In the first experiment, by predicting the participants’ affective states, we tested the precision of our multimodal affective computing system. In the second experiment, we tested the regulation algorithm embedded in a closed-loop regulation system by comparing it with playing music without feedback.

SEXI-TSK-FC has structural and algorithmic novelties. In the structural sense, to guarantee enhanced generalizability and short fuzzy rules, the proposed XI-TSK is created as each subclassifier on a subset of the original features. Then it stacks each successive subclassifier on both the outputs and the important features selected, which are from the incorrectly classified dataset by the previous subclassifier. After that, SEXI-TSK-FC linearly aggregates all the outputs of its subclassifiers with a one-step calculation to enhance classification accuracy while preserving extreme interpretability. In the algorithmic sense, each short fuzzy rule of the XI-TSK subclassifier is determined using the proposed fuzzy feature selection and clustering algorithm to select the subset of all the original features and simultaneously fix the antecedent and consequent of each rule. After that, the rule weights in each subclassifier are trained quickly with strong generalizability using the proposed Vapnik-Chervonenkis dimension minimization-based learning.

Additionally, the Sarsa algorithm enhanced with eligibility traces guides the selection of optimal schemes during the local enhancement phase. To ensure a balance between convergence and diversity, a solution selection strategy based on penalty-based boundary intersection decomposition is utilized.

In this article, we dive a deeper thought into this task and propose a simpler and effective framework, termed SparsePose, which can directly predict multiperson joint coordinates from the full image without any post-processes and dense representations. In SparsePose, the full-body instances are decoupled by exploring spatial-aware feature learning (SFL) without box and classification supervision. For improving the quality of instance map, the instance contrastive constraint (ICC) and center correction (CC) strategy are proposed to make the instance-wise spatial feature more discriminative. Importantly, we propose a visibility-guided weighting mechanism to enable model be confident to the visible joint predictions and insensitive to the occlusions or partial bodies. In general, SparsePose is conceptually simpler and plays favorably against the existing counterparts on three benchmarks in terms of both accuracy and efficiency.},

  abstract     = {Multiobjective multitask optimization (MO-MTO) aims to exploit the similarities among different multiobjective optimization tasks through knowledge transfer (KT), facilitating their simultaneous resolution. The effective design of KT techniques embedded in multiobjective evolutionary optimizers is crucial for enhancing the performance of multiobjective multitask evolutionary algorithms (MO-MTEAs). However, a significant limitation of existing KT techniques in MO-MTEAs is their equal treatment of particles/individuals for transferred knowledge reception, which can negatively impact the balance of diversity and convergence in population evolution. To remedy this limitation, this article proposes a new MO-MTEA, named MTEA-DCK, which incorporates diversity-oriented KT (DKT) and convergence-oriented KT (CKT) techniques tailored for different particles in the population. MTEA-DCK utilizes a strength-Pareto-based competitive mechanism to divide particles into winners and losers: 1) for winners, DKT is conducted via an intertask domain alignment approach to enhance population diversity and 2) for losers, CKT is executed within the unified search space to improve convergence. Additionally, to ensure robust performance on complex task combinations, we introduce two automatic parameter control strategies specifically designed for these KT techniques. MTEA-DCK was performed on 39 benchmark MO-MTO problems and demonstrated superior performance compared to eight state-of-the-art MO-MTEAs and six multiobjective evolutionary algorithms. Finally, we present three real-world MO-MTO application cases, where our approach also yielded better results than other algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Due to the complex entanglement between distributed control and distributed estimation, adaptive multiagent dynamics over leaderless directed graphs are yet not completely understood. This happens even when the adaptive dynamics are based on established tools like model reference adaptive control (MRAC). This work starts from the observation that existing MRAC-based leaderless designs stop at asymptotic consensus, lacking of any guarantee for exponential consensus or parameter identification. The main contribution of this work is to show a new design departing from the existing ones in terms of exploiting persistence of excitation (PE): the proposed design is the first one attaining exponential consensus with exponential parameter identification over leaderless directed graphs. In the special case that the unknown parameters are homogeneous, PE can be relaxed to a weaker cooperative PE (C-PE) condition. The design is illustrated and verified alongside the state-of-the-art.},

First, a framework for multiagent differential graphical games is formulated.

Finally, the presented consensus control policy is extended to address the group formation tracking problem (GFTP) of nonholonomic mobile robots, with a numerical example to illustrate the efficacy of the proposed results.

The parameters of the system are unknown, and traditional parameter estimation methods are difficult to achieve fixed time convergence, which leads to extremely position tracking control problem. In addition, the transient and steady-state performance of the robot system is difficult to specify in advance. In this article, a novel composite learning fixed-time (FxT) control strategy is proposed for the robotic systems to deal with these issues. The funnel control (FC) is utilized to transform the original error system into a new error dynamics with transient performance constraints. The two-phase nonsingular FxT sliding mode surface is constructed to avoid the singularity problem. Then, the filter operation is introduced to obtain the expression of parameter estimation error and is used to design the composite learning law. To achieve parameter estimation, a FxT composite learning law based on online historical data and regression extension is proposed, where the interval excitation (IE) is considered in the adaptive law. Finally, the designed adaption is incorporated into the nonsingular FxT sliding mode control to achieve tracking control. Moreover, the comparison of three different controllers is made to demonstrate the benefits of the developed control strategy.},

It is noticeable that when the DoS attacker is active, the controller does not receive any information, which makes the controller fail to work. To tackle the challenge, an adaptive NN switching state observer is first built to estimate the unmeasurable states. Second, an FTPP function is constructed to boost the transient and steady-state performances of NCSs. Third, under the framework of the backstepping technique, an adaptive command filter is established by combining the dynamic adaptive technique with the switching state observer, which handles the “complexity explosion” problem and improves the robustness of NCSs. Besides, it is rigorously proved mathematically that the boundedness of all signals in the closed-loop system and the designed controller compels the tracking error to fall into the predefined boundary within a finite time. Finally, an application-oriented example of the single-link robotic arm system is utilized to demonstrate the viability of the proposed control method.},

To expand the attraction domain within the local FTS framework, a piecewise fractional-order differential inequality based on impulsive control systems is proposed. Subsequently, a new hybrid control strategy is designed by integrating a simple feedback controller with an impulsive controller involving a finite number of impulses, which can be accurately calculated using the proposed impulsive degree. Additionally, a set of local/global FTS criteria is formulated, and the settling time can be explicitly estimated.

To reduce the communication resources and controller update times, an event-triggered mechanism is designed via employing the sampled augmented systems states and triggered control input signals. Based on the developed event-triggered mechanism and Bellman optimality theory, a fuzzy optimal event-triggered control (ETC) approach is presented. Since solution of optimal control policy reduces to algebraic Riccati equations (AREs), its analytical solution is difficult to solve directly. Then, to search its approximation solution, a VI algorithm is formulated. By rigorous proof, the proposed optimal ETC scheme can assure that the USVs systems are asymptotically stable and the Q-learning algorithm is convergent. Finally, the simulation and comparisons results with previous optimal controllers verify the feasibility of the presented optimal ETC scheme.},

For the new normal form, N and an auxiliary signal are designed to exponentially stabilize the unstable zero/internal dynamics of the auxiliary system; and the real input is designed to ensure that $s $ is exponentially stable. In particular, the zero/internal dynamics dependence on the input is fully considered in this article, and the proposed method ensures global stabilization of the closed-loop system without relying on the existence condition of Lyapunov functions.

The anti-swing control issue of tower crane with varying suspension cable length and double spherical pendulum effect is still open. Furthermore, the system parameters uncertainty makes it more challenging to implement anti-swing control. In this study, we present an adaptive sliding mode anti-swing control approach based on time-delay estimation for underactuated tower crane with varying suspension cable length and double spherical pendulum effect. First, we employ the Lagrange’s method to develop a seven-degree-of-freedom (7-DOF) tower crane dynamic model that comprehensively accounts for jib slewing, trolley motion, payload hoisting/lowering, and payload/hook spherical swing within a three-dimensional (3-D) space. Then, a sliding mode surface is constructed by analyzing the nonlinear coupling relationship between the unactuated states and actuated states. The time-delay estimation technique with adaptive scheme can adapt and predicate unknown system parameters online. An adaptive sliding mode anti-swing control method with time-delay estimation is designed for 7-DOF tower crane system subject to the parameter uncertainties. The convergence of the closed-loop control system is carefully demonstrated through the Lyapunov stability theory. Finally, the hardware experiments verify the anti-swing control performance and robustness of the designed adaptive sliding mode controller. The superiority of the proposed adaptive sliding mode anti-swing controller is confirmed by a decrease of at least 42.09% and 58.33% in the maximum and residual payload swing, respectively, over state-of-the-art control methods.},

However, for those scenarios that require fitting multiple expressions (MEs) synchronously, existing symbolic regression algorithms need to run multiple times step by step asynchronously for fitting such a group of expressions. Due to lacking mechanisms to explicitly capture and leverage the relationships between these expressions, the coupling information among MEs will be lost in this approach. A multiexpression symbolic regression algorithm (ME-SR) is proposed in this article to address the issue in learning MEs. Additionally, a methodology for extracting the approximate maximum common subexpression (aMCSE) among these MEs is suggested to disclose the relationships. A new metric is formulated to measure the quality of an aMCSE in ME-SR by imitating the concept of intersection over union. Furthermore, an adaptive cross matrix is incorporated into the algorithm to balance the search efforts between intertask and intratask domains. The proposed ME-SR demonstrates superior performance when compared to its counterparts of single expression symbolic regression on the designed test set.

First, a hierarchical self-attention (HSA) mechanism is proposed to capture the local degradation features and dependencies at different scales and enhance the representation capacity of RUL prediction model. Based on HSA and temporal convolutional network (TCN), a time-frequency fusion TCN (TFFTCN) is designed to mine the hidden degradation information from the time-domain and frequency-domain data. Then, a memory weight constraint (MWC) regularization term is built to control the update of important parameters for pervious tasks during the learning of new task. A horizontal network augmentation rule based on the task similarity and MWC is proposed, including the augmentation of a task branch network for small task difference and the augmentation of a feature extraction backbone network for large task difference. On this basis, the MBHAN is proposed to continuously predict RUL of machinery. Finally, the experimental results on the life-cycle bearing and gear datasets demonstrate that TFFTCN achieve an average accuracy of 93% across both datasets, surpassing the existing prediction methods.},

  abstract     = {Peak carbon emissions and carbon neutrality have become important initiatives for the country to solve outstanding problems of resource and environmental constraints and promote green and low-energy development, and have attracted widespread attention from the industry. The distributed flow shop scheduling problem (DPFSP) is a typical problem that mainly works by consuming energy. However, DPFSP rarely considers energy efficiency and blocking constraints. In this study, an excellent bi-population cooperative discrete differential evolution (BCDDE) is proposed, aiming to address the energy-efficient distributed blocking flow shop scheduling problem (EEDBFSP) with total energy consumption (TEC) and total tardiness (TTD) as two objectives. A bi-population cooperative strategy is constructed to enhance the diversity of BCDDE, while utilizing it to initialize the population to enhance the quality of the initial solution. An adaptive local search operator strategy is developed to improve the BCDDE convergence. Critical and noncritical paths are devised to further optimize TEC and TTD objectives. The efficiency of each strategy related to BCDDE is verified and compared with state-of-the-art algorithms in the benchmark suite. Numerical results show that BCDDE becomes an efficient optimizer for the EEDBFSP, significantly outperforming the state-of-the-art algorithms at the 95% confidence interval.},

  abstract     = {Surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithms for addressing expensive optimization problems with both continuous and categorical variables (EOPCCVs) are still in the early stages of development. This study makes significant advancements by leveraging the mixed-variable nature of EOPCCVs in two crucial ways. First, it introduces a novel hybrid approach combining differential evolution and upper confidence bound sampling (DEUCB), designed to explore the mixed search space effectively. Second, a specialized value distance metric (VDM) is proposed, integrating continuous and categorical variables, to enhance the accuracy of the radial basis function (RBF) model approximation. Finally, we present a customized evolutionary expensive optimization algorithm (CEEO), which seamlessly incorporates DEUCB and RBF-VDM into the widely utilized global and local surrogate-assisted evolutionary optimization framework. Experimental results, compared against state-of-the-art counterparts on three distinct sets of benchmark problems and a convolutional neural network hyperparameter optimization task, consistently affirm the efficacy of the proposed CEEO in addressing EOPCCVs.

To address this dilemma, this article studies a local knowledge transfer-based evolutionary algorithm for constrained multitask optimization. To be specific, each task population is divided into multiple niches to enhance the diversity and control the intensity of knowledge transfer, thus avoiding excessive transfer of knowledge. Then a new similarity judgment method based on the information feedback of pioneer individuals is developed to judge the similarity between tasks and whether to perform knowledge transfer. Furthermore, two different transfer methods: a direct transfer and a learning transfer, are devised to perform knowledge transfer among niches pertaining to different tasks. In addition, an excellent-information-guided mutation mechanism is proposed to prevent niches from getting trapped in local optima and to promote rapid convergence. The system experiment on 18 constrained multitask test instances and 2 real-world problems demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms or is at least comparable to other EMTO algorithms and constrained single-objective optimization algorithms.},

However, owing to complex architectures, existing approaches have failed to achieve high accuracies in real-time applications. In this article, a novel knowledge distillation (KD) SegFormer-based network, called KDSNet-S*, is proposed to explore the tradeoff between accuracy and efficiency. Specifically, a structured KD scheme is designed to transfer the rich advanced features of a teacher network (KDSNet-T) to a student network (KDSNet-S). Thereafter, the KDSNet-S network learns the precise segmentation ability of the KDSNet-T network. Additionally, a multifield perceptual fusion model is proposed to learn more integrated features for a single modality and obtain discriminative and comprehensive feature representations. Furthermore, a high-level feature integration module is introduced to refine multimodality high-level features. Finally, multilevel features are fused, and a label-decoupling-based three-stream decoder that decomposes the original semantic segmentation map into center and contour diffusion maps for different supervision tasks is introduced. Experimental results on two public red-green–blue-thermal semantic segmentation datasets indicate the superiority of KDSNet-S* over compared state-of-the-art methods. The KDSNet-S* reduces parameters and floating-point operations per second by 91.1% and 81.9%, respectively, compared with the KDSNet-T.

  abstract     = {This article focuses on multiagent distributed asynchronous optimization over directed networks where each agent can only access its individual local function, and the aggregate aim is to minimize the cumulative sum of all local functions. Considering the asynchrony among the agents, we develop an algorithm in which agents compute and communicate individually, without any form of synchronized coordination. Agents perform their local updates by local communication with their immediate neighbors, and this may involve the use of stale information. Since asynchrony naturally leads to latency or packet loss, an asynchronous robust gradient tracking mechanism is developed to guarantee estimating the average of agents’ gradients precisely. Moreover, it employs uncoordinated step-sizes which are more flexible and general than constant or decaying step-size. When the global objective is strongly convex and the local objectives have Lipschitz-continuous gradients, we prove that each agent executing the asynchronous algorithm linearly converges to the consensus optimal point at an $\mathcal {O}(\lambda ^{k})$ rate, where $\lambda \in (0,1)$ is convergence factor and k represents the iteration number, with a step satisfying a tight explicit upper bound. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our algorithm has better advantages over the state-of-the-art asynchronous algorithms.},

Using behavioral incentives via trust to encourage voluntary preference adjustments improves consensus through mutual agreement. This article aims to establish a trust incentive-driven framework for enabling consensus in social network group decision making (SN-GDM). First, a trust incentive mechanism is modeled via interactive trust functions that integrate risk attitude. The inclusion of risk attitude is crucial as it reflects the diverse ways decision makers (DMs) respond to uncertainty in trusting others’ judgments, capturing the varied behaviors of risky, neutral, and insurance DMs in the consensus process. Inconsistent DMs then adjust opinions in exchange for heightened trust. This mechanism enhances the importance degrees via a new weight assignment method, serving as a reward to motivate DMs to further align with the majority. Subsequently, a trust incentive-driven bounded maximum consensus model is proposed to optimize cooperation dynamics while preventing over-compensation of adjustments. Simulations and comparative analysis demonstrate the model’s efficacy in facilitating cooperation through tailored trust incentive mechanisms that account for these diverse risk preferences. Finally, the approach is applied to evaluate candidates for the Norden Shipping Scholarship, providing a cooperation-focused SN-GDM framework for achieving mutually agreeable solutions while acknowledging the impact of individual risk attitude on trust-based interactions.},

Then, an action space and an efficient action decoding algorithm are proposed, which enable agents to explore in the high-quality solution space and improve the learning efficiency. In addition, a state space with generalization, a reward function considering machine idle time and a strategy for handling four disturbance events are designed to minimize the total tardiness cost. Comparison experiments show that the proposed method outperforms the priority dispatching rules, genetic programming and four popular reinforcement learning (RL)-based methods, with performance improvements mostly exceeding 10%. Furthermore, experiments considering four disturbance events demonstrate that the proposed method has strong robustness, and it can provide appropriate scheme for uncertain manufacturing system.},

This work’s investigation reveals that competitive NNs with switching afford more storage capacity compared to the nonswitching case. Additionally, our results are valid for the integer-order and fractional-order switched NNs, improving and generalizing current works.

To conserve communication resources, an ABETM is employed to determine the release of system measurements to the PIO. Before transmission over the communication network, the triggered signal is quantized through a probabilistic quantization mechanism. The goal of this article is to devise a PIO that guarantees ultimate boundedness of the estimation error dynamics in the mean square. Initially, a sufficient condition is derived to ensure that the estimation error dynamics are exponentially ultimately bounded in the mean square. Following this, necessary PIO gains are identified by solving specific matrix inequalities, and the efficacy of this proposed PIO approach is validated using a three-tank system simulation.},

In scaled consensus, the aim is for agents’ states to achieve specified proportions rather than converging to a single value, and this approach encompasses standard consensus, bipartite consensus, and cluster consensus within its framework. To prevent the leakage of sensitive data during communication, a novel privacy-preserving scaled distributed protocol is proposed. This protocol uses homomorphic encryption, whereby agents initially encrypt their information and transmit it in ciphertext form to neighboring agents. The control protocol is then reconstructed by the agents using the encrypted information received from their neighbors. A modified Halanay-like inequality is formulated and, by leveraging algebraic graph theory and the Lyapunov stability theorem, sufficient conditions are established to ensure that the MASs can achieve exponentially ultimately bounded scaled consensus. Furthermore, a convex optimization method is adopted to identify the optimal control gain so as to maximize the allowable sampling interval bound.

This article introduces a novel approach integrating Lyapunov and Poincaré–Bendixson methods to analyze the stability of limit cycles in nonlinear systems, specifically focusing on Epileptors with a two-state dynamic. Our method accurately delineates the limit cycle boundary through eigenvalue-based analysis, facilitating precise assessment of stability properties and identification of critical regions linked to seizure initiation and termination. Through the investigation of the two-state dynamics of Epileptors, we gain deeper insights into the transition between low activity and seizure states, consequently improving our understanding of epileptic seizures. Our approach can be employed to establish stability conditions and determine the existence of limit cycles in Epileptor models, which can further aid in predicting and preventing epileptic seizures by identifying critical regions associated with seizure initiation and termination. The simulations conducted in this study demonstrate that the model under investigation exhibits stable limit cycle behavior and manifests bifurcation, with significant implications for the development of targeted interventions and more effective prediction and treatments for epilepsy. The findings indicate that the suggested approach establishes that external stimulation should not surpass 10.8 mA. Moreover, the initial normal state lies within the range of −1.6 to −0.1 ictal LFP. On the other hand, the LaSalle and eigenvalue methods individually cannot precisely determine the limit cycle region.},

  abstract     = {This article addresses the crucial aspect of safety in collaborative robotics by introducing a new continuous wavelet transform-convolutional neural network (CWT-CNN) for efficient robot collision detection. Unlike conventional methods, CWT-CNN exhibits superior data efficiency, requiring minimal collision data for robust training without relying on a dynamic model. The network’s adaptability extends to varying internal stiffness levels, offering robustness to changes in robotic system characteristics. Through comprehensive experimental studies, we investigate the impact of input signal types, wavelet types, wavelet scale ranges, and time-moving window sizes on collision detection performance, offering critical insights for optimal CWT parameter selection. Additionally, our transferability analysis demonstrates that the CWT-CNN can seamlessly adapt from one joint to another, requiring only minimal free-motion data from the new joint. This adaptability is validated through extensive experiments on an industrial robot and the robot equipped with variable stiffness actuators. In conclusion, the CWT-CNN is highly generalizable and data-efficient, making it a reliable solution for real-time collision detection in human-robot interactions, addressing a key aspect of safety in collaborative environments.},

  abstract     = {Safe exploration can be regarded as a constrained Markov decision problem (CMDP) where the expected long-term cost is constrained. Previous off-policy algorithms convert the constrained optimization problem into the corresponding unconstrained dual problem by introducing the Lagrangian relaxation technique. However, the cost function of the above algorithms provides inaccurate estimations and causes the instability of the Lagrange multiplier learning. In this article, we present a novel off-policy reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm called conservative distributional maximum a posteriori policy optimization (CDMPO). At first, to accurately judge whether the current situation satisfies the constraints, CDMPO adapts distributional RL method to estimate the Q-function and C-function. Then, CDMPO uses a conservative value function loss to reduce the number of violations of constraints during the exploration process. In addition, we utilize adaptive proportional integral derivative (APID) to update the Lagrange multiplier stably. In our experiments, we select eight representative constrained tasks from two well-known safe RL benchmarks (Safety Gym and Bullet Safety Gym), providing a comprehensive evaluation of our methods across diverse scenarios. Empirical results show that the proposed method has fewer violations of constraints in the early exploration process. The final test results also illustrate that our method has better-risk control capabilities.},

This article studies the finite-time synchronization of coupled FOSs with nonlinearity via fuzzy intermittent quantized control and two novel fractional-order differential inequalities. An interval-type 2 Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy technique is introduced, which not only facilitates the handling of the nonlinear term in the error dynamic system, but also greatly simplifies the control design. Synchronization conditions in form of linear matrix inequalities are provided by designing a novel Lyapunov function on the basis of ellipsoidal norm. Moreover, two corollaries show the generality of the new analysis framework. Compared with existing results, it is amazing that the decreasing magnitude of Lyapunov function on the control intervals can be smaller than its increasing magnitude on the subsequent noncontrol interval. Finally, Chua’s system is used to clarify the effectiveness of theoretical outcomes.},

The uniqueness of CEBO lies in its capability of balancing feasibility and objective improvement under a limited function evaluation budget, which is achieved by designing two strategies to obtain promising solutions. The first strategy prefers feasibility. It tends to obtain a feasible solution by utilizing the predicted value and uncertainty provided by Gaussian process (GP). The second strategy prefers objective improvement. It maintains and evolves the population of evolutionary algorithms, and selects a solution with a good objective function value and violating the constraints not too much based on the predicted value and uncertainty provided by GP at each iteration. The sequential implementation of these two strategies allows CEBO to balance feasibility and objective improvement. The effectiveness of CEBO is verified by 26 test instances and a practical application. The results demonstrate that CEBO is able to find high-quality solutions with 100 FEs.},

Most vehicles use a variety of different sensors to improve robustness. A vital part of these is the radar sensor. It provides the vehicle not only with location but also with valuable velocity information from surrounding objects. The increasing usage of radar systems in road traffic also causes problems in terms of mutual interference between different radar sensors. This interference leads to broadband disturbances in the signal which must be mitigated to ensure reliable object detection and object angle estimation. In this article, we compare different variants of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in their ability to mitigate mutual interference for multiantenna radar data. We analyze the potential of using multiantenna data for real-valued CNN (RVCNN) and complex-valued (CVCNN) models, comparing detection, phase reconstruction, and angle estimation performances. Furthermore, we propose a complex-valued CVCNN (CVCNN) architecture using a modified batch normalization method that omits activation scaling. Our experiments show, that using multiantenna data in combination with CVCNNs can greatly improve detection, phase, as well as angle estimation performance and that activation scaling is detrimental to our CVCNN architecture.},

Several positive augmented Lyapunov-Krasovskii (L-K) functionals are proposed by introducing integral quadratic functions based on the L-K stability theorem. To further reduce the estimation gap caused by the existing integral inequalities, which were applied for dealing with the derived augmented-type integral term from augmented functional, some refined matrix-separation-based inequalities are introduced. With fewer decision variables, the proposed method considers the information among the system state, its derivative, and their related terms. After these, some cubic functions in the time-varying delay appear and show nonconvexity. Then, negative definite conditions are imposed on such cubic terms to obtain the stability criterion in the form of the linear matrix inequality (LMI). Inspired by the Taylor’s expansion methodology and the delay-partitioning techniques, we improve the existing negative definite conditions on the cubic function without introducing any decision variable. For linear systems with a time-varying delay, this relaxed condition, the refined matrix-separation-based inequalities, and the constructed L-K functionals, are combined to produce a less conservatism stability criterion. Two numerical examples illustrate the effect of the offered methods and the stability condition.},

Building on the principles of arbitrage pricing theory (APT), this study introduces a dynamic neural network model aimed at minimizing investment risk, optimizing portfolio allocation within predefined constraints, and maximizing returns. First, a convex optimization objective function incorporating risk constraints is formulated based on APT principles. This is followed by the introduction of a novel dynamic neural network model designed to solve the convex optimization problem, accompanied by comprehensive theoretical analysis and rigorous proofs. The study uses two distinct datasets sourced from Yahoo Finance, consisting of 30 selected stocks, covering a span of 250 valid trading days to validate the proposed methodology. The results of 30 different stock market scenario experiments indicate that, when the upper limit for investment risk is set at $3.285 \times 10^{-4}$ , the expected maximum investment return exceeds the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) index by 16.2816%. These empirical findings highlight the viability, stability, and efficacy of the proposed approach and framework, demonstrating its potential applicability for real-time, high-frequency trading scenarios.

  abstract     = {The State of Charge (SoC) is an important parameter of a battery energy storage system (BESS), and its balance problem is also an issue worth studying in a multi-BESS network. Recently, some researchers have proposed a power allocation method, claiming that as long as the power sharing state and SoC balance state can be obtained in real-time, it can not only maintain supply and demand balance, but also ensure that any BESS will not exit early due to insufficient energy storage. Considering this, we are attempting to design a distributed dynamic average tracking algorithm based on multiagent systems (MASs) with prescribed transient and steady state performance to estimate the power sharing and SoC balance states of a BESSs network with dynamic load in a distributed manner. Two versions of the solution are designed here, where one is event triggered and the other is self triggered. These two schemes ensure the performance of the estimators under intermittent communication to varying degrees, respectively. In each constructed estimation scheme, prescribed performance control (PPC) method is implemented to ensure the expected steady-state and dynamic performance, which is encapsulated in a performance function. Thus, it achieves almost zero error estimation of the fast time-varying power sharing and the SoC balance states. In addition, consensus and average tracking performance are decoupled, which provides convenience for parameters tuning. Finally, to verify the results of the theoretical analysis, some cases are studied and relevant simulations are performed on a 4 bus system.},

Then, to resolve the problems caused by asynchronous decentralization, a graph-theoretic approach is employed. Combining this with an auxiliary timer, an innovative Lyapunov functional is designed, after which an original Lyapunov-based method is proposed to cope with the complexity of introducing high nonlinearity and asynchronous decentralization into networks.

Nevertheless, the modeling task based on traditional methodologies could be complicated, considering the specific nature of periodic motions in actual systems. Differential neural networks (DNNs) are modeling tools for dynamic systems that can be useful for developing precise representations of periodic systems. This study presents the design of a novel family of DNN identifiers that could reproduce the trajectories of periodic systems with an uncertain mathematical model. The suggested DNN identifiers may produce an approximate model with periodic properties similar to the system under analysis exhibiting an one-period convergence of DNN weights. The fundamentals of the Floquet’s theory drive the design of the learning laws to ensure the reproduction of the periodic properties in the DNN. The design of a controlled Lyapunov function allows the learning laws to be derived for the DNN weights whose evolution depends on the positive definite solution of a periodic differential Lyapunov equation. Several numerical evaluations on periodic systems confirmed the modeling performance of the proposed identifier when the approximation performance is compared with traditional DNN identifiers using sigmoidal functions.},

In order to enhance the system robustness against DoS attacks, a rapid exponential stabilization (RES) method is leveraged in controller design to accelerate the convergence rate of the system state. Meanwhile, to take into account the performance boundary of the system state, the learning algorithms are designed to mitigate the peaking phenomenon due to the high-gain feedback in the RES method. In the adaptation law design, $\sigma $ -modification combined with G+D estimator is adopted to robustly shape the dynamics of closed-loop system and enhance the steady-state performance. Through Lyapunov stability analysis, it is proved that the CPSs under the proposed control scheme can accommodate the effect of DoS attacks of nearly arbitrary intensity, i.e., the communication is not completely blocked. Finally, a numerical simulation is carried out to illustrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed control scheme.},

However, the existing linear interaction patterns do not realistically reflect users’ decision-making processes. The formation of users’ opinions on items and the evolutionary preference interaction process among users needs to be explored. In our work, we bridge social psychology and recommender systems to develop a social recommendation model, nonlinearly utilizing latent user preferences and item features to simulate the intrinsic formation of users’ decision-making. We extend the cognitive opinion formation mechanism by improving the two-stage process and seamlessly combine it and matrix factorization, simulating the nonlinear interactions between users and items. We incorporate the implicit user influence and explicit social dynamics with bounded confidence effect into the nonlinear cognitive recommendation framework to characterize the evolutionary preference interactions among users. We conduct comprehensive experiments on real-world datasets to compare the proposed method with the state-of-the-art models. The results indicate that our method makes notable improvements in rating prediction for all users and cold-start users. In addition, the nonlinear cognitive opinion formation has a significant effect on improving performance, conferring higher interpretability to the recommendation.},

By designing a new variable, the original model is converted into a model without delay while guaranteeing the equivalence of performance index and control law of each agent. Subsequently, the transformed model and reinforcement learning (RL) theory are integrated to obtain a novel data-driven distributed learning framework. This framework enables online learning of the optimal control law and ensures tracking consensus of all followers’ position and velocity states. Compared to the traditional actor–critic framework, an additional neural network (NN) is utilized to approximate the forward reward information (FRI) to improve the information learning capability of the MASs. Furthermore, the convergence analysis of system states and three NNs structures are conducted by Lyapunov theory. Finally, the proposed framework is verified to have better convergence and require fewer iteration steps than classical actor–critic framework by numerical simulation comparison experiments.},

However, when agent resources are scarce, assignment strategies aimed at eliminating agent conflicts become infeasible. Consequently, there is a need to select the optimal assignment with a minimal number of agent conflicts, which is essentially a nonlinear bilevel optimization problem. To tackle this issue, we first design the group role assignment with minimized agent conflicts (GRAMAC) model to formalize this problem. It converts this problem into an extended integer linear programming (x-ILP) one and finds the optimal solution. Then, we prove that solving the GRAMAC model is an $\mathscr {NP} - \mathrm {complete}$ task. Moreover, we identify the sufficient and necessary condition under which the GRAMAC model has the optimal conflict-free solution. Finally, extensive experiments demonstrate that, compared to existing strategies, our proposed method reduces the number of agent conflicts by an average of approximately 30% while ensuring the group performance of the collaborative system.},

However, its configuration optimization in confined three-dimensional (3-D) space is very complicated due to infinite configurations of inverse kinematics solutions. This article proposes a spatial triarc planning method in response to the issue mentioned above. A reasonable triarc configuration can be optimized by this method based on six input parameters, i.e., the proximal control point and tangent vector, distal control point and tangent vector, and two centers of curvature circles in both two-dimensional (2-D) and 3-D space. This method has the following three advantages. First, the task configuration of a spatial triarc can be predicted by presetting the relationship between the proximal and distal tangent vectors. Furthermore, the configuration of the middle and inner concentric cable-driven mechanism can be controlled by adjusting the direction of the distal tangent vector. Additionally, the proportion of each concentric cable-driven mechanism can be controlled by changing centers of curvature circles. Finally, the proposed spatial triarc planning method is verified by simulations and experiments. Results show that the maximum errors of the C-shaped spatial triarc and the S-shaped spatial triarc experiments are 1.68 mm and 1.36 mm, respectively.},

Different variable admittance controllers with essential stability analyses are required for multiple interaction scenarios in a complex task, where stability analysis is the major difficulty. In this article, we propose a unified stability-guaranteed variable admittance control architecture to decrease the control system complexity, in which we represent the admittance control model as a port-Hamiltonian (pH) system and design an energy tank with the optimization theory. The advantages of the proposed architecture are reflected in several aspects: 1) compatibility with common strategies; 2) perturbation resistance; and 3) passivity as a natural property. As the dissipated energy from the pH system is injected into the energy tank while the energy in the tank is used to support the interaction and perturbation resistance, the best passive approximation of the desired behaviors is generated, which can avoid the control signal failure (control signal failure denotes that the unexpected input $u=0$ occurs due to a lack of energy in the tank). Three different groups of experiments are conducted to verify the feasibility, perturbation resistance, and practicality of the proposed architecture.},

  abstract     = {Constrained nonlinear equations (CNEs) are involved in numerous practical applications, and many solutions to CNEs have been reported. In particular, a special neural network called zeroing neural network (ZNN) has recently been developed to solve the time-dependent CNE (TDCNE). In this study, we propose a new discrete-time ZNN (DTZNN) model to determine the numerical solution of the TDCNE. Such a model, which is derived from the discretization of the previous ZNN model via a special difference formula, can achieve excellent performance on computing and solving the TDCNE. Theoretical analysis and comparative numerical results further denote the validity and superiority of the proposed DTZNN model. Finally, the proposed model is used to simulate the dual-arm robot system, which verifies the practicability and feasibility of the DTZNN.},

  abstract     = {Infinite-horizon optimal control of constrained piecewise affine (PWA) systems has been approximately addressed by hybrid model predictive control (MPC), which, however, has computational limitations, both in offline design and online implementation. In this article, we consider an alternative approach based on approximate dynamic programming (ADP), an important class of methods in reinforcement learning. We accommodate nonconvex union-of-polyhedra state constraints and linear input constraints into ADP by designing PWA penalty functions. PWA function approximation is used, which allows for a mixed-integer encoding to implement ADP. The main advantage of the proposed ADP method is its online computational efficiency. Particularly, we propose two control policies, which lead to solving a smaller-scale mixed-integer linear program than conventional hybrid MPC, or a single convex quadratic program, depending on whether the policy is implicitly determined online or explicitly computed offline. We characterize the stability and safety properties of the closed-loop systems, as well as the suboptimality of the proposed policies, by quantifying the approximation errors of value functions and policies. We also develop an offline mixed-integer-linear-programming-based method to certify the reliability of the proposed method. Simulation results on an inverted pendulum with elastic walls and on an adaptive cruise control problem validate the control performance in terms of constraint satisfaction and CPU time.},

  abstract     = {Centrality metrics play a crucial role in network analysis, while the choice of specific measures significantly influences the accuracy of conclusions as each measure represents a unique concept of node importance. Among over 400 proposed indices, selecting the most suitable ones for specific applications remains a challenge. Existing approaches—model-based, data-driven, and axiomatic—have limitations, requiring association with models, training datasets, or restrictive axioms for each specific application. To address this, we introduce the culling method, which relies on the expert concept of centrality behavior on simple graphs. The culling method involves forming a set of candidate measures, generating a list of as small graphs as possible needed to distinguish the measures from each other, constructing a decision-tree survey, and identifying the measure consistent with the expert’s concept. We apply this approach to a diverse set of 40 centralities, including novel kernel-based indices, and combine it with the axiomatic approach. Remarkably, only 13 small 1-trees are sufficient to separate all 40 measures, even for pairs of closely related ones. By adopting simple ordinal axioms like Self-consistency or Bridge axiom, the set of measures can be drastically reduced making the culling survey short. Applying the culling method provides insightful findings on some centrality indices, such as PageRank, Bridging, and dissimilarity-based Eigencentrality measures, among others. The proposed approach offers a cost-effective solution in terms of labor and time, complementing existing methods for measure selection, and providing deeper insights into the underlying mechanisms of centrality measures.},

The proposed protocol makes use of two independent channels to transmit data separately, thereby improving the channel utilization efficiency and reducing the probability of packet dropout. Then, with the proposed protocol and the iterative dynamic linearization approach, an adaptive iterative learning controller associated with a parameter estimation strategy is provided for the nonlinear system under investigation. The control law is data-driven, which therefore does not require knowledge of the model. Subsequently, the sufficient condition is derived under which the tracking error is forced to convergent.

In this framework, dependence between $\mathcal {X}$ and $\mathcal {Y}$ in D, denoted ${\mathfrak {B}}_{\mathrm {}} (\mathcal {X}, \mathcal {Y} | D)$ , is quantified as $P (H_{1} | D)$ , the posterior probability for the model of dependence given D, or any strictly increasing function thereof. It is therefore a measure of the evidence for dependence between $\mathcal {X}$ and $\mathcal {Y}$ as modeled by $H_{1}$ and observed in D. We review several statistical models and reconsider standard results in the light of ${\mathfrak {B}}_{\mathrm {}} (\mathcal {X}, \mathcal {Y} | D)$ as a measure of dependence. Using simulations, we focus on two specific issues: 1) the effect of noise and 2) the behavior of ${\mathfrak {B}}_{\mathrm {}} (\mathcal {X}, \mathcal {Y} | D)$ when $H_{1}$ has a parameter coding for the intensity of dependence. We then derive some general properties of ${\mathfrak {B}}_{\mathrm {}} (\mathcal {X}, \mathcal {Y} | D)$ , showing that it quantifies the information contained in D in favor of $H_{1}$ versus $H_{0}$ . While some of these properties are typical of what is expected from a valid measure of dependence, others are novel and naturally appear as desired features for specific measures of dependence, which we call inferential. We finally put these results in perspective; in particular, we discuss the consequences of using the Bayesian framework as well as the similarities and differences between ${\mathfrak {B}}_{\mathrm {}} (\mathcal {X}, \mathcal {Y} | D)$ and mutual information.},

  abstract     = {Bird excrement deposited on solar panels can lead to hotspots, significantly reducing the efficiency of solar power plants. This article presents a novel solution to this problem leveraging unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) systems for the automated geolocation and removal of bird excrement across large-scale solar power facilities. First, a UAV executes a predefined flight path to capture sequential aerial images of the plant. These images are subsequently stitched to produce a high-definition orthomosaic of the entire facility. An advanced detection framework based on YOLOv7, enhanced with an attention module, is employed to accurately detect bird excrement by reducing background noise and highlighting key features. An additional prediction head is integrated to improve detection of smaller bird excrements. To compute precise geolocation of the detected excrement, the midpoint pixel coordinates of the excrement along with the azimuth angle and actual ground distance (AGD) relative to a ground control point (GCP) is used. This article further proposes a cleaning technique that employs a traveling salesman problem (TSP) approximation algorithm to efficiently optimize flight path of the cleaning UAV. Experimental results indicate the system achieves an average detection precision (AP) of 93.91% and GPS coordinate accuracy with an average error of 0.149 m, demonstrating the efficacy of the proposed method in both geolocation and removal of bird excrement from solar panels.},

Furthermore, we establish that random nonlinear systems utilizing self-triggered control (STC) can achieve NSS, by setting a minimum triggering time to prevent Zeno behavior. Lastly, by adopting the adaptive dynamic programming (ADP) strategy, we develop self-triggered optimal control for random systems with Markovian switching, ensuring the uniform ultimate boundedness (UUB) of the signals in all closed-loop systems. This article addresses three key gaps in the field of RDE optimal control, contributing substantially to both theoretical and practical advancements.

Taking Petri nets (PNs) as a modeling and analysis tool, this article focuses on the deadlock control problem for a forward-conflict free net (FCFN), which allows for batch assembly and multiple resource allocations. First, a new structural characterization of deadlocks in FCFN is proposed through two structural objects: 1) circuit and 2) $\omega $ -structure. The starting point for this is motivated by the fact that deadlocks in assembly systems stem not only from the circular wait of resources but also the parts waiting for their assembly with other parts. Subsequently, based on these two objects, a necessary and sufficient condition about FCFNs liveness is obtained: 1) an FCFN is live if and only if no circuit and 2) $\omega $ -structure are saturated at any reachable marking. Finally, in order to prevent each such object from inducing deadlocks, a hierarchical search algorithm appropriate for real-time implementation is developed to avoid its saturation. The proposed algorithm is proven to be capable of ensuring the deadlock-free operation of FCFNs. Moreover, several examples are provided to demonstrate its effectiveness.},

  abstract     = {In multiagent systems, conventional methods for addressing consensus problems typically rely on utilizing local and smooth control inputs; however, the focus of these methods is often on achieving asymptotic behavior, rather than transient response. In the existing literature, it has been shown that resetting some controller states can improve the transient response of linear systems. In this article, by utilizing a model predictive control (MPC)-based reset strategy, a new design framework is proposed that ensures not only the asymptotic stability but also the achievement of a desired transient performance. The proposed approach entails minimizing a quadratic cost function to determine the optimal after-reset values for controller states. The problem is then reformulated as a linear matrix inequality (LMI) optimization problem, which is solved to determine the reset law at specific reset instants, enabling the controller to achieve optimal performance and stability in a given multiagent system. The proposed method can be implemented in two distinct modalities. In the first one, characterized as distributed, when the reset conditions are satisfied in a particular agent at any given moment, only the controller state of that specific agent undergoes a reset in that moment, consequently, the transient performance improvement is exclusively limited to that particular agent. On the other hand, in the second modality, known as centralized, when the reset conditions hold in one agent, the controller states of all agents are reset simultaneously, thereby the transient performances of all agents concurrently experience improvement. Finally, numerical simulations are provided to demonstrate the superior performance of both suggested approaches in comparison with conventional reset methods. Furthermore, a comparison between the two suggested strategies is conducted.},

  abstract     = {This article develops a fixed-time identifier for modeling unknown discrete-time nonlinear systems without requiring the standard persistence of excitation (PE) condition. A data-driven update law based on a modified gradient descent (GD) update law is presented to learn the system parameters, which relies on the concurrent learning approach under which the recorded past data and the current data are employed concurrently. Fixed-time convergence guarantees are provided for the modified GD update law under the condition that the recorded data fulfills a rank condition, which is less restrictive than the standard PE condition. To guarantee fixed-time convergence, fixed-time Lyapunov analysis is leveraged. Compared to typical GD-based update laws, two main advantages of the presented approach are: 1) the modified GD update law guarantees fixed-time convergence instead of asymptotic convergence and 2) the convergence guarantee is provided under an easy-to-check rank condition rather than the standard PE condition, which is hard or even impossible to check online. Simulation results are provided to verify the obtained results.},

  abstract     = {Systems of different types of agents coupled with high-order interactions can emerge complex synchronization patterns. This article presents an analysis framework to study the group synchronization of heterogeneous multiagent systems with hierarchical structure and directed interactions of arbitrary order. First, directed hypergraph is introduced to describe the arbitrary-order interactions among the agents. Then, to explore the possible group synchronization patterns, the agent partition methods commonly used in dyadic graphs are extended to the directed hypergraph. Meanwhile, to verify the admissibility of the group synchronization patterns, two equitable partition types of agent partition are defined from the perspective of hyperedge partition. Next, using the simultaneous block diagonalization method, the stability problem of the group synchronous solution is decoupled into several independent subblocks. These subblocks are associated with the perturbations along and transverse to the synchronous manifold, with transverse subblocks related to loss of synchronization. Therefore, the stability of the group synchronous solution can be investigated by evaluating the stability of each transverse subblock via the master stability function method, thus significantly reducing the stability calculation complexity. Finally, the effectiveness of the analysis framework is illustrated via the simulation.},

Also, it can conquer a conservative limitation that the bounds of the transformed error-constraints are known. Subsequently, the critic-actor–identifier framework is constructed in the backstepping step to evaluate the objective function, control behavior and unknown dynamic, respectively, wherein the decentralized controller derived from the learning process and the fault-tolerant controller are separated by introducing an intermediate controller. Meanwhile, it is illustrated that the trajectory tracking errors will approach to a small region nearby the origin, and the system states may not beyond the given asymmetric constraint bounds, even in the presence of faults.

Existing research only focuses on the methodologies and lacks the systematic modeling and solving of national image resources recommendation. A collaborative recommendation approach to national image resources is proposed for targeted international communication. In it, the multidimensional features of national image resources and characteristics of communication audiences are modeled, and an evaluation mechanism is proposed to measure the comprehensive compatibility between national image resources and communication audiences. By innovatively introducing the role-based collaboration (RBC) theory and the environment-classes, agents, roles, groups, and objects (E-CARGO) model, the national image resources recommendation is formalized as a collaborative optimization problem. The mathematical model is built and solved via an optimization package. Finally, the case study and experiments show that the approach is efficient, feasible, and conducive to enhancing the efficiency of selecting national image resources. It offers a novel research paradigm for targeted international communication.},

  abstract     = {Conventional assistive and rehabilitative robotic systems often overlook human biomechanics, particularly muscular forces, as they predominantly operate in joint or task space and focus on position and exchanged forces. Similarly, traditional manual rehabilitation techniques employed by physiotherapists struggle to obtain quantitative measurements and make precise modifications to key human variables, resulting in predominantly qualitative methods and outcomes. In response to these limitations, this article introduces an innovative assistive robot controller that operates in the muscular space, targeting specific muscles in the lower limb, and distinguishing itself from existing solutions that focus primarily on joint or task space. A key innovation of our approach is the real-time measurement of muscular forces during dynamic tasks, obtained from a calibrated musculoskeletal model. These measurements enable the establishment of a multistep closed-loop controller, with the outer loop precisely tracking the desired muscular forces. Implemented within a configurable viscous environment, the controller provides a natural response for the user. Experimental evaluations conducted using a parallel robot designed for rehabilitation demonstrate the controller’s efficacy. Incorporating the outer loop reduced the median relative error of the tracked muscular force by nearly 80% and decreased the variability of this error by over 85% compared to a pure viscous environment defined as the baseline. These findings highlight the potential applications of this control framework in areas, such as assistive robotics and precision rehabilitation. By achieving objective measurement and control, the system may enhance rehabilitation outcomes, offering tailored exercises that match the individual needs, capabilities, and engagement of each patient.},

It can be seen that even if there are uncertain parameters in the cost function, exact optimization can still be achieved. To solve this problem in a distributed manner when different local cost functions have identical Hessians, we propose a novel distributed algorithm that cascades the fixed-time average estimator and the distributed optimizer. We remove the requirement for the upper bounds of certain complex functions by integrating state-based gains in the proposed design. We further extend this result to address the distributed optimization where the time-varying cost functions have nonidentical Hessians. We prove the convergence of all the proposed algorithms in the global sense. Numerical examples verify the proposed algorithms.},

Since FDI attacks produce unknown attack gains, which increases the difficulty of the controller design, an adaptive secure control strategy is given based on the essential property of Nussbaum functions. By improving the traditional coordinate transformation in the current literatures that can only achieve unilateral consensus control, a backstepping-based control algorithm is put forward attaining bilateral consensus control. In addition, the appropriate Lyapunov functions are generated by a class of non-negative functions to construct the adaptive secure bipartite consensus controllers, which not only makes certain that the bilateral errors ultimately converge to a predefined interval, but also guarantees that all the closed-loop signals within the investigated system are bounded. Conclusively, a practical example is provided to validate the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy.},

Based on the benefits of the logic processor, a switching sampled-data (SD) control protocol in which different feedback gains are chosen for different attack cases is proposed.

  abstract     = {The robotics research community has developed several effective techniques for quadrupedal locomotion. Most of these methods ease the modeling and control problem by assuming a rigid contact between the feet and the terrain. However, in the case of compliant terrain or robots equipped with soft feet, this assumption no longer holds, as the contact point moves and the reaction forces experience a delay. This article presents a novel approach for quadrupedal locomotion in the presence of soft contacts. The control architecture consists of two blocks: 1) upstream, the motion planner (MP) computes a feasible trajectory using model predictive control (MPC) and 2) downstream, the tracking controller (TC) employs hierarchical optimization (HO) to achieve motion tracking. This choice allows the control architecture to employ a large time horizon without heavily compromising the model’s accuracy. For the first time, both blocks consider the contact compliance: in the MP, the classic linear inverted pendulum model is extended by proposing the soft bilinear inverted pendulum (SBIP) model; conversely, the TC is a whole-body controller (WBC) that considers the full dynamics model, including the soft contacts. Simulations with multiple quadrupedal robots demonstrate that the proposed approach enables traversing soft terrains with improved stability and efficiency. Furthermore, the performance benefits of including the compliance in the MP and TC are evaluated. Finally, experiments on the SOLO12 robot walking on soft terrain validate the proposed approach’s effectiveness.},

To make sure that the transient time is within user’s preset time and the communication and computation resources are reduced, we focus on the event-triggered predefined-time control problem. To solve the problem, we design a node-based event-triggered controller in which coupling weights are updated based on an adaptive mechanism. Moreover, a state transformation is considered, and by analyzing the predefined-time stability of the transformed state, both the predefined-time longitudinal formation and the boundedness of controller are proved. Note that, with the adaptive updating mechanism, the control parameters do not depend on the information of Laplacian matrix and the bounds of unknown inertias. Thus, the formation is scalable for the case where some agents leave or join in the formation. Furthermore, to avoid updating the desired spacing manually when agents join or leave, we propose a fully distributed event-triggered predefined-time desired spacing decision algorithm based on distributed resource allocation algorithm. With the combination of the proposed spacing decision algorithm and controller, the longitudinal formation control is more scalable, time-saving and energy-saving.},

Erasable patterns are less profitable patterns whose gain, i.e., the sum of product profits, does not exceed a user-defined threshold. Mining erasable patterns provides the necessary information to users who want to increase profits by erasing less profitable patterns. There are requirements for a method which efficiently manages uncertain databases in incremental environments to identify erasable patterns that consider uncertainty. Because our novel technique uses a list structure, it is more efficient at finding erasable patterns from incremental databases. Moreover, accumulated stream data should be handled efficiently to identify new useful patterns in both additional data and the existing data. In this article, an algorithm using a list-based structure is proposed to extract erasable patterns containing valuable knowledge from uncertain databases in real time with effective and productive performance. In order to derive erasable patterns from continuously accumulated stream databases, the structure efficiently manages the information gathered from the previous database. Extensive performance and pattern quality evaluations were conducted using real and synthetic datasets. The results show that the algorithm performs up to seven times faster than state-of-the-art erasable pattern mining algorithms on real datasets and scales adeptly on synthetic datasets while delivering reliable and significant result patterns.},

Based on a nonlinear transformation function technique that eliminates the conventional feasibility conditions of virtual control laws in recursive design steps, the original state-constrained system is transformed into an unconstrained system. Subsequently, by deriving a practical prescribed-time adjustment function and its related stability lemma, a PTNDO-based adaptive control strategy is established to guarantee that the disturbance observation and tracking errors converge to the adjustable bound, including zero at a prescribed settling time, while maintaining state constraints.

  abstract     = {Soft actor-critic (SAC) is a reinforcement learning algorithm that employs the maximum entropy framework to train a stochastic policy. This work examines a specific failure case of SAC where the stochastic policy is trained to maximize the expected entropy from a sparse reward environment. We demonstrate that the over-exploration of SAC can make the entropy temperature collapse, followed by unstable updates to the actor. Based on our analyses, we introduce Reg-SAC, an improved version of SAC, to mitigate the detrimental effects of the entropy temperature on the learning stability of the stochastic policy. Reg-SAC incorporates a clipping value to prevent the entropy temperature collapse and regularizes the gradient updates of the policy via Kullback-Leibler divergence. Through experiments on discrete benchmarks, our proposed Reg-SAC outperforms the standard SAC in spare-reward grid world environments while it is able to maintain competitive performance in the dense-reward Atari benchmark. The results highlight that our regularized version makes the stochastic policy of SAC more stable in discrete-action domains.},

  abstract     = {This study revisits the fuzzy control system design problem with the motto “Fuzzy with Conventional Control,” inspired by L.A. Zadeh’s statement in the famous debate “Some Crisp Thoughts on the Fuzzy versus Conventional Control.” Focused on single-input (SI) fuzzy PIDs (FPIDs), our approach synergizes fuzzy and conventional control, presenting similar control laws to PID and fuzzy gain-scheduled (FGS) PID. Departing from traditional fuzzy control paradigms, our design methodology enhances, rather than replaces, PID controllers with fuzzy logic controllers (FLCs). We start by analyzing the internal structure of both type-1 and type-2 SI-FPIDs and commenting on their structural properties. We address the high-design complexity of FLCs by proposing an interpretable and geometrical design method that explicitly shapes fuzzy mapping (FM) according to the desired control characteristics. To provide self-tuning (ST) capability to the FPID, like the FGS-PID, we develop ST mechanisms that adapt the FM of SI-FPID according to the operating point via the derived insights. Real-world application in speed control for an industrial permanent magnet synchronous machine validates the efficacy of our designs, showcasing improved disturbance rejection and reduced control signal variation compared to FGS-PIDs and PID. This research advocates for the wider adoption of SI-FPID as a practical enhancement to PID in industrial applications, offering design simplicity and ST capabilities.},

  abstract     = {This article addresses the output-feedback reinforcement learning (RL)-based saturated proportional-integral-derivative (PID) control design for fully actuated Euler-Lagrange (EL) systems which are uncertain subject to actuator saturation with prescribed performance. It is assumed that the actuator input nonlinearity, uncertain nonlinearities and unmeasurable external disturbances have a significant impact on the system. The presence of actuator saturation and complex uncertainties may inevitably give rise to the breakdown of the EL control system. The lack of prior knowledge of the system dynamics renders the presented technique to achieve a robust prescribed tracking performance without using velocity sensors. To conquer mentioned obstacles, a novel RL saturated PID controller, which is not dependent on the system’s dynamics and only requires measurable output signals is designed via actor-critic structure to deeply estimate and compensate complex unknowns. An adaptive robust controller is used to reduce external disturbances effects adaptively. The prescribed performance funnel control way is considered to guarantee predetermined output constraints. The high-gain observer (HGO) is used to estimate velocities and derivatives free of system dynamics, and generalized saturation functions are utilized to efficiently decrease actuator saturation danger. It is proved that suggested technique ensures a robust prescribed performance with input constraints in the absence of velocity sensors and the existence of considerable complicated model uncertainties. A semi-global uniform ultimate boundedness (SGUUB) stability for tracking deviation errors and state estimation deviation is ensured through a Lyapunov stability study. Finally, experimental results on a real robotic arm is carried out to further demonstrate the effectiveness of all theoretical findings.},

In the first part, static optimization problems are formulated to compute the following parameters of the perimeter defense problem; the number of reserve stations, their locations, the priority region, the monitoring region, and the minimum number of defenders required for the monitoring purpose. The concept of a prioritized intruder is proposed here to identify and handle those critical intruders (computed based on the velocity ratio and location) to be tackled on a priority basis. The computed priority region helps to assign reserve defenders sufficiently earlier such that they can neutralize the prioritized intruders. The monitoring region defines the minimum region to be monitored and is sufficient enough to handle the intruders. In the second part, the earlier developed DREAM approach is modified to incorporate the priority of an intruder. The proposed P-DREAM approach assigns the defenders to the prioritized intruders as the first task. A convex territory protection problem is simulated to illustrate the P-DREAM approach. It involves the computation of static parameters and solving the prioritized task assignments with dynamic resource allocation. Monte-Carlo results were conducted to verify the performance of P-DREAM, and the results clearly show that the P-DREAM approach can protect the territory with consistent performance against highly manoeuvring intruders.},

  abstract     = {This article introduces a novel framework named double-latent optimization for representation disentanglement (D-LORD), which is designed for motion stylization (motion style transfer and motion retargeting). The primary objective of this framework is to separate the class and content information from a given motion sequence using a data-driven latent optimization approach. Here, class refers to person-specific style, such as a particular emotion or an individual’s identity, while content relates to the style-agnostic aspect of an action, such as walking or jumping, as universally understood concepts. The key advantage of D-LORD is its ability to perform style transfer without needing paired motion data. Instead, it utilizes class and content labels during the latent optimization process. By disentangling the representation, the framework enables the transformation of one motion sequence’s style to another’s style using adaptive instance normalization. The proposed D-LORD framework is designed with a focus on generalization, allowing it to handle different class and content labels for various applications. In addition, it can generate diverse motion sequences when specific class and content labels are provided. The framework’s efficacy is demonstrated through experimentation on three datasets: 1) the CMU XIA dataset for motion style transfer; 2) the multimodal human action database dataset; and 3) the RRIS Ability dataset for motion retargeting. Notably, this article presents the first generalized framework for motion style transfer and motion retargeting, showcasing its potential contributions in this area.},

First, the novel finite-time performance boundaries are proposed to ensure that consensus deviations converge to the predefined steady-state zones within a preassigned time, and by using asymmetrically parallel boundaries to constrain consensus errors to narrow feasible regions, small overshoots of consensus errors are assured. Second, by utilizing the inherent approximation property of fuzzy logic systems (FLSs), a fuzzy state observer is devised to recover the unmeasurable states. Based on the observation outcomes, an improved event-triggered output-feedback controller is synthesized so that the number of control input updates is reduced without incurring an evidently deteriorated control performance. The salient merits of the proposed approach are that all consensus errors are free from great overshoots, while settling time can be explicitly assigned in advance.

To safeguard privacy, persistent Laplace noise is introduced into the exchanged data, affecting the estimated optimal solution, gradient, and Hessian averages. To counteract the noise’s impact, the internode coupling strength is adaptively reduced over time through decay factors, allowing for noise attenuation as the algorithm progresses. The algorithm’s convergence to the optimal solution, assuming global function smoothness and strong convexity, is theoretically proven.

Despite their potential to significantly enhance operational efficiency, the integration of SRL for dynamic and intricate tasks presents challenges in teleoperation, precise positioning, and dynamic balance control. To address challenges in initiating control when targets or the SRL’s end-effector are outside the camera’s visual range, a coarse teleoperation strategy is implemented. This strategy utilizes the inertial measurement unit (IMU) and the extended Kalman filter (EKF), enabling basic orientation and movement toward the target area without reliance on visual cues. Challenges in achieving fine-tuned control for accurate task completion, particularly in visual navigation and precise positioning of the SRL’s end-effector, are addressed by integrating object detection via YOLOX with the tangential artificial potential field (T-APF) method for exact path planning. This integration significantly enhances the system’s ability to fine-tune the placement of end-effector. The challenge of conducting balance tasks without force sensors is tackled by adopting a dual-spring model combined with autoregressive (AR) predictive modeling, enabling effective balance support through anticipatory motion adjustments. Experiments have demonstrated the system’s enhanced positional accuracy and maintained synchronization with human movements, underscoring the effectiveness of the integrated approach in facilitating complex human-robot collaborative tasks.},

The primary objective of IVSM is to continuously map the heterogeneous sensory data within different time into a unified subspace, thereby enabling the direct measurement of heterogeneous and varying sensory data.

First, a continuous-time dynamic model that can be solved explicitly is constructed to model the discontinuous backlash-like hysteresis nonlinear behavior approximatively. Second, the coupling relationship between stochastic disturbance and hysteresis nonlinearity is analyzed, and the role of the coupling terms is attributed to each subsystem using the inequality expansion and the summation order transformation techniques. Then, based on the above analysis, a memory-free stochastic fixed-time control law without constructing the hysteresis inverse is developed recursively in the framework of backstepping by means of the It $\hat {o}$ stochastic differential equation theory and the adaptive fuzzy technique, which can achieve semiglobally practical fixed-time stability of stochastic systems with hysteresis properties and the tracking error can converge to a small neighborhood near the origin.

  abstract     = {In this article, the conditions of ensuring nonovershooting tracking control (NOTC) for nonlinear pure-feedback systems (PFSs) are proposed. Presently, there are almost no results of guaranteed NOTC conditions for nonlinear PFSs. And the results in strict-feedback form are also very narrow. Based on these problems, this article obtains a more extensive conditions of NOTC for nonlinear PFSs. First, a controller is designed to make the closed-loop system (CLS) globally asymptotically stable, and a suitable CLS can be obtained through the designed controller. Then, by analyzing the CLS, the NOTC conditions of the first-order, second-order, and multiorder systems can be obtained, respectively. Finally, through the simulation results of two examples and comparing the simulation results of the existing algorithms, it is concluded that the algorithm in this article is effective and superior. In this article, for more general nonlinear PFSs, a wider range of NOTC conditions are obtained, and the obtained NOTC conditions are also suitable for strict-feedback form. Therefore, this algorithm reduces the conservatism.},

First, the communication link faults, including the channel signal fading and cyber bias attack, is considered, and the communication link fault compensation controller is designed through introducing the adaptive signals with the estimate of the norms of the faulty matrix. Then, by using the minimum eigenvalue of the control gain matrix, the minimum-eigenvalue-based adaptive fault-tolerant controller is proposed to compensate for the time-varying actuator loss of effectiveness and bias faults. Moreover, the convergence performance analysis of the developed FTC algorithm is given based on the Lyapunov theory.

  abstract     = {This article copes with the distributed control and target tracking (DCTT) problem in general linear and Lipschitz multiagent systems (MASs). In comparison to the traditional DCTT algorithms that were developed for MASs in ideal conditions, two schemes based upon a resilient protocol are proposed for linear and nonlinear MASs to estimate and track a mobile target where all agents are subject to composite attacks, including camouflage attacks, DoS attacks, sensor attacks, and actuator attacks. Based on the digital twin approach, a twin layer (TL) with high privacy and security is introduced to separate the problem of DCTT into two tasks: 1) handling DoS attacks on the TL and defending against sensor and 2) actuator attacks on the cyber-physical layer (CPL). First, two distributed estimation algorithms are established to reconstruct the agents and target dynamics for every agent on the TL in the presence of DoS attacks. Second, using the reconstructed agents and target dynamics on the TL, a resilient distributed control protocol is designed to resist sensor and actuator attacks on the CPL. The current scheme guarantees the achievement of control and target tracking such that the DCTT error of the proposed design is ultimately bounded in terms of linear matrix inequality. By applying two simulation examples, the presented algorithms are also validated.},

By leveraging graph theory, the interconnections among fingers are delineated and integrated into the dynamic equations. The modified nonsingular terminal sliding mode (TSM) technique is employed to achieve fixed-time convergence of error variables without triggering singularity. Within the framework of composite learning, a novel computable prediction error is formulated by harnessing online historical data alongside the regression matrix. The combination of prediction errors and the regression matrix is utilized for parameter estimation, which, under a milder interval excitation (IE) condition, facilitates accurate parameter estimation without the requirement for the stringent persistent excitation (PE) condition.

During the DoS attacks, with communication services being denied, a halt in data transmission among the agents is experienced, which might result in performance degradation, undesirable oscillatory behavior, or even hinders the agents from performing their intended tasks. Consequently, there emerges a pressing requirement for the analysis and design of a secure bipartite tracking consensus protocol for MASs under the threat of DoS attacks. In pursuit of this goal, a modified Halanay-like inequality is initially established, which provides a basis for us to derive certain sufficient conditions ensuring the MASs to achieve the bipartite tracking consensus, despite the disruptive presence of malicious DoS attacks. Additionally, the control gain matrix can be readily computed by resolving a collection of linear matrix inequalities. For specific scenarios that demand reduced computational complexity, the matrix decoupling method is introduced, enabling a reduction in the dimensionality of the matrix inequalities and, consequently, facilitating its straightforward application to large-scale MASs. This article culminates in a numerical simulation, which is performed to validate the developed results.},

Through the time-dependent Lyapunov functional and free-weighed matrix, the tracking performance between the estimator and the exosystem is achieved and auxiliary dynamic variable asymptotically converges to zero. Further, according to the information of observer and estimator for each agent, the BT controller and the agent-state-dependent switching law are jointly designed to suppress control bumps and determine which subsystem to be activated. Besides, to cope with the tough scenario that the classical design of a single controller for each subsystem cannot achieve the decline of Lyapunov function and satisfactory BT performance simultaneously, two controllers are designed for each subsystem. In this way, a two-layer switching strategy is presented to deal with the problem of cooperative output regulation with satisfactory BT performance.

Complex evidence theory (CET) provides a framework for handling uncertainty reasoning in the complex plane. Within CET, complex basic belief assignment (CBBA) aims to tackle the uncertainty and imprecision inherent in data coinciding with phase or periodic changes. However, measuring the uncertainty of CBBA over time remains an open issue. This study introduces a novel entropy model, the complex belief (CB) entropy, within the framework of CET, designed to tackle the inherent uncertainty and imprecision in data with phase or periodic changes. The model is developed by integrating concepts of interference and fractal theory to extend the understanding of uncertainty over time. Methodologically, the CB entropy is constructed to include discord, nonspecificity, and an interaction term for focal elements, defined as interference. In addition, thanks to the concept of the fractal, the model is further generalized to time fractal-based CB (TFCB) entropy for forecasting future uncertainties. We furthermore analyze the properties of the entropy models. Findings demonstrate that the proposed entropy models provide a more comprehensive measure of uncertainty in complex scenarios.

In virtue of the first-order Taylor series approximation technique, a robust first-order approximate HJB equation is established. To further improve the approximation accuracy, a robust second-order approximate HJB equation is exploited by using the Hessian matrix of the value function. It is shown that the second-order approximate HJB equation could be extended to the uncertain DT linear systems. Aiming at obtaining the solutions of the two robust approximate HJB equations, we propose two corresponding policy iteration (PI) algorithms.

Third, an adaptive time delay controller is proposed for tracking the optimal set points. Then, the Lyapunov-Krasovskii functionals are employed to ensure the stability of C-TDROC.

The observers do not rely entirely on continuous measured output and do not need to interface docking with the original system equipment. In the FE process of the work, an iterative estimation convergence theorem (IECT) is proposed, which is a new breakthrough for the convergence theory of estimation mean sequence in the literature. The IECT can guarantee the obtained offline iterative FE sequence from the transmitted-data-driven observers to be convergent in certain conditions.

  abstract     = {This article presents an adaptive fuzzy control scheme capable of guaranteeing prescribed performance for stochastic nonlinear systems with unknown control directions. Unlike the majority of existing prescribed performance control schemes, the proposed scheme ensures the independence from initial errors and guarantees controllable overshoot. Moreover, the proposed prescribed function exhibits nonmonotonicity, which can be beneficial in control applications with input constraints. To address the challenge posed by unknown control directions, a novel class of multiple Nussbaum functions is introduced. Compared to the existing single Nussbaum function, the multiple Nussbaum functions can mitigate instability arising from the cancelation of multiple unknown signs. Additionally, to tackle unknown nonlinearities, a single-parameter fuzzy approximator is introduced, aiming to concurrently reduce computational complexity. Furthermore, a novel class of switching threshold event-triggered mechanisms is designed to address issues encountered in existing designs where parameter inequalities impose conservative constraints. The control scheme ensures that the tracking error converges to prescribed asymmetric boundaries with arbitrarily small residuals in a prescribed time, while also guaranteeing that all closed-loop signals are bounded in probability. The effectiveness and superiority of the control scheme are verified by simulation results.},

In order to enhance the security of the Markovian jumping CPSs, an encryption scheme based on complex dynamical networks (CDNs) is presented. Note that the existing encryption mechanism based on single-node chaotic systems cannot detect attacks when part of the encrypted information is eavesdropped by the attacker. However, the method presented here plays the advantage of complexity of CDNs in the encryption link and can still effectively identify attacks. In addition, the communication delay of data in the communication network is considered. It is shown that compared with the existing results, the encryption scheme proposed in this article does not involve the control link when realizing CDNs synchronization, thus widening the allowable range of delay. Furthermore, the synchronization of drive-response complex chaotic networks guarantees the Markovian jumping CPSs nominal performance without attacks and the stochastic input-to-state stability with attacks. In the end, two examples are given to describe that the proposed security architecture can detect attacks both in theory and simulation.},

  abstract     = {Accurate quality variable inference by process variables is the core of industrial inferential sensor modeling, where recent advancements have seen deep learning (DL) models achieving remarkable success. However, integrating knowledge of unit operations is critical for improving inferential sensor performance, yet it has received little attention. The main challenge lies in the incompleteness and correctness of industrial knowledge due to its semi-empirical nature and inevitable engineering errors. Addressing this, this article introduces the gradient knowledge network based on the graph neural network’s message-passing mechanism within the variational Bayesian inference framework, which naturally copes with the abovementioned issues by fusing observational data. Initially, the prior knowledge about the process variables, which mirrors the graph in graph neural network, is parameterized as Dirichlet distribution based on the analysis of message-passing mechanism. However, the divergence computation and normalization constraints are challenging for model implementation. To navigate these challenges, the Bayesian inference problem is transformed into an optimization problem, subsequently recast as a simulation problem induced by the gradient field, ensuring compatibility with DL backends. Furthermore, a theoretical iteration equation is derived to maintain the normalization constraint. The architecture of the proposed model and its learning algorithm are then detailed. Finally, various experiments are conducted on two real industrial processes to demonstrate the model’s efficacy from the perspective of prediction accuracy, sensitivity analysis, and ablation study.},

  abstract     = {Unsupervised anomaly detection (AD) methods based on deep learning have attracted great attention in unlabeled data mining. The performance of these AD methods usually depends on the representation ability of normal patterns and the quality of training data. However, most deep unsupervised AD methods do not capture the distribution characteristics and the diversity of normal patterns effectively. In the meantime, they ignore the interference of abnormal samples on the model in training data with anomaly contamination. To tackle these issues, this article proposes a method named landmark block-embedded aggregation autoencoder (LBAA) for AD. LBAA constructs a filter and an aggregation autoencoder by introducing a novel normal feature learning approach to improve data quality and adjust its distribution differences from anomalies. In the normal feature learning, we define a landmark block to represent distribution of a normal class and an adaptive selection mechanism of landmark blocks’ number to obtain diverse normal features. On the basis, the filter is constructed to filter distinct anomalies and improve the quality of the contaminated training data. Then, a weighted objective function is proposed to train the aggregation autoencoder. The function can reduce the interference of anomalies and realize the aggregation of normal samples to increase the feature differences between normal and abnormal samples. Next, the trained aggregation autoencoder calculates the anomaly score of each sample by summing the reconstruction error and its median sparseness to the landmark blocks. Finally, we report on a comprehensive experiment on multiple datasets. The obtained results validate the effectiveness and robustness of LBAA.},

  abstract     = {In minimally invasive surgery (MIS), the field of view (FOV) control is crucial. Autonomous endoscope robots have been developed to facilitate MIS procedures by enabling autonomous surgical target tracking, thus reducing the workload on surgeons. However, existing visual servoing-based target tracking methods for autonomous endoscopes often overlook the insecurity stemming from restricted workspace conditions. Instances, such as collisions between the endoscope robot’s tip and the patient’s chest or abdominal wall pose risks to patient tissue, while extensive motion of the endoscope shaft may damage incision port tissue. Addressing these security concerns, this article proposes a novel approach called virtual fixture-based restricted workspace constraint (RWSC) to reconstruct the endoscope robot’s movement range. A quadratic programming (QP) optimization framework is employed to govern the robot’s motion, ensuring autonomous target tracking while adhering to RWSCs. To solve the QP problem, we propose an adaptive zeroing neural network (ZNN) featuring a newly designed activation function (AF). This AF enhances the ZNN with predefined-time convergence and noise rejection capabilities, making it especially suitable for time-sensitive and noise-prone surgical applications. Theoretical analysis and experimental results demonstrate that our adaptive ZNN achieves shorter convergence times than existing neural dynamic-based QP solvers. Physical validations show the efficacy of the proposed RWSCs in limiting the workspace of the endoscope robot, while the FOV control strategy enables autonomous target tracking of flexible endoscopes under diverse constraints and objectives.},

Hence, in the context of networks, this article copes with the continuous network dismantling problem which aims to find the key node set whose removal would break down a given network more thoroughly and thus is more capable of suppressing virus or misinformation. To achieve this goal effectively and efficiently, we propose the external-degree and internal-size component suppression (EDIS) framework based on the network percolation, where we constrain the search space by a well-designed local goal function and candidate selection approach such that EDIS could obtain better results than the-state-of-the-art in networks of millions of nodes in seconds. We also contribute two strategies with time complexity ${\mathcal {O}}(m\log _{\vartheta } m)$ and space complexity ${\mathcal {O}}(m)$ , of networks of m edges, under such framework by well studying the evolving characteristics of the associated connected components as nodes are occupied, where $\vartheta \gt 1$ is a hyperparameter. Our results on 12 empirical networks from various domains demonstrate that the proposed method has far better performance than the-state-of-the-art over both effectiveness and computing time. Our study could play important roles in many real-world scenarios, such as the containment of misinformation or epidemics, the distribution of resources or vaccine, the decision of which group of individuals set to quarantine, or the detection of the resilience of a network-based system under intentional attacks.},

  abstract     = {Uncertainty is a crucial aspect in real-life scenarios, especially when dealing with ambiguous information from multimodal data sources. Complex evidence theory (CET), a generalized form of Dempster-Shafer evidence theory that uses complex numbers to describe uncertainty, offers a more promising framework for dealing with uncertainty in many fields. Focusing on conflict management in the CET framework, new divergence measures, namely, complex belief Kullback-Leibler (CBKL) divergence and complex belief Jensen-Shannon (CBJS) divergence, are proposed in this article to quantify the discrepancy between complex evidence bodies. Additionally, novel multisource information fusion methods based on CBKL divergence and CBJS divergence for decision making are proposed. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed methods, classification tasks are performed. The results demonstrate the feasibility and accuracy of the proposed methods in handling complex evidence fusion and decision-making tasks.},

First, for the nonlinear characteristics in CPSs, the model is reconstructed based on the Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy modeling technique. Then, a T-S fuzzy resilient observer is proposed to estimate the state as well as the actuator fault information. The proposed T-S fuzzy resilient observer proactively detects sensor transmission channels affected by dynamically changing denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, and proactively isolates contaminated data so as to reduce the impact of DoS attacks on the estimation effect. Based on the above content, an observer-based adaptive event-triggered security FTC scheme is proposed, which can ensure the stability of the CPSs and save the limited network resources between the controller and the actuator. Finally, simulation results are given to verify the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.},

The objectives are to minimize the maximum completion time (makespan), mean of earliness and tardiness, and total carbon emission, simultaneously. First, a mathematical model is established. Second, the double-learning-strategy-based Jaya algorithms are developed to address the problems. According to problem-specific nature, one Q-learning state-action strategy is designed to guide nondominated solutions choosing appropriate machine speed adjustment strategies for achieving a satisfactory tradeoff among the three objectives. Third, eight neighborhood structures are designed and embedded in the proposed Jaya algorithms to discover high-quality solutions in local spaces. Fourth, another three novel Q-learning state-action design strategies are proposed to dynamically select the appropriate neighborhood structures during iterations, which introduce the searching directions and improve the convergence of the proposed Jaya. Finally, 81 benchmark instances are solved and the effectiveness of improved strategies is demonstrated. The proposed Jaya algorithm with the best double Q-learning strategies is compared to a solver, Gurobi, to verify the developed mathematical model. The experimental analysis demonstrates that the improved Jaya algorithm with both the Q-learning based machine speed adjustment and the Q-learning-based neighborhood selection strategies shows the best performance.},

Nonetheless, quantifying uncertainty within CET remains a subject of ongoing research. To enhance decision making, a method for complex pignistic belief transformation (CPBT) has been introduced, which allocates CBBAs of multielement focal elements to subsets. CPBT’s core lies in the fractal-inspired redistribution of the complex mass function. This article presents an experimental simulation and analysis of CPBT’s generation process along the temporal dimension, rooted in fractal theory. Subsequently, a novel fractal-based complex belief (FCB) entropy is proposed to gauge the uncertainty of CBBA.

  abstract     = {The computerized delineation and prognosis of lung cancer is typically based on Computed Tomography (CT) image analysis, whereby the region of interest (ROI) is accurately demarcated and classified. Deep learning in computer vision provides a different perspective to image segmentation. Due to the increasing number of cases of lung cancer and the availability of large volumes of CT scans every day, the need for automated handling becomes imperative. This requires efficient delineation and diagnosis through the design of new techniques for improved accuracy. In this article, we introduce the novel Weighted Deformable U-Net (WDU-Net) for efficient delineation of the tumor region. It incorporates the Deformable Convolution (DC) that can model arbitrary geometric shapes of region of interests. This is enhanced by the Weight Generation (WG) module to suppress unimportant features while highlighting relevant ones. A new Focal Asymmetric Similarity (FAS) loss function helps handle class imbalance. Ablation studies and comparison with state-of-the-art models help establish the effectiveness of WDU-Net with ensemble learning, tested on five publicly available lung cancer datasets. Best results were obtained on the LIDC-IDRI lung tumor test dataset, with an average Dice score of 0.9137, the Hausdorff Distance 95% (HD95) of 5.3852, and Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) Curve (AUC) of 0.9449.},

However, these risers are vulnerable to vibrational disturbances, which can adversely impact system performance and induce fatigue damage. Therefore, effective vibration control strategies are required to address this issue. This study introduces an innovative adaptive quantized fault-tolerant control strategy designed to attenuate vibrations in a three-dimensional (3-D) riser-vessel system against the effects of actuator faults, unknown control direction, and external disturbances. Different from previous findings, the suggested controller can directly counteract the nonlinear component stemming from actuator faults and handle the nonlinear decomposition inherent to the quantizer, without the necessity for upper-limit estimation. Furthermore, to tackle the input saturation, control laws are formulated using the hyperbolic tangent operator. Finally, the proposed controller’s effectiveness and robustness are validated through thorough Lyapunov analysis and numerical simulations, affirming the system’s uniformly bounded stability.},

By merging ideas from estimation theory and consensus theory, three parallel auxiliary variables are designed to dynamically estimate the aggregative behavior of the collection, called the mean field term. The leaderless consensus of players’ estimates and the optimization of local objective function need to be achieved simultaneously. In addition, the dynamic event-triggered mechanism and adaptive learning gain are introduced, which provide a natural and scalable framework for distributed communication and computation in large-scale complex networks. We further prove that convergence to NE can be guaranteed using the designed strategies. Finally, a numerical experiment is provided to validate the proposed algorithm.},

The fact is that secondary control requires information exchange through sparse communication networks, which makes cybersecurity the key to achieving voltage restoration. Compared with the attack signals launched by nonintelligent attackers, stealthy attack signals are more difficult to capture. Similarly, since MGs actually operate in a closed environment, malicious attackers have limited knowledge of the MG’s structural information. Therefore, we reformulate the problem to a two-person zero-sum game between the attacker and defender and then seek the optimal voltage restoration control strategy. In the process of solving the optimal problem, both robustness and convergence of parameter estimation are considered in this article to enhance the feasibility of adaptive dynamic programming schemes. Additionally, while ensuring the voltage restoration performance of DC MGs and considering the constraints of actual network communication, a novel dynamic event-triggered mechanism is designed to reduce information transmission pressure. The effectiveness of the established control scheme is verified through real-time testing equipment built on OPAL-RT and comparison results.},

  abstract     = {As the number of scientific publications continues to increase at a dizzying rate, researchers face challenges related to spending too much time and effort searching for appropriate papers to cite in their work. Citation recommendation models have thus been developed to automatically generate a list of relevant papers for a specific text passage, thus helping to reduce the workload for scientists and contribute to better-quality research. Consequently, this research direction has recently attracted significant interest in the scientific community. However, the current citation recommendation models still focus primarily on the citation context and do not adequately address the metadata of papers, such as the citation links, publication time, and venue. To overcome these problems, in this study, we propose the SciBERT-GraphSAGE which is a hybrid deep learning-based model for recommending a list of academic papers by considering both the citation context and this article’s metadata. Our model has two important components: 1) SciBERT for text data representation learning and 2) GraphSAGE for learning the representations of this article’s citation links. We validate the effectiveness of our model on three benchmark datasets: 1) FullTextPeerRead; 2) ACL; and 3) RefSeer. The results from experiments demonstrate that our novel SciBERT-GraphSAGE model outperforms previous advanced models in terms of Recall@K, mean reciprocal rank (MRR), and mean average precision (MAP).},

Then, to overcome bandwidth constraints, a new hybrid event-triggered and impulsive security consensus control approach is first designed, which only needs to detect the sampled data at instants of cyber attacks and impulse.

In order to effectively measure and infer the epistemic uncertainty for both static BPAs and dynamic fusion processes, a solution based on plausibility entropy is proposed in this study. At first, four new properties, called grouping, splitting, weighted additivity, and weighted subadditivity, are proved for the first time in this study to strengthen the theoretical foundation of plausibility entropy in measuring the uncertainty associated with a given BPA. Second, the upper bounds of uncertainty are derived for typical BPA-based multisource information fusion systems, including standard DCR, weighted DCR, discounted DCR fusion systems for evidence defined on the same frame of discernment (FOD), and the DCR fusion system for evidence defined on multiple distinct FODs. Several examples are given to illustrate these results.},

  abstract     = {In this research, a battery control method is proposed to handle the repetitive but nonidentical daily state-of-charge (SoC) profiles of electric vehicle (EV) batteries. The proposed method employs an iterative learning control (ILC) framework having a quadratic performance index with iteration-varying weighting matrices. This results in iteration-varying ILC control gains to better cope with iteration-varying SoC profiles. Moreover, input constraints representing the limits on the ranges of the charge and discharge currents are considered, leading to an iteration-varying constrained convex optimization problem. This optimization problem is solved to obtain the ILC control input update via resolving its Lagrange dual problem. Next, a data-driven method based on the dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) approach is proposed to predict the SoC profile in the next weekday based on the SoC profiles in the current and previous weekdays. The predicted SoC profile is then served as the reference for the ILC tracking controller. Finally, the proposed methods are verified through extensive numerical simulations for a synthetic case and for a realistic, benchmark driving pattern. In the simulations, different ways of selecting the iteration-varying weighting matrices are introduced and their control performances are compared. It is also shown that the proposed ILC control design outperforms conventional P-type and adaptive ILC controllers as well as the classical proportional-integral-derivative controller on the tracking of the SoC profile based on the considered realistic driving pattern.},

  abstract     = {Finite- and fixed-time parameter estimation and adaptive control have been extensively investigated in recent years. This study proposes a finite- and fixed-time learning control framework to achieve simultaneous finite/fixed-time parameter estimation and control. The proposed learning control method first estimates unknown parameters and then uses these estimates to improve the control performance. Therefore, we first consider the convergence condition of finite/fixed-time parameter estimation. Next, a novel learning-based finite/fixed control law is designed. Unlike most existing adaptation laws, the estimate is updated to improve the understanding of the system rather than eliminate the influence of uncertainties. The finite/fixed-time convergence of the system states is analyzed using a direct dynamic analysis method that differs from the long-used Lyapunov method. We show that the proposed control input satisfies the excitation condition of the finite/fixed-time estimation, indicating simultaneous estimation and control. Finally, numerical simulations are performed to verify the theoretical results.},

Different from existing ones, an order-reduction method (ORM) is proposed to reduce the order of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) without a complicated calculation process. The problem of complexity explosion caused by using LMI to analyze MASs is solved. To start with, we discuss and compare the existing ORMs and our ORM, respectively. Subsequently, under this improved ORM and the quadratic-delay-product method, a modified Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional (LKF) is constructed to obtain a less conservative consensus criterion. Then, we put forward a consensus controller which allows larger time delay upper bound. In addition, based on the self-adaptive differential evolution (DE) algorithm, the performance of the controller is significantly optimized. It is strictly proved that the designed controller can guarantee the realization of consensus and the LMI method used is feasible because it is independent of the number of agents. Finally, the simulation and comparison results illustrate the superiority of the theoretical results over others.},

  abstract     = {In the last years, our cities become more and more crowded due to the increasing number of cars into old city planes. So, even small/medium cities experience a travel time comparable with the bigger ones. To improve mobility management in modern cities, specific simulation tools can be used to analyze the impact of different mobility plans on mobility and, therefore to find the most suitable solution for each city. However, these tools are often hard to be used by city traffic managers without advanced computer skills. In this article, we used a multiagent transport simulation (MATSim) to provide a simple tool that can be easily used by end-users to better plan mobility strategies for both private and public transportation. In particular, starting from the open data provided by the city of Messina, we have implemented a software tool able to process MATSim events. Moreover, we propose a metric to estimate the safety of roads for cyclists. From the experimental results provided by the proposed software, we are able to discover the most overloaded links and estimate the travel time distribution by hour of departure time.},

The implementation of such application becomes even more theoretical and practical challenge if uncertainties in the robot model, unmeasured velocity vector and multiple-dynamic-obstacles environment are involved, yet certain behavior indices are also pursued. In this work, a settling time regulator is introduced and it is integrated with the dynamic surface-based backstepping design embedded with specific system transformation. This results in a solution that both constrained and unconstrained cases can be accommodated uniformly, concurrently, the settling time and tracking precision can be preset by user as required. Furthermore, a fuzzy velocity observer is designed with aid of the fuzzy logic technique, which is nontrivial to perform a control design of robot dynamics with unmeasured velocity vector and modeling uncertainties. In particular, benefiting from integral multiplicative barrier-Lyapunov function, an improved adaptive obstacle-avoiding controller is designed, which, without control singular issue, is capable of achieving desired tracking while avoiding obstacles encountered. The validity and benefits of the resultant control strategy are eventually substantiated via the simulation results of a two-DOF robotic manipulator.},

Theoretical results and numerical calculations indicate that MDMDSHNN is capable of producing any desired amount of multidirectional multidouble-scroll attractors, including unidirectional (1-D), bidirectional (2-D), and three-directional (3-D) multidouble-scroll attractors. Furthermore, an infinite amount of initial offset-boosted coexisting multidouble-scroll chaotic attractors possessing identical shapes but different positions, i.e., homogeneous extreme multistability are also found via switching the memristor initial values. Furthermore, to validate the physical implementability and practicality of MDMDSHNN, the digital hardware platform is performed. Finally, to investigate MDMDSHNN in practical application, an image encryption scheme with superior security performance is given by employing the homogeneous multidouble-scroll chaotic sequences, further illustrating good superiority and effectiveness of the present MSC method.},

This article introduces an adaptive multi/many-objective transformation technique, termed adaptive many-objective transformation technique (AMaOTCO), designed to effectively address COPs. The transformed many-objective optimization problem (MaOP) defines an objective using a convex combination of the objective function (or constraint violation function) and an auxiliary function. This auxiliary function is constructed through a convex combination of the objective function and a weighted constraint violation function. The adaptive tuning of all combination coefficients is based on population information. This adaptive tuning ensures an intelligent balance between minimizing various constraint violations and managing the tradeoff between objective function minimization and constraint violation reduction. The effectiveness of the proposed AMaOTCO is demonstrated through comparisons with state-of-the-art constrained evolutionary algorithms (CEAs) on a set of real-world COPs.},

Specifically, a mapping matrix is proposed to transform source parameters into intermediate parameters with dimensions matching the target parameters. By treating the intermediate parameter and mapping matrix as latent variables, variational Bayesian (VB) inference is introduced to efficiently approximate intractable posterior distributions of all unknown parameters, with variances reflecting their uncertainty levels. A probabilistic PTI is then proposed to derive the transfer posterior conditioned on the intermediate parameters, whose analytical form is vital for carrying out VB. Based on this, a heterogeneous PTI is established under the VB framework such that variational posterior distributions for all unknown parameters can be updated iteratively. Finally, an atmospheric fermenter example verifies that the proposed algorithm can bring in model accuracy improvement as high as 60% compared with the nontransfer identification approach, when dealing with nonideal measurements.},

They oversimplify the treatment of diverse samples by assuming that they exist in the same class space, ignoring their labels and distribution information. Consequently, difficulties arise when dealing with data that exhibit considerable distribution variations across classes. To address this issue, this study proposes a directed fuzzy rough set model that better captures the inherent uncertainty in sample distribution compared with traditional models. In this model, class-subspace distribution information is seamlessly integrated into directed fuzzy binary relations. Furthermore, fuzzy rough approximation operators are redefined to accurately capture the uncertainty associated with class distribution, facilitating a comprehensive analysis of relevant properties concerning decision approximations for samples. Building on this background, a heuristic algorithm for feature selection and a K-nearest neighbor reduction classifier are developed. Comparative experiments with top-tier algorithms showcase the outstanding performance of our proposed model.

  abstract     = {Broad learning system (BLS), a tri-layer feedforward neural network, has gained widespread recognition for its exceptional scalability and computational efficiency. However, BLS and its derivatives encounter several challenges: 1) overlooking the uncertainty introduced by numerous nonlinear random mappings; 2) failing to cope with the misalignment of model inputs with the output sampling rate; 3) lack of attention to nonstationary scenarios; and 4) absence of theoretical optimization for incremental learning. To overcome these obstacles, we propose a regression modeling and anomaly detection scheme rooted in a temporal kernel stationary BLS (TKS-BLS). We first create a nonlinear kernel broad representation (NKBR) extraction strategy, providing a robust nonlinear foundation for random feature mapping via kernel technology. Following this, we probe the mechanism of temporal matching between model inputs and outputs through a temporal alignment parameter, interpretable under a latent variable relationship. In the integration phase, we establish a Kullback-Leibler divergence objective function to facilitate the capture of stationary relationships within time-series data, in conjunction with the regression error. Subsequently, a double-loop parameter optimization algorithm and an independent incremental learning mechanism are put forth, both backed by comprehensive theoretical analyses. Our method’s superiority is thoroughly confirmed by experimental outcomes from extensive case studies across seven real ironmaking process datasets.},

  abstract     = {The high-order fully actuated (HOFA) system approaches are utilized in this article to solve the synthesis problem of a class of generalized pseudo pure-feedback nonlinear control systems (PPFNCSs). Contrary to the traditional state space method, a recursive design approach is proposed to transform the generalized PPFNCSs into HOFA systems by adopting the idea of “ascending order and descending dimension.” In this framework, a class of generalized first-order, second-order, and mixed-order PPFNCSs are transformed into HOFA models based on the newly proposed generalized inverse function lemma, which overcomes the problem that traditional backstepping design methods are not applicable to such systems without any restrictions. Based on this, the linear time-invariant systems with the desired characteristic structure are derived by designing control strategies for the transformed HOFA systems, which not only achieves the desired control performance but also successfully avoids the problem of “explosion of complexity.” To demonstrate the effect of the approach, two examples are performed at final.},

  abstract     = {In the face of environmental deterioration and global climate change, the concept of carbon neutrality and carbon peaking has gained prominence as a means to balance development and environmental preservation worldwide. Energy-aware scheduling is becoming the key scenario for environment conservation in manufacturing. This study focuses on addressing the energy-aware distributed no-wait flow-shop scheduling problem in a heterogeneous factory system (EDNWFSP-HFS) to minimize total energy consumption (TEC) and total tardiness (TTDs). A mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model is formulated and a policy-based meta-heuristic algorithm (MHA-PG) is specifically designed to solve EDNWFSP-HFS. First, the optimal allocation rules based on random sequence (OAR-RS) are designed to initialize the population. Second, a policy-based method is employed to guide the algorithm toward making a better decision. Third, the energy-saving strategy considering specific knowledge of EDNWFSP-HFS is summarized to further optimize the feasible solution. Extensive simulations are conducted, comparing the performance of MHA-PG against several state-of-the-art algorithms. The results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms the competing approaches in solving EDNWFSP-HFS, indicating its superior performance and effectiveness.},

  abstract     = {This article proposes a novel even-triggered mechanism (ETM) to improve load frequency control (LFC) in power systems with electric vehicle (EV) integration, particularly when faced with bandwidth-constrained network communication. To mitigate the transmission of redundant packets that are typically found in conventional ETMs, a variable probabilistic release (VPR) scheme is introduced. The foundation of this VPR-based ETM rests on two crucial steps: 1) Construction of an Event Generator With Variable Probability: This generator facilitates the selection of actual released packets (ARPs) by using the VPR scheme from a group of triggered packets. Leveraging an algorithm, the probability of transmitting each triggered packet in the subsequent group is recomputed, enabling a more adaptive response to system dynamics. 2) Setting a Buffer With Delay Effect: A buffer is utilized to delay the release of ARPs until the final triggered instant in a group. The design not only simplifies timing division but also enhances system stability within fixed time intervals. Furthermore, this work formulates sufficient conditions that ensure the mean-square asymptotic stability (MSAS) of power systems. An illustrative example is presented to confirm the superiority of the proposed VPR-based ETM through comparative analysis with traditional ETMs.},

First, a dynamic-event-triggered mechanism (DETM) with a time-varying additional threshold is introduced, which can save communication resources more effectively. However, due to the introduction of DETM, the modes of the controller and the system exhibit asynchronous behavior. On the other hand, while network communication facilitates signal transmission, it also exposes the system to an open environment vulnerable to cyberattacks. To address these issues, we devise a security asynchronous controller based on the hidden Markov model. In addition, this article also considers a class of actuator saturation problem. After that, the sufficient conditions for RSs are obtained by applying the stability theory of Lyapunov functional and linear matrix inequalities. The controller gains are obtained by the matrix decoupling method. Finally, the feasibility and practicability of the method are verified by the circuit model and a numerical simulation.},

  abstract     = {Photovoltaic (PV) power forecasting is important for promoting the integration of renewable energy sources. However, neural network-based methods, particularly deep learning for PV power forecasting, face challenges with computational and memory requirements when dealing with industry-scale datasets. To address this, we introduce Rec-PF, a robust computational framework employing the tensor-train (TT) technique. This framework aims to streamline the training process of massive deep learning recommendation models (DLRMs) on constrained resources. Rec-PF employs a high-performance compressed embedding table, enhancing TT decomposition using key computing primitives. It serves as a drop-in replacement for the PyTorch API. Additionally, Rec-PF utilizes an index reordering technique to leverage local and global information from training inputs, thereby enhancing performance. Furthermore, Rec-PF adopts a pipeline training model, eliminating the need for communication between training workers and host memory. We are pioneers in applying DLRM to PV power prediction to reduce training time without compromising accuracy. Our approach demonstrates a twofold improvement in training time compared to methods that do not incorporate our approach. To better demonstrate the enhanced performance of the algorithm, we specifically compare its efficiency with other frameworks using datasets commonly employed in recommender systems. Comprehensive experiments indicate that Rec-PF is capable of processing the largest publicly accessible DLRM and PV datasets on a single GPU, offering a threefold acceleration compared to state-of-the-art DLRM and PV frameworks.},

According to the communication link and group allocation results, an optimal search formation is designed for each group to maximize their individual search ranges. For transmitting information between different groups, by employing the agent with the highest communication efficiency within the discovery agent’s group as the relay agent, a communication relay strategy is proposed to transmit the task information to other groups. Then, a task allocation strategy based on communication relays is designed to achieve global task allocation by using the estimated state information of all agents. Moreover, to ensure the sustainability of task search and allocation, an intergroup scheduling strategy is proposed to recover the optimal search formation after agents complete the task-related works.

  abstract     = {The self-attention mechanism has advantages in analyzing the internal characteristics of data and capturing local information. Therefore, it is applied to fault detection. Since complex industrial processes usually contain a mixture of properties, such as nonlinearity, dynamics, and non-Gaussianity, this places higher demands on fault detection methods. To further improve the performance of the self-attention mechanism for fault detection in complex industrial processes, an innovative self-attention mechanism integrating the adaptive double subspace (ISA-ADS) method is proposed for fault detection. First, the query matrix, the key matrix, and the value matrix of the self-attention mechanism are designed so that they can better focus on local information through the adaptive sample weight allocation strategy. At the same time, this design reduces the interference of nonlinear and noisy information and amplifies the impact of important fault information in the sample. Second, considering the problem of Gaussian and non-Gaussian distributions of the data and the different degrees of influence of different subspaces on the final process monitoring results, an adaptive Gaussian and non-Gaussian double subspace fault detection model based on the self-attention output matrix is established, which adaptively assigns different weights to different subspaces by determining their importance. The statistics of different subspaces are fused using the Bayesian inference and a new adaptive monitoring statistic is constructed to obtain a more accurate monitoring of the process state. Finally, the ISA-ADS is validated using the Tennessee Eastman (TE) process and the actual polyethylene production process. The results show that ISA-ADS has a low false alarm rate and a high fault detection rate, verifying the effectiveness of its fault detection performance.},

  abstract     = {Battery capacity and safety are closely related to the battery temperature. The battery thermal management (BTM) system consumes considerable energy to maintain the temperature of the battery in the safe range. This energy consumption significantly decreases the driving range of the electric vehicle (EV). This article investigates the optimal control strategy of the BTM system based on model predictive control (MPC) for the connected and automated EV (CAEV), which minimizes energy consumption of the BTM system under the constraint of power and thermal at the same time. The slow thermodynamics of the battery requires a long prediction horizon to achieve optimal temperature and energy consumption of the BTM system. However, long preview information, such as vehicle speed, has large uncertainties, which significantly affects the energy efficiency performance and constraint enforcement robustness. In this study, the effects of the different prediction horizon lengths and the information within the prediction horizon on the MPC performance are first analyzed. Then, the MPC optimization strategy based on adaptive optimization horizon and multitimescale (AOH-MT) is proposed to reduce the temperature constraint violations and computation time. Finally, to improve the robustness under the real driving condition where there are large uncertainties in the speed preview information, a chance-constrained stochastic MPC (C-SMPC) is proposed and the AOH-MT framework is integrated into its prediction horizon to reduce time cost. The simulation results under real-world traffic data show that the proposed approach reduces the constraint violation by 84.88% and the energy cost by 2.44%, which improves robustness against uncertainty in the speed preview information.},

  abstract     = {In real-world applications of multiagent reinforcement learning (MARL), agents often face inaccurate environments due to unavoidable noise, presenting a challenge to their robustness. However, limited prior work focuses on addressing such noise in observations, hindering the deployment of multiagent systems. In this article, we propose a method named learning discrete representation (LDR) to improve robustness against noise in multiagent tasks. Specifically, LDR employs a quantization module with a segment mechanism to encode observations and teammate actions, generating discrete representations from learnable codebooks. These representations are subsequently processed via a combiner for decision-making. Through discretization, LDR is able to mitigate the impact of minor noise on decision-making. To enhance the learning efficiency, we incorporate a set-input block that treats the joint observations of agents as a permutation-invariant set, thereby reducing the complexity of the joint observation space. Additionally, we theoretically analyze the expressiveness of discrete representation and the boundedness of discrete distortion. We evaluate the proposed method on StarCraft II micromanagement tasks and multiagent MuJoCo with noisy observations. Empirical results demonstrate that LDR outperforms existing algorithms, improving robustness in noisy cooperative MARL tasks while maintaining superior performance in clean observations.},

Under the proposed control strategy, all signals in the closed-loop system are proven to be semi-global bounded and the stability for the studied systems under deception attacks is ensured. Conclusively, we conduct simulation experiments using the MATLAB software to verify the effectiveness of the proposed strategy.},

  abstract     = {Differential privacy preserving ensures the privacy of the system data by adding certain regular noises to the data to cover up the real information. The main challenges of strong nonlinearities, uncertainty, and data privacy are considered together for switched systems, and a novel privacy-preserving robust model-free adaptive predictive control (PPR-MFAPC) method is proposed that guarantees both $H_{\infty }$ performance and system privacy. At first, a performance-dependent differential privacy noise conforming the Laplace distribution is designed, which can adaptively adjust the noise size to balance the system performance and privacy. Then, a novel privacy level analysis with evaluation method is presented. Subsequently, the strong uncertainties of switched systems is solved through a dynamic linearization method. On this basis, a novel cost function is designed by considering both the $H_{\infty }$ performance and system privacy to balance the system performance and privacy from the perspective of control design. Further, by incorporating a parameter estimator and a prediction algorithm, the private MFAPC anti-noise controller is obtained. Finally, the feasibility of the PPR-MFAPC is explained with illustrative example.},

Unfortunately, they are difficult to be fused due to their heterogeneity, which struggles to provide a united and reliable solution. To solve this issue, a data-knowledge-driven inductive learning (DKIL) method is introduced to WWTPs. First, a fuzzy-based expression strategy is introduced to describe the operational status of WWTPs. This strategy captures the available data, constraint knowledge and semantic knowledge for the modeling process. Second, a heterogeneous assimilation mechanism is designed to integrate data and knowledge. This mechanism supports their interaction to form a unified scheme through fusion operations. Third, a collaborative optimization algorithm is developed to extract the operational features of WWTPs. This algorithm updates the parameters using both error information and semantic knowledge, which enhances the modeling performance.

  abstract     = {Petri nets (PNs) are graphical and mathematical tools used to model a variety of discrete event systems and analyze their properties. Reachability is their fundamental property that is undecidable for PNs in general and has exponential complexity with respect to net size. One of the possible computation techniques of reachable states (markings) is based on the determination of legal firing sequences (LFSs) that correspond to a non-negative integer solutions (NISs) of a state equation. Our previous work has proposed an algorithm to decide the existence of LFSs corresponding to an NIS in polynomial time. However, it is impossible to check all NISs to decide a marking’s reachability in the case of an infinite number of NISs in a state equation. Hence, this work studies the relationship between the structure of a PN and the number of NISs of its state equation. Furthermore, an innovative method is proposed to modify its structure such that its state equation has no more than one NIS. The relationship between the properties of a PN and its modified one is studied in this article. We conclude that we can modify its structure while maintaining the function of the modeled system such that the reachability of the model can be decided in polynomial time. This can be viewed as a breakthrough result in the area of PN theory and applications. The correctness and time efficiency of the algorithm are verified by case studies and experiments. This work is important in putting PNs into the industrial use.},

  abstract     = {A novel optimization algorithm has been developed for distributed large-scale multiagent systems (LS-MASs), specifically focusing on achieving a terminal density constraint. While the recent advancement in mean field game (MFG) offers a feasible distributed solution to address the “Curse of Dimensionality” problem, it compromises the optimality of large-scale homogeneous agents and lacks the capability to achieve arbitrary fixed terminal probability density function (PDF) constraint, especially when deviating from the normal distribution. To tackle this issue, a novel approach called the imbalanced mean-field game (Imb-MFG) theory has been designed alongside an adaptive PDF decomposition method and distributed reinforcement learning (RL) that can effectively obtain optimal solutions in LS-MAS even with fixed terminal density constraints in a distributed manner. In particular, a method based on the induction theory has been developed for estimating the parameter of the final PDF constraint, enabling the decomposition of MFG-PDF into multiple imbalanced normal distributions. Subsequently, the Imb-MFG theory is developed by integrating the decomposed multigroup MFG agents with a K-means clustering algorithm with constraint. The developed Imb-MFG approach decomposes a single PDF into multiple imbalanced normal distributions, which are combined to achieve arbitrary terminal PDF constraints. To achieve the solution of the Imb-MFG theory, a multiactor-critic-mass (M-ACM) algorithm is developed. This algorithm is developed to concurrently learn the solution for coupled Fokker-Planck–Kolmogorov (FPK) and Hamilton-Jacobi–Bellman equations. The algorithm’s convergence is ensured through the Lyapunov analysis. The effectiveness of this algorithm is validated through a simulation study.},

The Elman network can be viewed as an RNN with a single layer of feedback connections and local storage units. However, the Elman network has two limitations that restrict its application. One is the overfitting phenomenon, which limits its generalization ability. The other is the complexity of the network structure, which makes its theoretical results incomplete and limits its practicality. The main contribution of this article is to propose a new Elman network model with a regularization term. First, we demonstrate the convergence of the backpropagation algorithm with weight decay regularization under some reasonable conditions. Second, contrary to the usual requirement for bounded weights, we show that such boundedness is no longer a necessary condition for convergence analysis. Third, we show that the requirements for learning rate and the stable set of error functions can also be relaxed. Finally, we provide simulation results to demonstrate the excellent performance of our proposed algorithm.},

Then, in the treatment of the LKF derivative, the GFIIs are utilized to estimate the delay related integrals of the quadratic product items. For the LKF differential, it is obtained as the delay function with the $2N-1$ degree. Next, to set up the linear matrix inequality (LMI) forms and solve the nonlinear items injected by the GFIIs, the novel matrix-based negative conditions (NCs) for odd degree polynomials are put forward.

The significant advantage of this control scheme is that it can achieve precise tracking within finite-time, which is not constrained on initial values and control parameters. Furthermore, an adaptive PST compensator and a PST controller with time-varying scaling function are proposed to achieve the output consensus of the HMAS within PST. In contrast to existing compensators, the highlight of the adaptive compensator is not contingent upon the global information of the system topology, and also obviates the necessity for full access to the system matrix of the leader.

  abstract     = {In the field of linguistic decision making, it is widely acknowledged that different individuals may have different understandings of the same linguistic information. Consequently, the modeling of personalized individual semantics (PISs) has emerged as a prominent research avenue within the domain of linguistic decision making. In this article, we study multicriteria decision making problems with incomplete linguistic preference relations (ILPRs), particularly in scenarios where the marginal utility function of each criterion remain elusive. We develop a new approach for modeling PISs of decision makers from the preference disaggregation perspective. The proposed method initiates by representing the marginal utility of each alternative regarding to every criterion, employing piecewise linear functions. It then customizes linguistic preference values within an ILPR by translating them into numerical preference intensities. Subsequently, this article formulates optimization models to check and rectify the inconsistencies between the multicriteria assessment information and the known elements in the ILPR. Furthermore, an optimization model is devised with the objective of minimizing the inconsistency index of the complete linguistic preference relation, thereby enabling the estimation of missing elements of the ILPR and the ranking of alternatives. Consequently, this method also facilitates the derivation of marginal utility functions and PISs for the decision maker. The proposed method is illustrated using a practical scenario involving a car purchase problem, substantiated by a series of simulation experiments and comparative analysis, ultimately providing validation for the proposed approach.},

In contrast to the conventional approach, the developed control signal includes a sampling-time variable that varies over time within each sampling period. Next, the primary Lyapunov term consists of aperiodic sampling in various degrees, hence becoming discontinuous. Furthermore, sufficient reachable set conditions are derived as linear matrix inequalities by making use of Wirtinger’s inequality-based time-dependent discontinuous Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional and two-sided looped functional.

Our prior robotic studies using PV-RNN showed that the nature of interactions between the top-down expectation and bottom-up inference is strongly affected by a parameter, called the meta-prior, which regulates the complexity term in free energy. The current study examines how changing the meta-prior w in the interaction phase affects the counter force generated when an experimenter attempts to induce movement pattern transitions familiar to the robot through its prior training. The study also compares the counter force generated when trained transitions are induced by a human experimenter and when untrained transitions are induced. Finally, the study examines how different levels of disturbances, pattern level, and cognitive level can be resolved internally across different layers. Our experimental results indicated that 1) the human experimenter needs more/less force to induce trained transitions when w is set with larger/smaller values; 2) the human experimenter needs more force to act on the robot when he attempts to induce untrained as opposed to trained movement pattern transitions; and 3) when the robot was disturbed in the cognitive level, the disturbance was resolved more in the higher layer as compared to the case with disturbance in the pattern level. Our analysis of time development of essential variables and values in PV-RNN during bodily interaction clarified the mechanism by which gaps in action intentions between the human experimenter and the robot can be manifested as reaction forces between them.},

  abstract     = {Air pollution poses a significant threat to urban environments, and accurate prediction of multiple air pollutants is crucial for effective mitigation strategies. This study introduces a novel time-aware auto-regressive long-short-term memory (TAR LSTM) approach to address this challenge by developing a multivariate prediction model using artificial intelligence (AI) for SMART city applications. Existing models often fall short of predicting all six major criteria pollutants comprehensively. In response, this work proposes an autoregressive (AR) neural network model based on the long short-term memory (LSTM) architecture, which excels in capturing temporal dependencies within sequential data. The proposed method uses the AR model that captures the linear dependencies in the time series, while the LSTM captures the nonlinear dependencies and long-term patterns. This enables the model to consider past pollutant concentrations and their relationships, resulting in a more accurate and dynamic prediction. Rigorous testing on datasets from low-cost air quality sensors (LAQSs) validates the model’s superior performance. Datasets from diverse locations, including India, Malaysia, and the Philippines, contribute to the robustness of the model, showcasing its efficacy in varied urban environments. This research contributes to advancing predictive modeling for air quality, addressing the limitations of previous approaches, and providing a promising solution for SMART city implementations. The findings highlight the AR LSTM model’s potential as a valuable tool for precise and comprehensive air pollution forecasting, which has implications for informed decision making and better urban environmental management.},

First, a novel stability criterion condition is designed to obtain an initial admissible policy pair by using an offline iterative method under the time-triggered control framework. Then, starting from the stability of the constrained system, a nonperiodic ETC method and a periodic ETC method are developed by adopting an online learning algorithm. In addition, four kinds of neural networks are constructed for the implementation of the event-based online $H_{\infty }$ optimal control strategy. Finally, two experimental examples with physical backgrounds are provided to illustrate the effectiveness and superiority of the developed schemes.},

  abstract     = {The future intelligent transport systems (ITSs) promise to improve traffic safety and security along with reducing the driver workload. In this article, we consider a pre-emptive emergency situation, wherein we design a safe-driving maneuver problem for transportation Metaverse (TransVerse) to compensate for driver reaction delay. The proposed scheme balances the risk of collision, and the spectral and computation resources required by the network. This combination of the spectral and computation resources required is also known as utility of the vehicular network. Further, an emergency maneuver is proposed to suggest a lane-changing maneuver based on the safe lane quality index for vehicles in vicinity of the emergency vehicle, also known as collision risk vehicles (CRVs). Moreover, based on the current position of the vehicles and the proposed safe maneuver, we propose a driving mode advisory to the drivers to provide a speed profile and a real-time high-level driving modes advice on acceleration, cruise, and engine brake. We evaluate the performance of the proposed safe-maneuver planning for CRVs in terms of collision probability, velocity, driving mode, and end-to-end lane changing delay. It can be observed that with the use of the proposed scheme, there is no effect on the performance of the high-CRV (HCRV). However, for the second following vehicle (HCRV2), the probability of collision decreases by 34.78%, and the velocity of the vehicle increases by 61.70% with the use of TransVerse. Moreover, a tradeoff between resource allocation and end-to-end delay of the network is also analyzed with and without TransVerse scenario.},

  abstract     = {Cluster tools have been widely used in the semiconductor industry. In previous work, singe-arm and dual-arm cluster tools are dealt with separately. When considering residency time constraints, algorithms for scheduling robot moving sequences are mainly developed based on backward and swap strategies, respectively. How about the performance of other robot moving sequences is still an open problem. The present work addresses general conditions by considering all feasible robot moving sequences—beyond backward- and swap-based strategies. In addition, both dual-arm and single-arm cluster tools with reentrance are handled simultaneously. To solve this, the problem is first divided into two parts—the basic one without reentrance and reentrant operations. Based on detailed analysis of all available robot operations in a cluster tool, mixed-integer programming formulations are developed for both parts. Subsequently, both illustrative examples and randomly generated instances are tested to validate the efficiency of the proposed approach. Results of one example show improvement comparing to previous work. Another two examples—not scheduled previously—are scheduled well by the proposed approach. Meanwhile, the flexibility of operations obtained by the proposed model is demonstrated by an example with six processing modules and 12 stages in a dual-arm cluster tool. Additionally, more randomly generated instances are tested more to validate the proposed approach and analyze computation time.},

  abstract     = {Multiview clustering (MVC) provides a natural formulation to generate clusters for multiview data, which is fundamental to lots of industrial tasks like autonomous driving, defect detection, and multisensor information fusion, as part of the foundation models. Most existing MVC methods suppose that the data of multiple views are available during the clustering process. However, that is a very strong assumption and is impractical when the views are incremental over time. In addition, if directly applying existing MVC approaches to the clustering setting with incremental views, the massive redundant information in each view might limit the knowledge sharing between historical and newly arrived views. To solve these problems, a continual information bottleneck (CIB) method is presented in this article, which addresses the incremental MVC issue by maximally preserving the consistency of a sequence of views and removing the redundant information in each view. In particular, to facilitate the knowledge transfer from historical views to incoming one, we build a knowledge library to store the representative samples in historical views. When adding a new view, we first construct a view-specific encoder with information-theoretic constraints to learn a compact and discriminative representation, in which redundant information in the new view is eliminated. Then, to capture the consistency information between historical views and the new view, a shared encoder is devised after retrieving the global neighbors in the library for the new view, which is performed by contrasting the cluster assignment and feature representation simultaneously. Finally, a unified objective function is devised to simultaneously optimize the knowledge library and clustering process, in which the knowledge library is updated by maximizing the mutual information between the new view and all historical ones to keep tracking knowledge about the earlier views. Extensive experiment on nine multiview benchmarks has verified the superiority of the CIB method over 19 baselines.},

As a complex and multidisciplinary system involving electrical, mechanical, and chemical processes, efficient prediction of manufactured battery properties and explainable analysis of strongly coupled battery production variables becomes an important but challenging issue for the wider application of batteries. In this article, an interpretable AI solution based on generalized additive model with interactive features and interpretability (GAM-IFI) is proposed to effectively predict battery capacities in the early phase of battery manufacturing and explain the effects of involved coating features. The designed solution is evaluated by using reliable production data from a real battery manufacturing line. Illustrative results show that the proposed solution is able to accurately predict three different types of battery capacities with an $R^{2}$ over 0.98. Moreover, information regarding the importance ratio of both main effect and pairwise interaction terms derived from three coating features is identified, while global and local interpretations of the effects of these terms can be well explained. The developed interpretable solution opens a promising avenue to identify the importance of battery production features and explain how the variation of these features influences the properties of battery products. This can help engineers to better understand the underlying complex behaviors in battery production, which in turn will benefit the digitalization of battery manufacturing.},

  abstract     = {This article investigates the bumpless transfer (BT) $H_{\infty }$ control problem for a class of switched linear systems. The key point is that a novel BT control framework exploiting controllers collaborated with switching signal (SS) design is proposed. This is based on the consideration that for most existing BT control strategies, the design of SS is only used to guarantee the stability of switched systems instead of the BT performance, while the BT performance is achieved by adding additional limitations to the original controllers, which makes it impossible to achieve both stability and BT performance simultaneously. A continuous switching controller with time-varying gain matrices is developed, which achieves continuous transition on the switching instants. A generalized time and state-dependent SS is designed, in which the dwell time provides enough regulation time to pursue a desired BT performance, while, the state-dependent switching relaxes the requirement on each system by allowing each subsystem to be unstable, which helps to realize a satisfactory steady-state performance. Besides, a sufficient condition verifying the solvability for the BT $H_{\infty }$ control problem by the designed controller and SS is constructed. Finally, to demonstrate the availability of the proposed BT $H_{\infty }$ control strategy, two examples are provided.},

Hence, in this article, an effective kinematics method has been proposed based on the morphologic space constraints. It decomposes the resolution of inverse kinematics into two steps: 1) setting the target morphologic space and 2) tracking the morphologic space. In addition, because the proposed kinematics method would calculate the link end positions first but not the joint parameters, this article discards the joint space and obtains the configuration space more directly, by which the method would be more intuitive and efficient. Afterward, a serpentine scanning motion mode, which is efficient, reliable, and of high performance in obstacle avoidance, was studied. Simulation and experiment results show that the kinematics method and serpentine scanning motion mode can meet the requirements of real-time control and obstacle avoidance.},

In order to solve this problem, this article proposes robust BLS (GC-BLS) based on generalized maximum correntropy criterion (GMCC). GMCC has a more general kernel function, which can effectively extract high-dimensional features of the data. In the non-Gaussian noise environment, GC-BLS shows excellent robustness. However, if the kernel width deviates from its optimal value, the performance of the system constructed based on the entropy criterion may fluctuate or even degrade. Since robust regression methods can improve robustness and are independent of kernel width, this motivates us to further construct MGC-BLS based on M-estimator functions. MGC-BLS can effectively suppress the performance degradation caused by kernel width deviation and has better robustness when selecting an appropriate M-estimator function. The two algorithms are optimized by fixed-point iteration, the update strategy in the iterative process is analyzed, and the sufficient conditions for the convergence of the algorithms are given. Compared with other BLS variants, GC-BLS and MGC-BLS can show better performance in the tests. Experiments on University of California Irvine (UCI) regression datasets and time-series datasets show the effectiveness of the two new algorithms.},

Particularly, dynamic ETMs (DETMs) may exhibit this problem, since they are designed to further reduce the number of communication instants. Motivated by this problem, we propose a novel state estimator that integrates discrete transmitted measurements and implicit information between events provided by the proposed DETM. Our proposal guarantees a uniformly bounded mean-squared error in the stochastic context, regardless of transmission instants. Moreover, compared to static ETMs, our proposal adaptively reduces the number of transmissions according to the behavior of the measured signal.

  abstract     = {Accurately solving discrete optimization problems is still a serious challenge for classical computing systems. Despite significant progress, it is still impossible to optimally solve examples of the size found in real-world applications. This article examines the problem of scheduling tasks on one machine. Each task has an associated execution time, desired completion date, and a late penalty feature weight. The order of executing tasks should be determined in a manner that minimizes the sum of delay costs. Despite the simplicity of the formulation, this problem is NP-hard and is representative of optimization challenges encountered in the practice of production control, management, and logistics.In this work, we propose using a quantum computing environment to solve it. The main disadvantage of calculations on quantum computers is their nondeterminism. Therefore, there is no guarantee of optimality of solutions to discrete optimization problems determined on a quantum computer.We propose a novel approach to constructing hybrid algorithms that guarantee the optimality of the solution. The algorithm for solving the task scheduling problem considered here is based on the branch and bound method. Calculations are performed alternately on a classical computer and a quantum computer. The lower and upper bounds of the criterion function are determined on a quantum computer. Computational experiments were performed on the D-Wave quantum computer. In small examples, the algorithm runs faster and generates significantly fewer solution tree vertices than its counterpart running on a classic computer. For larger examples, the proposed runtime-constrained method, acting as a heuristic, is an interesting alternative to using quantum computing hardware in relation to classical approaches based on silicon computers.},

  abstract     = {Large-scale many-objective optimization problems (LSMaOPs) pose great difficulties for traditional evolutionary algorithms due to their slow search for Pareto-optimal solutions in huge decision space and struggle to balance diversity and convergence among numerous locally optimal solutions. An objective space linear inverse mapping method has successfully achieved great saving in execution time in solving LSMaOPs. Linear mapping is a fast and straightforward way, but fails to characterize a complex functional relationship. If we can enhance the expressive capacity of a mapping model, and further obtain a more general function approximator, can the evolutionary search based on objective space mapping be more efficient? To answer this interesting question, this work proposes to employ nonlinear activation functions widely used in neural networks so as to enhance the efficiency of objective space inverse mapping, thus efficiently generating excellent offspring population. A new evolutionary optimization framework based on decision variable analysis is proposed to solve LSMaOPs. In order to demonstrate its performance, this work carries out empirical experiments involving massive decision variables and many objectives. Experimental results prove its superiority over some representative and updated ones.},

  abstract     = {This article proposes a fuzzy optimal fault-tolerant control scheme with prescribed performance for three-dimensional trajectory tracking control of underactuated autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) in complex ocean environments, especially in the presence of unknown actuator faults and dynamic uncertainties. The scheme has the following features. 1) The underactuation problem is overcome by defining new system outputs. 2) An error transformation method that removes restrictions on initial error conditions is adopted to achieve global prescribed performance control. 3) A fuzzy adaptive disturbance observer based on a generalized fuzzy hyperbolic model (GFHM) is proposed to estimate compound disturbances consisting of actuator faults, dynamic uncertainty parts and disturbances. 4) Based on adaptive dynamic programming techniques, a single critic structure fuzzy optimal controller is developed using a GFHM to obtain an approximate optimal control law. In particular, actuator faults, dynamic uncertainties, and disturbances are uniformly handled by structuring an improved cost function and solving optimal control of the nominal system. Through analysis, the proposed scheme can ensure that all signals of the AUV closed-loop system are uniformly ultimately bounded and the original tracking errors can remain within prescribed boundaries. Pure software and hardware-in-the-loop simulations demonstrate the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed scheme.},

To this end, we represent the output of the given controller as a linear combination of a fixed number of previous inputs and outputs. As a result, the encrypted controller involves only a limited number of homomorphic multiplications on every encrypted data, assuming that the output is re-encrypted and transmitted back from the actuator. A guidance for parameter choice is also provided, ensuring that the encrypted controller achieves predefined performance for an infinite time horizon. Furthermore, we propose a customization of the method for ring learning with errors (RLWE)-based cryptosystems, where a vector of messages can be encrypted into a single ciphertext and operated simultaneously, thus reducing computation and communication loads. Unlike previous results, the proposed customization does not require extra algorithms, such as rotation, other than basic addition and multiplication.

Since the direction of system control is unknown, we develop a novel logic switching mechanism. Therefore, an adaptive switching controller is proposed, and the switching parameters in the controller can make timely updates based on the designed switching condition judgment. At the same time, to solve the measurement error caused by actuator failure and event-trigger mechanism, the control protocol is proposed, which ensures that the state of the system eventually converges to the origin and the global asymptotically stability can be achieved.

To enhance the safety of FL system against growing privacy attacks, secret sharing techniques are introduced to realize secure model aggregation. However, the huge extra transmission in vanilla secret sharing aggravates the inherent communication bottleneck of FL system in industrial cellular networks. To reduce transmission overhead, this article proposes a lightweight FL system based on rotated partial secret sharing (FedRPS), which divides industrial terminals into several subgroups and allows them to alternately share partial local secrets. Our FedRPS ensures the global model to converge at a high rate with incomplete local parameters. Moreover, we theoretically analyze the convergence error of FedRPS, and discuss the impact of unbalanced data in subgroups on model convergence. To further improve global model performance under non-IID settings, we design a multiparty greedy grouping (MPGG) strategy to balance the training data in each subgroup. Finally, we conduct experiments on several datasets, which demonstrate our FedRPS trades for significant improvement on communication with only small loss of model accuracy. In addition, we also simulate the privacy attack scenarios to verify the better defense of FedRPS compared with previous complete secret sharing.},

First, the measurement principle based on the refraction model ensures its high accuracy. Second, an underwater 3-D dense mapping algorithm fusing the Doppler velocity log (DVL), inertial measurement unit (IMU), and pressure sensor multifrequency information is proposed to realize dense mapping during robot motion. Then, an air–water two-stage extrinsic calibration algorithm is proposed. In particular, the extrinsic parameters between DVL and camera are innovatively calibrated using BSL, enhancing robustness. Furthermore, for the first time, a framework of BSL-based collision-free navigation is presented to guarantee the safe movement of the system in unknown environments. Experimental results show that our system can simultaneously achieve autonomous collision-free navigation and dense mapping in dark underwater environments, which has great potential for application in marine refined exploration.},

Accurate prediction of the future trajectory of ships is crucial, especially in encounter situations where conventional navigational devices are prone to high uncertainty and risk due to their limitations. Unfortunately, kinematic models and data-driven methods suffer from numerous issues, such as poor performance, intricate architecture, and reduced interpretability. In response, this article introduces a novel approach, driven by automatic identification system (AIS) data, to enhance the efficacy of ship encounter trajectory prediction. It revolves around encounter classification, wherein the invaluable insights of seamanship play a pivotal role in identifying and categorizing legitimate encounters into three distinct types. This categorization forms the foundation for developing a probability-based classification model, in conjunction with a hybrid predictor that amalgamates a kinematics-based model and a neural network-based model. Historical AIS data collected in Oslofjord, Norway, are utilized in this study, and experiments have been conducted to assess the performance of the proposed method through real cases. The results substantiate the promise of the classification model and underscore the exceptional predictive capabilities of the hybrid approach. This superiority is attributed to the synergistic effects arising from the integration of its constituent models.},

The desired yaw angle of each AUV is calculated in real time on the basis of its individual desired trajectory, which can guarantee the attitude configuration for the multi-AUV formation. Meanwhile, the two-layered leader-follower framework is employed to guarantee the flexible maneuvers, in which the AUVs are divided into three layers: 1) first leader AUV; 2) second leader AUV group; and 3) follower AUV group. The desired formation maneuver information only needs to be known by the first leader AUV. For the second AUV group, the formation maneuver information is estimated by the designed distributed estimators to acquire their desired reference trajectories. The follower AUV group only needs to track their desired trajectories affinely localized by the leader AUVs. Furthermore, the adaptive fast nonsingular integral terminal sliding-mode controllers are designed for the leader layers and follower layer to guarantee the fast and accurate tracking of their desired trajectories, such that the multi-AUV formation system is able to realize the precise maneuvers.

Next, an auxiliary system is constructed to modify performance bounds of ATPP for tolerating possible collision avoidance actions of ASVs. In the guidance loop, nominal surge and yaw guidance laws are developed using the ATPP-based transformed relative distance and heading errors. A barrier-certified yaw velocity protocol is proposed by formulating a quadratic optimization problem, which unifies the nominal yaw guidance law and CBF-based collision-free constraints. In the control loop, two prescribed-time disturbance observers (PTDOs) are devised to estimate unknown external disturbances in the surge and yaw directions. The antidisturbance control laws are designed to track the guidance signals.

  abstract     = {Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) are widely used in sampling on-site the seawater parameters, such as temperature, salinity and biomass for better understanding the ocean. The AUV path needs to be carefully planned in order to maximize the sampled information within the power constraints, which is known as the informative path planning (IPP). The existence of ocean currents further complicates the problem. This article proposes an IPP method for AUVs under the influence of ocean currents via combining the probabilistic roadmap and $Q$ -learning. Specifically, the $Q$ -learning algorithm builds an informative optimal AUV path by traversing a learned and updated $Q$ -table. The $Q$ -value in the table represents the expectation of the obtained reward if taking a certain action moving from one position to another. Considering the characteristics of the IPP task, we design the reward matrix in $Q$ -learning using the prior knowledge on the environment information. A convergent $Q$ -table guarantees that only one complete training and learning is required to generate the path between any two positions. This feature facilitates converting the possible repetitive path plannings into simple search problems, and thus the automatic return is easily realized whenever the AUV residual energy is insufficient. Moreover, to improve the efficiency of the $Q$ -learning algorithm, a probabilistic roadmap with random sampling is generated and combined with the $Q$ -learning. Various simulations and comparisons are carried out. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed IPP algorithm, showing that the convergence of the path planning can be achieved quickly and successfully. The superiority in terms of efficient return path planning over the traditional path planning method, RRT*, is also demonstrated.},

  abstract     = {This article addresses the challenge of enhancing collaboration efficiency within a heterogeneous system of multiple unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) while accounting for the impact of ocean currents. In this context, this article introduces an intelligent algorithm called the hexagonal grid-based neural network with parallelogram law (HGNNPL). The algorithm comprises three key components: 1) a bio-inspired neural network (BINN) designed to predict an optimal collision-free path for a multi-USV system, which operates based on hexagonal partitioning grids, ensuring smooth navigation without collisions; 2) an adjustment component plays a crucial role in correcting deviations caused by ocean currents and calculating the associated energy consumption; and 3) an optimal task assignment component responsible for assigning task objectives to the USVs, where distance determined by the BINN and the energy consumption are involved as motion planning costs. This article presents simulation results that compare the performance of the proposed algorithm with an existing algorithm based on square grids, which does not account for the elimination of ocean current effects. These results illustrate the practical effectiveness of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {Sea state information is significant for the guide of maritime activities of autonomous vessels. The sea state estimation (SSE) model, powered by artificial intelligence (AI), has shown great effectiveness but is susceptible to malicious data attacks. These attacks can lead to significant declines in the system’s performance and result in incorrect predictions about the sea state. This study introduces SecureSSE, a strategy for protecting SSE models in autonomous marine vessels from adversarial attacks. This approach incorporates three main components: 1) the multiscale feature extraction learning (MFEL) module; 2) the feature convolution aggregation learning (FCAL) module; and 3) the perturbation examples training (PET) module. The PET module is specifically crafted to create perturbation examples that are in line with unaltered data, leveraging the capabilities of both the MFEL and FCAL modules to efficiently extract and integrate detailed features from ship motion data. Our proposed SecureSSE approach is shown to significantly improve the resilience of deep learning models against potential attacks. Through experimental testing, we have validated the effectiveness of this method in enhancing SSE. Additional ablation studies highlight the critical role of each module within the SecureSSE framework. To our knowledge, this is the first study to address adversarial attacks in this context and to propose a comprehensive defense mechanism for SSE systems in autonomous marine vessels.},

  abstract     = {In this work, pursuit-evasion (PE) games with marine surface vessels (MSVs) as pursuers are solved while considering velocity constraints and unknown dynamics simultaneously. Differentiable performance index functions are designed for PE games based on minimum and maximum approximation functions. Then, we can obtain the desired pursuit velocities for MSVs satisfying velocity constraints and evasion strategies by applying game theory. Neural networks (NNs) are established to approximate unknown dynamics, which is suitable to design NN-based control to ensure that all velocities of MSVs converge to their desired ones. Through rigorous Lyapunov analyses, it can be guaranteed that all convergence and weight errors are uniformly ultimately bounded. Simulation results and comparison with known dynamics are provided and analyzed, which show that the proposed NN-based PE game is effective for MSVs with velocity constraints and unknown dynamics.},
