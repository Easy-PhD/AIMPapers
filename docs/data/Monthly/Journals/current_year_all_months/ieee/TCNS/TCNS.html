  abstract     = {This article concerns the distributed observer for the descriptor linear system. Unlike centralized descriptor system observers, in the case of distributed observers, each agent either finds it difficult to independently eliminate impulses, or the observer dynamics after eliminating pulses cannot be implemented. To overcome this issue, this article develops the structure of the distributed observer in two different scenarios, and the observer parameters are presented through a novel design. Moreover, we provide two implementation methods for distributed observer in different scenarios. As a result, each local observer has the ability to reconstruct the states of the underlying system, including its impulse phenomenon. Finally, simulation results verify the validity of our results.},

To achieve Nash equilibrium (NE) in a user-defined prescribed time, a time-varying high-gain function is incorporated into the design. The core challenge lies in applying IC to NE seeking, which complicates the convergence analysis and control design. To address this sticking point, we construct an auxiliary function and propose a Lyapunov function considering second-order dynamics to solve the PTNE seeking problem of PEG. Building upon the results for undirected graphs, we further extend our findings to directed graphs, demonstrating that the proposed method can reach the NE of PEG under IC in the prescribed time. Moreover, we generalize the approach to noncooperative games, indicating that the prescribed-time IC framework can effectively solve the PTNE seeking problem in such competitive scenarios. The numerical simulations validate the practicality of the proposed method.},

A distributed position controller is first developed for each follower quadrotor to ensure the formation tracking to the leader, where cascade estimators consisting of a filter-based dynamics estimator and a fixed-time estimator are exploited to completely counteract the actuator fault and external disturbance. Then, based on the cascade estimators development, by introducing a nonlinear transformation, a robust attitude constrained controller is proposed to guarantee the command attitude tracking singularity free. Stability analysis demonstrates that the closed-loop systems are asymptotically stable. Experiment results further verify and assess the proposed control strategy.},

Traditional approaches involve developing detectors to identify cyber-attacks or implementing passive defense strategies, such as encrypting communication channels and using firewalls. Differently, in this article, we address the challenge of securing CPS against unauthorized observers, which aims to estimate the system states by eavesdropping on system input and output. An active defense strategy, called misleading unauthorized observer, that modifies input–output signals in order to mislead the unauthorized observer, is introduced. These modifications are additional signals undetectable by innovation-based or residual-based detectors and designed with the aim of arbitrarily increasing the estimation error at the unauthorized observer side. For this purpose, system properties required for guaranteeing the existence of such a defense strategy are stated. Then, the design of these additional signals is formulated as an optimization problem with undetectability constraints. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is validated through simulations of a moving body in the XY plane, demonstrating how the active defending system successfully misleads the unauthorized observer.},

The error in attitude estimation converges asymptotically to a common orientation among multiple rigid body systems, based on relative attitude measurements under undirected graphs. To eliminate the reliance on direct angular velocity measurements, a cascaded estimation scheme is proposed, employing indirect angular velocity estimation through a single vector measurement that is readily accessible using accelerometers or magnetometers. An event-triggered condition, grounded in clock variables, is proposed to reduce the communication and computation requirements associated with the attitude estimation. Subsequently, a rigorous convergence analysis of the attitude estimation errors is conducted, relying upon a stability criterion of invariant sets for cascade-connected systems. Furthermore, a self-triggered condition is developed to overcome the challenge of continuous monitoring throughout the event detection process. Ultimately, the efficacy of the proposed framework is validated through a numerical simulation encompassing multiple small satellites.},

Our approach leverages the notion of privacy to add noise to the agents' states, ensuring that individual contributions are masked while still enabling the detection of malicious behavior. We present a detailed analysis of the privacy–accuracy tradeoff and demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through simulations. The results show that our reputation-based consensus method with privacy guarantees offers robustness against attacks while preserving the privacy of participants, making it a promising solution for privacy-conscious resilient distributed systems.},

That is, a channel for which its use is switched between the multiple output feedback control loops. We then extend the study to the case of a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) constrained transmission of the actuation signal through an AWN multiple access channel (MAC). For both channel approaches, we consider first the regulation problem (with setpoint set to zero) and then include in the analysis the potential effect of a nonzero setpoint signal on the resulting SNR constraints. We conclude that, in terms of the minimal required SNR, the AWN MAC channel option is, in general, preferable over the switched AWN channel option if linear co-design of the encoder and decoder is available.},

We consider that the communications are affected by time-varying delays and the vehicles lack velocity measurements. The desired control objective is that all the vehicles converge to a given desired formation and that they reach a consensus on the localization of the center of such formation and on their orientations. The control architecture exploits several features. From a control viewpoint, the systems’ dynamics are split into their angular-motion and linear-motion parts, so each of these is driven by a separate distributed dynamic output-feedback controller, passively interconnected to the plant via a virtual spring. From a network-topology viewpoint, the overall networked system contains two layers of interconnections with undirected graphs. Finally, from an analytical viewpoint, each vehicle-controller closed-loop system may be regarded as a cascade with a $\boldsymbol{\delta }$-persistently exciting interconnection, which ensures the achievement of the control goal, in spite of the nonholonomic constraints.},

  abstract     = {Statistical diversity is a property of data distribution and can hinder the optimization of a decentralized network. However, the theoretical limitations of the Push-SUM protocol reduce the performance in handling the statistical diversity of optimization algorithms based on it. In this article, we theoretically and empirically reduce the negative impact of statistical diversity on decentralized optimization using the Push-SUM protocol. Specifically, we propose the adaptive weighting Push-SUM protocol, a theoretical generalization of the original Push-SUM protocol, where the latter is a special case of the former. Our theoretical analysis shows that, with sufficient communication, the upper bound on the consensus distance for the new protocol reduces to $O(1/N)$, whereas it remains at $O(1)$ for the Push-SUM protocol. We adopt stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and momentum SGD on the new protocol and prove that the convergence rate of these two algorithms to statistical diversity is $O(N/T)$ on the new protocol, while it is $O(Nd/T)$ on the Push-SUM protocol, where $d$ is the parameter size of the training model. To address statistical diversity in practical applications of the new protocol, we develop the Moreau weighting method for its generalized weight matrix definition. This method, derived from the Moreau envelope, is an approximate optimization of the distance penalty of the Moreau envelope. We verify that the adaptive weighting Push-SUM protocol is practically more efficient than the Push-SUM protocol via deep learning experiments.},

The proposed algorithm includes three crucial points, i.e., proximal-point regularizer, primal-dual method, and inertial update rule. For the first point, we use a proximal quadratic-form term to regularize the Lagrangian function to maintain the strong-convex property for the primal and dual subproblems. Then, a primal-dual method is adopted to update the predicted solutions of primal and dual subproblems, which are subsequently corrected by an inertial update rule. An alternating iterative procedure is carried out between the primal-dual method and the inertial update rule to find the optimal solution. We present the convergence analysis based on the strongly convex characteristic of the proximal operator and the saddle-point theorem and prove that our algorithm has the worst case $\mathcal {O}({1}/{k})$ convergence rate for the general nonsmooth convex optimization problems. Furthermore, we present an algorithmic extension of PCPM to solve the separable convex optimization problems.

  abstract     = {In this article, to effectively implement the environmental monitoring mission around the perimeter of a rocky area, a prescribed performance control (PPC) scheme is proposed for an underactuted surface vehicle–underactuted aerial vehicle system using the robust bounded compensating technique (RBCT). First, a grid cell guidance law is introduced for rocky area scanning, considering the heterogeneous system's differing maneuverability. The grid cell undergoes a comprehensive calculation process to ensure that it meets operational requirements. Subsequently, a prescribed performance control scheme based on the RBCT is proposed to reduce design and computational complexity. A novel prescribed performance function is developed to regulate transient performance and initial errors. The RBCT is employed not only to eliminate system uncertainties but also to resolve the “calculation explosion” problem, thereby simplifying the control design. The system's global stability is proved via Lyapunov theory. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the PPC-RBCT scheme.},

  abstract     = {In most practical dynamic leader-following scenarios, the control input or dynamical model of the neighboring agents is not known to the followers. In such scenarios, asymptotic leader-following requires employing discontinuous robust mechanisms to cope with unknown parts of the neighbors' trajectories, leading to chattering in the followers' inputs. Few studies have already addressed asymptotic leader-following with continuous control inputs; however, they require the communication topology to be undirected, which is a restrictive assumption in leader-following. In this article, asymptotic dynamic leader-following in Euler–Lagrangian multiagent systems is addressed. We assume that the leader's control input is determined by the leader locally and is unknown to the followers. The contribution of this article is that whereas the unknown input and model of the neighboring agents are compensated by a robust mechanism in the followers' control strategy, the continuity in the followers' control inputs is guaranteed, and the interaction in the network is under directed topologies. Simulation results for a network of manipulator robots illustrate the performance of the proposed control strategy.},

For this problem, a data-driven load frequency control method is proposed via improved model free adaptive control. First, because of the nonlinearity and uncertainty of multimicrogrid interconnected systems, the relevant model information cannot be fully obtained. To realize the design of the algorithm under the assumption that the model information is unknown, the equivalent functional relationship between the control signal and the area-control-error signal is established by using a dynamic linearization technique. Then, a data-driven control algorithm with time delays is developed, in which a tracking differentiator is designed to obtain the derivative value of the system output signal for the improved model free adaptive structure. On this basis, to reduce the computation and communication burden of the multimicrogrid system, an event-triggered mechanism is proposed. The stability of the system is analyzed by using the Lyapunov stability theory. Finally, simulation results in a three-area multimicrogrid interconnected system verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.},

Existing distributed online algorithms solving this problem require that each agent broadcasts its decision to its neighbors at each iteration. However, communication resources are often limited. To better utilize communication resources, we propose a distributed event-triggered online primal–dual algorithm with two-point bandit feedback. Under several classes of appropriately chosen decreasing parameter sequences and nonincreasing event-triggered threshold sequences, we establish dynamic network regret and network cumulative constraint violation bounds. These bounds are comparable to the results achieved by distributed event-triggered online algorithms with full-information feedback.

In networked control systems, the controller generates control inputs based on sampled data to ensure the safety and stability of the plant. However, the combined effects of quantization and time-varying delay introduced by digital communication networks have rarely been considered in safety-critical control. This article develops sufficient conditions for the design of safety and stabilizing control laws and provides explicit safety and input-to-state stability thresholds for networked control systems. In addition, we present provable extensions that can cope with the network-induced challenges mentioned above. In the context of periodic event-triggered mechanism, we formulate optimal control problems with constraints in the form of high-order control barrier functions and control Lyapunov functions. Finally, we apply the proposed strategy to adaptive cruise control, and illustrate that the event-based control approach effectively reduces communication traffic while achieving the control objectives.},

  abstract     = {To estimate accurate voltage phasors from inaccurate voltage magnitude and complex power measurements, the standard approach is to iteratively refine a good initial guess using the Gauss–Newton method. However, the nonconvexity of the estimation makes the Gauss–Newton method sensitive to its initial guess, so human intervention is needed to detect convergence to plausible but ultimately spurious estimates. This article makes a novel connection between the angle estimation subproblem and phase synchronization to yield two key benefits: first, an exceptionally high-quality initial guess over the angles, known as a spectral initialization, and second, a correctness guarantee for the estimated angles, known as a global optimality certificate. These are formulated as sparse eigenvalue–eigenvector problems, which we efficiently compute in time comparable to a few Gauss–Newton iterations. Our experiments on the complete set of Polish, PEGASE, and RTE models show, where voltage magnitudes are already reasonably accurate, that spectral initialization provides an almost-perfect single-shot estimation of $n$ angles from $2n$ moderately noisy bus power measurements (i.e., $n$ pairs of PQ measurements), whose correctness becomes guaranteed after a single Gauss–Newton iteration. For less-accurate voltage magnitudes, the performance of the method degrades gracefully; even with moderate voltage magnitude errors, the estimated voltage angles remain surprisingly accurate.},

In addition, this study considers the energy consumption of an HVAC system that is governed by the regulated indoor temperatures within its zones and addresses the dynamics of the temperatures, presenting a noncooperative Nash game involving players with dynamic models in the context of a multizone HVAC systems connected by a strongly connected communication network. The dynamics of the indoor temperature in each zone is affected by the outside environment, the external thermal disturbance, and the temperatures in its neighboring zones. The disturbances we consider are general bounded disturbances with unknown bounds. Furthermore, we also consider temperature constraints in individual zones to accommodate the requirements of the HVAC users. Consequently, the distributed estimator approach, the adaptive control method, and the projected gradient-based technique are integrated to address all these considerations.

Thus, based on the susceptible–infected–susceptible compartmental model, this study proposes a susceptible–infected–exhausted–susceptible model that includes an enhanced transition pathway of the malware state. Subsequently, considering the potential heterogeneity of network topology and pulse wave attacks (PA), three additional models are expanded upon. Concurrently, the dynamic stability analyses of these four models have been conducted to verify the practicality of effective control by malicious attackers (MA) and network defenders (ND) within these frameworks to achieve their respective benefits. Finally, based on the framework of optimal control and game theory, we discuss and simulate attack–defense confrontation under various scenarios, including different objective functions, network topologies, control forms, and parameter combinations. Experimental results demonstrate that in most cases, MA refrained from launching malicious attacks but continued malware propagation. Under certain conditions, malware may remain in a dormant state indefinitely. Meanwhile, ND consistently engages in network repair regardless of MA's actions. MA's revenue peaks when launching continuous-time attacks in the financial network, while ND's revenue is at its lowest. In the majority of instances, under PA and higher operation costs, MA's efficacy is lower, while ND performs better.},

It has been exploited for adaptive output feedback control of uncertain nonlinear systems in the literature; however, the controller must partially reside at the plant side where computation capacity is required. In this article, all controller components are moved to the controller side, and their dynamics use sampled states rather than continuous ones with the benefit of directly estimating the next triggering instance of some conditions and avoiding constantly checking the event condition at the controller side. However, these bring two major challenges. First, the virtual input designed in the dynamic filtering technique for stabilization is no longer differentiable. Second, the plant output is sampled to transmit at the plant side and sampled again at the controller side to construct the controller, and the two asynchronous samplings make the analysis more involved. This article solves these two issues by introducing a new state observer to simplify the adaptive law, a set of continuous companion variables for stability analysis, and a new lemma quantifying the error bound between the actual output signal and the sampled transmitted output. It is theoretically guaranteed that all internal signals in the closed-loop system are semiglobally bounded and the output is practically stabilized to the origin.

The challenge is to address secure formation tracking and communication bandwidth-saving issues simultaneously. To tackle this, we propose a switching-like event-triggered mechanism that reduces excessive bandwidth consumption during interactions among multiple followers under DoS attacks. The triggering condition is allowed to be switched during the intervals when attacks are activated, ensuring that triggering can normally occur throughout the overall time interval by introducing an auxiliary variable depending on the success of the latest trigger moment. Based on this approach, we construct an event-based time-varying formation control scheme. In addition, we establish sufficient conditions that reveal the relationship between exponential stability and the frequency/duration of the DoS attacks. Unlike other single-leader methods, a significant feature of the formation control scheme is its ability to achieve the desired formation tracking for multiagent systems with multiple leaders. Finally, the validity of the proposed method is demonstrated through simulation and experimental results.},

To address this, we explore two spatial out-of-order scenarios, focusing on enhancing state estimation precision. For the random out-of-order scenario, characterized by unpredictable sensor data sequences, we propose an accumulative measurement approach and introduce two algorithms to restore data order, thereby improving state estimation accuracy. In the fixed out-of-order scenario, where a consistent but unknown pattern exists, our two algorithms efficiently restore measurement order within a limited time frame.

  abstract     = {This article formulates a predefined-time multiagent approach to distributed nonconvex constrained optimization and tackles the challenges caused by the nonconvexity and nonlinearly coupled information. The divergence caused by nonconvexity is handled by utilizing a momentum-based system, and the distributed computation of nonlinearly coupled optimization information, as well as the distributed comparison of global function values, is dealt with by introducing estimation state variables. Then, combined with time-base generators, the proposed multiagent system is proven to be stable at a local optimal solution within a predefined time. The simulations of a chiller system and a numerical example are elaborated to verify and demonstrate the enhanced stability, predefined-time convergence, and distributed computation capability of the proposed multiagent approach.},

Drawing on gradient tracking technique and projection method, a fixed-step distributed optimization algorithm is proposed to solve the multirobot formation problem.

We first formulate the scheduling problem as a mixed-integer convex program (MICP), then propose an efficient polynomial time relaxation–adjustment–rounding algorithm for solving the problem. The key novelty of the proposed method lies in its adjustment step, which uses a graph-based algorithm to navigate within the set of optimal points of the convex relaxation while reducing the number of fractional entries in the solution. We establish mathematically that our algorithm yields solutions that are near optimal for a finite number of loads and with its suboptimality independent of the number of loads. Consequently, the proposed method is asymptotically optimal in a per-load cost sense when the number of loads increases. Despite the gap between the MICP and its convex relaxation, we establish that the solution of the proposed algorithm can be decentralized by marginal prices of the convex relaxation. We also develop and analyze variants of the proposed algorithm for settings with uncertainty and with time-varying realistic load shapes. Finally, we numerically evaluate the proposed algorithm in a case study for the nonpreemptive scheduling of electric vehicles charging loads.},

  abstract     = {This article proposes a distributed safety-critical optimal flocking control algorithm for the multiagent system. In general, safety (i.e., collision avoidance) could be guaranteed by the use of a control barrier function (CBF) as constraints in the optimal control problem. However, the existence of conflicting safety constraints from multiple agents could lead to a feasibility problem (i.e., the absence of a feasible control command) in distributed optimal flocking control algorithms. To deal with this issue, we propose two effective feasibility enhancement approaches. First, we develop a high-order CBF associated with the collision risk to alleviate the burden of distributed safety constraints on agents with a high risk of collision. Second, to enhance feasibility, a relaxation method is used to enlarge the allowable control space of agents. In particular, to decrease the number of optimization variables in the relaxation method, a selective strategy is adopted. This involves applying the relaxation method only to specific CBF based on the decision variable related to the overlap of admissible control spaces among agents. Numerical simulations demonstrate the superiority and validity of the proposed optimal flocking algorithm compared with existing approaches.},

The leaders perform trajectory scaling in order to cope with the velocity limits of the single robots. Once the trajectories for the centroid and the formation are estimated, each agent can compute its own reference trajectory and a local control loop is designed to track it. An approach to mapping the velocity constraints of each agent to the velocity limits at the task level is developed. Then, a trajectory-scaling algorithm is adopted to ensure velocity constraint fulfillment. The stability and performance properties are rigorously analyzed under two different assumptions about the planned trajectories. Finally, both simulation and experiments are run on the Robotarium platform to show the effectiveness of the approach and the effect of parameter tuning on the achieved performance.},

To tackle such a problem, the model-based distributed control scheme is developed via distributed continuous observer design. Subsequently, the data-driven distributed control scheme is proposed, which comprises a compensation term, an optimal feedback term, and a feedforward term. Specifically, a new kind of distributed adaptive continuous observers is first constructed based on the adaptive control theory to estimate the leader's state, output, and plant matrices, the off-policy learning method is then employed to seek the optimal control gain and identify the unknown system dynamics, thereby facilitating the construction of the control protocols.

First, in communication-based networks, AUVs are allowed to transmit information via communication devices. A dynamic control law consisting of a distributed estimator is proposed. By analyzing with the perturbed system method, the multivehicle system achieves global exponential stability instead of asymptotic stability. Second, in communication-denied networks, AUVs depend only on the relative measurements from the onboard sensors. A dynamic control law consisting of a decentralized estimator is proposed.

In the proposed network model, node dynamics are nonlinear and defined by a tractable realization of the mixed-feedback structure. Coupling between nodes is also nonlinear and defined by a tractable abstraction of synaptic coupling between neurons. We derive constructive conditions under which the spectral properties of the network adjacency matrix fully and explicitly determine both the emergence of a stable network rhythm and its detailed rhythmic profile, i.e., the pattern of relative oscillation amplitudes and phase differences. Our theoretical developments are grounded on ideas from dominant systems and bifurcation theory. They provide a new framework for the analysis and design of nonlinear network rhythms.},

If the hypergraph's hyperedges further connect the same number of vertices, it is said to be uniform. In algebraic graph theory, a graph can be characterized by an adjacency matrix, and similarly, a uniform hypergraph can be characterized by an adjacency tensor. This similarity enables us to extend existing tools of matrix analysis for studying dynamical systems evolving on graphs to the study of a class of polynomial dynamical systems evolving on hypergraphs utilizing the properties of tensors. To be more precise, in this article, we first extend the concept of a Metzler matrix to a Metzler tensor and then describe some useful properties of such tensors. Next, we focus on positive systems on hypergraphs associated with Metzler tensors. More importantly, we design control laws to stabilize the origin of this class of Metzler positive systems on hypergraphs. In the end, we apply our findings to two classic dynamical systems: a higher order Lotka–Volterra population dynamics system and a higher order SIS epidemic dynamic process. The corresponding novel stability results are accompanied by ample numerical examples.},

For the heterogeneous agents involving nonlinear underactuated coupled dynamics and limited communication capabilities, a unified event-triggered data-driven control method is proposed, including a distributed event-triggered observer for interaction data recovery under DoS attacks and robust controllers to achieve distributed formation. The control policies and disturbances, including couplings and external disturbances, are modeled as performance optimizers and adversarial players in the zero-sum game. Robust optimal policies are obtained by developing off-policy reinforcement learning without information on system dynamical parameters. Sufficient conditions are derived to guarantee the stability of the closed-loop system under DoS attacks, and Zeno behavior for all agents can be excluded. The effectiveness of the proposed controllers is validated by presenting two simulation examples of a distributed heterogeneous formation.},

  abstract     = {Exploiting the underlying structure of optimization programs has unlocked computational gains and, in some cases, enabled distributed solution methods. One should expect that this structure can be similarly exploited for other important tasks, such as differentiation. Differentiating through optimization programs has in fact attracted much interest and led to numerous applications, from optimization-based layers in machine learning models to complex design problems formulated as bilevel programs. However, existing differentiation methodologies rarely leverage problem structure. In this work, we propose an efficient framework for computing gradients of constraint-coupled optimization problems. Gradients are decomposed into local components—computed in a distributed manner—and a coupling term—handled by a central coordinator. This centralized framework achieves significant computational gains, especially for large systems, and we provide sufficient conditions to ensure its validity. Building on this, we develop a decentralized algorithm—eliminating the need for a central coordinator—by leveraging the exponential decay of sensitivities in graph-structured problems. Finally, we demonstrate how the decentralized scheme allows for accurate and efficient estimation of important emissions metrics on large dynamic power system models.},

An event-triggered distributed two-stage fusion estimation method is proposed for the clustered sensor network. Specifically, a local fusion estimator is first constructed to fuse multirate measurements transmitted through small-scale fading channels. The parameters of the estimator are computed by solving linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). Then, the event-triggered mechanism (ETM) is utilized to adjust the transmission frequency of local estimates, aiming to conserve the energy of cluster heads. Furthermore, by solving a min–max optimization problem, a global fusion estimator is designed to fuse the local estimates in the presence of the ETM and large-scale fading channels. Sufficient conditions for the stochastic ultimate boundedness of both local and global estimation errors are derived by leveraging differential game theory and LMIs. The comparison simulation results on a dc-power network show the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed method.},

This article proposes a distributed identification algorithm for local subsystems to identify their parameter matrices under local observation with a guarantee of convergence. We obtain the necessary and sufficient conditions for the convergence of local identification. We prove that by injecting an independent random signal to the local subsystem, which is easy to implement, using a simple least-squares method to identify local systems can achieve convergent identification for a certain probability. Meanwhile, we give the minimal level of variance of the injected signal that can still guarantee the convergence of the identification. Next, we add the designed input as a vector of Gaussian noises with decreasing variance to a known controller, proving that it can converge to the original controller. Simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.},

Our method employs a distributed projected gradient play approach alongside consensus dynamics, with individual agents minimizing their local costs through gradient steps and local information exchange with neighbors via a time-varying directed communication network. Addressing time-varying directed graphs presents significant challenges. Existing methods often circumvent this by focusing on static graphs or specific types of directed graphs or by requiring the stepsizes to scale with the Perron–Frobenius eigenvectors. In contrast, we establish novel results that provide a contraction property for the mixing terms associated with time-varying row-stochastic weight matrices. Our approach explicitly expresses the contraction coefficient based on the characteristics of the weight matrices and graph connectivity structures, rather than implicitly through the second-largest singular value of the weight matrix as in prior studies. The established results facilitate proving geometric convergence of the proposed algorithm and advance convergence analysis for distributed algorithms in time-varying directed communication networks. Numerical results on a Nash–Cournot game demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method.},

For a NET-SCS, the propagation of nonlinear statistics of the network communication status brought up by deterministic thresholds makes the precise computation of ACR difficult. Previous work used to oversimplify the computation using a Gaussian distribution without incorporating this nonlinearity, leading to sacrificed precision. This article proposes a novel approach to calculate the exact ACR for a NET-SCS using a recursive model. We use theoretical analysis and a numerical study to qualitatively evaluate the deviation gap of the conventional approach that ignores the side information. The accuracy of our proposed method, alongside its comparison with the simplified results of the conventional approach, is validated by experimental studies.

  abstract     = {This work studies efficient centralized solution methods for cluster-based control policies of transition-independent Markov decision processes (TI-MDPs). We focus on control of multiagent systems, whereby a central planner influences agents to select desirable group behavior. The agents are partitioned into disjoint clusters whereby agents in the same cluster receive the same controls but agents in different clusters may receive different controls. Under mild assumptions, this process can be modeled as a TI-Markov decision process (MDP) where each factor describes the behavior of one cluster. The action space of the TI-MDP becomes exponential with respect to the number of clusters. To efficiently find a policy in this rapidly scaling space, we propose a clustered Bellman operator that optimizes over the action space for one cluster at any evaluation. We present clustered value iteration (CVI), which uses this operator to iteratively perform “round robin” optimization across the clusters. CVI converges exponentially faster than standard value iteration (VI), and can find policies that closely approximate the MDP’s true optimal value. A special class of TI-MDPs with separable reward functions is investigated, and it is shown that CVI will find optimal policies for this class of problems. Finally, the optimal clustering assignment problem is explored. The value functions TI-MDPs with submodular reward functions are shown to be submodular functions, so submodular set optimization may be used to find a near-optimal clustering assignment. We propose an iterative greedy cluster splitting algorithm, which yields monotonic submodular improvement in value at each iteration. Finally, simulations offer an empirical assessment of the proposed methods.},

  abstract     = {This article investigates impulsive security protocols with the goal of achieving consensus of fractional-order fuzzy multiagent systems (FOFMASs). In contrast to multiagent systems characterized by ordinary differential equations, FOFMASs are created using Takagi–Sugeno fuzzy rules and fractional-order differential equations, which allow for nonlinearities with parameter uncertainties and also manage memory effects. Due to the potential of denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, the topology among nodes may change, and it is necessary to gain insight into the security consensus under topology switching. This article tackles the security protocol problem by designing a distributed impulsive control for each agent, relying on global delayed communications and topology switching resulting from DoS attacks. Analyzing the stability of impulse-free error systems is a salient problem. Supported by the Lyapunov method and average impulsive interval method, for two cases of self-stabilization or instability of the error system in the absence of impulse, some sufficient conditions are presented to ensure the exponential consensus of FOFMASs under distributed impulsive control with communication delays. Besides, several corollaries are provided to guarantee the consensus under distributed impulsive control without communication delays. Finally, two numerical examples are provided, and some numerical simulations are given to confirm the efficacy of the theoretical findings.},

We propose a quantized distributed NE seeking strategy based on the approach of dynamic quantized consensus. To solve the quantizer saturation problem caused by DoS attacks, the quantization mechanism is equipped to have zooming-in and holding capabilities, in which the holding capability is consistent with the results in quantized consensus under DoS. A sufficient condition on the number of quantizer levels is provided, under which the quantizers are free from saturation under DoS attacks. The proposed distributed quantized NE seeking strategy is shown to have the so-called maximum resilience to DoS attacks. Namely, if the bound characterizing the maximum resilience is violated, an attacker can deny all the transmissions, and hence, distributed NE seeking is impossible.},

Our key contribution is deriving the distributed evidence lower bound (DELBO) from the centralized estimation objective, whose separable structure enables distributed inference with one-hop sensor communication. The DELBO consists of observation likelihood and divergences to prior estimates, and the gap in the measurement evidence is ascribed to consensus and modeling errors. For supervised learning, we design a DELBO-maximizing online distributed algorithm and specialize it to Gaussian variational densities with nonlinear likelihoods. We extend the resulting distributed Gaussian variational inference updates via diagonalized and 1-rank covariance inversions for high-dimensional estimates and apply it to multirobot probabilistic mapping using indoor LiDAR data.},

  abstract     = {In transmission networks, power flows and network topology are deeply intertwined due to power flow physics. Recent literature shows that a specific more hierarchical network structure can effectively inhibit the propagation of line failures across the entire system. In particular, a novel approach named tree partitioning has been proposed, which seeks to bolster the robustness of power networks through strategic alterations in network topology, accomplished via targeted line-switching actions. Several tree-partitioning problem formulations have been proposed by considering different objectives, among which power flow disruption and network congestion. Furthermore, various heuristic methods based on a two-stage and recursive approach have been proposed. The present work provides a general framework for tree-partitioning problems based on mixed-integer linear programming (MILP). In particular, we present a novel MILP formulation to optimally solve tree-partitioning problems and also propose a two-stage heuristic based on MILP. We perform extensive numerical experiments to solve two tree-partitioning problem variants, demonstrating the excellent performance of our solution methods. Lastly, through exhaustive cascading failure simulations, we compare the effectiveness of various tree-partitioning strategies and show that, on average, they can achieve a substantial reduction in lost load compared to the original topologies.},

  abstract     = {Assuming agents possess sensing capabilities and dynamics relative to their body coordinate frames, this article addresses a displacement-based strategy for discrete-time formation control through attitude synchronization. Unlike the Eulerian approximation, the first challenge lies in developing discrete-time models that capture both position and attitude motions, thereby complementing existing continuous-time systems with a discretized version. Then, two leader-following control protocols are designed, incorporating a jointly connected topology to relax the connectivity requirements. The analysis of these systems often relies on the Lyapunov function, the existence of which may be hard to guarantee. Consequently, the geometric properties of several polytopes are explored under the dynamic topologies and time-varying parameters. By extending the ergodicity results to leader-following scenarios, these properties are characterized as positively invariant sets. This invariance, which is independent of the existence of the Lyapunov function or the solvability of its associated criteria, provides a beneficial tool for analyzing time-variant systems. Utilizing this invariance and some mathematical techniques, the desired formation shape can be achieved in cases where the attitudes of the followers synchronize with the leader. Finally, a numerical simulation validates the results.},

  abstract     = {Solving power flow is a fundamental problem in power systems. The normally radial (tree) topology of a distribution network induces a spatially recursive structure in ac power flow, which enables a class of efficient solution methods—backward/forward sweep (BFS). In this article, we revisit BFS from the perspective of its convergence, which was rarely addressed before. We introduce three variants of BFS algorithms: the first one calculates voltages and line currents in a single-phase network model; the second algorithm extends the first one to an unbalanced three-phase network with $Y$ and $\Delta$ configurations; the third one calculates voltages and line power flows in the classical dist-flow model. We prove a sufficient condition, under which the first algorithm is a contraction mapping on a closed set of voltages and thus converges geometrically to a unique solution. This proof is extended to the second algorithm for three-phase networks. We then use the monotone convergence theorem to prove convergence of the third algorithm. We verify the convergence conditions, solution accuracy, and computational efficiency of BFS algorithms through simulations in IEEE test systems.},

Meanwhile, the attack should be synthesized with sophistication to deceive an anomaly detector. To investigate the vulnerabilities of such estimation systems without feedback links and enhance security performance, the optimal attack policy is derived by formulating and explicitly solving a convex optimization problem, with the goal of maximizing the sum of estimation errors. Subsequently, a novel attack detection and resilient state estimation algorithm is proposed to ensure an acceptable level of estimation accuracy.

On the one hand, the Gaussian assumption only derives an approximate result, while on the other hand, exact results can be obtained by numerical integration but with excessive computational complexity. To this end, in this article, we propose a stochastic ETS based on acknowledgment information for remote state estimation with smart sensors and packet drops. The transmission decision is jointly driven by the holding time at the remote end and the accumulated innovative information. Then, we inductively derive the exact probability density function of the augmented innovative information vector by the Bayesian rule, which is used to obtain the explicit form of the estimation error covariance. These exact theoretical results mean that the design of scheduling parameter sequences no longer relies on experience.

Auxiliary variables are constructed to seek the NE point within the prescribed time and serve as reference signals for the tracking control part. Then, state feedback control is designed to drive the strategies of all the players to the expected NE point in the prescribed time.

The gradient estimations easily become biased, for example, when gradients are compressed or clipped, when data are shuffled, and in meta-learning and reinforcement learning. In this work, we establish worst-case bounds on parallel momentum methods under biased gradient estimation on both general nonconvex and $\mu$-Polyak–Łojasiewicz problems. Our analysis covers general distributed optimization problems, and we work out the implications for special cases where gradient estimates are biased, i.e., in meta-learning and when the gradients are compressed or clipped.

In this work, we present primal decomposition schemes for hierarchically structured strongly convex quadratic programs. These schemes offer high degrees of feasibility in a small number of iterations in combination with global convergence guarantees. We benchmark their performance against the centralized off-the-shelf interior-point solver Ipopt and ADMM on problems with up to 300 000 decision variables and constraints.

Yet, their potential is often shadowed by a pressing concern: the privacy of agents' initial values, which frequently represent sensitive data or proprietary information. A computationally light privacy-preserving mechanism for matrix-weighted average consensus (MAC) algorithms is proposed in response to the concern of agents' privacy. In the mechanism, agents' states are first perturbed and then multiplied by the matrix weights before being sent to their neighbors. Both the perturbation and the matrix weight are neighbor-dependent, i.e., they may be selected to be different for different neighbors, and they can be selected independently to mask the true state of an agent. The proposed mechanism can simultaneously guarantee the privacy of initial values and accurate average consensus. The additional computational burden that an agent bears is only the addition of vectors in the same dimension as its state compared to the original MAC algorithm. Through practical case studies with a peer-to-peer transactive energy system, we demonstrate the tangible implications of safeguarding initial value privacy with the proposed mechanism.},

This study focuses on achieving company–traveler equilibria, whereby a single company optimizes pricing and routing decisions to maximize profitability while considering travelers' mode choices, modeled via a multinomial logit model (MNL). Although profit maximization problems have been extensively studied in the field of revenue management across various domains, their application to transportation networks poses unique challenges, such as the influence of network topology and additional constraints (e.g., flow conservation, rebalancing, etc.). To address the inherent nonlinear relationship arising from endogenous travel demand, we shift our domain space from price to market share. Subsequently, we derive prices using a direct one-to-one correspondence within the MNL. This work is the first effort in leveraging such novel techniques in the context of transportation network analysis. Remarkably, the proposed reformulation results in an equivalent problem exhibiting convexity, offering computational efficiency and interpretability. By solving the Karush–Kuhn–Tucker conditions, we characterize user equilibrium with the generalized route cost, which incorporates the operating cost by rebalancing and travelers' disutility caused by congestion. Our approach is empirically validated through a numerical analysis conducted on the widely recognized Sioux Falls network. The results underscore the effectiveness and practical applicability of our method in analyzing transportation networks featuring MoD services and open the stage for important future investigations.},

  abstract     = {External disturbances and denial-of-service (DoS) attacks pose significant challenges to the quantized control of multiagent systems (MASs). Most of the existing quantized control strategies primarily focus on designing scaling factors and constructing auxiliary systems without considering external disturbances. Note that these strategies require a highly accurate system model and will lead to the saturation of the quantizer if there exist external disturbances. To overcome the aforementioned shortcomings, a new scaling function is developed in this article by incorporating robustness factors into the scaling function design, significantly enhancing the robustness of the quantization mechanism. Based on this, a robust quantized control strategy is designed to achieve the bounded consensus of linear MASs in the presence of disturbance and DoS attacks, where the tradeoff among quantization level, consensus performance, and resilience to DoS attacks is explored. Besides, the robust design framework shows significant flexibility and efficiency in addressing the resilient control of nonlinear MASs subject to DoS attacks. Numerical simulations are provided to validate the theoretical results.},

Each agent in a multiagent system (MAS) is equipped with a timer mechanism that generates intermittent measurement and control update events, which may occur asynchronously between agents. Between consecutive event times, as determined by the corresponding timer mechanism, the controller of each agent is held constant. These controllers are shown to drive the configuration of the MAS into a neighborhood of the set of centroidal Voronoi configurations, i.e., the minimizers of the standard locational cost. The combination of continuous-time dynamics with intermittently updated control inputs is modeled as a hybrid system. The coverage objective is posed as a set attractivity problem for hybrid systems, where an invariance-based convergence analysis yields sufficient conditions that ensure maximal solutions of the hybrid system asymptotically converge to a desired set.

  abstract     = {The optimal power flow (OPF) problem is one of the most fundamental problems in power system operations. The nonlinear ac power flow equations that model different physical laws (together with operational constraints) lay the foundation for the feasibility region of the OPF problem. While significant research has focused on convex relaxations, which are approaches to solve an OPF problem by enlarging the true feasibility region, the opposite approach of convex restrictions offers valuable insights as well. Convex restrictions, including polyhedral restrictions, reduce the true feasible region to a convex region, ensuring that it contains only feasible points. In this work, we develop a sequential optimization method that offers a scalable way to obtain (bounds on) solutions to OPF problems for distribution networks. To do so, we first develop sufficient conditions for the existence of feasible power flow solutions in the neighborhood of a specific (feasible) operating point in distribution networks; second, based on these conditions, we construct a polyhedral restriction of the feasibility region. Our numerical results demonstrate the efficacy of the sequential optimization method as an alternative to existing approaches to obtain (bounds on) solutions to OPF problems for distribution networks. By construction, the optimization problems within the defined restrictions can be solved in polynomial time and are guaranteed to have feasible solutions.},

The serial consensus design will guarantee the stability of the closed-loop system under the minimum requirement of the underlying communication graph containing a directed spanning tree, which is not generally true for conventional consensus. As our main result, we show that the serial consensus design gives bounds on the worst-case transient behavior of the formation, which is independent of the number of vehicles and the underlying graph structure. In particular, this shows that the serial consensus design guarantees the string stability of the formation and is, therefore, suitable for directed formations and communication topologies. We show that serial consensus can be implemented through message passing or measurements to neighbors at most two hops away. We illustrate our results through numerical examples.},

Yet, they achieve feasibility only asymptotically, which induces a substantial computational burden. This work presents an approximate dynamic programming scheme for tree-structured optimization problems, which is guaranteed to deliver a feasible solution in “one shot,” i.e., in one backward-forward iteration over all subproblems.

Although this problem has been studied in the literature, existing research has some limitations. This article presents two new theoretical results that address these limitations: the synthesis of unrealistic high-gain control parameters due to the lack of a systematic way to incorporate the lower and upper bounds on the control parameters, and the performance sensitivity to the communication delay due to inaccurate Taylor series approximation. To be more precise, taking advantage of the well-known Padé approximation, this article proposes a constrained CAV platoon controller synthesis that systematically incorporates the lower and upper bounds on the control parameters, and significantly improves the performance sensitivity to the communication delay. The effectiveness of the presented results is verified through conducting extensive numerical simulations. The proposed controller effectively attenuates the stop-and-go disturbance—a single cycle of deceleration followed by acceleration—amplification throughout the mixed platoon (consisting of CAVs and human-driven vehicles). Modern transportation systems will benefit from the proposed CAV controls in terms of effective disturbance attenuation as it will potentially reduce collisions.},

To tackle this challenge, we propose the Q-DADAM algorithm, a quantized distributed adaptive momentum method that ensures that agents interact with neighbors to optimize the global cost function collectively. Unlike many existing distributed online optimization algorithms that overlook communication bandwidth constraints, the Q-DADAM algorithm involves random quantization to effectively reduce the data transmission volume, making it more practical for applications with limited channel capacity. Different from existing algorithms that neglect adaptive momentum methods, the Q-DADAM algorithm incorporates these adaptive momentum methods, contributing to improved convergence and superior performance. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that the Q-DADAM algorithm with appropriate step size and quantization level can reduce communication traffic and achieve sublinear dynamic regret. Simulation experiments validate the practicality and effectiveness of the Q-DADAM algorithm. In addition, we discuss the impacts on the convergence of the Q-DADAM algorithm under different quantization levels and the number of agents.},

In response to this challenge, this article proposes a hierarchical coverage control (HCC) protocol for MASs to perform sector-based coverage operations. First, a distributed Voronoi partition-based sweep-and-assign protocol, combined with a sectorial partition method, is developed, enabling the segmentation of a whole poriferous region into multiple sectorial sub-subregions. Following this procedure, an extreme search scheme is developed to determine the optimal amount of agents for each subregion. After this allocation, a distributed controller is proposed to deploy the agents, considering nonholonomic constraints, into designated niche positions. In addition, sufficient conditions are derived to guarantee the asymptotical stability of the present HCC. The analytical challenge of the present study stems from the nonconvex characteristics inherent in the loss function induced by porous environments. This nonconvexity renders the task of globally optimizing the assignment of MASs intractable. Finally, numerical simulations are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the present coverage control approach.},

  abstract     = {This article first presents an interval-appointed looped-functional approach for the stability of switching event-triggered (SET) control systems with input saturation. In order to improve the resource utilization of the networked control system while maintaining satisfactory system performance, a memory term and a dynamic triggering threshold are introduced into the existing SET scheme. Thus, a dynamic memory-based SET (DMSET) scheme is newly designed. To analyze the stability of the controlled system, a useful lemma is established in which an interval-appointed looped-functional is constructed, and a combined Lyapunov method is developed accordingly to derive a relaxed stability criterion. This method contributes to discarding the positive definiteness of certain Lyapunov matrices in the interval-appointed looped-functional and lays a groundwork for the stability analysis of other SET-based saturated control systems. As an application, an LMI-based less conservative stability criterion for DMSET control systems is then derived. Two optimization algorithms are given to maximize the estimates of the region of attraction and the permissible length of the sampling period, respectively. In the end, the advantages of the interval-appointed looped-functional approach and the DMSET scheme are demonstrated by two illustrative examples.},

  abstract     = {This article examines the stability of finite networked evolutionary games (NEGs) considering randomly available second-order neighbors' information. A new strategy update rule (SUR) with randomly mixed two-level reasoning is proposed. The idea behind two-level reasoning is that each player predicts his/her neighbors' strategies based on the second-order neighbors' information if available, and then updates his/her own strategy accordingly. Since this information is only available randomly, the induced SUR is a mixed SUR based on one-level and two-level reasoning. The algebraic form of the profile dynamical system is derived, and the profile's transition probability matrix is calculated. Based on these, necessary and sufficient conditions for a Nash equilibrium (NE) stability are proposed. In addition, it is proved that under mild probability conditions, if an NE of an NEG with one-level reasoning is stable, then it is also stable for the NEG with the induced randomly mixed two-level reasoning. An illustrative example is provided to demonstrate the proposed results.},

We introduce a continuous-time coordination algorithm to solve unconstrained optimization problems with additive structure. The proposed algorithm can be interpreted as a modified version of the distributed subgradient method, enhanced with an augmented scalar state variable. Each agent is assumed to know its out-degree. Unlike existing methods that rely on a perturbed version of the push-sum algorithm, the proposed algorithm does not require any specific initialization. As a result, it is capable of handling strongly connected networks with sporadically varying sizes. We show that the proposed network flow is guaranteed to converge to the global minimizer of a sum of convex functions, provided that the local objective functions are strongly convex and have Lipschitz-continuous gradients. In addition, by considering a class of admissible time-varying gains/step-sizes, our analysis substantiates an explicit sublinear rate of convergence for the proposed algorithm.},

  abstract     = {In this work, we consider dynamic influence maximization games over social networks with multiple players (influencers). At the beginning of each campaign opportunity, individuals' opinion dynamics take independent and identically distributed realizations based on an arbitrary distribution. Upon observing the realizations, influencers allocate some of their budgets to affect their opinion dynamics. Then, individuals' opinion dynamics evolve according to the well-known DeGroot model. In the end, influencers collect their reward based on the final opinion dynamics. Each influencer's goal is to maximize their own reward subject to their limited total budget rate constraints, leading to a dynamic game problem. We first consider the offline and online versions of a single influencer's optimization problem where the opinion dynamics and campaign durations are either known or not known a priori. Then, we consider the game formulation with multiple influencers in offline and online settings. For the offline setting, we show that the dynamic game admits a unique Nash equilibrium policy and provide a method to compute it. For the online setting and with two influencers, we show that if each influencer applies the same no-regret online algorithm proposed for the single-influencer maximization problem, they converge to the set of $\epsilon$-Nash equilibrium policies where $\epsilon =\mathcal {O}(1/\sqrt{K})$ scales in average inversely with the number of campaign times $K$ considering the influencers' average utilities. Moreover, we extend this result to any finite number of influencers under more strict requirements on the information structure.},

We assume that the only available information is the zero–nonzero structure of system matrices, and approach this problem within a structured system model. We revisit the concept of state and input observability for structured systems, providing refined necessary and sufficient conditions for placing dedicated sensors via the Dulmage–Mendelsohn decomposition. Based on these conditions, we prove that determining the minimum number of dedicated sensors to achieve generic state and input observability is NP-hard, which contrasts sharply with the polynomial-time complexity of the corresponding problem with known inputs. We also demonstrate that this problem is hard to approximate within a factor of $(1-o(1))\mathrm{{log}}(n)$, where $n$ is the state dimension. Notwithstanding, we propose nontrivial upper and lower bounds that can be computed in polynomial time, which confine the optimal value of this problem to an interval with length being the number of inputs. We further present a special case for which the exact optimal value can be determined in polynomial time. In addition, we propose a two-stage algorithm to solve this problem approximately. Each stage of the algorithm is either optimal or suboptimal and can be completed in polynomial time.},

This number is considerably smaller than what is typically required from classic rigidity-theory-based strategies ($2n-3$ edges).

The author models agent coordination as a decentralized leader–follower problem with time-varying communication weights. Given this problem setting, the author first presents a method for converting the communication graph into a neural network, where an agent can be represented by a unique node of the communication graph but multiple neurons of the corresponding neural network. The author then applies a mass-centric strategy to train time-varying communication weights of the neural network in a decentralized fashion. This implies that the observation zone of every follower agent is independently assigned by the follower based on positions of its in-neighbors. By training the neural network, the author can ensure safe and decentralized multiagent coverage control. Despite the target is unknown to the agent team, the author provides a proof for convergence of the proposed multiagent coverage method. The functionality of the proposed method is validated by a large-scale multicopter team covering distributed targets on the ground.},

  abstract     = {The advent of social media applications and mobile devices has allowed users to experience live streaming events (e.g., a football match) together, even if they are not in the same physical place. However, this service brings along the issue of ensuring a synchronized video playback among geographically distributed users. Users leave comments and reactions to an online live event on social networks. As a consequence, an unsynchronized video playback can be easily noticed and be detrimental to users' feelings of togetherness. In this work, we propose a distributed control approach to achieve synchronization among users. In particular, the well-known consensus problem of first-order integrators with saturated inputs is employed to design a distributed playback synchronization framework. Furthermore, we propose a leader–follower approach to ensure a controlled synchronization among users in order to obtain the least possible delay with respect to the video content provider. Finally, an event-triggered control is introduced as an enhancement to the previously developed control with the aim of reducing the information exchanged among users. Simulations on different network topologies confirm that the proposed approach is effective at enforcing asymptotic synchronization.},

  abstract     = {This article systematically studies the problem of resilient controller design for networked control systems under imperfect communication environments. The stochastic denial of service attacks in the case of an imperfect network are remodeled. An semi-Markov chain is introduced in this article to provide a suitable description of random attacks. On this basis, the double-layer stochastic process is constructed, which consists of an attack sequence and an observation one. Second, since the attack modes are inaccessible, a controller is constructed based on the observation sequence by virtue of the emission probability to stabilize the system under random attacks. Due to the complexity of the network, the probability that an observer can accurately detect an attack when it occurs is considered unknown. Based on the introduced double-layer stochastic process, a mode-associated Lyapunov function is constructed to facilitate the stability analysis. Building on this foundation, sufficient conditions that can ensure the $\delta$-error mean-square stability of the closed-loop system are derived. In the end, a simulation of the autonomous ground vehicle is presented, showcasing the feasibility and validity of the proposed control scheme.},

  abstract     = {Most multiagent reinforcement learning (MARL) methods are limited in the scale of problems they can handle. With increasing numbers of agents, the number of training iterations required to find the optimal behaviors increases exponentially due to the exponentially growing joint state and action spaces. This article tackles this limitation by introducing a scalable MARL method called distributed multiagent reinforcement learning with one-hop neighbors (DARL1N). DARL1N is an off-policy actor–critic method that addresses the curse of dimensionality by restricting information exchanges among the agents to one-hop neighbors when representing value and policy functions. Each agent optimizes its value and policy functions over a one-hop neighborhood, significantly reducing the learning complexity, yet maintaining expressiveness by training with varying neighbor numbers and states. This structure allows us to formulate a distributed learning framework to further speed up the training procedure. Distributed computing systems, however, contain straggler compute nodes, which are slow or unresponsive due to communication bottlenecks, software problems, or hardware problems. To mitigate the detrimental straggler effect, we introduce a novel coded distributed learning architecture, which leverages coding theory to improve the resilience of the learning system to stragglers. Comprehensive experiments show that DARL1N significantly reduces training time without sacrificing policy quality and is scalable as the number of agents increases. Moreover, the coded distributed learning architecture improves training efficiency in the presence of stragglers.},

First, the reference generator is constructed for each follower agent to generate the virtual tracking signal, confining to the convex hull spanned by the leaders. Meanwhile, the unmeasurable state variable of each follower is estimated by adopting the $K$-filters based on the available output/input signals and known system function matrices. Then, a distributed adaptive output feedback controller with only one updating parameter is designed for each follower by introducing a logarithmic quantization to quantize the control inputs under the framework of prescribed performance control. The lack of a priori knowledge for the control gain and the quantization gain is counteracted effectively by employing the Nussbaum function method in the adaptive backstepping design process. It is proved that the outputs of followers can enter into the convex hull of multiple leaders and the relevant tracking errors satisfy the prescribed performance index. Finally, the validity of the proposed schemes is illustrated through simulation studies on robotic systems.},

  abstract     = {The Stackelberg game depicts a leader–follower relationship wherein decisions are made sequentially, and the Stackelberg equilibrium represents an expected optimal solution when the leader can anticipate the rational response of the follower. Motivated by control of network systems with two levels of decision-making hierarchy, such as the management of energy networks and power coordination at cellular networks, a networked multileader multifollower Stackelberg game is proposed. Due to the constraint of limited information interaction among players, a clustered information structure is assumed that each leader can only communicate with a portion of overall followers, namely, its direct subordinated followers, and also only with its local neighboring leaders. In this case, the leaders cannot fully anticipate the collective rational response of all followers with local information. To address Stackelberg equilibrium seeking under this partial information structure, we propose a distributed seeking algorithm based on implicit gradient estimation and network consensus mechanisms. We rigorously prove the convergence of the algorithm for both diminishing and constant step sizes under strict and strong monotonicity conditions, respectively. Furthermore, the model and the algorithm can also incorporate linear equality and inequality constraints into the followers' optimization problems, with the approach of the interior point barrier function. Finally, we present numerical simulations in applications to corroborate our claims on the proposed framework.},

This article delves into the problem of cooperative fault-tolerant control under state constraints for a specific class of nonlinear multiple-agent systems. To achieve an asymptotic estimation of states and faults, we propose a distributed state–fault observer that leverages the structural information of faults. Notably, this observer operates independently of the choice of control input, thus decoupling it from the controller design. Alongside estimates of states and faults, we develop a cooperative fault-tolerant controller to ensure that the constrained state difference remains within the prescribed range throughout the system's evolution, ultimately converging to the desired value. We demonstrate the applicability of this approach in the context of cooperative fault-tolerant cruise control for multiple high-speed trains, where we consider simultaneous constraints on train position and velocity.},

In this article, we propose new models of multiplex network games to capture the different modalities of interactions among strategic agents, and multilayer network games to capture their interactions over multiple action dimensions. We explore how the properties of the constituent networks of a multiplex/multilayer network can undermine or support the existence, uniqueness, and stability of the game's Nash equilibria. Notably, we highlight that both the largest and smallest eigenvalues of the constituent networks (reflecting their connectivity and two-sidedness, respectively) are instrumental in determining the uniqueness of the multiplex/multilayer network game's equilibrium. Together, our findings shed light on the reasons for the fragility of equilibria when agents interact over networks of networks, and point out potential interventions to alleviate them.},

To address this problem, we propose a computationally efficient and robust algorithm that builds on a probabilistic technique for stochastic gradient computation, which we believe will be applicable to a wide range of problems in decentralized information processing, learning, and control. Specifically, we show that the proposed method achieves an oracle complexity (computational complexity) of $O(1/\epsilon ^{2})$ for smooth and nonconvex functions with stochastic gradients, which is known to be sharp for its respective function class, and is an improvement over the computational cost obtained in previous works. In addition, we retain the $O(1/\epsilon ^{3})$ rate for the communication cost, which is at par with the communication cost obtained in previous works. We also show how the proposed algorithm has robust performance in environments with unreliable computational resources. Finally, the theoretical findings are validated via numerical experiments.},

In this article, we introduce a new rigidity theory adapted to pseudorange measurements. The peculiarity of pseudoranges is that they are asymmetrical measurements. Therefore, unlike other usual rigidities, the graphs of pseudorange frameworks are directed. In this article, pseudorange rigidity is proved to be a generic property of the underlying undirected graph of constraints. The main result is a characterization of rigid pseudorange graphs as combinations of rigid distance graphs and connected graphs. This new theory is adapted for GNSS. It provides new insights into the minimum number of satellites needed to locate a receiver and is applied to the localization of GNSS cooperative networks of receivers.

We consider the problem of designing a controller that achieves desirable objectives. We propose in this article a decentralized polytopic control design that yields a state feedback voltage controller that stabilizes the inverters in the presence of droop-like controllers aiming to achieve power sharing. The voltage controller is synthesized via a convex optimization problem that uses a detailed nonlinear inverter model, where the nonlinearities are taken into account via a quasi-linear parameter-varying formulation. Our control design guarantees stability and plug-and-play capability via a decentralized condition with passivity properties, and appropriate performance specifications are satisfied, including voltage tracking capability, restricted control input, and robustness to state deviations. Our approach allows using a user-defined operating point, and through the polytopic control design, it allows us to take into account the bounds on the inverter state deviations. The performance of the controller is illustrated via simulations with detailed nonlinear models in a realistic setting.},

  abstract     = {In this article, we consider event-triggered control (ETC) to achieve robust synchronization between Boolean networks and probabilistic Boolean networks (PBNs). The advantage of the controller in this article lies in its robustness against random disturbances, which unavoidably exist in real networks because of environmental changes. Moreover, the proposed ETC effectively reduces energy consumption, because it achieves the control objective using the shortest possible time without unnecessary updates of the feedback gain. First, robust synchronization is equivalently converted to robust set stabilization of an augmented PBN using the semitensor product. Second, a feasible algorithm is presented to calculate the largest robust control invariant set of a given set, based on which a necessary and sufficient condition is developed for the existence of event-triggered controllers. Then, a detailed configuration of all feasible controllers is provided by a constructive algorithm. Under some mild conditions, global controllers are designed to further reduce computation load. Finally, examples are provided to illustrate the main results.},

Each player represents a region, which is assumed to choose its control to implement a tradeoff between socioeconomic aspects and health aspects; the control comprises both epidemic control physical measures and influence actions on the region's opinion. The generalized Nash equilibrium (GNE) analysis of the proposed game model is conducted. The direct analysis of this game of practical interest is nontrivial, but it turns out that one can construct an auxiliary game that allows one to prove existence and uniqueness and to compute the GNE and the optimal centralized solution (sum cost) of the game. These results allow us to assess numerically the loss (measured in terms of price of anarchy) induced by decentralization with or without taking into account the opinion dynamics.},

We consider a group of agents that communicate over a strongly connected, aperiodic graph and do not have any knowledge of the system dynamics. Each agent only measures some signals that are linear functions of the system states or inputs, and does not know the functional form of this dependence. The proposed distributed algorithm consists of two steps that rely on the collected data: first, the identification of an unforced trajectory of the system, and second, the estimation of the coefficients of the characteristic polynomial of the system matrix using this unforced trajectory. We show that each step can be formulated as a problem of finding a common solution to a set of linear algebraic equations, which are amenable to distributed algorithmic solutions. We prove that under mild assumptions on the collected data, when the initial condition of the system is random, the proposed distributed algorithm accurately estimates the spectrum with probability 1.},

To characterize the generation power against the fuel cost, we denote various fuel choices by segmented nonconvex costs. To help address the lack of prior knowledge of the system model, we propose a novel distributed actor–critic algorithm to find the feasible power. The algorithm combines the actor policy network with the multiplier splitting approach and projected gradient method, maps the action's policy distribution to a feasible power interval, and finally realizes real-time dispatching in continuous action space by approximating the evaluation function from the critic network. The convergence of the algorithm is theoretically analyzed. The effectiveness of the approach is verified by several simulations.},

A key reason for this reluctance could be the competitive advantage that comes with lax regulation. A popular platform that starts enforcing content moderation rules may fear that it could lose users to less-regulated alternative platforms. Moreover, if users continue harmful activities on other platforms, regulation ends up being futile. This article examines the competitive aspect of content moderation by considering the motivations of all involved players (platformer, news source, and social media users), identifying the regulation policies sustained in equilibrium, and evaluating the information quality available on each platform. Applied to simple yet relevant social networks, such as stochastic block models, our model reveals the conditions for a popular platform to enforce strict regulation without losing users. Effectiveness of regulation depends on the diffusive property of news posts, friend interaction qualities in social media, the sizes and cohesiveness of communities, and how much sympathizers appreciate surprising news from influencers.},

To enhance the rapidity of the systems, a distributed bang–bang control algorithm is introduced with communication delays. It is shown that all trains will eventually achieve stable operation with a desired velocity while remaining in the self-adjusting zones in the absence of communication delays or remaining in the neighborhood of the self-adjusting zones in the presence of communication delays. The analysis is mainly based on linear equivalent transformations of the sign functions and constraints, and the convexity of stochastic matrices.

Numerous approaches to manage this impact have been proposed, ranging from stochastic and chance-constrained programming to robust optimization. However, these approaches either tend to be conservative or leave the system vulnerable to low-probability, high-impact uncertainty realizations. To address this issue, we propose a new formulation for stochastic optimal power flow that explicitly distinguishes between “normal operation,” in which automatic generation control (AGC) is sufficient to guarantee system security, and “adverse operation,” in which the system operator is required to take additional actions, e.g., manual reserve deployment. The new formulation has been compared with the classical ones in a case study on the IEEE-118 and IEEE-300 bus systems. We observe that our consideration of extreme scenarios enables solutions that are more secure than typical chance-constrained formulations, yet less costly than solutions that guarantee robust feasibility with only AGC.},

This pursuit leads us to the development of a distributed optimization algorithm that preserves privacy, tailored for directed networks. The algorithm strives to secure a balance between supply and demand at the lowest economic cost, all while adhering to real-world constraints and maintaining the confidentiality of power-sensitive information. To fulfill this objective, we propose a novel privacy-preserving distributed algorithm that capitalizes on the inherent resilience exhibited by system dynamics toward uncertainty. Specifically, to ensure privacy preservation, we strategically incorporate randomness into the mixing weights, thereby generating a degree of uncertainty in communication messages during the initial iteration. Rigorous analysis is built to delineate that our method can achieve exact convergence and ensure the confidentiality of power-sensitive information.

  abstract     = {In this article, we address formation tracking control in agents' body coordinate frames while imposing no assumptions, such as positive definiteness on agents' initial attitude matrix. Difficulty in achieving formation control is exacerbated when agents are unable to access their absolute attitudes relative to a common frame of reference, and initial attitude matrices are required to be restricted to special sets. Addressing this issue, we present a distributed fixed-time attitude synchronization law, which utilizes only relative attitude measurements to align the agents' coordinate frames almost globally in finite time and locally in fixed time. The proposed law ensures the global asymptotic convergence of formation tracking error for displacement-based formation control in a leader–follower topology. We also establish global uniformly asymptotic stability for bearing-only formation tracking. A Lyapunov-based attitude estimation algorithm is proposed to estimate the attitudes up to a common reference frame in finite time without using Gram–Schmidt orthogonalization. For nonholonomic agents, formation stabilization in agents' local coordinate frame is studied using these attitude estimates and bearing-only measurements. Finally, to illustrate the applicability of our results, simulations are presented.},

  abstract     = {Resilience of cyber-physical networks to unexpected failures is a critical need widely recognized across domains. For instance, power grids, telecommunication networks, transportation infrastructures, and water treatment systems have all been subject to disruptive malfunctions and catastrophic cyberattacks. Following such adverse events, we investigate scenarios where a node of a linear network suffers a loss of control authority over some of its actuators. These actuators are not following the controller's commands and are instead producing undesirable outputs. The repercussions of such a loss of control can propagate and destabilize the whole network despite the malfunction occurring at a single node. To assess system vulnerability, we establish resilience conditions for networks with a subsystem enduring a loss of control authority over some of its actuators. Furthermore, we quantify the destabilizing impact on the overall network when such a malfunction perturbs a nonresilient subsystem. We illustrate our resilience conditions on two academic examples, on an islanded microgrid and on the linearized IEEE 39-bus system.},

The communication networks are deemed to be invaded by spoofing attacks in a probabilistic manner, where normally transmitted data may be replaced. Depending on the data-buffer-aided mechanism, a novel dynamic-memory event-triggered protocol is proposed to modulate the transmission frequency by drawing into historically released packets and two auxiliary internal dynamic variables. Then, a suitable event-triggered adaptive sliding-mode control strategy is developed to actualize the reachability of the specified integral sliding surface, which is capable of diminishing the impacts of model uncertainties. Stochastic admissibility and strict dissipativity conditions of closed-loop fuzzy implicit Markov jump systems are derived under the framework of linear matrix inequalities. Finally, a networked truck–trailer reversing system is exploited to verify the validity of developed strategies.},

The first algorithm exhibits synchronous operation while the second one exhibits asynchronous operation. Both algorithms operate exclusively with quantized values. This means that the information stored, processed, and exchanged between neighboring nodes is subject to deterministic uniform quantization. The algorithms rely on event-driven updates in order to reduce energy consumption, communication bandwidth, network congestion, and/or processor usage. Finally, once the algorithms converge, nodes distributively terminate their operation. We prove that our algorithms converge in a finite number of iterations to the exact optimal solution depending on the quantization level, and we present applications of our algorithms to, first, optimal task scheduling for data centers, and second, global model aggregation for distributed federated learning. We provide simulations of these applications to illustrate the operation, performance, and advantages of the proposed algorithms.

We also examine an associated problem where every robot is limited by payload, budget, and communication to pick no more than a specified number of relative position measurements. The basic underlying formulation for these problems is nonlinear and is known to be NP-hard. Our approach formulates this problem as a mixed-integer semidefinite program, later reformulated into a mixed-integer linear program for obtaining optimal solutions using cutting plane algorithms. We introduce a novel upper bounding algorithm based on the principal minor characterization of positive semidefinite matrices and discuss a degree-constrained lower bounding formulation inspired by robust network structures.

In order to compute the ride-pooling assignment, which is the matching between two or more users so that they can be pooled together, we devise a polynomial-time knapsack-like algorithm that is optimal w.r.t. the minimum vehicle travel time with users on-board. Finally, we conduct two case studies of Sioux Falls and Manhattan, where we validate our models against state-of-the-art results, and we quantitatively highlight the effects that maximum waiting time and maximum delay thresholds have on the vehicle hours traveled, overall pooled rides, and actual delay experienced.

Most of the existing research on the coordination control of multiple PDE systems assumes that the communication topology is undirected and that communication between neighboring agents is continuous, leading to significant consumption of communication resources. However, in this study, the communication topology among the virtual leader and followers is described by a directed graph, where the leader's reference signal is accessible only to a subset of the followers. Moreover, an event-triggering mechanism is proposed to avoid continuous signal transmission among agents, effectively mitigating the communication burden. An adaptive boundary control scheme based on filters is designed for each following flexible manipulator to track the leader's angle and eliminate unexpected vibrations in the presence of unknown external disturbances. All the signals of the closed-loop system are uniformly bounded. Simulation results show that the presented control scheme is effective.},

  abstract     = {Ambient monitoring through remote sensing is the first required step of many control operations in cyber-physical systems to enable accurate decision-making by network intelligence. We consider a controller that sends status updates about a process to a receiver, incurring a cost when doing so. The process is dynamic, implying that the information the receiver has may become outdated due to a natural drift of the process. To determine the correctness of the information at the receiver, we model this interaction using a Markov chain with two states, namely, right (R) and wrong (W). The controller can restore the receiver status to R by performing a new transmission, which comes at a cost. The staleness of information, when the system state is erroneous, is quantified through the average value of the age of incorrect information metric. Moreover, an adversary may inject false data at a price to make the information available at the receiver less fresh, which can only be contrasted by additional measurements by the controller. This results in a game played by strategic agents, namely, the controller and the adversary. The adversary's objective is to maximize the time the receiver is in the W state of the Markov chain, while the controller's objective is to minimize it. We provide a mathematical formulation of this strategic interaction using game-theory, demonstrating the existence of a Nash equilibrium. In our analysis, we discuss the role of different system parameters and the implications on the resulting system performance, providing a quantitative evaluation of the parameter ranges where an adversary can be effectively counteracted is an important guideline to improve the security of cyber-physical systems.},

  abstract     = {In this article, the state estimation issue is investigated for networked switched systems via an event-triggered zonotope method, and the general asynchronism is considered between subsystems and observers. First, the event-triggered zonotope is proposed to enclose the system state, where the observer gain only updates with the switching signal at triggering instants. The restriction on the switching signal is removed such that system switchings can happen more than once over each interevent interval. Then, specific iteration procedures are provided for the generator matrix in synchronous and asynchronous intervals. Solvable conditions are proposed to jointly optimize the event-triggered parameters and observer gains by constructing observer-mode-dependent radius functions. The boundedness and ${\mathcal {L}}_{\infty }$ performance are analyzed for the radius of the zonotope under restricted switchings.

  abstract     = {Linear approximation commonly used in solving ac optimal power flow (OPF) simplifies the system models but incurs accumulated voltage errors in large power networks. Such errors will make the primal–dual type gradient algorithms converge to solutions with voltage violations. In this article, we improve a recent hierarchical OPF algorithm that rested on primal–dual gradients evaluated with a linearized distribution power flow model. Specifically, we propose a more accurate gradient evaluation method based on an unbalanced three-phase nonlinear distribution power flow model to mitigate the errors arising from linearization. The resultant gradients feature a blocked structure that enables our development of an improved hierarchical primal–dual algorithm to solve the OPF problem. Numerical results on the IEEE 123-bus test feeder and a 4518-node test feeder show that the proposed method can enhance voltage safety at comparable computational efficiency with the linearized algorithm.},

We propose both a distributed reference generator and a control law based on the low-gain approach for each follower agent in the system. We show that all the control laws together achieve semiglobal bipartite output consensus. Furthermore, we present a Q-learning algorithm to obtain both the low-gain parameter and the feedback gain matrix in the control law. We also present an online output-tracking-error-based updating algorithm to obtain the feedforward gain matrix in the control law. Thus, these control laws no more rely on the dynamics of linear systems. We show that the input saturation during the online updating algorithm does not affect the convergence of the algorithm. The control laws calculated from the model-free algorithms can prevent input saturation from occurring, and thus, the heterogeneous multiagent systems achieve global bipartite output consensus.

This map allows the construction of a traffic abstraction, through an $\ell$-complete relation, that provides upper and lower bounds on the sampling performance of the concrete system.

Complex frequency represents the rate of change of voltage amplitude and phase angle by its real and imaginary parts, respectively. This emerging notion is of significance as it accommodates the multivariable characteristics of power networks, where active power and reactive power are inherently coupled with both voltage amplitude and phase. We propose the notion of complex-frequency synchronization to study the phase–amplitude multivariable stability issue in a power system with dispatchable virtual oscillator-controlled converters. To achieve this, we separate the system into linear fast dynamics and approximately linear slow dynamics. The linearity property makes it tractable to analyze fast complex-frequency synchronization and slower voltage stabilization. From the perspective of complex frequency and complex-frequency synchronization, we provide novel insights into the equivalence of dispatchable virtual oscillator control and complex-power–frequency droop control, stability analysis methods, and stability criteria. Our study offers a practical solution to address challenging stability issues in converter-based power systems.},

The optimal control signal of each SS is obtained using its constructed corresponding global cost function. Sufficient conditions are provided on the sampling time, which guarantees the recursive feasibility of the proposed CDMPC approach. Moreover, sufficient conditions are presented, which guarantees that the deviation of the state variables, control inputs, and outputs of the LS system (LSS) converge to the origin and, consequently, guarantees closed-loop stability.

We formulate a Nash-minmax strategy, where the interactions of players in the same agent are nonzero-sum, while interactions of players between agents are antagonistic (e.g., zero-sum game). That is, the players in each agent minimize their costs, while the players from neighboring agents go against and maximize the costs. This approach finds the Nash control solutions for players within each agent and the worst control solutions for players in neighboring agents. The asymptotic stability under mild conditions and Nash-minmax solutions are guaranteed in the games. Offline policy iteration and online data-driven off-policy reinforcement learning algorithms are proposed, with proven convergence, to compute the Nash-minmax solutions.

We consider a practical information structure where each node has local information and some common information obtained from overhearing. We approach the problem via two steps: 1) we show that it is sufficient for the policy to be “greedy” and “exhaustive”; limiting the policy to this class reduces the problem to obtaining a queue switching policy at queue emptiness instants; and 2) by formulating the delay optimal scheduling as a partially observed Markov decision process, we show that the optimal switching rule is stochastic largest queue. Using this theory as the basis, we develop a practical, tunable, distributed scheduler, QZMAC, which is an extension to the existing ZMAC protocol. We implement QZMAC on standard off-the-shelf TelosB motes and also use simulations to compare QZMAC with the full-knowledge centralized scheduler and with ZMAC. We use our implementation to study the impact of false detection, while overhearing the common information, and the efficiency of QZMAC. Simulation results show that the mean delay with QZMAC is close to that of the full-knowledge centralized scheduler.},

However, as the excitation signals, artificial noises and their direction matrix are given in advance. Therefore, optimizing the noise direction matrix will lead to the re-excitation of CPSs, which is a significant challenge for the data-driven privacy enhancement. To solve this problem, a searchable virtual noise space is introduced to jointly design the controller gain and noise injection direction with the data-driven parameterization method. Then, the privacy of monitored data is optimally enhanced to prevent eavesdroppers from obtaining real data, while ensuring that the influence of the noises on the system performance remains below a specified level. Finally, the proposed method is applied to a vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) aircraft model, and the simulation results show that the privacy of monitored data is greatly enhanced under a slight loss of the control performance.},

This motivates us to propose a novel encrypted form for computations of the continuous-time controller and present rigorous stability analysis based on its virtual dynamics.

  abstract     = {In this article, we develop distributed computation algorithms for Nash equilibriums of linear–quadratic network games with proven differential privacy guarantees. In a network game with each player's payoff being a quadratic function, the dependencies of the decisions in the payoff function naturally encode a network structure governing the players' interpersonal influences. Such social influence structure and the individual marginal payoffs of the players indicate economic spillovers and individual preferences, and thus, they are subject to privacy concerns. For distributed computing of the Nash equilibrium, the players are interconnected by a public communication graph, over which dynamical states are shared among neighboring nodes. When the players' marginal payoffs are considered to be private knowledge, we propose a distributed randomized gradient descent algorithm, in which each player adds a Laplacian random noise to her marginal payoff in the recursive updates. It is proven that the algorithm can guarantee differential privacy and convergence in expectation to the Nash equilibrium of the network game at each player's state. Moreover, the mean-square error between the players' states and the Nash equilibrium is shown to be bounded by a constant related to the differential privacy level. Next, when both the players' marginal payoffs and the influence graph are private information, we propose two distributed algorithms by randomized communication and randomized projection, respectively, for privacy preservation. The differential privacy and convergence guarantees are also established for such algorithms.},

  abstract     = {In this article, we study the collective behavior of heterogeneous nonlinear systems, interconnected over generic directed graphs and in the scenario that, due to the nature of their interconnections, the agents self-organize in modules. These are subnetworks composed of agents that are densely connected with a strong coupling, while the modules themselves are sparsely interconnected. As we show, beyond certain coupling thresholds, the systems within each module synchronize rapidly with a weighted-average dynamical system that evolves more slowly than the individual systems. Then, the average dynamical systems corresponding to each and all the modules synchronize among themselves. Furthermore, we establish global asymptotic stability for the overall network under the conditions that the average dynamics admit the origin as a globally asymptotically stable equilibrium and each system be semipassive. Finally, we explore stabilization techniques that consist in controlling the average dynamics to make the origin globally asymptotically stable.},

Our design satisfies the so-called nontriviality property, a discrete-time version of the Zeno-free property, and enforces triggering events to be separated at least by two sampling periods. We propose a multirate event-based controller, in which trigger checking and control update are performed at different rates, which serves to capture the intersampling behavior. Two different architectures are proposed based on the lifting-based approach, where the original periodic system is isomorphically lifted to a higher order linear time-invariant one.

In order to capture the characteristics and interactions of the three phases, a group of coupled performance indexes is designed, based on which a backward strategy design mechanism is proposed, i.e., following the sequence of formation control $\rightarrow$ path planning $\rightarrow$ task allocation to obtain the optimal strategy of each phase. The proposed framework makes the strategies to be designed in a closed-loop form and the performance of each phase to be bidirectionally adjustable. It is rigorously proved that the designed strategies can achieve the desired performance of each phase, as well as the Gestalt Nash equilibrium of the integrated game.

  abstract     = {An optimal event-driven containment control problem is studied for partially unknown nonlinear multiagent systems with input constraints and state constraints. Its novelty lies in the optimization of the performance index while ensuring constraints handling abilities on states and inputs. First, an improved discounted cost function is constructed, and the state and input constraint information are encoded into the cost function by barrier functions and nonquadratic utility functions, respectively. Then, the approximate distributed optimal containment control policy is derived by an integral reinforcement learning (IRL)-based adaptive critic design, where the IRL technique can overcome the limitation of known drift dynamics in previous results. In critic neural networks learning, the weight tuning law is presented by virtue of the concurrent learning technique, which relaxes the persistence of excitation conditions by storing appropriate historical data. In order to reduce the amount of information transmitted through the controller-to-actuator channel, a containment error-dependent dynamic event-triggered mechanism is defined. Theoretical results indicate that signals in closed-loop systems driven by event-triggered optimal controllers are uniformly ultimately bounded, and Zeno behavior is avoided. Finally, the effectiveness of the developed method is illustrated by a simulation example on multiple single-link robot manipulators.},

Based on the nearest neighbor rule, a unified distributed nonlinear control scheme is proposed. With rigorous Lyapunov-based analysis, it is shown that under the proposed control scheme, all followers can converge toward the convex hull formed by each leader's trajectory and its symmetrical trajectory having the same amplitude but different sign in a finite time or fixed time if and only if the underlying weakly connected signed digraph contains at least one structurally balanced closed strong component. As a byproduct, necessary and sufficient criteria are established for single-integrator cooperative-antagonistic networks to achieve finite-time and fixed-time bipartite consensuses, interval bipartite consensus, and stability.

First, a novel output-based hybrid distributed observer is designed which can achieve distributed information estimation for various practical hybrid exosystems. Second, by incorporating a decentralized hybrid output feedback control law with the proposed hybrid distributed observer, a hybrid distributed output feedback control law is synthesized to solve the hybrid cooperative output regulation problem. In comparison with the existing works targeting purely continuous-time multiagent systems, the simplified forms for both the hybrid distributed observer and the hybrid output feedback control law proposed in this article exhibit prominent advantages from various aspects, such as robustness against intermittent communication links and the sampled measurement of system output for feedback.

In particular, the proposed control protocols are differentiable, namely, chattering-free, which do not comprise the conventional discontinuous absolute value and/or signum functions anymore. Therefore, the undesirable chattering problem is effectively overcome.

Inspired by applications where customers' demand can only be affected through posted prices and real-time two-way communication with customers is not available, we require an algorithm to generate “safe prices.” This means that at no iteration should the realized demand in response to the posted prices violate the safety constraints of the network. Thus, in contrast to existing distributed first-order methods, our algorithm, called safe pricing for NUM (SPNUM), is guaranteed to produce feasible primal iterates at all iterations. At the heart of the algorithm lie two key steps that must go hand in hand to guarantee safety and convergence: first, applying a projected gradient method on a shrunk feasible set to get the desired demand, and second, estimating the price response function of the users and determining the price so that the induced demand is close to the desired demand. We ensure safety by adjusting the shrinkage to account for the error between the induced demand and the desired demand. In addition, by gradually reducing the amount of shrinkage and the step size of the gradient method, we prove that the primal iterates produced by the SPNUM achieve a sublinear static regret of ${\mathcal O}(\log {(T)})$ after $T$ time steps.},

  abstract     = {This work addresses the consensus problem for first-order multiagent systems with fixed-time convergence rate and heterogeneous communication range constraints. A novel class of distributed fixed-time consensus control algorithms is proposed with connectivity preservation property over directed graphs for nominal agents. Then, the proposed protocol is modified to solve the fixed-time connectivity-preserving consensus for nonlinear and disturbed multiagent systems. The edge-based representation framework is utilized and two strict Lyapunov functions are constructed to show that the initial edges can be maintained under the proposed control protocols. Furthermore, the fixed-time consensus is achieved, where all of the states reach a common value within a finite time, which is upper bounded regardless of initial states. Consequently, the convergence time can be set in advance. Two numerical examples are performed to illustrate the proposed schemes.},

The control objective is to achieve similar formation transformations (translation, rotation, and scaling) while maintaining the desired formation shape. The desired formation shape is determined by a set of similarity constraints on the signed angle and the distance ratio of a pair of edges joining a common vertex. Instead of the error variables with respect to the angle or distance ratio usually used in traditional similarity-rigidity control methods, the relative position errors are obtained by the constant rigidity matrix. Once the position of each USV overlaps with the configuration of the target formation, the desired formation maneuver can be achieved. The proposed control strategy can be implemented in a local coordinate system and directed graphs without intervehicle communication. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy.},

The scenario is that sensors transmit innovations to remote estimators, and event-based schedulers are equipped to save energy. Unlike the existing powerful cyber-attacks, the inversion attack is proposed for attackers with very limited capabilities. We demonstrate that a malicious attacker can degrade system performance simply by directly injecting an inverter into the event scheduler without any system knowledge. The stealthiness of the inversion attack is quantified by two types of failure detectors. To mitigate the attack effect, we further construct an alternative estimator as a countermeasure, based on which a defense strategy is designed for systems at risk of inversion attacks.

We start from an analytical model for the trailing upwash behind a fixed-wing uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV), and we derive the optimal air speed for trailing UAVs to maximize their travel endurance. Next, we prove that simply flying at the optimal airspeed will never lead to emergent flocking behavior and propose a new decentralized “aneroid” behavior that yields emergent V formations. We encode these behaviors in a constraint-driven control algorithm that minimizes the locomotive power of each UAV. Finally, we prove that UAVs initialized in an approximate V or echelon formation will converge under our proposed control law, and we demonstrate that this emergence occurs in real time in simulation and in physical experiments with a fleet of Crazyflie quadrotors despite the noise and disturbances inherent in physical systems.},

On the defender's side, a robust detector is designed to detect malicious attacks utilizing zonotopes to handle bounded disturbances. A new recursive update method and a reduction operator are proposed to improve the accuracy and reduce the storage space of the detector. Unlike traditional parity-space-based detectors, it is proved that any attack that can completely bypass the robust detector must be bounded.

This selection determines total arrival rates in station queues, which are represented by a fluid state; departure rates are modeled under the assumption that clients have a given sojourn time in the system. The resulting differential equation system is analyzed with tools of optimization. We characterize the equilibrium as the solution to a specific convex program, which has connections to optimal transport problems, and also with road traffic theory. In particular, a price of anarchy appears with respect to a social planner's allocation. From a dynamical perspective, global convergence to equilibrium is established, with tools of Lagrange duality and Lyapunov theory. An extension of the model that makes customer demand elastic to observed delays is also presented, and analyzed with extensions of the optimization machinery. Simulations to illustrate the global behavior are presented, which also help validate the model beyond the fluid approximation.},

However, the existing results are difficult to ensure the positive minimum interevent times (MIETs) while achieving asymptotic convergence performance. Besides, the drawback that the controllers of the spacecraft suffer from chattering may exist, due to the transmitted discontinuous neighbors' states. To overcome the difficulty and drawback, two novel distributed adaptive control strategies are presented under event-triggered communication condition. Specifically, we first consider the attitude synchronization convergence. To estimate the final synchronization value of the attitude while avoiding the undesirable chattering phenomenon of the controllers, a distributed attitude filter with event-triggered state transmission is presented for each spacecraft, which can generate a continuous reference signal for each spacecraft. To ensure the positive MIETs, a novel triggering condition is designed, by resorting to a clock-like variable. Based on the attitude filter and triggering condition, a distributed adaptive attitude synchronization control scheme is presented. Then, we further generalize the design idea to consider the attitude synchronization tracking of a stationary leader, where a distributed event-triggered adaptive attitude tracking control scheme is proposed.

  abstract     = {This work studies a multiagent Markov decision process (MDP) that can undergo agent dropout and the computation of policies for the postdropout system based on control and sampling of the predropout system. The central planner's objective is to find an optimal policy that maximizes the value of the expected system given a priori knowledge of the agents' dropout probabilities. For MDPs with a certain transition independence and reward separability structure, we assume that removing agents from the system forms a new MDP comprised of the remaining agents with new state and action spaces, transition dynamics that marginalize the removed agents, and rewards that are independent of the removed agents. We first show that under these assumptions, the value of the expected postdropout system can be represented by a single MDP; this “robust MDP” eliminates the need to evaluate all $2^{N}$ realizations of the system, where $N$ denotes the number of agents. More significantly, in a model-free context, it is shown that the robust MDP value can be estimated with samples generated by the predropout system, meaning that robust policies can be found before dropout occurs. This fact is used to propose a policy importance sampling (IS) routine that performs policy evaluation for dropout scenarios while controlling the existing system with good predropout policies. The policy IS routine produces value estimates for both the robust MDP and specific postdropout system realizations and is justified with exponential confidence bounds. Finally, the utility of this approach is verified in simulation, showing how structural properties of agent dropout can help a controller find good postdropout policies before dropout occurs.},

The accurate convergence of the designed distributed algorithm is established, rather than the bounded convergence of the differential privacy-based algorithms.

To address this challenge, a distributed event-triggered observer is proposed for each agent to estimate the upper bound of the norm of the exosystem matrix, based on which all agents can obtain the same upper bound in finite time. In particular, two types of distributed event-triggered observers are designed to estimate the exosystem matrix and the exosystem state. Meanwhile, with a clock-like variable being incorporated into the event-triggered mechanism, the existence of a positive minimum interevent time can be guaranteed for each agent.

The second algorithm operates over heterogeneous networks, i.e., nodes have varying processing delays and communicate in an asynchronous fashion. Our algorithms exhibit efficient communication, finite-time convergence, and operation termination after convergence, making them suitable for resource-constrained environments. We also present topological conditions under which our algorithms enable privacy preservation.

  abstract     = {We propose an operating envelopes (OEs) aware energy community market mechanism that dynamically charges/rewards its members based on two-part pricing. The OEs are imposed exogenously by a regulated distribution system operator (DSO) on the energy community's revenue meter and are subject to a generalized net energy metering tariff design. By formulating the interaction of the community operator and its members as a Stackelberg game, we show that the proposed two-part pricing achieves a Nash equilibrium and maximizes the community's social welfare in a decentralized fashion while ensuring that the community's operation abides by the OEs. The market mechanism conforms with the cost-causation principle and guarantees community members a surplus level no less than their maximum surplus when they autonomously face the DSO. The dynamic and uniform community price is a monotonically decreasing function of the community's aggregate renewable generation. We also analyze the impact of exogenous parameters, such as NEM rates and OEs, on the value of joining the community. Lastly, through numerical studies, we showcase the community's welfare and pricing, and compare its members' surplus to customers under the DSO's regime.},

To quantify the patrolling performance of the robot team, we first introduce a novel performance measure based on the mean first hitting time. We then formulate optimization problems for unweighted complete graphs and transcribe it to the well-known maximum $k$-cut problem. To reduce the computational complexity, we identify a special solution structure of the optimization problem, and we develop an efficient heuristic descent-based algorithm by taking advantage of this special property of the optimal solution. We show that our algorithm converges in a finite number of steps and finds a suboptimal solution that preserves the special solution structure and satisfies a suboptimality bound. We validate our findings through numerical experiments and show the clear advantages of our partition-based strategy.},

In the extended looped functional, some integral state vectors are first utilized to achieve the goal of enlarging the sampling interval upper bound. And, to guarantee the flexibility of the controller, the sampling fluctuation is taken into account in the design procedure. Then, on the basis of free-matrix-based inequalities, several sufficient consensus criteria with less conservativeness are obtained, which are presented as linear matrix inequalities.

In contrast to previous studies, our primary focus lies in addressing the following question: When we lack prior knowledge about disturbances, what synchronization performance can we achieve compared to a hindsight-based approach? To tackle this challenge, we introduce the concept of regret as a metric to model and quantify our problem, independent of any assumptions regarding disturbances. We define regret as the measure of deviation from an ideal synchronization outcome. Furthermore, we prove that the problem inherently possesses a lower bound of regret, which remains unaffected by disturbances. By appropriately setting the regret requirement, we can transform the problem into an $\mathcal {H}_\infty$ optimal control problem equivalently, which allows us to determine the corresponding synchronization strategy. Through simulations, we validate the effectiveness of our method, demonstrating its superiority over existing approaches.},

In the considered setting, two groups are formed and reach intergroup bipartite consensus or disagreement. On the other hand, the end-effectors achieve intragroup formation. To ensure that the end-effectors do not collide, we design gradient-based control laws using barrier-Lyapunov functions. In addition, the proposed controller ensures that the closed-loop system is robust to external disturbances. The latter are assumed to be generated by an exosystem, so they are effectively rejected by an internal-model-based compensator.

A problem with a moderate size may entail forming and then solving a few hundreds of such linear equations. Thus, the computational cost of solving such a problem can be formidable. In this article, we first improve the existing algorithm by decoupling each of these linear equations into two lower dimensional linear equations. The first one contains $nq$ unknown variables, and the second one contains $\frac{n (n+1)}{2} + mn$ unknown variables. Thus, this improved algorithm reduces a linear equation with $\frac{n (n+1)}{2} + (m+q)n$ unknown variables to a linear equation with $nq$ unknown variables and a linear equation with $\frac{n (n+1)}{2} + mn$ unknown variables. As a result, not only the computational cost of the problem is drastically reduced but also the solvability conditions for these equations are significantly weakened. Moreover, we also apply this improved algorithm to the adaptive cooperative optimal output regulation of linear multiagent unknown systems and reduce the computational cost of the problem more saliently.},

Besides, the exposure of private DER data, such as energy generation and consumption profiles, is leading to prevalent customer privacy breaches. Despite the importance, research on privacy-preserving DER control in a fully scalable manner is still lacking. To fill this gap, a hierarchical DER aggregation and control framework is first developed to achieve scalability over a large DER population size. Second, a novel privacy-preserving optimization algorithm is proposed for the developed DER aggregation and control framework based on the secret sharing technique. Finally, privacy preservation guarantees of the developed algorithm are provided against honest-but-curious adversaries and external eavesdroppers. Simulations on a 13-bus test feeder demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in preserving private DER data within power distribution networks.},

Defense resources against the adversary are allocated by a defender on several selected vertices. First, the objectives of the adversary and the defender with uncertain targets are formulated in a probabilistic manner, resulting in an expected worst-case impact of stealthy attacks. Next, we provide a graph-theoretic necessary and sufficient condition under which the cost for the defender and the expected worst-case impact of stealthy attacks are bounded. This condition enables the defender to restrict the admissible actions to dominating sets of the graph representing the network. Then, the security allocation problem is solved through a Stackelberg game-theoretic framework. Finally, the obtained results are validated through a numerical example of a 50-vertex networked control system.},

The objective is to minimize the sum of all local functions while achieving consensus among the local states through information exchange with neighboring agents. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel distributed proximal alternating direction multiplier method (ADMM). By introducing the proximal operator of the nonsmooth term, linearizing the smooth term, and incorporating an additional proximal term, the ADMM subproblem can be solved more efficiently. One key advantage of the proposed algorithm is that it allows each agent to select parameters without being constrained by the network topology. In some instances, the algorithm can be transformed into some classical optimization algorithms. The algorithm is further extended to an asynchronous version by introducing randomized block coordinate. We further analyze the convergence of the proposed asynchronous algorithm and establish the sublinear convergence rate under synchronous conditions.

We then focus on the special case of rank-1 interaction matrices, modeling subpopulations of homogeneously mixing individuals with different activity rates, susceptibility to the disease, and infectivity levels. For this special case, we find $n$ invariants of motion and provide an explicit expression for the limit equilibrium point. We also determine necessary and sufficient conditions for stability of the equilibrium points. We then establish an upper bound on the number of changes of monotonicity of the infection curve at the single node level and provide sufficient conditions for its multimodality.

Furthermore, data are vulnerable to cyberattacks before being transmitted to the controller due to the open communication architecture, in which adversaries are assumed to inject false data that are capable of affecting data security. To effectively mitigate unnecessary utilization, we develop a novel dynamic event-based protocol involving dynamic threshold parameter and system modes in the feedback channel. Our methodology tackles the vulnerability of data to cyberattacks in open communication architectures, and the proposed protocol provides a feasible security solution for the hidden Markov jump systems.

The local control law in each agent uses only local relative positions defined in a local coordinate frame, without the need to measure the orientation of its neighbors nor to exchange local state information with the neighbors. Using transversally exponential stability analysis, we establish the local exponential convergence of the closed-loop systems to the desired formation shape and consensus group motion.

  abstract     = {It is still an open problem to output feedback stabilization with input quantizations and deception attacks for nonlinear cyber-physical systems subject to mismatched parametric uncertainties via backstepping design. This is because: first, the system contains mismatched uncertainties; second the output is corrupted by an additional attack signal, making the conventional recursive control design strategy using traditional error surfaces unsuitable; and third, since only the compromised output signal is available, the impacts of nonlinear items related to unknown attack weights become difficult to be explicitly addressed in the existing available output feedback control results. In this article, we present a solution to circumvent these obstacles by constructing a set of new $K$-filters using compromised output only, which, together with a coordinate transformation involving the attacked output and filter variables, allow a new form of state-observer-based resilient adaptive control scheme to be developed. Meanwhile, a novel compensation term is incorporated into the real controller to eliminate the effect of quantization on the system stability. It is shown that, by establishing Lyapunov functions appropriately, the original output of the system converges to zero, and all the signals in the closed-loop system are globally uniformly bounded. A practice example is provided to confirm the effectiveness of the proposed strategy.},

With the help of the constructed impulse-time-delayed Lyapunov functional, a new sufficient condition is developed to guarantee the exponential stability of the addressed system.

The inclusion of control variation in the cost function presents significant challenges in both the design of the corresponding distributed optimal control and the convergence analysis of the resulting closed-loop system. By properly designing the network cost, it is shown that the optimal control law always exists, and the explicit expression of the optimal control gain is given.

Using disturbance observer, event-triggered containment control under DoS attacks and disturbance is guaranteed. It is assumed that separate attacks occurred on the control channels and the communication channels. Moreover, when effective DoS attacks occur, it becomes impossible to communicate data through a communication network, and if the DoS attack is ineffective, the topology graph has a united directed spanning tree. Our method does not require the continuous sharing of state information between neighboring agents; rather, at event times, information is sent to reduce the consumption of communication resources. Using state estimators, trigger times are determined according to the estimator's data without any continuous information of the neighbor's state. Using accurate analysis of the time and frequency of DoS attacks, the resilient conditions are obtained, and then, exponential stability of containment behavior under asynchronous attacks is proved by Lyapunov analysis. Moreover, the obtained strictly positive minimal interevent time for agents prevents Zeno behavior. Finally, the performance of the proposed method is shown by simulation.},

The reference generator is based on the estimation of the left eigenvector of the Laplacian matrix and is suitable for unbalanced digraphs. Moreover, the backstepping design technique is efficiently combined with the distributed optimization scheme, leading to a systematic solution for the high-order nonlinear MAS. It is proven that all the outputs of the MAS exponentially converge to the optimal solution of the resource allocation problem under the proposed control.

A distinguishing feature of the proposed model is the inclusion of an opinion-dependent resource-penalty term in the utilities, which limits the agents from holding opinions of large magnitude. This model is applicable in scenarios where the opinions pertain to the usage of resources, such as money, time, computational resources, etc. Each agent myopically seeks to maximize its utility by revising its opinion in the gradient ascent direction of its utility function, thus leading to the proposed opinion dynamics. We show that for any arbitrary social influence network, opinions are ultimately bounded. For networks with weak antagonistic relations, we show that there exists a globally exponentially stable equilibrium using contraction theory. We establish conditions for the existence of consensus equilibrium and analyze the relative dominance of the agents at consensus. We also conduct a game-theoretic analysis of the underlying opinion formation game, including on Nash equilibria and on prices of anarchy in terms of satisfaction ratios. In addition, we also investigate the oscillatory behavior of opinions in a two-agent scenario. Finally, simulations illustrate our findings.},
