  abstract     = {This article presents a novel design of a distributed adaptive observer for distributed state estimation of continuous-time uncertain linear time-invariant systems over directed networks. In contrast to existing works, the observed system is subject to uncertainties and possibly jointly observable. The distributed estimation of such systems allows practical applications in challenging problems subject to sparse arrangement of sensors and model uncertainties. A class of fully distributed nonlinear adaptive observers is proposed to address these challenges. In particular, we introduce an observability decomposition method to decompose both the state and the unknown parameters of the observed system into an observable and an unobservable component. This decomposition circumvents the impact of the unknown parameters on existing observability decomposition methods. Two nonlinear mappings are designed to achieve the reconstruction of the system state and the unknown system parameters. A parametric representation of the output estimation error is established to convert the unknown parameter estimation problem of the observable subsystem into an unknown parameter identification problem using a linear regression equation. Using a Lyapunov stability analysis, it is shown that the system parameter can be recovered by the nonlinear mappings, while the distributed state estimation problem is solved.},

This method employs the recent adaptive control approach with batch least-squares identification (BaLSI, pronounced “ballsy”) that completes perfect parameter identification in finite time and offers a previously unforeseen advantage in safe control design with aCBF, which we elucidate in this article. Since the true challenge is exhibited for CBF of a high relative degree, we undertake a control design in this article for a class of systems that possess a particularly extreme relative degree: $2\times 2$ hyperbolic PDEs sandwiched by a strict-feedback nonlinear ODE and a linear ODE, where the unknown coefficients are associated with the PDE in-domain coupling terms and with the input signal of the distal ODE. The designed output-positive adaptive controller guarantees the positivity of the output signal that is the furthermost state from the control input as well as the exponential regulation of the overall plant state to zero. The effectiveness of the proposed method is illustrated by numerical simulation.},

This note investigates online trajectory generation and control for this system, focusing on the asymptotic stabilization of both the actuated UAV's positions and the unactuated payload's swings. First, we introduce a virtual nonholonomic constraint (VNHC)-based approach to generate smooth UAV trajectories. This approach simplifies the design by operating on a lower dimensional system, thereby bypassing the complexities of the original high-dimensional underactuated system. Second, a continuous fixed-time tracking controller is designed to drive the system dynamics onto the VNHC and to ensure its invariance. The rigorous asymptotic stability of the closed-loop system is analyzed using Lyapunov techniques and Barbalat's lemma. Numerical and experimental studies are conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed approach.},

This significantly weakens the classic assumptions used in the literature. To design an optimal adaptive control, a weighted least squares algorithm is modified by using random regularization method, which can ensure uniform stabilizability and uniform detectability of the family of estimated models. At the same time, a diminishing excitation is incorporated into the design of the proposed adaptive control to guarantee strong consistency of the desired components of the estimates. Finally, although some components of the estimates may not converge to the true values, it is still demonstrated that a certainty equivalence control with diminishing excitation remains optimal for an ergodic quadratic cost function.},

This article investigates the delayed pinning control scheme for lag synchronization and lag quasi-synchronization of dynamical networks. Two pinning control schemes with uniform delay and nonuniform delays are proposed, which are more practical than the widely used delay-free pinning control scheme. For the two pinning control schemes, criteria for lag synchronization and lag quasi-synchronization of dynamical networks are derived by proposing a system of functional differential inequalities, and in the meantime, an upper bound of tolerable delays that allows synchronization is given. In particular, the ultimate bound of the synchronization error is estimated for lag quasi-synchronization. Finally, the theoretical results are demonstrated by two numerical examples.},

By incorporating three nonlinear modulating (trimming) functions to “recalibrate” the generalized tracking error, a nonlinear PID control framework is constructed that possesses several notable features. First, the user-assignable parameters in the modulating functions allow the resultant control strategy to analytically bridge fixed gain linear PID control with nonlinear PID control, covering both traditional fixed-gain and time-varying gain PID control as special cases. Second, the inherently nonlinear nature of the proposed control methodology effectively counteracts system nonlinearities, thereby enhancing the overall performance of the control scheme. Third, unlike conventional PID control that often involves integration saturation, the proposed control method obliterates such “windup” phenomenon by utilizing the integral trimming function that remains bounded or self-vanishes. Fourth, eliminating the necessity for a “trial-and-error” process for PID gain determination, the proposed control not only ensures asymptotic tracking but also guarantees a bounded comprehensive performance index in the presence of modeling uncertainties and external disturbances. The effectiveness and benefits of the proposed method are also confirmed by numerical simulations.},

  abstract     = {Passivity-based approaches have been suggested as a solution to the problem of decentralized control design in many multiagent network control problems as stability can often be determined independently of the network topology. However, it is not clear if these controllers are optimal at a network level due to their inherently local formulation, with designers often relying on heuristics to achieve desired global performance. On the other hand, solving for an optimal controller is not guaranteed to produce a decentralized optimal policy that leads to a passive network with a plug-and-play operation. In this article, we address these dual problems by showing that when appropriate decentralized conditions are satisfied, passive network systems have an inverse optimal control interpretation, i.e., the corresponding decentralized controllers are solutions to a network-wide optimal control problem. These conditions are then formulated into a set of linear matrix inequalities for the case of linear systems, which can be used for control synthesis for such systems. The proposed approach is demonstrated through case studies from distributed optimization and the control of dc microgrids.},

  abstract     = {This article proposes an online cross-layered defense strategy for multichannel systems with switched dynamics under DoS attacks. The enabling condition of a channel under attacks is formulated with respect to attack flow and channel bandwidth, then a new networked control system model bridging the gap between system dynamics and network deployment is built. Based on this, the cross-layered defense strategy is proposed. It jointly optimizes the controller gain and bandwidth allocation of channels according to the real-time attack flow and system dynamics, by solving a mixed-integer semidefinite programming online. A smart enumeration algorithm for nonconvex bilevel optimization is proposed to analyze the stability under the strategy. Numerical examples are given to illustrate the high resilience from the cross-layered feature.},

In particular, we assume that the controlled plant admits a global asymptotic stable equilibrium corresponding to each fixed reference input and consider a modified gradient-flow optimizer augmented with a nonlinear perturbation function. With the output map of the controlled plant satisfying a linear growth condition, this article proves the existence of a perturbation function such that the resulting feedback optimization system is globally asymptotically stable at the desired equilibrium. The proof is based on the seamless integration of tools from the singular perturbation theory, input-to-state stability, and the nonlinear small-gain theorem. The possibility of extending the proposed approach to other optimizers is also discussed. Three numerical examples are employed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

A new representation of saturation map is presented by equality with bounded uncertain diagonal matrix and reduces conservatism. Further, based on spherical polar coordinate quantizer, the quantization error is converted to sector-bound uncertainty. Thus, the considered system is modeled as uncertain system and the considered problems are converted into the equivalent solvable problems for uncertain system and the larger stability region is obtained. We first propose the quantization methods with finite data rate for asymptotic stability under the system input saturation for two cases: first state quantization case and second input quantization case. In input quantization case, an augmented vector is constructed and quantized to obtain the estimate of the system input. We further propose the quantization method for the case of quantizations and saturations of the system input and state, which results in nested saturation and nested quantization. In this case, although the quantizer for the sensor output and the quantizer for the controller output can not communicate with each other, by the proposed quantization method, they coordinate with each other to guarantee the asymptotic stability of the systems.},

  abstract     = {Social pressure is a key factor affecting the evolution of opinions on networks in many types of settings, pushing people to conform to their neighbors’ opinions. To study this, the interacting Pólya urn model was introduced by Jadbabaie et al., 2023, in which each agent has two kinds of opinion: inherent beliefs, which are hidden from the other agents and fixed; and declared opinions, which are randomly sampled at each step from a distribution which depends on the agent’s inherent belief and her neighbors’ past declared opinions (the social pressure component), and which is then communicated to her neighbors. Each agent also has a bias parameter denoting her level of resistance to social pressure. At every step, each agent updates her declared opinion (simultaneously with all other agents) according to her neighbors’ aggregate past declared opinions, her inherent belief, and her bias parameter. We study the asymptotic behavior of this opinion dynamics model and show that the agents’ declaration probabilities approach a set of equilibrium points of the expected dynamics using Lyapunov theory and stochastic approximation techniques. We also derive necessary and sufficient conditions for the agents to approach consensus on their declared opinions. Our work provides further insight into the difficulty of inferring the inherent beliefs of agents when they are under social pressure.},

We develop a general framework for reconstructing errors by processing nonlinear measurements obtained across the sensor network, based on the assumptions that the errors are sparse (i.e., only a fraction of the agents have errors) and that the sensor network is sparsely connected. It is shown that this twofold sparsity of the EIC problem can be leveraged using a combination of block-sparse optimization and the alternating direction method of multipliers, yielding a novel distributed EIC algorithm which can be interpreted as a multiagent residual testing mechanism. The effectiveness of the proposed distributed EIC approach is demonstrated by considering a numerical example of sensor network localization, in which the distances between connected agents are used to uniquely identify and correct the agents with erroneous position estimates without relying on anchors (i.e., agents that are assumed to be error-free).},

The technique consists of using data sampled from the concrete system to find a lower dimensional subspace of its state space (which we call the active subspace), and constructing an abstraction candidate using Gaussian process (GP) regression. We derive sufficient conditions under which the GP candidate is shown to be the abstraction of the original system while quantifying the error bound between the output of the abstraction and that of the concrete system.

The time series generated by a subset of the nodes in this new larger network are equivalent to the time series generated by the original network. In this new larger network, based on the notion of $d$-separation, we formulate sufficient graphical conditions to select a set of predictor inputs.

However, such leader-following behavior would be impossible with existing adaptive consensus methods, e.g., based on model reference adaptive control, since the stability of the reference dynamics is required. To fill this gap, we propose a novel model reference adaptive stabilizing control framework for leader-following consensus of multiagent systems with unknown and heterogeneous dynamics. Differently from several approaches in the leader-following consensus literature, the proposed framework is free of any extra distributed observer layer for the leader's signal, as the reconstruction of such signals is intrinsic in the adaptive laws. Besides, the framework does not require Hurwitz or neutral stability of the leader and generalizes existing acyclic requirements on the communication graph among the follower. Starting from any weakly connected communication digraph, the proposed method allows us to derive a lower bound, useful from the network design point of view, for the minimum number of followers that should be pinned by the leader.},

Assuming the global cost function satisfies the Polyak–Łojasiewicz condition, which does not require the global cost function to be convex and the global minimizer is not necessarily unique, we show that our proposed algorithms linearly converge to a global optimal point. Moreover, we show that a low data rate is sufficient to guarantee linear convergence when the algorithm parameters are properly chosen. The theoretical results are illustrated by numerical examples.},

  abstract     = {In its standard formulation, the control barrier function (CBF) method scales poorly as the order of the system dynamics increases. On the one hand, the need of recursively extending the control with higher-order terms along the backstepping procedure inevitably results in dynamically increasing complexity. On the other hand, the lack of an explicit form of the CBF leads to implicit formulations of the safety conditions, to be solved numerically via quadratic programming. These high complexity and poor scalability issues further amplify in multiagent systems. This work proposes a low-complexity framework for safe control of higher order multiagent systems within the philosophy of funnel control. Different from the state-of-the-art, safety is expressed in terms of a CBF that is explicitly constructed from funnel functions, thus providing a solution to the well-known problem of lack of systematic methods for constructing a CBF. Low complexity comes from the fact that the control does not involve complex dynamical extensions during the backstepping procedure. Notably, the proposed CBF is shown to automatically satisfy by design the safety conditions, without resorting to any quadratic programming. Lyapunov analysis shows that the design allows to consider individual terms for stability and safety, so as to accomplish these tasks in a seamless integrated fashion. Simulation studies and comparisons with the state-of-the-art further demonstrate the method.},

To that end, we model the market clearing process as a dynamical system, called market dynamics, which is temporally coupled with the grid frequency dynamics and is thus required to guarantee system-wide stability while meeting operational constraints. We characterize participants as price-takers who rationally update their bids to maximize their utility in response to real-time schedules of prices and dispatch. For two common bidding mechanisms, based on quantity and price, we identify a notion of alignment between participants’ behavior and a grid planner’s goals, leading to a saddle-based design of market dynamics that guarantees convergence to an operating point achieving economic efficiency and incentive compatibility subject to all operational constraints. We further explore cases where this alignment property does not hold and observe that misaligned participants’ bidding can destabilize the closed-loop system. We thus design a regularized version of market dynamics that recovers all the desirable stability and steady-state performance guarantees. Numerical tests validate our results on the IEEE 39-bus system.},

In the literature, this problem has been typically tackled by means of open-loop strategies, whose applicability is limited by the need of accurate a priori information on the game and a lack of robustness to uncertainty and noise. Here, we overcome these limitations by adopting a closed-loop approach using an adaptive-gain control scheme within a replicator equation—a nonlinear ordinary differential equation that models the evolution of the collective behavior of the population. For most classes of 2-action matrix games, we establish sufficient conditions to design a controller that guarantees convergence of the replicator equation to the desired equilibrium, requiring limited a priori information on the game. Numerical simulations corroborate and expand our theoretical findings.},

This relationship, however, remains underinvestigated in the existing studies. To address this gap, the formation control problem of classical second-order multiagent systems with bounded process noises was considered taking into account the channel capacity. More specifically, the model of communication links between agents is first established, based on a new concept—guaranteed communication region, which characterizes all possible locations for successful message decoding in the presence of control-system uncertainty. Furthermore, we rigorously prove that the guaranteed communication region does not unboundedly increase with the transmission time, which indicates an important tradeoff between the guaranteed communication region and the data rate. The fundamental limits of data rate for any desired accuracy are also obtained. Finally, an integrated design to achieve the desired formation accuracy is proposed, where an estimation-based controller and transmit power control strategy are developed.},

The proposed algorithms are based on the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM). ADMM is a powerful tool for solving a wide class of constrained optimization problems. There are two main challenges when applying ADMM: Its performance depends greatly on the efficiency of solving the suboptimization problems associated with the ADMM at each iteration; it is not trivial to find the correct penalty parameters. For the first challenge, we provide a way to reformulate the original QCQP problem into a form such that there exist analytical solutions for the suboptimization problems. Hence, the computational cost per iteration is low. For the second challenge, we provide two procedures to compute systematically the penalty parameters. In the first procedure, a closed-form expression for the optimal constant scalar parameter is derived in terms of the matrix condition number. In the second one, the penalty parameters are adaptively tuned to achieve fast convergence. The results are validated via numerical simulations.},

We derive the difference expressions among these quantities and establish the corresponding one-step relations. These relations reveal how performance deteriorates when noise covariances are misspecified, and demonstrate how to evaluate the estimation error covariance using the available nominal filter parameter. We particularly highlight the effect of the information fusion step number on these relations. Furthermore, recursive relations are introduced by extending the results of the one-step relations. Subsequently, we demonstrate the convergence of these quantities under the collective observability condition and show that the convergence condition of the nominal filter parameter can guarantee the convergence of the estimation error covariance. In addition, we provide bounds on the estimation error covariance under misspecified noise covariances by utilizing the Frobenius norms of the noise covariance deviations and the trace of the nominal filter parameter. Finally, the effectiveness of the theoretical results is verified through numerical simulations.},

Specifically, a system is observed by a set of (local) observation sites (OSs) which occasionally send their recorded sequences of observations to the coordinator that is in charge of estimating the system state. The malfunctions and attacks, referred to as errors in this article, include symbol deletions, insertions and replacements, each of which bears a positive cost. Two types of errors, global errors and local errors, are proposed to describe the impact of errors on decentralized information processing. Global errors occur when all OSs record the same error, while local errors occur when different OSs record different errors. Distinguishing these types of errors is important for a proper design of decentralized information processing (so as to be more resilient and better equipped to handle attacks and failures). For each type of error, we propose two methods to efficiently perform state estimation: one based on appropriately modifying the original system and the other based on inferring the matching behavior of the original system. For each method, we adopt an estimation-by-release methodology to design an algorithm for constructing a corresponding synchronizer for state estimation.},

If all of the parameters of a model can be recovered from data, then the model is said to be identifiable. However, in many models, there are parameters that can take on an infinite number of values but yield the same input–output data. In this case, those parameters and the model are called unidentifiable. The question is then what to do with an unidentifiable model. One can try to add more input–output data or decrease the number of unknown parameters, if experimentally feasible, or try to find a reparameterization to make the model identifiable. In this article, we take the latter approach. While existing approaches to find identifiable reparameterizations were limited to scaling reparameterizations or were not guaranteed to find a globally identifiable reparameterization even if it exists, we significantly broaden the class of models for which we can find a globally identifiable model with the same input–output behavior as the original one. We also prove that, for linear models, a globally identifiable reparameterization always exists and shows that, for a certain class of linear compartmental models, with and without inputs, an explicit reparameterization formula exists. We illustrate our method on several examples and provide detailed analysis in the Supplementary Material on github.},

In this article, we propose a lifting approach to map observable data into an infinite-dimensional function space, which generates a flow governed by the proposed Zubov–Koopman operators. By learning a Zubov–Koopman operator over a fixed time interval, we can indirectly approximate the solution to Zubov's equation by iteratively applying the learned operator on certain functions. We also demonstrate that a transformation of such an approximator can be readily utilized as a near-maximal Lyapunov function. We approach our goal through a comprehensive investigation of the regularities of Zubov–Koopman operators and their associated quantities. Based on these findings, we present an algorithm for learning Zubov–Koopman operators that exhibit strong convergence to the true operator. We show that this approach reduces the amount of required data and can yield desirable estimation results, as demonstrated through numerical examples.},

The considered systems have sensors and actuators that are susceptible to unknown or adversarial inputs. To solve this problem, we first identify conditions that allow agents to obtain nonlinear bounded-error equations characterizing the input. Then, we propose a distributed interval-valued observer that is guaranteed to contain the disturbance and system states. To do this, we first detail a gain design procedure that uses global problem data to minimize an upper bound on the signal norm of the observer error. We then propose a gain design approach that does not require global information, using only values that are local to each agent. The second method improves on the computational tractability of the first, at the expense of some added conservatism. Further, we discuss some possible ways of extending the results to a broader class of systems. We conclude by demonstrating our observer on two examples. The first is a unicycle system, for which we apply the first gain design method. The second is a 145-bus power system, which showcases the benefits of the second method, due to the first approach being intractable for systems with high dimensional state spaces.},

  abstract     = {This article is devoted to classification of stochastic systems given by stochastic differential equations in continuous time. We develop two novel approaches. The first one is based on the use of a deep neural network (NN), whereas the second one uses hypothesis test-based methods. The idea of deep learning method focuses on treating the given stochastic system models by generating Monte Carlo sample paths. These samples are used to train a deep neutral network. A least square error is used as the loss function for network training. Then, the resulting weights are applied to out of sample Monte Carlo paths for testing. The underlying problem is then converted to a stochastic optimization task. Recursive stochastic algorithms are developed; convergence of the algorithm and rate of convergence are fully analyzed. Such deep NN approach compares favorably to the hypothesis test approaches. Then mean reversion models are studied to show the adaptiveness and power of our deep NN method. An advantage of the deep NN approach is real data can be used directly to train the deep NN. Therefore, model calibration can be bypassed all together.},

We develop the nonnegative supermartingale inequality of the estimation error, and prove that the estimations of all nodes converge to the unknown true parameter vector almost surely if the algorithm gains, graphs and regression matrices jointly satisfy the sample path spatio-temporal persistence of excitation condition. Especially, this condition holds by choosing appropriate algorithm gains if the graphs are uniformly conditionally jointly connected and conditionally balanced, and the regression models of all nodes are uniformly conditionally spatio-temporally jointly observable, under which the algorithm converges in mean square and almost surely.

At each stage of these interactions, agents use their decision-making model to revise their strategy selections based on payoffs determined by an underlying game. Their goal is to learn the strategies that correspond to the Nash equilibrium of the game. However, when games are subject to time delays, conventional decision-making models from the population game literature may result in oscillations in the strategy revision process or convergence to an equilibrium other than the Nash. To address this problem, we propose the Kullback–Leibler Divergence Regularized Learning (KLD-RL) model, along with an algorithm that iteratively updates the model's regularization parameter across a network of communicating agents. Using passivity-based convergence analysis techniques, we show that the KLD-RL model achieves convergence to the Nash equilibrium without oscillations, even for a class of population games that are subject to time delays. We demonstrate our main results numerically on a two-population congestion game and a two-population zero-sum game.},

The objective is to develop distributed optimization algorithms for a set of heterogeneous linear agents over a directed communication network, which will drive the decision variables of the agents to the optimal state with optimal system performance. First, a new distributed optimal coordination algorithm is developed, comprising an output regulation tracking controller and a surplus-based optimal policy generator. This is achieved by utilizing the output regulation technique and surplus-based consensus method. Second, a projected distributed optimal coordination algorithm is designed to address the distributed constrained optimal coordination problem, where the decision variables of the agents are constrained by local feasible set constraints and network resource constraints. In comparison to previous distributed optimal coordination studies, the agent dynamics and communication framework have been significantly expanded, and this represents the first investigation of the distributed constrained optimal coordination problem for heterogeneous linear systems over weight-unbalanced directed communication networks. Finally, the practical applications of multiple rotary-wing air vehicle systems and battery energy storage systems are presented, thereby demonstrating the efficacy of the proposed distributed optimal coordination and distributed constrained optimal coordination algorithms in a real-world context.},

The proposed method aims to enhance a given suboptimal controller, leveraging data to achieve a nearly optimal solution for the infinite horizon problem. The method is built on two techniques. First, we estimate the expected values of the convex costs using a computationally tractable approximation, achieved by sampling across the space of disturbances. Second, we implement a data-driven approach to approximate the optimal value function and its corresponding domain through systematic exploration of the system's state space. These estimates are subsequently used to calculate the terminal cost and terminal set within the proposed MPC. We prove recursive feasibility, robust constraint satisfaction, and convergence in probability to the target set. Furthermore, we prove that the estimated value function converges to the optimal value function in a local region. The effectiveness of the proposed MPC is illustrated with detailed numerical simulations and comparisons with a value iteration method and a learning MPC that minimizes a certainty equivalent cost.},

We consider the problem of enforcing privacy and utility with both obfuscation (altering communications to mislead eavesdroppers) and control (restricting system behavior to avoid information leakage). We present a formulation of this problem that models components of the networked system as interconnected reactive processes. Tools from distributed reactive synthesis are then used to automatically design obfuscators and controllers, which coordinate to enforce requirements. In particular, we develop formal specifications capturing privacy using the information flow property of opacity and utility ensuring availability of information or imposing constraints on the closed-loop system. This synthesis approach is applicable to a large class of network architectures, which we demonstrate on three representative problems over a building access control system.},

  abstract     = {This article presents a robust data-driven predictive control (RDPC) framework for linear time-invariant (LTI) systems affected by bounded disturbances and measurement noise. Unlike traditional model-based approaches, the proposed method relies solely on input-state-output (ISO) data without requiring prior system identification. Given that multiple systems can be consistent with the collected data due to disturbances and noise, a set of all possible systems using quadratic matrix inequalities is constructed. The RDPC scheme is then formulated as an optimization problem that minimizes an upper bound on the control objective while ensuring robust constraint satisfaction for all systems in the set. Unlike the existing robust data-driven model predictive control methods based on behavioral system theory, the proposed method does not require the precollected data to satisfy the persistently exciting condition of a sufficiently high order. It only needs the stabilizability of the LTI system to be controlled. The proposed approach is further extended for systems where the state is unmeasurable. By reformulating the problem using an autoregressive exogenous model, a dynamic output feedback controller that leverages input–output data directly is designed. The effectiveness of the proposed methods is validated through a case study on an unstable batch reactor, demonstrating comparable performance to model-based robust MPC and data-driven MPC approaches while reducing conservatism and computational complexity.},

Taking advantage of the symmetry in the game structure, the identifiability of the underlying game model is established and the well-posedness of the inverse game problem is guaranteed. The identification problem is solved by a least squares program that admits a unique global minimum at the true value of the unknown parameter. To address the mixed-integer constraints, an efficient subdifferential algorithm is designed by incorporating the linear sum assignment substructures. In addition, robust estimators are further designed in the stochastic setup, whose statistical consistency can be guaranteed in the presence of noisy observations.

We conclude with a simulation study on representative real-world networks and present insights. When all the nodes' opinions are observable, we show that our learning algorithm deduces the exact optimal strategy in very few intervals.

Moreover, the performance analysis of the modified algorithms is also provided under rather mild conditions, including the steady-state value of the estimation error covariance.

  abstract     = {A novel robust nonlinear model predictive control strategy is proposed for systems with nonlinear dynamics and convex state and control constraints. Using a sequential convex approximation approach and a difference of convex functions representation, the scheme constructs tubes that contain predicted model trajectories, accounting for approximation errors and disturbances, and guaranteeing constraint satisfaction. An optimal control problem is solved as a sequence of convex programs. We develop the scheme initially in the absence of external disturbances and show that the proposed nominal approach is nonconservative, with the solutions of successive convex programs converging to a locally optimal solution for the original optimal control problem. We extend the approach to the case of additive disturbances using a novel strategy for selecting linearization points. As a result, we formulate a robust receding horizon strategy with guarantees of recursive feasibility and closed-loop stability.},

  abstract     = {This article is concerned with game-based distributed least-distance formation tracking with a moving target. More specifically, the agents aim to form a desired shape while enclosing a moving target with a least overall distance. Different from most of the existing results on formation tracking, the key challenge for least-distance formation tracking under consideration is that the distances between the agents and the target are not required to be predefined but are autonomously adjusted by solving a distance optimization problem. In particular, with the target being moving, the distance optimization problem is time-varying. To address this issue, a game-based formulation of distributed least-distance formation tracking is first presented, where first- and second-order integrator-type agents are taken into account, respectively. Then, under the scenario in which all the agents know the position of the moving target, a new distributed Nash equilibrium seeking strategy that can be utilized to achieve distributed least-distance formation is constructed based on gradient search algorithms, regularization techniques and consensus protocols. Moreover, when it is further considered that only a subset of the agents can access the information of the moving target, a leader-following tracking protocol is introduced to estimate unknown information distributively. It is theoretically shown that the proposed strategies can globally steer the agents to form a desired shape while minimizing the overall distance to the moving target. Finally, the effectiveness of the established strategies is verified by, respectively, conducting simulation studies for a network of vehicles and quadrotors.},

Model predictive control (MPC) provides a constructive framework for controlling safety-critical systems but is limited by its computational complexity. We address this problem by presenting a novel algorithm that automatically computes an explicit approximation to nonlinear MPC schemes while retaining closed-loop guarantees. Specifically, the problem can be reduced to a function approximation problem, which we tackle by proposing the Adaptive and Localized Kernel Interpolation Algorithm with eXtrapolated reproducing kernel Hilbert space norm, which we refer to as Alkia-x. Alkia-x is a noniterative algorithm that ensures well-conditioned computations, a fast-to-evaluate approximating function, and the guaranteed satisfaction of any desired bound on the approximation error. Hence, Alkia-x automatically computes an explicit function that approximates the MPC, yielding a controller suitable for safety-critical systems and high sampling rates. We apply Alkia-x to approximate two nonlinear MPC schemes, demonstrating reduced computational demand and applicability to realistic problems.},

A challenging exploration is to implement neural network functionalities through biochemical reaction networks (BCRNs), a language that is inherently compatible with in vivo, with difficulties specifically in constructing an appropriate BCRN that respects computation and information processing steps involved in neural networks. By addressing these difficulties, this paired article manages to develop a biochemical fully connected neural network (BFCNN) that has the potential to behave like a neural network independently in vivo. In Part I, BFCNN is designed according to five different modules with concrete theoretical support on the stability of every module. In this article, we establish a systematic framework for error analysis of the designed BFCNN. We introduce current error evaluating error generation within an individual computational module by measuring the deviation between finite-time concentration and steady-state concentration, and the accumulative error characterizing error propagation across different modules connected via oscillatory signals and within the repeated modules due to multiple iterations. We further derive the formula for the total error upper bound about the iteration number and illustrate its exponential convergence order about nonzero duration time of an oscillatory signal concentration. Ultimately, the numerical experiments on two classification examples are made to exhibit the change tendency of total error bounds about the nonzero duration time and iteration number.},

In part I, we divide the FCNN into assignment, feedforward propagation, judgment, learning, and clear-out modules. Each module is programmed using BCRNs by setting species concentrations to carry information related to all kinds of computations and operations, with the equilibria of some species to represent the computation results and information processing results. The newly formed biochemical neural network exhibits the potential to work independently in vivo. In addition, our construction addresses a critical design gap by integrating two essential modules: the biochemical assignment module that enables iterative input of training samples, and the biochemical judgment module responsible for determining the termination of the training process. We further confirm theoretically that the BCRN system achieves FCNN functionality with exponential convergence to all target computational results.

The novel triggered-learning ADRC framework optimizes the ADRC performance of switched systems through reinforcement learning (RL) and enables “on-demand” updates of neural networks with guidance from a predesigned trigger. The innovation of this article is mainly reflected in four aspects: First, the RL-based gain automatic update mechanism (i.e., the dual-gain optimization mechanism) optimizes the performance of extended state observer and controller; the optimal policy is obtained from the experience-based deep deterministic policy gradient with self-learning ability. Second, the adaptive performance-triggered strategy guides the update of dual-gain; the on-demand triggering judgment is achieved by comparing cost functions that reflect the tracking control performance. Third, the proposed theoretical analysis method proves that the learning mechanism can enhance the closed-loop system performance. Fourth, the constructed ADRC-based switching law accelerates the convergence of system tracking error. Finally, a comparative simulation example demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

In this article, a quantitative analysis for the inhibitory effect of directed cycles on the consensus of directed network is provided. Specifically, directed cycle necessarily inhibits network consensus when there is at least one node with in-degree of 1 on the cycle, and the more the nodes with in-degree of 1, the greater the inhibition. The inhibition induced by multiple disjoint directed cycles is only determined by the directed cycle with the minimum node in-degree, independent of other directed cycles. Generally, the more intersected directed cycles, the smaller the convergence rate. Accordingly, to improve the consensus or synchronizability of a directed network, it is necessary to avoid the generation of multiple intersected directed cycles, especially those with a large number of in-degree 1.},

By using a novel system transformation, the heterogeneous high-order interval consensus problem then can be transformed into a first-order one, thus restoring the monotonic property, and further facilitating the analysis of the position interval consensus. We introduce a fully distributed absolute damping gain design. When the intersection of the intervals imposed by the agents is nonempty, the resulting positions must converge to a common value inside that intersection. When the intersection of the intervals is empty, there exists a unique, and globally asymptotically stable equilibrium.

We will first establish the invariance property of uniform observability with respect to some invariant subspace under time-varying output feedback control. Then, based on this invariance property, we will establish an exponential convergence result with respect to an invariant subspace for a class of linear switched systems. Leveraging this exponential convergence result, we will solve the exponential synchronization problem for general linear multiagent systems over jointly connected switching networks.

  abstract     = {This article provides a novel solution to a task allocation problem, by which a group of agents assigns a discrete set of tasks in a distributed manner. In this setting, heterogeneous agents have individual preferences and associated rewards for doing each task; however, these rewards are only known asymptotically. The assignment problem is formulated by means of a combinatorial partition game for known rewards, with no constraints on the number of tasks per agent. We relax this into a weight game, which together with the former, are shown to contain the optimal task allocation in the corresponding set of Nash equilibria (NE). We then propose a projected, best-response, ascending gradient dynamics (PBRAG) that converges to an NE in finite time. This forms the basis of a distributed online version that can deal with a converging sequence of rewards by means of an agreement subroutine. We present simulations that support our results.},

  abstract     = {The secure output regulation (OR) problem is formulated for networked switched systems (SSs) with severely unstable dynamics that are subjected to long-duration zero-value (LDZV) attacks. For these systems, well-defined switching rules enable the severely unstable dynamics to achieve stability and OR by allowing each subsystem to dwell for a short period. However, during LDZV attacks, the system's external variables (inputs and outputs) are set to zero for a long period. Given the presence of severely unstable dynamics, it becomes impossible to construct reliable switching rules that guarantee security, stability, and OR by merely extending the dwell time. In this scenario, specific system internal parameters, such as dissipativity parameters, can be leveraged in designing a secure control scheme to address the cumulative impacts of LDZV attacks and severely unstable dynamics. Thereby, event-triggered protocols and switching rules are designed from the dissipativity context. Finally, the secure OR solvability is verified using an aeroengine.},

To address the computational challenge, we propose a novel distributionally robust lifted control policy (DR-LCP) method to derive a high-quality approximate solution to this DRMIC problem for a rich class of Wasserstein metric-based ambiguity sets, including the Wasserstein ambiguity set and its variants. In theory, we analyze the asymptotic performance and establish a tight nonasymptotic bound of the proposed method.

Monotone systems facilitate the efficient computation of reachable sets and thus the straightforward formulation of a robust MPC approach optimizing over open-loop predictions. We present an approach based on the division of reachable sets to incorporate feedback in the predictions, resulting in less conservative strategies. The concept of mixed-monotonicity enables an extension of our methodology to nonmonotone systems. Lastly, we discuss the relation between widely used tube-based MPC approaches and our proposed methods.

To achieve the optimal attack strategy that can maximize the impact on estimation performance, a new attack model with the constraints of stealthiness and energy limitations is constructed. Furthermore, an equivalent two-step optimization problem is suggested to obtain the optimal attack matrix and optimal attack scheduling, respectively.

However, the current SCA algorithm exhibits a slow convergence rate, resulting in a relatively poor performance within a limited sample time. In this article, the process of SCA is retreated as solving a fixed-point nonlinear equation. By analyzing the derivative properties of this nonlinear equation, we introduce a Newton-based accelerated SCA algorithm designed to enhance the local convergence rate while inheriting all favorable characteristics of the SCA methods. Specifically, our algorithm offers the following benefits: first, it is capable of effectively tackling nonlinear optimization-based control problems; second, it permits flexible termination with all generated intermediate solutions being feasible for the original nonlinear problem; third, it guarantees convergence with locally superlinear convergence rate to the stationary point of the original nonlinear problem. Finally, we conduct experiments in a multiagent collision avoidance scenario to show its validity.},

Based on group homomorphism theory, each group can be mapped as a virtual node, called the group representative node. Consequently, the signed networks can be represented by the homomorphic mapping graph with only negative weight edges. The definition of structural balance has been extended, eliminating the requirement for a structurally balanced network to have an even number of negative edges. As a result, a signed network with negative cycles is also considered structurally balanced. Then, multigroup symmetry consensus conditions are derived based on the characteristics of the Laplacian matrix associated with the homomorphic mapping graph. It can be concluded that average consensus and bipartite consensus are special cases of multigroup symmetric consensus. Each group in the signed networks is assigned different consensus parameters, thereby achieving asymmetric consensus, which together with symmetric consensus forms multigroup consensus control.},

Considering the mismatch of the data during the switching interval, the slack variable is introduced to ensure the feasibility of the algorithm. Then, the stability of the switched linear system is analyzed theoretically. The exponential stability of one single subsystem is shown with the existence of the artificial perturbation in the actual control input. We also elucidate the uniformly bounded growth of the system trajectory over the switching interval. Based on these results, we prove that the closed-loop system is exponentially stable, provided the switching signal satisfies the dwell-time condition.

To this end, this article presents a novel symbiotic control framework that offers the strengths of fixed-gain control and adaptive learning architectures. Specifically, this framework synergistically integrates these architectures to mitigate the effects of uncertainties in a more predictable manner as compared to adaptive learning alone and it does not require any knowledge on such uncertainties. Both parametric and nonparametric uncertainties are considered, where we utilize neural networks to approximate the unknown uncertainty basis for the latter case. Counterintuitively, the proposed framework has the ability to achieve a desired level of closed-loop system behavior even with an insufficient number of neurons (e.g., when the neural network approximation error is large) or in the face of injudiciously selected adaptive learning parameters (e.g., high leakage term parameters).},

Both algorithms invoke RR update for each agent, inherit favorable characteristics of RR for minimizing smooth nonconvex objective functions, and improve the performance of previous distributed RR methods both theoretically and empirically. Specifically, both GT-RR and ED-RR achieve the convergence rate of $\mathcal {O}(1/[(1-\lambda)^{1/3}m^{1/3}T^{2/3}])$ in driving the (minimum) expected squared norm of the gradient to zero, where $T$ denotes the number of epochs, $m$ is the sample size for each agent, and $(1-\lambda)$ represents the spectral gap of the mixing matrix. When the objective functions further satisfy the Polyak–Łojasiewicz condition, we show GT-RR and ED-RR both achieve $\mathcal {O}(1/[(1-\lambda)mT^{2}])$ convergence rate in terms of the averaged expected differences between the agents' function values and the global minimum value. Notably, both results are comparable to the convergence rates of centralized RR methods (up to constant factors depending on the network topology) and outperform those of previous distributed RR algorithms.},

  abstract     = {This article is focused on estimating reachable sets for periodic time-varying systems, whose dynamics are represented by trigonometric series through Fourier theory. Given the difficulty of dealing with coupled time-varying coefficients in reachable set estimation, a constructive polynomial-based approach is utilized to transform time-varying nonconvex constraints into constant vertex constraints through the property of multiaffine matrix polynomials. Based on that, when the decay rate parameters for Lyapunov functions are known, the reachable set bounding region can be determined by solving vertex constraints in linear matrix inequality forms. In cases where the decay rates are unknown, a simulated annealing algorithm and a Boundary Intersection algorithm are proposed to provide a tractable solution for parameter searching, and to achieve lower conservatism in the reachable set bounding regions. The effectiveness of our polynomial-based approach is illustrated through simulations using a single-mesh gear system. Moreover, the efficiency of the two algorithms can be assessed by contrasting the conservatism reduced in measurements of bounding regions.},

From the viewpoint of attackers, the attack design strategy against aperiodic sampled-data control systems is proposed. The strategy ensures that the detection signal at sampling instants consistently remains zero, allowing the designed zero-dynamics attack to achieve stealthiness. From the perspective of defenders, asynchronous sampling-and-holding countermeasure by introducing time-gap is presented. This countermeasure effectively disrupts the stealthiness of zero-dynamics attack, realizing the attack detection and enhancing the system security. It is demonstrated that for each sampling interval, there is at least one time-gap caused by asynchronous sampling-and-holding that allows attack signal to be detected. Finally, the automatic voltage regulator system and the inverted pendulum system are taken to verify the stealthiness of the attack design strategy and the effectiveness of the asynchronous-based countermeasure.},

Based on online measured data, an upper confidence bound (UCB) is designed such that the estimated obstacle regions are guaranteed to cover the real obstacles with a predefined probability, thus avoiding collisions. Using the proposed approach, the control path constraints are transformed into deterministic constraints using analytic approximations. By adjusting the parameters in the proposed approximation function, the feasible set of the approximate optimization problem converges to the real feasible set conservatively. Such a property leads to both feasibility and suboptimality of the solution obtained by solving a deterministic optimization problem. Numerical results demonstrate that the designed UCB and approximation function are effective for trajectory optimization problems with control bounds and obstacle avoidance chance constraints. Comparative studies verified that the approximation function ensures the feasibility of the original chance constrained problem and reduces conservatism.},

Depending on the system's complexity (order $n$, lag $\ell$, and number of outputs $p$), it was observed in several works that such an approach presents significant limitations. In particular, many works require to restrict the class of LTI systems to those satisfying the relation $p\ell =n$. In this note, we show how to address the general multi-input multi-output (MIMO) case (for which $p\ell \geq n$ in general) by constructing an alternative nonminimal state vector from data. Different from the existing literature, our method guarantees the satisfaction of certain rank conditions when the system is persistently excited, thereby facilitating the direct data-driven dynamic output-feedback control of MIMO systems by applying methods that were originally developed for the input-state data setting.},

First, we analyze multiple explicit representations of a single constraint and propose a method to reduce convexification loss without solving additional nested dual problems. Second, we map the expansion points to the constraint boundary and propose the second method, which minimizes the loss to the greatest extent, referred to as weak loss convexification. Both methods are incorporated into a suboptimal MPC framework, guaranteeing recursive feasibility and stability, even when SCP is stopped early.

For coping with this scenario, a novel event-triggered pinning quasi-synchronization approach is explored in this research for a category of switched directed networks (SDNs) with sampling measurements. By developing a time-dependent Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional (LKF) and implementing a state-dependent switching strategy utilizing sampling measurements, sufficient conditions are formulated to assure that the synchronization errors are ultimately bounded in an exponential fashion. Different from previous relevant findings, the verification of matrix conditions in the derived synchronization criterion no longer depends on the number of nodes in networks, making it more suitable for large-scale SDNs. Ultimately, two simulation examples are incorporated to elucidate the applicability of the newly crafted synchronization methodology.},

For nonminimum phase systems with unstable internal dynamics, the inverse model yields unbounded inputs, impeding the implementation of the feedforward control method. Existing stable inversion leverages noncausal input and initial state transition to achieve exact tracking with an infinite time preview of the output. However, a limited preview window results in tracking errors, and the existence of the optimal transition relies on the invertibility of the Grammian matrix. Recently, a novel stable inversion based on lifting time systems has been introduced. It enables finite-time precision tracking without an infinite preview window and exhibits significant application potential, though confined to linear time-invariant systems. From the perspective of the lifted system, this article addresses the stable inversion problem in finite time for multivariate linear periodic time-varying systems leveraging the equivalence between the linear periodic time-varying system and its lifted system. Simulation is designed to validate the effectiveness of the results.},

Our contributions show that OT ambiguity sets are also analytically tractable: they propagate easily and intuitively through linear and nonlinear (possibly corrupted by noise) transformations, and the result of the propagation is again an OT ambiguity set or can be upper bounded by an OT ambiguity set. In the context of dynamical systems, our results allow us to consider multiple sources of uncertainty (e.g., initial condition, additive noise, and multiplicative noise) and to capture in closed form, via an OT ambiguity set, the resulting uncertainty in the state at any future time. Our results are actionable, interpretable, and readily employable in a great variety of computationally tractable control and estimation formulations.

However, existing methods, such as mixed-integer programming and nonlinear programming, often struggle to efficiently solve control problems with complex, long-horizon STL specifications. This study introduces STLCCP, a novel convex optimization-based framework that leverages key structural properties of STL: monotonicity of the robustness function, its hierarchical tree structure, and correspondence between convexity/concavity in optimizations and conjunctiveness/ disjunctiveness in specifications. The framework begins with a structure-aware decomposition of STL formulas, transforming the problem into an equivalent difference of convex programs. This is then solved sequentially as a convex quadratic program using an improved version of the convex-concave procedure. To further enhance efficiency, we develop a smooth approximation of the robustness function using a function termed the mellowmin function, specifically tailored to the proposed framework. Numerical experiments on motion planning benchmarks demonstrate that STLCCP can efficiently handle complex scenarios over long horizons, outperforming existing methods.},

By employing perturbed best response evolutionary dynamics to model the population's strategic behavior, we extend previous related work so as to allow for noise in the agents' perceptions of the rewards and intrinsic costs of the available strategies. Central to our approach is the use of system-theoretic methods and passivity concepts to obtain a Lyapunov function, ensuring the global asymptotic stability of an endemic equilibrium with minimized infection prevalence under budget constraints. We leverage the Lyapunov function to analyze how the epidemic's spread rate is influenced by the time scale of the payoff mechanism's dynamics. In addition, we derive anytime upper bounds on both the infectious fraction of the population and the instantaneous cost a social planner must incur to control the spread, allowing us to quantify the tradeoff between peak infection prevalence and the corresponding cost. For a class of one-parameter perturbed best response models, we propose a method to learn the model's parameter from data.},

  abstract     = {Denial-of-service (DoS) attacks impose an important threat for networked switched systems, as they impede the effective transmission of the control signals and measurement data and disrupt the synchronization of the switching modes between the controllers and the plant. To address this challenge, this article proposes a sliding-mode controller design for safety against DoS attacks in networked switched systems. First, we analyze the impact of the time delays induced by signal quantization and DoS attacks on the switching signals, control laws, and measurement data. We then design an integral sliding surface associated with the switching modes such that, when system uncertainties, disturbances, and the frequency and duration of DoS attacks are suitably bounded, input-to-state practical stability is guaranteed. Moreover, a reaching law is designed such that the trajectories of the networked switched system reach the sliding surface in finite time. The practicality and applicability of the proposed approach is demonstrated with numerical simulations on a networked continuous stirred tank reactor system.},

A necessary and sufficient condition is presented for safety of switched systems by exploiting a multiple barrier functions (MBFs) method. To reveal the relationship about safety between subsystems and switched systems, an extended Nagumo's Theorem in the switched systems framework is derived. Also, several switched control design conditions are respectively provided to ensure safety of switched systems. Based on the union of MBFs and multiple Lyapunov functions, a novel safety-critical control framework is established to simultaneously ensure safety and stability of switched systems. Also, an auxiliary cost function is introduced to transform the safety-critical optimal control problem of switched systems into the one of non-switched systems. Finally, two examples are illustrated to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.},

Our approach is based on that of the so-called mean subsequence reduced (MSR) algorithm with a special emphasis on its use in agents capable to communicate with multihop neighbors. The MSR algorithm provides an effective technique for agents to achieve resilient consensus if the multiagent network satisfies certain connectivity requirements. Our analysis highlights that for maintaining the same level of resilience against adversarial nodes, such network connectivity requirements can be relaxed by increasing the number of relay hops. In particular, we characterize tight network structures for our algorithm to succeed and propose a novel notion of graph robustness with multihop communication. Moreover, we analyze the multihop W-MSR algorithm with delays in communication since messages from multihop neighbors may require different numbers of time steps for their transmissions.

This is achieved by proving that the exact backstepping kernels, constructed for stabilization of the large-scale system, can be approximated (in certain sense such that exponential stability is preserved) by the backstepping kernels constructed for stabilization of a continuum version (essentially an infinite ensemble) of the original PDE system. The proof relies on construction of a convergent sequence of backstepping kernels that is defined such that each kernel matches the exact backstepping kernels (derived based on the original, large-scale system), in a piecewise constant manner with respect to an ensemble variable; while showing that they satisfy the continuum backstepping kernel equations. We present a numerical example that reveals that complexity of computation of stabilizing backstepping kernels may not scale with the number of components of the PDE state, when the kernels are constructed on the basis of the continuum version, in contrast to the case in which they are constructed on the basis of the original, large-scale system. In addition, we formally establish the connection between the solutions to the large-scale system and its continuum counterpart. Thus, this approach can be useful for design of computationally tractable, stabilizing backstepping-based control laws for large-scale PDE systems.},

The path-lifting mechanism leverages the unique properties of the MRP representation and is crucial for developing a novel framework for the equivalence of stability results between these topological spaces. The new hybrid methodology allows the design and analysis of an attitude feedback controller in the topologically less complex MRP space with the guarantee that its asymptotic and exponential stability properties directly translate to the attitude dynamics in the base space. Furthermore, the resulting interconnection is impervious to the unwinding phenomenon. The design and evaluation of an MRP-based controller demonstrate the application, practical relevance, and advantages of the proposed algorithm alongside the novel results for equivalence of stability between spaces. The solution renders the attitude space dynamics robustly globally asymptotically stable and robustly semi-globally exponentially stable, illustrating the potential of this novel approach.},

In this article, by extending the famous mutual information-minimum mean-square error (I-MMSE) relationships to the discrete-time additive white Gaussian channels with and without feedback, a new paradigm is introduced to estimate and analyze total information rate as a control and filtering tradeoff metric. Under this framework, we explore the tradeoff properties of total information rate for a variety of the discrete-time control and filtering systems, e.g., linear time-invariant, linear time-varying, and nonlinear, and propose an alternative approach to investigate total information rate via optimal estimation.},

This suggests the emergence of bifurcations in population games admitting multiple strict Nash equilibria, as observed in numerous examples. We then characterize a novel class of monotone separable population games for which globally asymptotically stable logit equilibria are proved to exist for every noise level.

We establish theoretical results of the proposed algorithm that quantify the effect of communication noise and gradient noise on the performance of the algorithm.

We propose an information structure called a partial modified state class graph with respect to a timed observation. Then, based on the particular graph, an algorithm is designed to construct a delayed marking estimator that is used for the verification of $K$-step opacity of a timed observation by solving a number of linear programming problems.

Unfortunately, adaptive identification based on both saturated observations and the $\ell _{1}$-optimization turns out to be a challenging nonlinear problem, and has rarely been explored in the literature. Motivated by this and the need to fit with the $\ell _{1}$-based index of prediction accuracy in, e.g., judicial sentencing prediction problems, we propose a two-step weighted $\ell _{1}$-based adaptive identification algorithm. Under certain excitation conditions much weaker than the traditional persistent excitation condition, we will establish the global convergence of both the parameter estimators and the adaptive predictors. It is worth noting that our results do not rely on the widely used independent and identically distributed assumptions on the system signals, and thus, do not exclude applications to feedback control systems. We will demonstrate the advantages of our proposed new adaptive algorithm over the existing $\ell _{2}$-based ones, through both a numerical example and a real-data-based sentencing prediction problem.},

  abstract     = {In this article, a dynamic high-gain-based decentralized optimal fault-tolerant control (FTC) strategy for a class of strong interconnected systems with unknown actuator faults is proposed. The interactions considered are bounded by some functions that depend on all subsystems' states. A two-layer control framework is presented for each subsystem to steer its tracking error asymptotically to zero. In the upper layer, an error optimizer is designed to generate optimal error trajectory based on a local objective function that converges to zero. In the lower layer, with the aid of an auxiliary system, a trajectory-tracking fault-tolerant controller is given to adaptively accommodate the effects of parameteric uncertainties and actuator faults, where an adaptive high-gain approach is adopted to address the unknown strong interactions. In comparison with existing results, the proposed algorithm relaxes the requirement of output trajectory derivatives, and asymptotic tracking is accomplished. Application results obtained using an electrical power system case demonstrate the validity of the proposed algorithm.},

To expedite the optimization process, we amalgamate the heavy ball and Nesterov's accelerated method with distributed aggregative gradient tracking, resulting in the proposal of two innovative algorithms, aimed at resolving the distributed aggregative optimization problem. Our analysis demonstrates that the proposed algorithms can converge to an optimal solution at a global linear convergence rate when the objective function is strongly convex with the Lipschitz-continuous gradient, and when the parameters (e.g., step size and momentum coefficients) are chosen within specific ranges. In addition, we present several numerical experiments to verify the effectiveness, robustness, and superiority of our proposed algorithms.},

Moreover, the full state of the plant is available for feedback. A multiple model online identification scheme for the plant's state and input matrices is developed that guarantees the estimated parameters converge to the underlying plant model under the assumption of persistence of excitation. Using an exact matching condition, the parameter estimates are used in a control law such that the plant's states asymptotically track the reference signal generated by a state-space reference model. The control architecture is proven to provide boundedness of all closed-loop signals and to asymptotically drive the state tracking error to zero. Numerical simulations illustrate the stability and efficacy of the proposed MMRAC scheme, even in the presence of noise.

  abstract     = {This article considers distributed online convex optimization with time-varying constraints. In this setting, a network of agents makes decisions at each round, and then, only a portion of the loss function and a coordinate block of the constraint function are privately revealed to each agent. The loss and constraint functions are convex and can vary arbitrarily across rounds. The agents collaborate to minimize static network regret and network cumulative constraint violation. A novel distributed online algorithm with a vanishing stepsize is proposed and it achieves an $\mathcal {O}(T^{\max \lbrace c,1-c\rbrace })$ static network regret bound and an $\mathcal {O}(T^{1-c/2})$ network cumulative constraint violation bound, where $T$ is the number of rounds and $c\in (0,1)$ is a user-defined tradeoff parameter. When Slater's condition holds (i.e., there is a point that strictly satisfies the inequality constraints), the network cumulative constraint violation bound is reduced to $\mathcal {O}(T^{1-c})$. Moreover, if the loss functions are strongly convex, then static network regret bound is reduced to $\mathcal {O}(\log (T))$, and the network cumulative constraint violation bound is reduced to $\mathcal {O}(\sqrt{\log (T)T})$ and $\mathcal {O}(\log (T))$ without and with Slater's condition, respectively. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this article is the first to achieve tighter (network) cumulative constraint violation bounds for (distributed) online convex optimization with time-varying constraints under Slater's condition. Finally, the theoretical results are verified through numerical simulations.},

By exploiting the set-theoretic nature of the information provided by the quantizer, the problem is cast in the set membership estimation setting. Assuming the possibility of suitably tuning the quantizer range and resolution, the optimal design of adaptive quantizers is formulated in terms of the minimization of the radius of information associated to the state estimation problem. The optimal solution is derived for first-order systems and the result is exploited to design adaptive quantizers for generic systems, minimizing the size of the feasible output signal set. Then, the number of sensor thresholds for which the adaptive quantizers guarantee asymptotic boundedness of the state estimation uncertainty is established. Threshold adaptation mechanisms based on several types of outer approximations of the feasible state set are also proposed. The effectiveness of the designed adaptive quantizers is demonstrated on numerical tests, highlighting the tradeoff between the resulting estimation uncertainty and the computational burden required by recursive set approximations.},

Our design is for linearized hyperbolic Aw–Rascle–Zhang (ARZ) PDEs governing traffic velocity and density. Compared to continuous feedback, ETC provides a piecewise-constant VSL commands—more likely to be obeyed by human drivers. Unlike the existing “regular” ETC (R-ETC), which enforces conservatively a strict decrease of a Lyapunov function, our performance-barrier (P-ETC) approach permits an increase, as long as the Lyapunov function remains below a performance barrier, resulting in fewer control updates than R-ETC. To relieve VSL from continuously monitoring the triggering function, we also develop periodic event-triggered (PETC) and self-triggered (STC) versions of both R-ETC and P-ETC. These are referred to as R/P-PETC and R/P-STC, respectively, and we show that they both guarantee Zeno-free behavior and exponential convergence in the spatial $L^{2}$ norm. With comparative simulations, we illustrate the benefits of the performance-barrier designs through traffic metrics (driver comfort, safety, travel time, fuel consumption). The proposed algorithms reduce discomfort nearly in half relative to driver behavior without VSL, while tripling the driver safety, measured by the average dwell time, relative to the R-ETC frequent-switching VSL schedule.},

Specifically, we delve into the details of the geometrically periodic system through the tunnel of considering the convergence between the system and its geometrically averaging approximation. Under different corresponding conditions, the approximation on infinite time intervals can achieve certain accuracies, such that one can use the stability result of either the original system or the averaging system to deduce the stability of the other. After that, we employ the graphical stability to investigate the “pattern stability” with respect to the phase-based system. Finally, by virtue of the contraction analysis on the Finsler manifold, the idea of accentuating the periodic pattern incremental stability and convergence is nurtured in the phase-based differential inclusion system, and comes to its preliminary fruition in application to biomimetic mechanic robot control problem.},

The states and disturbances are typically estimated with a Kalman filter. The disturbance estimates effectively provide integral control, so the quality of the disturbance model (and resulting filter) directly influences the control performance. We implement eigenvalue constraints to protect against undesirable filter behavior (unstable or marginally stable modes, high-frequency oscillations). Specifically, we consider the class of linear matrix inequality (LMI) regions for eigenvalue constraints. These LMI regions are open sets by default, so we introduce a barrier function method to create tightened, but closed, eigenvalue constraints. To solve the resulting nonlinear semidefinite program, we approximate it as a nonlinear program using a Cholesky factorization method that exploits known sparsity structures of semidefinite optimization variables and matrix inequalities. The algorithm is applied to real-world data taken from two physical systems: a low-cost benchmark temperature microcontroller suitable for classroom laboratories, and an industrial-scale chemical reactor at Eastman Chemical's plant in Kingsport, TN.},

While robust closed loop stability of the deterministic part of the closed loop is guaranteed by a Lyapunov-based approach, the performance is improved by a separate $\mathcal {D}_{\mathrm{R}}$ eigenvalue region for the controller and observer. In addition, input, process, and sensor noise is suppressed by solving an optimization problem with an objective function derived from the discrete-time Itô differential operator. Therefore, an iterative LMI method is utilized, which leads to less conservative optimization results. Polynomial parameter dependencies are treated by including the calculation of upper and lower bounds in the set of LMIs with the theorem of Ehlich and Zeller. Therefore, the polynomial nonlinearities are formulated by means of quasi-linear system representations, which are interpreted as polynomial matrices. Thus, the polynomial nonlinearities are treated in their original polynomial form, without using polytopic approximations. As a result, the optimization of the controller parameters is improved in contrast to conventional polytopic approaches. The results of the novel approach of polynomial uncertainty representations are discussed in detail in two examples, wherein the reproducibility is guaranteed and the practical applicability of the approach is demonstrated.},

  abstract     = {To stabilize partial differential equation (PDE) models, control laws typically require space-dependent functional gains mapped by nonlinear operators from the PDE functional coefficients. When a PDE is nonlinear and its “pseudocoefficient” functions are state-dependent, a gain-scheduling (GS) nonlinear design is the simplest approach to the design of nonlinear feedback.The GS version of PDE backstepping employs gains obtained by solving a PDE at each value of the state. Performing such PDE computations in real time may be prohibitive. The recently introduced neural operators (NO) can be trained to produce the gain functions rapidly in real time for each state value without requiring a PDE solution. In this article, we introduce NOs for GS-PDE backstepping. GS controllers act on the premise that the state change is slow and, as a result, guarantee only local stability, even for ordinary differential equations (ODEs). We establish local stabilization of hyperbolic PDEs with nonlinear recirculation using both a “full-kernel” approach and the “gain-only” approach to gain operator approximation. Numerical simulations illustrate stabilization and demonstrate speedup by three orders of magnitude over traditional PDE GS.},

Fundamental limits in literature are only valid for modified algebraic Riccati equations, which are special cases of GAREs. The purpose of this article is to derive new information on $vm$. Main results are as follows: 1) The variance margin of a control is established in direct and analytical ways and a new characterization of $vm$ is proposed via the solution to a spectral optimization problem. 2) New analytical bounds of $vm$ are established. 3) $vm$ is completely determined by the optimal cost of a standard homogeneous linear quadratic regulation problem with a specified initial state if the systems have no state dependent noise and have a single input. If additionally, certain eigenvalue and controllability conditions are satisfied, an analytical expression of $vm$ is available.},

However, the remote control center is usually well protected and its knowledge is difficult to be disclosed, which becomes a major obstacle in developing stealthy false data injection (FDI) attack scheme because only partial system knowledge (i.e., the system matrices of the physical plant) could be used. To meet this challenge, a novel stealthy FDI attack scheme against the sensor measurement is proposed by employing the normal and compromised self-governed filters held by malicious attackers, where the normal one is adopted to estimate the system state and the compromised one is used as the virtual attacked target. The corresponding attack strategy is obtained by maximizing the estimation error of the compromised self-governed filter. Then, the residual of the compromised system is derived to prove attack stealthiness. Next, it is derived and found that the attack impact on system estimation performance is the same as that based on full system knowledge. Furthermore, the divergence condition of NCSs under the attack is presented. Finally, all the theoretical analyses are verified by simulation results.},

To enable the players to make self-beneficial decisions in such a dynamic environment, it is assumed that the players can locally store and exchange the historical action information. Based on the stored information, a distributed strategy is established, in which each player updates its action by a dual averaging method. In order to prevent excessive storage requirements, a storage mechanism is designed so that only the information generated from a certain historical time horizon is retained. The performance of the proposed strategy is evaluated by the static regret, which quantifies player's loss between the actual cost and the cost with the fixed best response during its active period. It is shown that the upper bound of each player's static regret grows sublinearly under local diminishing step sizes, indicating that the proposed strategy performs as well as choosing the best stationary action in hindsight for the long-term players. Finally, a simulation study on energy consumption games is given to verify the effectiveness of the developed methods.},

These notions are of utmost importance in applications to high-dimensional systems, such as large-scale networks, in which only a target subset of variables (nodes) is sought to be controlled or estimated. Although the duality between full-state controllability and observability is well established, the characterization of the duality between their generalized counterparts remains an outstanding problem. Here, we establish both the weak and the strong duality between output controllability and functional observability. Specifically, we show that functional observability of a system implies output controllability of a dual system (weak duality), and that under a certain geometric condition the converse holds (strong duality). As an application of the strong duality, we derive a necessary and sufficient condition for target control via static feedback. This allow us to establish a separation principle between the design of target controllers and the design of functional observers in closed-loop systems. These results generalize the classical duality and separation principles in modern control theory.},

This Lyapunov functional is shown to be the solution to a functional Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman (HJB) equation. Sufficient conditions for optimality are then provided in the form of a steady-state version of the functional HJB equation, thereby guaranteeing both stability and optimality. In addition, the corresponding results of optimal feedback control problem for a class of nonlinear delay-free systems are further developed.

With the help of theoretical tools including binary relation composition and products of nonnegative matrices, the inequality constraints for trust and distrust degrees are established, which ensures that trust relationships can counteract the negative effects of distrust relationships on opinion consensus. In addition, further analysis is conducted on the factors that affect the convergence rate of opinion consensus, including the longest positive distance from leader to the followers as well as the upper bound of communication delays.

However, safety-critical applications are still a challenge due to lack of safety guarantees during exploration and subsequent deployment. The learning problem becomes even more difficult for complex tasks with temporal and logical constraints. In this article, we introduce a modular deep RL architecture as a control framework to satisfy complex tasks specified using linear temporal logic (LTL). To enhance safety, we propose a safe “shield” to constrain RL actions within a safe set. In turn, a challenge with this strategy is that the safe filter can restrict RL exploration during training. To address this limitation, we have developed an innovative safe guiding process by integrating the properties of LTL automata with perturbations of the safe “shield.” This innovation is verified to maintain the original optimality of LTL satisfaction and enhances exploration efficiency. Finally, we demonstrate that our approach consistently achieves near-perfect success rates and safety guarding with a high level of confidence during the training.

In this article, we find minimally disruptive auxiliary signals that guarantee detection under set-based uncertainty. Our motivation is distance protection in inverter-dominated power systems, wherein small fault currents can go undetected by traditional schemes. We focus on static systems because distance protection is based on phasors. We formulate a general auxiliary signal design problem with constraints imposed by system operational requirements, and additive and multiplicative noise. We use a relaxation and duality to reformulate the problem as a semidefinite bilinear program. In the special case of additive uncertainty and no constraints, we obtain an analytical lower bound on the magnitude an auxiliary signal must have to guarantee detection. We solve the optimizations in an example based on distance protection, in which the auxiliary signal is negative sequence current.},

  abstract     = {The concept of priority has been introduced to the robotic systems in 1980s as an effort to overcome problems caused by singularity and it has attracted considerable attention from both the robotics and control societies. However, none of the previous works have successfully addressed two fundamental degenerate properties of singularity: nonsmoothness and imperfect inversion. This technical note proposes a prioritized output tracking control method that guarantees the ultimate boundedness and the convergence of higher priority outputs when the input–output feedback linearization becomes nonsmooth and imperfect by singularity. For that purpose, we first prioritize the input–output feedback linearization and discuss how two degenerate properties can occur when the system becomes singular. Then, we introduce the differential inclusion to deal with the nonsmooth internal dynamics and establish a condition using the upper Dini derivative for asymptotically stable zero dynamics. Also, we propose a strictly positive realness-based feedback gain design and find a condition related to an M-matrix in order to handle nonlinearities that appear in the imperfect feedback linearization. Finally, we combine these two results and show the ultimate boundedness and the output convergence. In addition, we provide a motivational example with a planar four-link manipulator to illustrate the effectiveness and limitations of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {The noncooperative game with private constraints is studied, where heterogeneous players communicate over a weight-unbalanced digraph. A novel distributed Nash equilibrium (NE) seeking algorithm is adapted for this problem tackling two main difficulties. First, the presence of the unbalanced digraph disrupts some essential properties of the Laplacian matrix. To overcome this limitation, a compensation mechanism based on output feedback is introduced. Second, to ensure players' actions meet the constraints, an adaptive penalty technique is introduced. This technique effectively uses the information obtained from the intrinsic nature of the constraints and fulfills the quantitative estimation of penalty parameters, where the penalty parameters are able to vary along with the degree of constraint violation. To reduce unnecessary communication among players, a novel distributed NE seeking algorithm with a bivariate dynamic event-triggered mechanism is employed, which ensures exponential NE seeking while avoiding the Zeno behavior. Finally, a connectivity control game is given to evaluate the effectiveness of the results.},

  abstract     = {In this article, the consensus problem of multiple Euler–Lagrange (EL) systems with time-varying asymmetric full-state constraints under a directed graph is investigated in a fully distributed way, where the global information dependence is removed. First, to prevent the violation of the full-state constraints of each EL system, a nonlinear state-dependent transformation is adopted for both the leader and followers, where the constraints will not be violated as long as the transformed states remain finite. Then, a constrained nonlinear fully distributed observer is constructed using only neighbors' states, and an adaptive gain is designed to eliminate the dependence of the global information. The theoretical analysis is completed via constructing a novel integration-based Lyapunov function using a graph-based diagonal matrix, ensuring the achievement of consensus. Using the observed state, an adaptive backstepping state tracking control protocol is developed such that the position of each EL system can track the leader within a tolerable bounded region. Thus, the leader-following consensus of multiple EL systems with time-varying asymmetric full-state constraints is achieved. Simulation results are illustrated to show the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.},

In order to avoid any unwanted behavior during the learning phase, a tube-based nonlinear model predictive controller is employed, which ensures satisfaction of constraints and input-to-state stability of the closed-loop states. In addition, the proposed approach guarantees the convergence of states to the origin under certain conditions. To make the algorithm implementable online, a dual-timescale adaptation mechanism is utilized, where the weights of the output layer of the neural network are updated each time instant using a weight update law, while the inner layers are repeatedly trained in self-supervised manner by using the adaptive actions as labels for the training. Our results are validated through a numerical experiment, which indicates that the proposed deep MPC architecture is effective in learning to control safety critical systems without suffering instability drawbacks.},

In particular, we decompose the original problem into the (control-constrained) partially observed LQ risk-sensitive control problem and the LQ risk-neutral problem for the mean-field dynamics. While the optimal solution of the former is characterized by the risk-sensitive state estimator and satisfies the associated control constraint, the optimal solution of the latter is represented by the state-feedback mean-field type process. Then, by combining the optimal solutions of these two problems, we obtain the explicit feedback-type linear optimal solution to the original problem.

To quantify the resilience of the interconnected system under the action of replay attacks, we derive bounds on the duration of each cyber-attack and the resting time between two consecutive cyber-attacks. Specifically, when each attack duration is smaller than our designed upper bound, the interconnected system controlled by the distributed approximation-based controller remains asymptotically stable. Moreover, if the resting time between two consecutive attacks is larger than the proposed bound, then all signals of the control system are guaranteed to be bounded. In this article, we show that under the action of the proposed distributed adaptive controller, the interconnected system remains stable in the presence of replay attacks with both the qualitative and quantitative resilient conditions.

  abstract     = {Common tasks in system analysis and control include optimal control, peak estimation, reachable set estimation, and maximum control invariant set estimation. A standard method to solve these problems is to lift them into infinite-dimensional convex linear programs. However, finite-dimensional truncations of these problems suffer a curse of dimensionality with respect to the size of the state and input. In the case where the dynamical system is input-affine and the input is restricted to a convex set, decomposition methods may be employed to eliminate the input and yield more tractable finite-dimensional truncations. Prior work on these eliminations include enforcing vertex constraints (switching), or employing facial decompositions in the case where the polytopic set is a scaled box. This work generalizes the box-facial technique toward the decompositions of arbitrary convex input-constraining sets using methods from robust optimization. The robustified programs are proven to have the same optimal value and an equivalent set of optimizers as the original program under mild compactness and regularity constraints. Specific attention is paid toward robust-counterpart decomposition of semidefinite representable sets when employing the moment-sum-of-squares hierarchy for polynomial optimization. Efficacy is demonstrated under data-driven peak and distance estimation problems.},

  abstract     = {Time-optimal control for high-order chain-of-integrator systems with full state constraints remains an open and challenging problem within the discipline of optimal control. The behavior of optimal control in high-order problems lacks precise characterization. Even the existence of the chattering phenomenon, i.e., the control switches infinitely many times over a finite period, remains unknown. This article establishes a theoretical framework for chattering in the problem, providing novel findings on the uniqueness of state constraints inducing chattering, the upper bound of switching times in an unconstrained arc during chattering, and the convergence of states and costates to the chattering limit point. For the first time, this article proves the existence of chattering in the considered problem. The chattering optimal control for fourth-order problems with velocity constraints is precisely solved, providing an approach to plan time-optimal snap-limited trajectories. Other cases of order $n\leq 4$ are proved not to allow chattering. The conclusions challenge a prevalent conception in the industry concerning the time-optimality of S-shaped trajectories with finite switching times.},

  abstract     = {In decentralized optimization over networks, synchronizing the updates of all nodes incurs significant communication overhead. Therefore, much of the recent literature has focused on designing asynchronous algorithms where nodes can activate anytime and contact a single neighbor to complete an iteration. However, most works assume that the neighbor selection is done randomly based on a fixed probability distribution, a choice that ignores the optimization landscape at the activation time. Instead, in this work we introduce an optimization-aware rule that chooses the neighbor providing the highest dual cost improvement (a quantity related to a consensus-based dualization of the problem). This scheme is related to the coordinate descent (CD) method with the Gauss-Southwell (GS) rule for coordinate updates; in our setting, however, only a subset of coordinates is accessible at each iteration (because each node can communicate only with its neighbors), so the existing literature on GS methods does not apply. To overcome this, we develop a new analytical framework for smooth and strongly convex functions that covers our new class of setwise CD algorithms—a class that applies to both decentralized and parallel distributed computing scenarios—and we show that the proposed setwise GS rule can speed up the convergence in terms of iterations by a factor equal to the size of the largest coordinate set. We analyze extensions of these algorithms that exploit the knowledge of smoothness constants when available, and otherwise propose an algorithm to estimate these constants. Finally, we validate our theoretical results through extensive simulations.},

While safety is paramount, guarantees on sufficient exploration are also crucial for ensuring autonomous task completion. To address these challenges, we propose a novel safe guaranteed exploration framework using optimal control, which achieves first-of-its-kind results: guaranteed exploration for nonlinear systems with finite-time sample complexity bounds, while being provably safe with arbitrarily high probability. The framework is general and applicable to many real-world scenarios with complex nonlinear dynamics and unknown domains. We improve the efficiency of this general framework by proposing an algorithm, SAfe Guaranteed Exploration using Model Predictive Control (SageMPC). SageMPC leverages three key techniques: first, exploiting a Lipschitz bound; second, goal-directed exploration; and third, receding horizon style replanning, all while maintaining the desired sample complexity, safety, and exploration guarantees of the framework. Lastly, we demonstrate safe efficient exploration in challenging unknown environments using SageMPC with a car model.},

The satisfaction of these objectives becomes more challenging when considering time-varying dynamics and disturbances, which arise in real-world contexts. We develop methods with the potential to address these issues by applying an offline-computed safety guaranteeing controller on a physical system, to track a virtual system that evolves through a trajectory that is replanned online, accounting for constraints updated online. The first method we propose is designed for general time-varying systems over a finite horizon. Our second method overcomes the finite horizon restriction for periodic systems.

To make event-triggered control as an end-to-end solution, a key issue is how to effectively learn unknown system dynamics from event-triggered measurements and consequently, develop a learning-based event-triggered controller. Existing works learn system dynamics based on periodic time-triggered measurements, and it is yet to know how to learn a controller with performance guarantee based on event-triggered measurements. To address this issue, we consider the problem of learning an event-triggered state feedback controller for an unknown linear system based on event-triggered state measurements in this work. In particular, we first analyze the event-triggered measurements within a set-membership framework. We prove that the estimation error belongs to a bounded ellipsoid determined by the historical measurements and the event-triggering condition. Subsequently, we demonstrate that all admissible systems compatible with the collected data samples can be explicitly represented in the form of quadratic matrix inequalities using the state estimates. With the acquired set of admissible systems, a co-design problem for the data-driven controller and event-triggering condition is solved using the linear matrix inequality technique, with guaranteed closed-loop stability and $\mathcal {L}_{2}$-gain performance. Finally, numerical examples and comparisons are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed event-triggered learning and control approach.},

The use of scheduling matrices is a generalization of the scalar scheduling signals used in the literature, and allows for greater design freedom when scheduling systems, such as in the case of gain-scheduled control. Furthermore, this work extends the existing gain-scheduling results to a broader class of QSR-dissipative systems. The matrix-scheduling of important special cases, such as passive, input strictly passive, output strictly passive, finite $\mathcal {L}_{2}$ gain, very strictly passive, and conic systems are presented. The proposed gain-scheduling architecture is used in the context of controlling a planar three-link robot subject to model uncertainty. A novel control synthesis technique is used to design QSR-dissipative subcontrollers that are gain-scheduled using scheduling matrices. Numerical simulation results highlight the greater design freedom of scheduling matrices, leading to improved performance.},

We consider the control of discrete-time, nonlinear time-varying dynamical systems and establish sufficient conditions for such guarantees. These allow the control design to distribute a limited computational budget over a time horizon and estimate the on-the-go loss in performance due to suboptimality. We study exponential incremental input-to-state stabilizing policies and show that for nonlinear systems, under some mild conditions, this property is directly implied by exponential stability without further assumptions on global smoothness.

We present two control schemes that achieve closed-loop stability without Zeno behavior. The first scheme is implemented under logarithmic quantization and uses the quantized state for the threshold in the triggering condition. The second one is a joint design of zooming quantization and self-triggered sampling, where the adjustable zoom parameter for quantization changes based on intersampling times and is also used for the threshold of self-triggered sampling. In both schemes, the self-triggering mechanism predicts the future state from the quantized data for the computation of the next sampling time.

  abstract     = {The uncontrolled diffusion equation on the unit disk under homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions is only neutrally stable, as zero is an eigenvalue. If we add linear reaction terms, the resulting equation can be unstable. To stabilize such a reaction-diffusion equation to a uniform state, which we conveniently take to be zero, we pose and solve a linear quadratic regulator (LQR). We consider two types of control actuation—boundary arc control and boundary point control. With boundary arc control, we assume that there are $m$ arcs on the boundary of the disk, and we can control the time-varying flux to be spatially constant across each arc, so the control is $m$ dimensional. Boundary point control is the idealized limit of boundary arc control as the length of each arc shrinks to zero, but the gain factor multiplying the control inversely goes to infinity. For each type of actuation, we derive a Riccati PDE whose solution is the Fredholm kernel of the optimal cost of the LQR. We also compute the Fredholm kernel of the corresponding optimal feedback and the first few closed-loop eigenvalues. We show that optimal feedback moves the neutrally stable eigenvalue into the open left half-plane but has little effect on the other eigenvalues as they are already sufficiently stable. We also show how a nonlinear reaction-diffusion equation can be stabilized by nonlinear nonquadatic regulation (nLnQR), which is an extension of Al’brekht’s method to nonlinear distributed parameter systems. We close with an example of how a distributed predator prey system can be stabilized to its equilibrium point. We show that two unilateral controls (controls that can only take nonpositive values) can be almost as stabilizing as one bilateral control (control that can take on both positive and negative values).},

This work considers a more general setting where the constraints can also dynamically adjust in response to changes in the decision variables. Specifically, we consider linear constraints and analyze the effect of decision-dependent distributions in both the objective function and constraints. First, we establish a sufficient condition for the existence of a constrained equilibrium point, at which the distributions remain invariant under retraining. Moreover, we propose and analyze two algorithms: repeated constrained optimization and repeated dual ascent. For each algorithm, we provide sufficient conditions for convergence to the constrained equilibrium point. Furthermore, we explore the relationship between the equilibrium point and the optimal point for the constrained decision-dependent optimization problem. Notably, our results encompass previous findings as special cases when the constraints remain fixed. To show the effectiveness of our theoretical analysis, we provide numerical experiments on both a market problem and a dynamic pricing problem for parking based on real-world data.},

Indeed, to robustly achieve dynamic consensus on the solution estimates and the global descent direction, we embed in our algorithms a distributed implementation of the alternating direction method of multipliers. Such a mechanism is suitably interlaced with a local proportional action steering each agent estimate to the solution of the original consensus optimization problem. First, in the case of ideal networks, by using tools from system theory, we prove the linear convergence of the scheme with strongly convex costs. Then, by exploiting the averaging theory, we extend such a first result to prove that the robust extension of our method preserves linear convergence in the case of asynchronous agents and packet losses. Further, by using the notion of input-to-state stability, we also guarantee the robustness of the schemes with respect to additional, generic errors affecting the agents' updates. Finally, some numerical simulations confirm our theoretical findings and compare our algorithms with other distributed schemes in terms of speed and robustness.},

  abstract     = {The linear-quadratic regulation (LQR) problem with unknown system parameters has been widely studied, but it has remained unclear whether $\tilde{ \mathcal {O}}(\sqrt{T})$ regret, which is the best known dependence on time, can be achieved almost surely. In this article, we propose an adaptive LQR controller with almost surely $\tilde{ \mathcal {O}}(\sqrt{T})$ regret upper bound. The controller features a circuit-breaking mechanism, which falls back to a known stabilizing controller when the input signal or control gain is large, thereby circumventing potential safety breach and ensuring the convergence of the system parameter estimate. Meanwhile, the circuit-breaking is shown to be triggered only finitely often, and hence has a negligible effect on the asymptotic performance of the controller. The proposed controller is also validated via simulation on Tennessee Eastman process (TEP), a commonly used industrial process example.},

  abstract     = {Entropy regularization is an efficient technique for encouraging exploration and preventing a premature convergence of (vanilla) policy gradient (PG) methods in reinforcement learning (RL). However, the theoretical understanding of entropy-regularized RL algorithms has been limited. In this article, we revisit the classical entropy-regularized PG methods with the soft-max policy parametrization, whose convergence has so far only been established assuming access to exact gradient oracles. To go beyond this scenario, we propose the first set of (nearly) unbiased stochastic PG estimators with trajectory-level entropy regularization, with one being an unbiased visitation measure-based estimator and the other one being a nearly unbiased yet more practical trajectory-based estimator. We prove that although the estimators themselves are unbounded in general due to the additional logarithmic policy rewards introduced by the entropy term, the variances are uniformly bounded. We then propose a two-phase stochastic PG algorithm that uses a large batch size in the first phase to overcome the challenge of the stochastic approximation due to the noncoercive landscape, and uses a small batch size in the second phase by leveraging the curvature information around the optimal policy. We establish a global optimality convergence result and a sample complexity of $\widetilde{\mathcal {O}}(\frac{1}{\epsilon ^{2}})$ for the proposed algorithm. Our result is the first global convergence and sample complexity results for the stochastic entropy-regularized vanilla PG method.},

The optimization problem is defined over a network that collectively minimizes a separable cost function with coupled linear constraints. An equivalent optimization problem with auxiliary decision variables and a decoupling structure is proposed. A sensitivity analysis demonstrates that the subgradient information can be computed using local information. This then leads to a subgradient algorithm for updating the auxiliary variables. A case with sparse coupling constraints is further considered, and it is shown to have better memory and communication efficiency. For the specific case of a CBF-induced time-varying quadratic program (QP), an update law is proposed that achieves finite-time convergence. Numerical results involving a static resource allocation problem and a safe coordination problem for a multiagent system demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our proposed algorithms.},

These properties facilitate the use of gradient-based optimization and learning-based control techniques, offering greater efficiency compared to traditional gradient-free methods. We propose three approaches leveraging these robustness properties to control the MAS. The first combines a gradient-based optimization algorithm with a heuristic one (hybrid optimization). The second uses imitation learning to learn a recurrent neural network (RNN) controller from a dataset generated by off-line optimizations. The third approach employs a model-based policy search algorithm to learn an RNN controller directly without a dataset. We showcase our proposed approaches in a simulated example. We demonstrate that, with hybrid optimization, the MAS can achieve a high success rate of compliance with the t-STREL requirement, while the imitation learning approach can be used for real-time control.

Our analysis provides constructive conditions on how multistable network belief equilibria and belief oscillations emerging at a belief-forming bifurcation depend on the communication network graph and belief system network graph.

In this article, we consider a 1-D reaction-diffusion system with boundary input delay and propose a general method for studying the problem of PT boundary stabilization. To achieve this objective, we first reformulate the system as a PDE-PDE cascade system (i.e., a cascade of a linear transport partial differential equation (PDE) with a linear reaction-diffusion PDE), where the transport equation represents the effect of the input delay. We then apply a time-varying infinite-dimensional backstepping transformation to convert the cascade system into a prescribed-time stable (in short PTS) target system. The stability analysis is conducted on the target system, and the desired stability property is transferred back to the closed-loop system using the inverse transformation. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated through numerical simulations.},

A noteworthy feature of the SFJ model is that the opinion dynamics need not be confined to the convex hull of the initial conditions, meaning that cleavage can increase because of the antagonistic interactions. In particular, we show that the concatenated SFJ model can behave as a nonnormal system, in which the opinions transiently distance themselves only to rejoin a common consensus value asymptotically.},

In particular, the proposed P-ZO algorithms can be interpreted as new extremum-seeking algorithms that autonomously drive an unknown system toward a neighborhood of the set of solutions of an optimization problem using only output feedback, while simultaneously guaranteeing that the input trajectories remain in a feasible set for all times. In this way, the P-ZO algorithms can properly handle hard and asymptotic constraints in model-free optimization problems without using penalty terms or barrier functions. Moreover, the proposed dynamics have suitable robustness properties with respect to small bounded additive disturbances on the states and dynamics, a property that is fundamental for practical real-world implementations. Additional tracking results for time-varying and switching cost functions are also derived under stronger convexity and smoothness assumptions and using tools from hybrid dynamical systems.

Second, we further consider the consensus problem under switching topologies, in which the undirected graph (or balanced digraph) is relaxed to be jointly connected (or jointly rooted). By using the Lyapunov approach combined with the related space decomposition technique, we derive sufficient conditions w.r.t. the boundary control gain based on a priori knowledge of possible Laplacian matrices for ensuring the asymptotic consensus.

  abstract     = {Leveraging autonomous systems in safety-critical scenarios requires verifying their behaviors in the presence of uncertainties and black-box components that influence the system dynamics. In this work, we develop a framework for verifying discrete-time dynamical systems with unmodeled dynamics and noisy measurements against temporal logic specifications from an input–output dataset. The verification framework employs Gaussian process (GP) regression to learn the unknown dynamics from the dataset and abstracts the continuous-space system as a finite-state, uncertain Markov decision process (MDP). This abstraction relies on space discretization and transition probability intervals that capture the uncertainty due to the error in GP regression by using reproducible kernel Hilbert space analysis as well as the uncertainty induced by discretization. The framework utilizes existing model checking tools for verification of the uncertain MDP abstraction against a given temporal logic specification. We establish the correctness of extending the verification results on the abstraction created from noisy measurements to the underlying system. We show that the computational complexity of the framework is polynomial in the size of the dataset and discrete abstraction. The complexity analysis illustrates a tradeoff between the quality of the verification results and the computational burden to handle larger datasets and finer abstractions. Finally, we demonstrate the efficacy of our learning and verification framework on several case studies with linear, nonlinear, and switched dynamical systems.},

  abstract     = {It has been reported that local memory information could enhance certain consensus performance of multiagent networks, such as protecting privacy and accelerating consensus. This article aims to investigate whether memory information can improve the robustness and scalability of consensus networks. The robustness is measured by the $\ell _{2}$ gains from disturbances to consensus errors, and the scalability means that consensus can be preserved without retuning control parameters as the network scale increases. Using the linear combination of previous and current iteration states of agents and their neighbors, a memory-based consensus protocol is developed and we provide a necessary and sufficient condition for achieving consensus. Then, we establish the analytic expression of the $\ell _{2}$ gain, which is exclusively determined by control parameters and nonzero minimum and maximum Laplacian eigenvalues. Furthermore, we show how tuning the memory coefficient can improve both robustness and scalability, and the optimal control parameters are further derived. Interestingly, we observe a positive correlation between robustness and scalability.},

  abstract     = {The robust integral of the sign of the error (RISE) control approach results in a powerful continuous controller that yields exponential tracking error convergence despite the presence of time-varying and state-dependent disturbances. However, designing the RISE controller to yield exponential tracking error convergence in the presence of actuator saturation has been an open problem. Although there are existing results that provide a saturation scheme for RISE controllers, these results only guarantee asymptotic tracking error convergence using a Lyapunov-based analysis. In this article, a new design strategy is developed using a projection algorithm and auxiliary filters to yield exponential tracking error convergence. This new strategy does not employ trigonometric or hyperbolic saturation functions inherent to previous saturated (or amplitude limited) controllers. As a result, a Lyapunov-based analysis can be constructed that yields exponential convergence of the tracking errors. Comparative simulation results demonstrate the performance of the developed method in comparison with a baseline controller. The developed method can operate at a lower saturation limit than the baseline method while maintaining stability and achieving exponential tracking error convergence.},

This work focuses on developing stability-guaranteed control methods for MASs with limited data rates. Initially, a distributed optimization algorithm with dynamic quantization is considered for solving the DMPC problem. Due to the limited data rate, the optimization process suffers from inexact iterations caused by quantization noise and premature termination, leading to suboptimal solutions. In response, we propose a novel real-time DMPC framework with a quantization refinement scheme that updates the quantization parameters on-line so that both the quantization noise and the optimization suboptimality decrease asymptotically. To facilitate the stability analysis, we treat the suboptimally controlled MAS, the quantization refinement scheme, and the optimization process as three interconnected subsystems. The cyclic-small-gain theorem is used to derive sufficient conditions on the quantization parameters for guaranteeing the stability of the system under a limited data rate. Finally, the proposed algorithm and theoretical findings are demonstrated in a multi-AUV formation control example.},

Specifically, multiple workers independently perform system rollouts to estimate zero-order policy gradients (PGs), which are then aggregated in a central node for policy updates. Moreover, each worker is allowed to interact with the central node asynchronously, leading to delayed PG estimates. By quantifying the convergence rate of AZOPG, we show a linear speedup property both in theory and simulation, which reveals the advantages of using asynchronous parallel workers in learning policies.},

Such equivalence inherits the well-known property of contracting ODE systems on a specific manifold. Subsequently, we construct an auxiliary ODE system from a DAE system whose trajectories encapsulate those of the corresponding variational DAE system. Using the auxiliary ODE system, a sufficient condition for contraction of the time-varying DAE system is established by using matrix measures, which allows us to estimate a lower bound on the parameters of the auxiliary system.

The existing methods require the initial stabilizing control policy, the persistence of excitation (PE) condition and the data storage to ensure the algorithm convergence. Fundamentally different from them, these restrictions can be relaxed in the proposed method. Specifically, an adaptive parameter is elaborately designed to remove the requirement of the initial stabilizing control policy. Besides, an online data calculation scheme is proposed, which cannot only replace the stored historical data by online data, but also can relax the PE condition to the interval excitation condition.

Different from the existing works, the nonlinear growth rates under consideration are allowed to contain unknown constants and state-input-dependent functions, and the impulse effects are allowed to have unknown sizes. This problem has remained unsolved because it exceeds the coverage of common assumptions in impulsive systems. To this end, we propose a novel logic-based switching gain approach. Specifically, the well-designed logic-based switching mechanism detects the Lyapunov function in real time to adjust the candidate gain online such that the gain grows large enough to effectively dominate the strong nonlinearities and serious uncertainties. Interestingly, the proposed approach removes the restriction on impulse frequency (reflected by the average impulsive interval constant) within the lower-triangular structural framework, and executes only one switching action to obtain the upper bound of the required gain within the upper-triangular structural framework. It is shown that the logic-based switching adaptive controller ensures that all the closed-loop signals are bounded and the system states converge to the origin at an exponential rate. Finally, the effectiveness of the presented results is demonstrated by two representative examples.},

First, this article considers homogeneous agents and presents a class of bipartite synchronization protocols with saturation constraint, which exploits the solution of the time-varying Riccati equation (TVRE) to design the control gain. Then, a time-varying parameter scheduler is tactically designed for TVRE and achieves finite-time bipartite synchronization. Note that the design uses the solution computed online and brings a bit of conservatism in determining the settling time. So, for heterogeneous agents, this article constructs a modified parameter scheduler computed off-line to reduce the conservatism. A class of finite-time bipartite synchronization generators and generator-based finite-time protocols are proposed. It shows that, in both designs, the control input subjects to the bound saturation during convergence even if the gain escapes to infinity towards the settling time. Moreover, the tradeoff among the finite convergence time, the saturation bound of the input, and the initial domain are analyzed explicitly in theory.

To this end, the system is first transformed to a region automaton that is a finite representation of the system's semantics.

  abstract     = {The leader-following consensus problem for multiple uncertain Euler–Lagrange (EL) systems has been extensively studied by two approaches: robust control approach and adaptive control approach. The adaptive control approach has the advantage that it does not require the bounds of unknown parameters be known but has the shortcoming that the control law is of high dimension as every unknown parameter has to be estimated by the local control law of every follower. On the other hand, the robust control has the advantage that every local control law is static but it needs to assume that the bounds of the uncertain parameters and the disturbances are known. Moreover, the validity of the existing robust control approaches relies on some restrictive assumptions on the communication networks and the dynamics of the EL systems. In this article, we consider the leader-following consensus problem for multiple uncertain EL systems where both the bounds of the uncertain parameters and the disturbances are unknown. We solve this problem by augmenting the robust control law with an adaptive control mechanism for estimating the unknown bound of all uncertain parameters and the unknown bound of all disturbances of each follower. As a result, regardless of the dimension of the uncertain parameters and the dimension of the disturbances of each follower, the dimension of each local control law of each follower in this article is only two, which is in contrast with the dimension of the adaptive control approach in the literature. Moreover, we consider jointly connected switching networks which can be disconnected at any time instant.},

The existing results on this topic require stringent condition either on the network connectivity or on the detectability. In contrast, a new form of distributed observer, which ensures that all agents asymptotically estimate the system state under the mild network connectivity condition without increasing the need for the detectability condition, is proposed. Necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of the proposed distributed observer are established. The key to the proposed method is a refined canonical decomposition form of the coefficient matrices of the system which is introduced leveraging the real Jordan canonical form, the Popov–Belevitch–Hautus test, the matrix permutation, and the observable decomposition. The methodology is applied to estimate the positions of a group of Pendubots to demonstrate its effectiveness.},

We represent a complex event as a set of atomic event sequences. For a given atomic event sequence and a complex event to be recognized, we introduce the notion of “partition” to stand for a possible single complex event sequence. By constructing an augmented automaton that includes all possible partitions, we derive a necessary and sufficient condition for the complex event recognition problem to be solvable. We then find an algorithm to check the condition.

The solution is based on a novel distributed reformulation of the original centralized semidefinite outer Löwner-John program, characterized by a nonseparable objective function and global constraints. We prove finite-time convergence to the global minima of the centralized problem in the static case and finite-time bounded tracking error in the dynamic case.

We strengthen this dispiriting slow convergence result by arguing within a simpler algorithmic framework in the perspective of MDP, apart from the usual MCTS description, that the simpler strategy, called “upper confidence bound 1” (UCB1) for multiarmed bandit problems, when employed as an instance of MCTS by setting UCB1’s arm set to be the policy set of the underlying MDP, has an asymptotically faster convergence-rate of $O(\ln n / n)$. We also point out that the UCT-based MCTS in general has the time and space complexities that depend on the size of the state space in the worst case, which contradicts the original design spirit of MCTS. Unless heuristically used, UCT-based MCTS has yet to have theoretical supports for its applicabilities.},

This decomposition allows us to leverage system level synthesis to jointly optimize an affine error feedback, a nominal nonlinear trajectory, and, most importantly, a dynamic linearization error overbound used to ensure robust constraint satisfaction for the nonlinear system. The proposed approach thereby results in less conservative planning compared with state-of-the-art techniques.

Existing methods for finding $U(s)$ use an iterative manual calculation or, when the plant's right half plane zeros are simple, a matrix calculation based on the Nevanlinna–Pick interpolation. We present a new interpolant of the form $ \prod _{i} \left(\frac{s+a_{i}}{s+b_{i}}\right) ^{m_{i}}$, where $a_{i}, b_{i} &gt; 0$. While our final interpolant has integer $m$’s, we allow noninteger or real $m$’s in intermediate calculations. This allows our search to be continuous instead of discrete. Repeated right half plane zeros of the plant are accommodated easily. Real $m$’s are obtained whenever the plant satisfies the PIP, and integer $m$’s are obtained for suitably chosen $a$’s and $b$’s. With numerical optimization of parameters, the $m$’s take moderate integer values. We close with some numerical examples.},

Thus, we focus on the existence of the attacks with complete and energy stealthiness to gradually remove the attack impact on detectors. Since the existence of stealthy attacks is significantly affected by accessing attack channels, the necessary and sufficient conditions of such two types of attacks with constrained channels are proposed by matrix decomposition techniques and the reachability analysis of system dynamics. In general, deeper stealthiness for attacks will require harsher constraints on the system dynamics, while it turns out that the completely-stealthy attacks are achievable under the same existence conditions as the generally stealthy attacks. Meanwhile, we indicate that though launching energy-stealthy attacks needs more demanding system dynamics, they can deceive detectors more deeply.

Therefore, we first propose an auxiliary system for each agent, which is used to seek the solution of the global optimization problem. And we present a novel method to ensure that the states of the auxiliary systems are uniformly bounded. Then, a distributed control protocol is designed for the multiagent systems to enable each agent to track its auxiliary system. It is worthy noting that the auxiliary system and the local tracking controller are coupled and need to be jointly designed. Finally, it is proved that the overall systems are stable and the output of each agent can converge to the solution of the constrained optimization problem. Two examples are provided to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {Collecting the most informative data from a large dataset distributed over a network is a fundamental problem in many fields, including control, signal processing, and machine learning. In this article, we establish a connection between selecting the most informative data and finding the top-$k$ elements of a multiset. The top-$k$ selection in a network can be formulated as a distributed nonsmooth convex optimization problem known as quantile estimation. Unfortunately, the lack of smoothness in the local objective functions leads to extremely slow convergence and poor scalability with respect to the network size. To overcome this deficiency, we propose an accelerated method that employs smoothing techniques. Leveraging the piecewise linearity of the local objective functions in quantile estimation, we characterize the iteration complexity required to achieve top-$k$ selection, a challenging task due to the lack of strong convexity. Several numerical results are provided to validate the effectiveness of the algorithm and the correctness of the theory.},

We consider the decentralized stochastic gradient (DSGD) algorithm and perform a refined convergence analysis. Our analysis is explicit on the similarity between Hessian matrices of local objective functions, which captures the degree of data homogeneity. We illustrate the impact of our analysis through studying the transient time, defined as the minimum number of iterations required for a distributed algorithm to achieve comparable performance as its centralized counterpart. When the local objective functions have similar Hessian, the transient time of DSGD can be as small as ${\mathcal O}(n^{2/3}/\rho ^{8/3})$ for smooth (possibly nonconvex) objective functions, ${\mathcal O}(\sqrt{n}/\rho)$ for strongly convex objective functions, where $n$ is the number of agents and $\rho$ is the spectral gap of graph. These findings provide a theoretical justification for the empirical success of DSGD. Our analysis relies on a novel observation with higher order Taylor approximation for gradient maps that can be of independent interest. Numerical simulations validate our findings.},

However, most averaging results for hybrid systems are limited to first-order methods, hindering their use in systems and algorithms that require high-order averaging techniques, such as hybrid Lie-bracket-based extremum-seeking algorithms and hybrid vibrational controllers. To address this limitation, we introduce a novel high-order averaging theorem for analyzing the stability of hybrid dynamical systems with high-frequency periodic flow maps. These systems incorporate set-valued flow maps and jump maps, effectively modeling well-posed differential and difference inclusions. By imposing appropriate regularity conditions, we establish results on $(T,\varepsilon)$-closeness of solutions and semiglobal practical asymptotic stability for sets. These theoretical results are then applied to the study of three distinct applications in the context of hybrid model-free control and optimization via Lie-bracket averaging.},

The controller aims to maximize an average gain per time unit, supposing that the population is of infinite size. This leads to an ergodic control problem for a “mean-field” Markov decision process in which the state space is a product of simplices, and the population evolves according to controlled linear dynamics. By exploiting contraction properties of the dynamics in Hilbert's projective metric, we prove that the infinite-dimensional ergodic eigenproblem admits a solution and show that the latter is in general nonunique. This allows us to obtain optimal strategies and to quantify the gap between steady-state strategies and optimal ones. In particular, we prove in the 1-D case that there exist cyclic policies—alternating between discount and profit-taking stages—which secure a greater gain than constant-price policies. On numerical aspects, we develop a policy iteration algorithm with “on-the-fly” generated transitions, specifically adapted to decomposable models, leading to substantial memory savings. We finally apply our results to realistic instances coming from an electricity pricing problem encountered in the retail markets and numerically observe the emergence of cyclic promotions for sufficient inertia in customer behavior.},

  abstract     = {Bayes' rule, although a powerful framework for performing state estimation, is often intractable for real-world, nonlinear dynamic systems. As a result, estimation algorithms typically rely on a simplifying assumption, such as the linearity of the measurement model or Gaussianity of the likelihood function. For nonlinear, non-Gaussian systems, these approximations can introduce statistical inconsistencies into the underlying estimator. To mitigate approximation errors, a homotopic scheme is proposed for Bayesian inference. The approach partitions Bayes' rule into smaller, incremental corrections, over which linear and/or Gaussian assumptions are more accurate. The incremental update is limited to zero, yielding a system of first-order differential equations governing the update from prior to posterior for the weights, means, and covariances of a finite Gaussian mixture approximation. The proposed method is shown to be generalizable to both non-Gaussian likelihoods and likelihoods with non-Euclidean support. The homotopic filter is applied to a dynamic state estimation scenario and noticeable improvements over traditional Bayesian filtering techniques (e.g., the unscented Kalman filter and conventional Gaussian mixture filtering) are observed.},

  abstract     = {Linear fusion is a cornerstone of estimation theory. Implementing optimal linear fusion requires knowledge of the covariance of the vector of errors associated with all the estimators. In distributed or cooperative systems, the cross-covariance terms cannot be computed, and to avoid underestimating the estimation error, conservative fusions must be performed. A conservative fusion provides a fused estimator with a covariance bound that is guaranteed to be larger than the true, but computationally intractable, covariance of the error. Previous research by (Reinhardt et al., 2013, 2015) proved that if no additional assumption is made about the errors of the estimators, the minimal bound for fusing two estimators is given by a fusion called covariance intersection (CI). In distributed systems, the estimation errors contain independent and correlated terms induced by the measurement noises and the process noise. In this case, CI is no longer the optimal method. Split covariance intersection (SCI) has been developed to take advantage of the uncorrelated components. This article extends SCI to also take advantage of the correlated components. Then, it is proved that the new fusion provides the optimal conservative fusion bounds for two estimators, generalizing the optimality of CI to a wider class of fusion schemes. The benefits of this extension are demonstrated in simulations.},

Existing research concentrated on how to adjust reward or punishment, as two mutually exclusive tools, during the evolutionary process to achieve the desired proportion of cooperators in the population, and less attention has been given to exploring a combined incentive-based control policy that can steer the system to the full cooperation state at the lowest cost. In this work, we propose a combined incentive scheme in a population of agents whose conflicting interactions are described by the prisoner's dilemma game on complete graphs and regular networks, respectively. By devising an index function for quantifying the implementation costs of the combined incentives, we analytically construct the optimally combined incentive protocol by using optimal control theory. By means of theoretical analysis, we identify the mathematical conditions, under which the optimally combined incentive scheme requires the minimal amount of cost. In addition to numerical calculations, we further perform computer simulations to verify our theoretical results and explore their robustness on different types of network structures.},

This article aims to overcome this common issue existing in the control problem of distributed event-driven dynamic average tracking for networked multiple linear systems with linear reference signals. Utilizing only local information of each agent and its neighbors, an adaptive distributed event-driven estimation algorithm is designed to estimate the average reference signal, and an adaptive distributed event-driven control protocol is developed to regulate the system state. The main contributions of this work are two-fold. First, a couple of dynamic distributed event-triggering mechanisms are proposed. They enable the communication between neighboring agents to be performed intermittently and asynchronously, without sacrificing any convergence precision of the dynamic average tracking error. Second, the event-driven estimation algorithm and control protocol developed for general linear reference signals and multiple agents exhibit robustness to initialization and adaptability in parameter selection, since their operation does not depend on any specific initial conditions and global information. Finally, numerical simulations are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the theoretical results.},

  abstract     = {In the classical communication setting multiple senders having access to the same source of information and transmitting it over channel(s) to a receiver in general leads to a decrease in estimation error at the receiver as compared with the single sender case. However, if the objectives of the information providers are different from that of the estimator, this might result in interesting strategic interactions and outcomes. In this work, we consider a hierarchical signaling game between multiple senders (information designers) and a single receiver (decision maker) each having their own, possibly misaligned, objectives. The senders lead the game by committing to individual information disclosure policies simultaneously, within the framework of a noncooperative Nash game among themselves. This is followed by the receiver's action decision. With Gaussian information structure and quadratic objectives (which depend on the underlying state and receiver's action) for all the players, we show that in general the equilibrium is not unique. We hence identify a set of equilibria and further show that linear noiseless policies can achieve a minimal element of this set. In addition, we show that competition among the senders is beneficial to the receiver, as compared with cooperation among the senders. Further, we extend our analysis to a dynamic signaling game of finite horizon with Markovian information evolution. We show that linear memoryless policies can achieve equilibrium in this dynamic game. We also consider an extension to a game with multiple receivers having coupled objectives. We provide algorithms to compute the equilibrium strategies in all these cases. Finally, via extensive simulations, we analyze the effects of multiple senders in varying degrees of alignment among their objectives.},

  abstract     = {In this article, the problem of remote state estimation is investigated for a class of complex networks with noisy wireless communication channels. The employment of the binary encoding scheme allows for the description of the influence of channel noises as probabilistic bit flips, where the probability of these bit flips is influenced by several factors with the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) being a crucial one. In engineering practice, the method of adjusting the transmission power for each node in a complex network is commonly applied to modify the SNR so as to reduce the data distortion caused by bit flips. Furthermore, due to restricted communication resources, the total available transmission power is often limited particularly in large-scale systems, such as complex networks. Consequently, the allocation of transmission power for all nodes under a total transmission power constraint becomes a concern. Utilizing the ultimately bounded filtering method, we devise a transmission-power-dependent state estimator, by which the combined effect of probabilistic bit flips and transmission power allocation on estimation performance is analyzed. Moreover, the task of co-designing the transmission power allocation scheme and estimator gains is modeled as an optimization problem, which is then addressed through a two-step optimization strategy. The existence of a unique optimal transmission power allocation scheme is also proven. Finally, numerical simulation examples are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed co-design approach.},

By formulating the joint estimation of system state and noise parameters into an optimization problem, a novel adaptive Kalman filter method based on conjugate-computation variational inference, referred to as CVIAKF, is proposed to approximate the joint posterior probability density function of the latent variables. Unlike existing adaptive Kalman filter methods utilizing variational inference in natural parameter space, CVIAKF performs optimization in expectation parameter space, resulting in a faster and simpler solution, particularly for nonlinear state estimation. Meanwhile, CVIAKF divides optimization objectives into conjugate and nonconjugate parts of nonlinear dynamical models, whereas conjugate computations and stochastic mirror-descent are applied, respectively. Notably, the reparameterization trick is employed to minimize the variance of stochastic gradients for the nonconjugate parts. The effectiveness of CVIAKF is validated through synthetic and real-world datasets of maneuvering target tracking.},

In this work, we introduce a notion of safety regret, a properly defined difference between the maximal invariant set of a system with finite preview and that of a system with infinite preview, and show that for linear systems, this quantity corresponding to finite-step preview decays exponentially with the preview horizon. Furthermore, algorithms are developed to numerically evaluate the safety regret of a system for different preview horizons.

However, real-world environments evolve as a result of past agent choices. Unfortunately, the analysis techniques that enabled a rich characterization of the emergent behavior of games played in static environments fail to cope with games played in dynamic environments. To address this problem, we develop a general framework using probabilistic couplings to extend the analysis of static environment games to dynamic ones. Using this approach, we obtain sufficient conditions under which traditional characterizations of Nash equilibria with best response dynamics and stochastic stability with log-linear learning can be extended to dynamic environment games. We obtain conditions under which the emergent behavior of a dynamic game can be characterized by performing the traditional analysis on a reference static environment game.

The initial and final states have certain smoothness and the transfer must occur over a given time interval. We address this motion planning problem by first discretizing the spatial derivatives in the parabolic equation using the finite-difference approximation to obtain a linear ODE in time. Then, using the flatness approach we construct an input signal that transfers this ODE between states determined by the initial and final states of the parabolic equation. We prove that, as the discretization step size converges to zero, this input signal converges to a limiting input signal which can perform the desired transfer for the parabolic equation. While earlier works have applied this motion planning approach to constant coefficient parabolic equations, this is the first work to investigate and establish the efficacy of this approach for parabolic equations with discontinuous spatially varying coefficients. Using this approach we can construct input signals which transfer the parabolic equation from one steady-state to another. We show that this approach yields a new proof for the null controllability of 1-D linear parabolic equations containing discontinuous coefficients and also present a numerical scheme for constructing a null control input signal when the initial state is piecewise continuous.},

This article aims to secure the ubiquitous formation control of MRNs against the replacement attack, where an external robot can replace a formation robot by compromising the communication and physically interfering with the victim simultaneously. To counter this advanced attack, the novel idea of this work is to leverage the physical proximity of the formation shape and the interaction topology among robots for defense design. First, from the physical proximity perspective, we propose the convex neighbor polygon (CNP) to capture the geometric characteristic of the formation robots, and design a CNP-based security mechanism for the robots during the replacement attack. Then, from the interaction perspective, we introduce the indirect controllability to characterize the possibility that the attacker leverages the interaction between robots to deactivate the CNP mechanism, and establish the conditions regarding the topology structure and the attack input to counter the replacement. Finally, based on the obtained conditions, we demonstrate how to design the initiatory topology among the formation robots to enhance the defense performance. Comparative simulations verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

We propose an optimal timing selection problem, in which a leader maximizes public opinion at a specific time by strategically selecting intervention times given a limited number of interventions. Our theoretical analysis shows that more interventions do not necessarily lead to better results, but additional interventions based on the existing intervention certainly do not worsen outcomes. Furthermore, we rigorously prove that intervention timing does not affect effectiveness if and only if all agents have the same weighted degree. Using the monotonicity and submodularity of the objective function, we develop a greedy algorithm and a time-importance-based heuristic algorithm to solve the problem.

The specific model we consider comprises an interconnection of two hybrid subsystems, a timer which triggers the jumps, and some discrete variables to determine the index of the jump maps. The flow equations of these variables are singularly perturbed differential equations and, in particular, a smaller value of the singular perturbation parameter leads to an increase in the frequency of the jump instants. For the limiting value of this parameter, we consider a decomposition that comprises a quasi-steady-state system modeled by a differential equation without any jumps and a boundary-layer system described by purely discrete dynamics. Under appropriate assumptions on the quasi-steady-state system and the boundary-layer system, we derive results showing practical stability of a compact attractor when the jumps occur sufficiently often. As an application of our results, we discuss the control design problem in a network of second-order continuous-time coupled oscillators, where each agent communicates the information about its position to some of its neighbors at discrete times. Using the results developed in this article, we show that if the union of the communication graphs being used for information exchange between agents is connected, then the oscillators achieve practical consensus.},

While the commonly used model referred to as a routing game considers the congestible nature of transportation facilities, existing models fail to account for environmental factors. This article aims at providing a mathematical framework to study strategic interaction between owners of mixed fleets comprising both internal combustion engine vehicle (ICEV) and electric vehicle (EV) trucks. This study introduces a “green” routing game with incomplete information that models strategic interaction among multiple logistic operators. These players face a pollution tax imposed on ICEVs and a potential delayed delivery cost due to EV charging requirements with uncertainty. In contrast to existing models, this novel model captures the players' tradeoff between lengthier congestion delay at charging stations as the share of EV trucks increases and higher pollution costs with increased ICEV usage, with uncertainty determined by a latent state. We first provide equilibrium characterization and present a condition for essential uniqueness. We show that this equilibrium can be computed in a distributed manner using a gradient projection method. We then introduce a public information system that broadcasts real-time information about the latent state. Importantly, we analyze the value of information for providing a condition for the public information to be beneficial. Finally, we present numerical examples to illustrate settings where environmental taxation and information dissemination can improve social welfare.},

Diverging from traditional safety approaches that enforce rigid/hard constraints on system states, our proposal involves integrating soft barrier functions with respect to system inputs and outputs to characterize soft safety. Particularly, when the soft barrier function takes a quadratic form with a constant QSR multiplier—later extended to a dynamic multiplier—we further define QSR safety for a class of nonlinear systems subject to quadratic constraints on input–output signals. The article presents methods for analyzing QSR safety in both open-loop systems with state-space representations and interconnected systems, with these methods subsequently employed to design QSR soft safe systems meeting prescribed safety and stability requirements. Numerical and simulation examples are provided to illustrate the rationality of the concept and the efficacy of the results.},

  abstract     = {To reveal the security vulnerabilities of distributed estimation systems, we investigate the existence of false data injection attacks in this article, where attacks can corrupt sensor data and filter data. Considering the innovation-based and consensus-based strict stealthiness, a successful attack should ensure the divergence of each local estimation and not affect innovation and consensus signals. By analyzing the null space of system matrices, the necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of attacks with such dual strict stealthiness are derived. Furthermore, if attacks can only destroy filter or sensor data, we discuss the existence of filter attacks and obtain that there is no strictly stealthy sensor attack to cause divergent estimation. By introducing a relaxed dual stealthiness constraint, the corresponding existence condition of sensor attacks is developed. Based on the given attack existence conditions, some data protection strategies are offered to defend against the threat of attacks. Simulations are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the theoretical results.},

  abstract     = {This article introduces a novel control framework to address the satisfaction of multiple time-varying output constraints in uncertain high-order multi-input–multi-output (MIMO) nonlinear control systems. Unlike existing methods, which often assume that the constraints are always decoupled and feasible, our approach can handle coupled time-varying constraints even in the presence of potential infeasibilities. First, it is shown that satisfying multiple constraints essentially boils down to ensuring the positivity of a scalar variable, representing the signed distance from the boundary of the time-varying output-constrained set. To achieve this, a single consolidating constraint is designed that, when satisfied, guarantees convergence to and invariance of the time-varying output-constrained set within a user-defined finite time. Next, a novel robust and low-complexity feedback controller is proposed to ensure the satisfaction of the consolidating constraint. Additionally, we provide a mechanism for online modification of the consolidating constraint to find a least violating solution when the constraints become mutually infeasible for some time. Finally, a simulation study validates the proposed approach.},

We propose an effective solution to this semiopen problem using the Krasovski functional (KF) framework in conjunction with a quadratic supply rate function, where both the plant and the estimator can accommodate a finite but unlimited number of pointwise and general DDs with square-integrable kernels. A key contribution is the introduction of a control concept called Kronecker–Seuret decomposition (KSD) for matrix-valued functions, which allows for the factorizations or approximations of any DD integral kernel without introducing conservatism. Moreover, using KSD facilitates the construction of complete-type KFs with integral kernels that can contain any number of weakly differentiable and linearly independent functions. Our proposed solution is formulated as sequential convex semidefinite programming (SDP) problems and is set out in two theorems along with an offline iterative algorithm, which eliminates the need for nonlinear numerical solvers. We show the effectiveness of our method using two challenging numerical experiments, including a system stabilized by a nonsmooth controller.},

To address this issue, differential privacy (DP) has emerged as a standard approach for privacy protection in decentralized online optimization. Regrettably, existing DP solutions for decentralized online optimization face the dilemma of trading optimization accuracy for privacy. In this article, we propose a local-DP solution for decentralized online optimization/learning that ensures both optimization accuracy and rigorous DP, even in the infinite time horizon. Compared with our prior results that rely on a decaying coupling strength to gradually eliminate the influence of DP noises, the proposed approach allows the coupling strength to be time-invariant, which ensures a high convergence speed. Moreover, different from prior results which rely on precise gradient information to ensure optimality, the proposed approach can ensure convergence in mean square to the optimal solution even in the presence of stochastic gradients. We corroborate the effectiveness of our algorithm using multiple benchmark machine-learning applications, including logistic regression on the “mushrooms” dataset and convolutional neural network-based image classification on the “MNIST” and “CIFAR-10” datasets.},

The constraint is incorporated in the objective function to form the Lagrangian with the dual variables updated through the primal–dual method. The consensus-based method is applied to update the parameters of the approximate action-value functions and the dual variables in a distributed manner. The developed algorithm is shown to achieve consensus among the agents and converge to a locally optimal policy. For a certain type of constrained Markov decision processes, the method to ensure the feasibility of the final solution is developed.

As long as the network contains a directed spanning tree, a scale-free protocol guarantees that the network achieves synchronization. If there is no directed spanning tree then synchronization cannot be achieved. But what happens when these scale-free protocols are applied to such a network where the directed spanning tree no longer exists? This article establishes that the network decomposes into a number of basic bicomponents that achieves synchronization among all nodes in this basic bicomponent. On the other hand, nodes which are not part of any basic bicomponent converge to a weighted average of the synchronized trajectories of the basic bicomponents. The weights are independent of the initial conditions and are independent of the designed protocol.},

The introduced L-SERC tests are practically implementable, accurate, and analogous to (and indeed recover) their smooth counterparts. To accomplish this, a novel first-order Taylor-like approximation theory is developed to directly treat nonsmooth (i.e., continuous but nondifferentiable) functions. An L-SERC algorithm is proposed that determines partial structural identifiability or observability, which are useful characterizations in the nonsmooth setting.

We propose conditions that facilitate the construction of the desired (augmented) CBFs and their corresponding secure-by-construction controllers.

  abstract     = {In this article, we consider the problem of finding a meta-learning online control algorithm that can learn across the tasks when faced with a sequence of $N$ (similar) control tasks. Each task involves controlling a linear dynamical system for a finite horizon of $T$ time steps. The cost function and system noise at each time step are adversarial and unknown to the controller before taking the control action. Meta-learning is a broad approach where the goal is to prescribe an online policy for any new unseen task exploiting the information from other tasks and the similarity between the tasks. We propose a meta-learning online control algorithm for the control setting and characterize its performance by meta-regret, the average cumulative regret across the tasks. We show that when the number of tasks are sufficiently large, our proposed approach achieves a meta-regret that is smaller by a factor $D/D^{*}$ compared to an independent-learning online control algorithm, which does not perform learning across the tasks, where $D$ is a problem constant and $D^{*}$ is a scalar that decreases with increase in the similarity between tasks. Thus, when the sequence of tasks are similar the regret of the proposed meta-learning online control is significantly lower than that of the naive approaches without meta-learning. We also present experiment results to demonstrate the superior performance achieved by our meta-learning algorithm.},

  abstract     = {The Friedkin–Johnsen (FJ) model introduces prejudice into the opinion evolution and has been successfully validated in many practical scenarios; however, due to its weighted average mechanism, only one prejudiced agent can always guide all unprejudiced agents synchronizing to its prejudice under the connected influence network, which may not be in line with some social realities. To fundamentally address the limitation of the weighted average mechanism, a weighted-median opinion dynamics has been recently proposed; however, its theoretical analysis is challenging due to its nonlinear nature. This article studies the weighted-median opinion dynamics with prejudice, and obtains the convergence and convergence rate when all agents have prejudice, and a necessary and sufficient condition for asymptotic consensus when a portion of agents have prejudice. These results are the first time to analyze the discrete-time and synchronous opinion dynamics with the weighted median mechanism, and address the phenomenon of the FJ model that connectivity leads to consensus when a few agents with the same prejudice join in an unprejudiced group.},

Any controller that satisfies the CBF condition and ensures that the trajectories of the closed-loop system are well defined makes the zero superlevel set forward invariant. Such a controller is referred to as safe. This article studies the regularity properties of the minimum-norm safe controller as a stepping stone toward the design of general continuous safe feedback controllers. We characterize the set of points where the minimum-norm safe controller is discontinuous and show that it depends solely on the safe set and not on the particular CBF that describes it. Our analysis of the controller behavior as we approach a point of discontinuity allows us to identify sufficient conditions determining whether the controller grows unbounded or remains bounded. Examples illustrate our results, providing insight into the conditions that lead to (un)bounded discontinuous minimum-norm controllers.},

To deal with nonvanishing uncertainties, a novel PT stabilization criterion that incorporates an adaptive method is proposed and a compensation mechanism is established to reduce the errors caused by FTCF, where the parameter adaptive estimation error achieves asymptotically zero convergence. Based on this, an event-triggered PT control strategy is designed to ensure that the closed-loop system achieves PT prescribed-performance tracking, in which a new relative-threshold event-triggered mechanism is constructed to better balance event-triggered errors and saving communication resources. Unlike the existing methods, the proposed method not only guarantees a more accurate control performance that the tracking error reaches zero at the PT moment, but also reduces the computational complexity by pioneering the introduction of FTCF.

In this condition, we put forward the noise intensity classification-based distributed output feedback consensus approach. First, we divide the noise intensity into small-noise intensity and large-noise intensity by designing a demarcation constant, and we introduce the switching property to distinguish them. Then, for the follower, we design the distributed controller based on the established compensator utilizing relevant outputs, and we produce sufficient conditions for the controller to be implemented. Subsequently, a unified Lyapunov function is constructed to prove that all agents can realize the full-state exponential consensus in mean square under the action of the controller.

  abstract     = {The classical linear quadratic regulation (LQR) problem of linear systems by state feedback has been widely addressed. However, the LQR problem by dynamic output feedback with optimal transient performance remains open. The main reason is that the observer error inevitably leads to suboptimal transient performance of the closed-loop system. In this article, we propose an optimal dynamic output feedback learning control approach to solve the LQR problem of linear continuous-time systems with unknown dynamics. In particular, we propose a novel internal dynamics called the internal model. Unlike the classical $p$-copy internal model, it is driven by the input and output of the system, and the role of the proposed internal model is to compensate for the transient error of the observer such that the output feedback LQR problem is solved with guaranteed optimality. A model-free learning algorithm is developed to estimate the optimal control gain of the dynamic output feedback controller. The algorithm does not require any prior knowledge of the system matrices or the system's initial state, thus leading to an optimal solution to the model-free LQR problem. The effectiveness of the proposed method is illustrated using an aircraft control system.},

To resolve the imperfect communication issue over directed networks, a series of noise-robust variants of Push-Pull/AB method have been developed. These methods improve the robustness of Push-Pull method against the information-sharing noise through adding small factors on weight matrices and replacing the global gradient tracking with the cumulative gradient tracking. Based on the two techniques, we propose a new variant of the push-pull method by presenting a novel mechanism of interagent information aggregation, named variance-reduced aggregation (VRA). VRA helps us to release some conditions on the objective function and networks. When the objective function is convex and the sharing-information noise is variance-unbounded, it can be shown that the proposed method converges to the optimal solution almost surely. When the objective function is strongly convex and the sharing-information noise is variance-bounded, the proposed method achieves the convergence rate of $\mathcal {O}(k^{-1+\epsilon })$ in the mean square sense, where $\epsilon$ could be close to 0 infinitely. Simulated experiments on ridge regression and logistic regression problems verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

In this article, the effects of adding weighted edges to a weighted directed path on the algebraic connectivity are investigated. First, it is proved that the Laplacian eigenvalues are only affected by local subgraphs containing the additional edges if some weighted edges are added. Second, considering the case of adding one weighted edge, it is shown that the algebraic connectivity is determined by the range and the weight of the added edge, as well as the distribution of weights along the path. Interestingly, if equal-weight edges are added to a directed path with each arc having equal weight, then the algebraic connectivity can be calculated by a formula of the weight and the maximum range of the edges, which means that the algebraic connectivity of the graph obtained from the path by adding some edges with the same weight is independent of the order of the directed path and the location of the edges added.

The plant is modeled with a labeled Petri net (LPN) and the attacker has the ability to replace and erase the sensor readings in the communication channel. Our goal is to synthesize a maximally permissive and resilient supervisor for the LPN such that the controlled system satisfies the safety specification under attack. Given a set of safe markings, the basis reachability graph (BRG) for control is defined. We prove that the resilient supervisor synthesis problem of LPNs against sensor attacks can be reduced to the SCP of its BRG. In this way, exhaustive enumeration of the reachability space of the LPN is avoided. Then, a method of supervisor synthesis for the BRG is proposed. The complexity of the proposed method remains the same as that of solving a standard SCP without attacks.},

The internal structures of uncertainties, however, are not presumed to cope with diverse random noises and errors arising from networked channels. A necessary and sufficient mean-square stability condition is obtained involving a novel small-gain type characterization. Next, we consider the output feedback controller synthesis problem of networked control systems facing stochastic multiplicative uncertainties and intrinsic channel-wise time delays simultaneously. Based on the obtained mean-square stability condition, further, we develop a fundamental necessary and sufficient condition of mean-square stabilizability explicitly. Such a condition equivalently determines that an open-loop unstable system can be stabilized by output feedback in the mean-square sense. Finally, an analysis of delay robustness is elaborated, in which the mean-square stabilizability condition is extended to the case tolerating uncertain but upper bounded time delays. Overall, this study provides a comprehensive analysis of the robust mean-square stability and mean-square stabilizability of time-delay systems under stochastic uncertainties, which can have practical implications for networked control systems.},

  abstract     = {An important question about finite constrained Markov decision process (CMDP) problem is if there exists a condition under which a uniformly optimal and uniformly feasible policy exists in the set of deterministic, history-independent, and stationary policies that achieves the optimal value at all initial states and if the CMDP problem with the condition can be solved by dynamic programming (DP). This is because the crux of the unconstrained MDP theory developed by Bellman lies in the answer to the same existence question of such an optimal policy to MDP. Even if the topic of CMDP has been studied over the years, there has not been any relevant responsive work since the open question was raised about three decades ago in the literature. We establish (as some answer to this question) that any finite CMDP problem $ \mathsf{M}^{c}$ “contains” inherently a DP-structure in its “subordinate” CMDP problem $\hat{ \mathsf{M} }^{c}$ induced from the parameters of $ \mathsf{M} ^{c}$ and $\hat{\mathsf{M} }^{c}$ is DP-solvable. We drive a policy-iteration-type algorithm for solving $\hat{\mathsf{M} }^{c}$ providing an approximate solution to $ \mathsf{M}^{c}$ or $ \mathsf{M} ^{c}$ with a fixed initial state.},

The algorithm is robust to GE type network disruptions, (re)-initialization errors and agents joining, faulty or leaving the network during time. Necessary and sufficient conditions are formulated to assess almost sure and mean bounded dynamic average consensus according to the characteristics of reference signals. The proposed conditions can be used for design purpose as they relate algorithm step size, network connectivity, and channel quality parameters (e.g., recovery and failure rate) to the algorithm convergence.

There are various techniques established for constrained zonotopes (CZs), although their computational complexity represents a limiting factor on the size of the set descriptions when running the methods in real time. Thus, when running a guaranteed state observer to estimate the state of a dynamical system using CZs, the number of generators and constraints has to be maintained small such that the order reduction procedures can be run within the sampling time. This article resorts to using ellipsoids for portions of the set description, which results in a computationally efficient method for a particular class of constrained convex generators that can also be used for ellipsotopes and CZs. Our approach is shown to have comparable performance and in some cases outperforms existing methods for CZs. We provide numerical examples to illustrate the advantages of our proposed approach, particularly in the context of guaranteed state estimation.},

Second, the corresponding governing equation that characterizes the propagation of the intervehicular spacing errors along the stream is deduced. Based on the resultant intervehicular spacing error propagation equation, the robust internal stability criterion is first derived. Then, the robust string stability condition is elaborated together with a co-design procedure developed for the coupled control gains and the time headway with respect to the model uncertainty bounds in a stepwise decoupling manner. In addition, utilizing the established dependent relation of the feasible time headway on the control gains, the conditions such that the implementable time headway with jerk feedforward is smaller than the lower bound of the time headway for the case without jerk feedforward are obtained. An illustrative example and comparative numerical simulations are finally provided to corroborate the effectiveness of the achieved theoretical results.},

We first show that our distributed asynchronous algorithm converges to the solution of a time-invariant feedback optimization problem in linear time. Next, we show that our algorithm tracks the solution of a time-varying feedback optimization problem within a bounded error dependent upon the movement of the minimizers and degree of asynchrony, which we make precise. These convergence results are extended to quantify agents' asymptotic behavior as the length of their time horizon approaches infinity. Then, to ensure satisfactory network performance we specify the timing of agents' operations relative to changes in the objective function that ensure a desired error bound. Numerical experiments verify these developments and show the utility of feedback optimization under asynchrony.},

Under compactness and regularity conditions, there is no relaxation gap between the infinite-dimensional convex programs and their nonconvex optimal-stopping stochastic problems.

In this work, we consider a class of control-affine nonlinear systems with partially unknown dynamics and aim to introduce an event-triggered learning-based control approach with guaranteed safety and improved data utilization efficiency. Specifically, a randomized learning approach is employed to evaluate the safety of state trajectories by defining and estimating its confidence interval, with data from a multisample of randomly generated state trajectories. Using the proposed randomized learning algorithm, a nominal trajectory with a high probability safety guarantee is designed, thus ensuring the disturbed system states to remain within a prespecified range around the nominal trajectory with a sufficiently high probability. Through removing irrelevant data, a local prediction model around the nominal trajectory is learned with satisfactory precision, and is updated online using an event-triggered learning strategy. Based on the learned model, an efficient data-driven predictive controller is designed to force the system states to evolve within the vicinity of the designed safety nominal trajectory. The effectiveness of the proposed event-triggered learning and data-driven control approaches is validated through comprehensive simulation studies.},

  abstract     = {This work mainly investigates the mean-square stability for a single-input single-output networked linear feedback system. The control signal in the networked system is transmitted over an unreliable channel with data transmission delays and packet dropouts. The transmission delays and packet dropouts are modeled by an independent and identically distributed random process with a known probability mass function. At the channel terminal, a linear receiving strategy is adopted. Based on the unit impulse response of the unreliable channel, we propose a new model of the channel uncertainty induced by the data transmission delays. It is found that the relation between the second-order statistics of the input and output of the channel uncertainty is time-invariant. To explore the effect of the channel uncertainty on the mean-square stability of this system, we introduce a concept called as frequency response of variation of the unreliable channel. With this new concept, a necessary and sufficient condition of the mean-square stability is established for the networked feedback system. It reveals that the mean-square stability is determined by the interaction between the frequency response of variation and the feedback system with a nominal channel. The channel uncertainty induced by data transmission delays is a colored multiplicative uncertainty. When the plant in the networked feedback system is minimum phase, an analytic necessary and sufficient condition is presented for its mean-square stabilizability via output feedback. It turns out that the stabilizability is only determined by the interaction between the frequency response of variation of the channel and unstable poles of the plant. Finally, numerical examples are given to illustrate our results.},

  abstract     = {This article studies controllability and observability problems for a class of mixed-valued probabilistic logical control networks (PLCNs). First, PLCN is transformed into the algebraic state-space representation (ASSR)-form by resorting to the semitensor product method. Then, the formulas are presented to calculate the lower and upper bounds of the transition probability matrix, which further derive the controllability and observability criteria. Furthermore, the ASSR-form of a PLCN can be regarded as a Markov decision process. Using the latter framework, we prove the equivalence between the controllability probability and the optimal state-value function, which is an iteration equation. Besides, the parallel extension technique transforms the observability of PLCNs into the set stabilization of an augmented system. The correspondence between observability probability and optimal state-value function is also derived. Afterward, based on the state-value function, the algorithms via the Q-learning technique are exploited to estimate the controllability and observability probabilities along with obtaining the corresponding optimal control sequences. Finally, all the theoretical results are elaborated via a genetic regulatory p53-Mdm2 network.},

Unlike preexisting approaches—which have tackled the possibility of the receiver (Bob) being non-Bayesian by considering that his thought process is not Bayesian yet known to the sender (Alice), possibly up to a parameter—we let Alice merely assume that Bob behaves “almost like” a Bayesian agent, in some sense, without resorting to any specific model. Under this assumption, we study Alice's strategy when both utilities are quadratic and the prior is isotropic. We show that, contrary to the Bayesian case, Alice's optimal response may not be linear anymore. This fact is unfortunate as linear policies remain the only ones for which the induced belief distribution is known. What is more, evaluating linear policies proves difficult except in particular cases, let alone finding an optimal one. Nonetheless, we derive bounds that prove linear policies are near-optimal and allow Alice to compute a near-optimal linear policy numerically. With this solution in hand, we show that Alice shares less information with Bob as he departs more from Bayesianity, much to his detriment.},

In this article, we study the distributed constrained optimization problem in the presence of five kinds of nonlinearities caused by nonconvex control input constraints, nonconvex interaction constraints, nonuniform step-sizes, nonuniform convex state constraints, and switching graphs. Due to the coupling of these nonlinearities, the interaction balance between agents does not exist anymore and the edge weights are equivalent to being multiplied with time-varying factors, which results in the invalidness of the existing approaches. To decouple the nonlinearities, our approach is to construct an equivalent time-varying system and introduce a chain approach so as to show that the maximum distance from the agent states to the intersection set of the convex constraint state sets with a disturbancelike term decreases as time evolves. By combining the chain approach and a contradiction approach, it is proved that the optimization problem can be solved even when the five kinds of nonlinearities coexist.

Opacity captures whether a system's secret behavior (a subset of the system's behavior that is considered to be critical) can be kept from outside observers. Existing works on opacity for control systems only provide a binary characterization of the system's security level by determining whether the system is opaque or not. In this work, we introduce a quantifiable measure of opacity that considers the likelihood of satisfying opacity for stochastic control systems modeled as general Markov decision processes (gMDPs). We also propose verification methods tailored to the new notions of opacity for finite gMDPs by using value iteration techniques. Then, a new notion called approximate opacity-preserving stochastic simulation relation is proposed, which captures the distance between two systems' behaviors in terms of preserving opacity. Based on this new system relation, we show that one can verify opacity for stochastic control systems using their abstractions (modeled as finite gMDPs). We also discuss how to construct such abstractions for a class of gMDPs under certain stability conditions.},

Instead of a full system model, we have access to a finite number of trajectories of each of the different modes prior to the online operation of the system. On the basis of informative enough measurements, we design an online switched controller that alternates between a mode detection phase and a stabilization phase. Since the currently active mode is unknown, the controller employs online measurements to determine it by implementing computationally efficient tests that check compatibility with the set of systems consistent with the precollected measurements. The stabilization phase applies a stabilizing feedback gain corresponding to the identified active mode and monitors the evolution of the associated Lyapunov function to detect switches. When a switch is detected, the controller returns to the mode detection phase. Under average dwell- and activation-time assumptions on the switching signal, we show that the proposed controller guarantees a practical stability property of the closed-loop switched system.

We apply our method to the reaction–diffusion equation, which serves only as a canonical example but the method is applicable also to other PDEs whose solutions can be decomposed into a slow finite-dimensional part and a fast tail, where the former dominates the evolution in large time. One of the main goals is to estimate the sufficient number of modes needed to stabilize the plant at a prescribed rate.

By randomizing all the action variables, we relax and decompose the problem into multiple subproblems, each of which can be solved independently and lead to scalable heuristics applicable to the original problem. Unlike the past studies assuming relatively simple structures of the underlying stochastic process, here, tracking the patrol trajectories involves stronger dependencies between the stochastic processes, leading to entirely different state and action spaces and transition kernels, rendering the existing methods inapplicable or impractical.

Due to the aggregative structure of the problem and the desired distributed paradigm, the centralized scheme would require global quantities that are not locally available. Thus, our distributed method concurrently updates a proxy of the centralized scheme with a set of local, auxiliary variables named trackers which suitably exploit interagent communication to reconstruct the global quantities. By relying on LaSalle-based arguments, we theoretically prove that our algorithm generates a sequence of trajectories converging to the set of trajectories satisfying the first-order necessary conditions for optimality.

The complexity is influenced by two main factors: coefficients and approximation criteria. On one hand, it is affected by the characteristics of all coefficients. Therefore, we begin by introducing a generalized Gramian-based method for estimating eigenvalue decay, which demonstrates the factors on the reduced order. On the other hand, existing interpolation conditions based on transfer functions must match multiple features with different bases. This article confirms that kernels, as new criteria, can match all features of a large class of nonlinear systems using the same basis as the linear part. We propose a $\mathit{k}$-dimensional refined space for affine input/output nonlinear systems, in contrast to existing methods that require at least an $\mathit{O(nk)}$-dimensional space to match $\mathit{n}$ transfer functions at $\mathit{k}$ interpolating points, even for $\mathbf{0}$th moment matching. To expand the applicability, we present a rank-$\mathbf{R}$ quadratic approximation to transform general systems into normalized affine input/output nonlinear systems. In terms of computational efficiency, we propose a parallel partial columnwise least-squares method to further reduce the rank.

  abstract     = {Recently, the so-called resilient homomorphic encryption (RHE) scheme has been proposed by Fauser and Zhang (2021). Different from the existing homomorphic encryption schemes, the RHE scheme is able to neutralize the effect of an attack injected into the ciphertexts. Thus, a control system can still operate even if an attack takes place. In this article, the RHE scheme is further developed so that it can not only neutralize additive attacks but also satisfy the security requirement of indistinguishability under chosen plaintext attack (IND-CPA). This is achieved by choosing the modulus and the random values in the RHE scheme suitably so that the ciphertexts obtained by the secure resilient homomorphic encryption (SRHE) scheme follow the approximate greatest common divisor (AGCD) distribution. Since it can be shown that the AGCD distribution is computationally indistinguishable from the uniform distribution, the distribution of the ciphertexts obtained by the SRHE scheme is also computationally indistinguishable from the uniform distribution. Therefore, the SRHE scheme satisfies IND-CPA. An approach is given to select the parameters of the SRHE scheme systematically to guarantee the desired security level. Moreover, considering the quantization error caused by the transformation between real values and integer values, a condition for the stability of the closed-loop encrypted control system with a dynamic output feedback controller is provided. Finally, the SRHE scheme is illustrated through the well-established quadruple-tank system and analyzed with respect to the execution time of the encrypted controller, the requirement on network capacity and the usage of storage.},

  abstract     = {Dealing with the uncertain high-frequency gain matrix, denoted as $K_{p}$, is a fundamental problem in multivariable adaptive control systems. In this article, we propose a new solution for parameter estimation and adaptive control for a general class of multi-input–multi-output discrete-time linear time-invariant systems. The proposed scheme does not require any prior knowledge of the sign or bound information of $K_{p}$, and thus, significantly relaxes the design conditions in traditional multivariable adaptive control systems. Compared with the commonly used Nussbaum gain or multimodel techniques for addressing the unknown signs of $K_{p}$, the proposed scheme does not rely on any additional design conditions or any switching mechanism, while still ensuring closed-loop stability and asymptotic output tracking. Specifically, an output feedback adaptive control law is developed based on a matrix decomposition technique, which leads to derivation of a modified estimation error model. Subsequently, a gradient-based parameter update law is formulated only relying on the nonzero condition of the leading principle minors of $K_{p}$. Through designing gain functions and stable filters, the controller is always nonsingular and does not involve any causal contradiction problem. Simulation study showcases the design process and demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.},

  abstract     = {This article addresses the problem of secure recursive state estimation for a networked linear system, which may be vulnerable to interception of transmitted measurement data by eavesdroppers. To effectively protect information security, an encryption-decryption-based communication scheme can be used, but encrypting all the measurement data from sensors can result in significant computational costs. To address this issue, a partial-encryption-decryption (PED) mechanism is proposed to enhance information security with relatively low computational costs. In this mechanism, only part of the transmitted measurement signals are encrypted, and the remaining signals are transmitted directly to the estimator. A Jordan-canonical-form-based approach is developed to select the appropriate parameter for the PED mechanism, and recursive formulas for the state estimator are designed based on the principle of minimum mean squared error. Sufficient conditions are derived to guarantee the ultimate boundedness of the estimation error variance matrix. Finally, the proposed PED-based recursive state estimation scheme is evaluated through two simulation examples to demonstrate its effectiveness.},

By switches, we mean transitions of a solution from one cone to another. Our interest in this class of CLS comes from the optimization-based control of an insulin infusion model, for which the fact that solutions switch finitely many times appears to be key to establish the global exponential stability of the origin. The stability analysis of this class of CLS greatly simplifies compared to general CLS, as all solutions eventually exhibit linear dynamics. The main challenge is to characterize CLS satisfying this finite number of switches property. We first present general conditions in terms of set intersections for this purpose. To ease the testing of these conditions, we translate them as a nonnegativity test of linear forms using Farkas lemma. As a result, the problem reduces to verify the nonnegativity of a single solution to an auxiliary linear discrete-time system. Interestingly, this property differs from the classical nonnegativity problem, where any solution to a system must remain nonnegative (componentwise) for any nonnegative initial condition, and thus requires novel tools to test it. We finally illustrate the relevance of the presented results on the optimal insulin infusion problem.},

  abstract     = {Reachable sets for a dynamical system describe collections of system states that can be reached in finite time, subject to system dynamics. They can be used to guarantee goal satisfaction in controller design or to verify that unsafe regions will be avoided. However, conventional grid-based methods for computing these sets suffer from the curse of dimensionality, which typically prohibits their use for systems with more than a small number of states, even if they are linear. In this article, we demonstrate that local viscosity supersolutions and subsolutions of a Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman equation can be used to generate, respectively, under-approximating and over-approximating reachable sets for time-varying nonlinear systems. Based on this observation, we derive dynamics for a union and intersection of ellipsoidal sets that, respectively, under-approximate and over-approximate the reachable set for linear time-varying systems subject to an ellipsoidal input constraint and an ellipsoidal terminal (or initial) set. The dynamics for these ellipsoids can be selected to ensure that their boundaries coincide with the boundary of the exact reachable set along a collection of solutions of the system. The ellipsoids can be generated with polynomial computational complexity in the number of states, making our approximation scheme computationally tractable for continuous-time linear time-varying systems of relatively high dimension.},

Our main contribution provides complete equilibrium characterizations in the scenario where the private resource budget is drawn from a Bernoulli distribution. We then leverage these characterizations to analyze a resource assignment problem where a commander must decide how to assign resources to subcolonels that compete against opponents in separate General Lotto games. While optimal deterministic policies have previously been characterized in the literature, we broaden the context by deriving optimal randomized policies, which induce asymmetric information General Lotto games. Leveraging our equilibrium characterizations, we demonstrate that randomization can offer a fourfold improvement in the commander's performance over the optimal deterministic assignments.},

In this article, we aim to establish a general framework to handle the bearing-based formation control. The framework offers three features. First, our problem is formulated for general heterogeneous multiagent linear systems, which include high-order integrator systems as a special case. Second, the desired positions of the leaders are generated by some linear autonomous systems called exosystems. Such systems can generate a large class of signals such as polynomials of any degree with unknown coefficients or trigonometric polynomials of arbitrary amplitudes and initial phases. Hence, different leaders can have different time-varying velocities. Third, the target formation can be achieved in the presence of a large class of disturbances. A key technology of our approach is the so-called bearing-based distributed observer for an exosystem. The bearing-based distributed observer, in conjunction with the classical output regulation theory, leads to a unified approach to handling the bearing-based formation for general linear systems and for a large class of formation maneuvers.},

However, the optimality of the derived policies is usually sensitive to model parameters, which are typically unknown and required to be estimated from noisy data in practice. To investigate the sensitivity of optimal policies to these uncertain parameters, we study a robust stochastic control problem of multiagent Markov decision processes where all agents constitute a centralized controller whose goal is to seek a maximal long-term return of all agents and the uncertainty plays a role of disturbance for achieving this goal, and provide a solution concept of robust team optimality for decisions of all agents. To seek such a solution, we develop a robust iterative learning algorithm of policies for all agents and present its convergence analysis. This algorithm, compared with robust dynamic programming, not only possesses a faster convergence rate, but also allows for using approximation calculations to alleviate required computational resources. Moreover, some numerical simulations are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm by extending the model of sequential social dilemmas to uncertain scenarios.},

We propose a systematic decomposition of the perturbed dynamics into slow and fast directions using the kinetic energy metric and the geometry of friction forces. The (slow) invariant manifold is identified by a set of invariance conditions resulting in partial differential equations that generally do not have an analytic solution. We approximate the invariant manifold along with the control inputs with power series and show that using this approximation the invariance conditions admit an inherent recursion. Accordingly, we develop a recursive procedure to perform dynamic input–output linearization of the approximated slow system. We consider the output trajectory tracking problem using a proportional derivative (PD) control law on the $N{\text{th}}$-order approximation of the invariant manifold. Closed-loop stability analysis is performed on both the invariant manifold and the full-phase space of the system. We prove that if the internal dynamics of the nonholonomic system is exponentially stable, then the perturbed system remains asymptotically stable. Moreover, we prove that the output error dynamics is uniformly bounded when applying the approximated control law, with bounds dependent on the control gains and strength of the friction force.

  abstract     = {Preserving the topology from being inferred by external adversaries has become a paramount security issue for network systems, and adding random noises to the nodal states provides a promising way. Nevertheless, recent works have revealed that the topology cannot be preserved under independent identically distributed (i.i.d.) noises in the asymptotic sense. How to effectively characterize the nonasymptotic preservation performance still remains an open issue. Inspired by the deviation quantification of concentration inequalities, this article proposes a novel metric named trace-based variance-expectation ratio. This metric effectively captures the decaying rate of the topology inference error, where a slower rate indicates better nonasymptotic preservation performance. We prove that the inference error will always decay to zero asymptotically, as long as the added noises are nonincreasing and independent (milder than the i.i.d. condition). Then, the optimal noise design that produces the slowest decaying rate for the error is obtained. More importantly, we amend the noise design by introducing one-lag time dependence, achieving the zero state deviation and the nonzero topology inference error in the asymptotic sense simultaneously. Extensions to a general class of noises with multilag time dependence are provided. Comprehensive simulations verify the theoretical findings.},

To address this issue, this article presents a novel APE approach to explore the optimality principle in the design of adaptive laws to obtain an online updated optimal learning gain, which is derived to minimize a cost function of estimation error with two weighting matrices. For this purpose, the estimation error is first reconstructed by using filter operations on the system and introducing several auxiliary variables. Then, two constructive APE algorithms driven by the extracted estimation error are developed. Finally, inspired by the duality of control and estimation, the estimation error dynamics are reformulated as a closed-loop system with an analogous control action to minimize the cost function. By using the Hamiltonian function, a differential Riccati equation is derived to find an optimal solution of learning gain to construct an optimal adaptive law. The robustness of the proposed adaptive laws subjected to disturbances is also analyzed. Comparative numerical simulations are given to illustrate the superiority of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {This article studies the risk-constrained linear–quadratic regulation (Rc-LQR) for a class of interconnected systems (ISs) with non-Gaussian noise. The IS is of a weakly connected topology. The standard linear–quadratic regulation (LQR) controller is optimal in expectation for the quadratic cost and, thus, is called risk-neutral LQR (Rn-LQR) controller. However, the Rn-LQR system may suffer from low-probability yet statistically significant/risky events. The Rc-LQR controller can well trade between the standard LQR performance and the risk cost. The Rc-LQR control problem has been studied for the traditional single systems in the literature. The extension of the Rc-LQR to the ISs has not been reported. The information constraint induced by the system topology complicates the Rc-LQR design of the non-Gaussian ISs. In this article, an orthogonal projection method is proposed to handle the information constraint of the subsystem controller for the non-Gaussian ISs. Then, the Rc-LQR of the non-Gaussian ISs can be successfully designed. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed methods is illustrated by simulations.},

The AMM is called reachable-space reducible when the reachable subspace is not the whole space. Previous results demonstrate that there exists a reduced-order quasi-realization, which may not satisfy the nonnegative constraints, equivalent to a given reachable-space reducible AMM. This article focuses on the structured AMM where the transition and observation matrices have certain structured patterns. Sufficient conditions are derived for a structured AMM to be reachable-space reducible. Moreover, in this case, we show that a real reduced-order realization, instead of a quasi-realization, is obtained by choosing suitable bases for supersets of the reachable space. Finally, examples are given to support our results.},

An optimal predictor-based protocol is developed, and conditions ensuring the mean-square consensus are provided, which are expressed in terms of system dynamics, graph parameters, and the maximal packet loss probability. It is highlighted that consensus condition upon the maximal packet loss probability is also necessary, and the effect of input delay can be completely compensated by the proposed approach.

In this article, we further study the same problem over jointly connected and weight-balanced networks. The existing approaches critically rely on the connectedness of the network and these approaches fail if the network is not connected. To overcome this difficulty, we propose a novel approach to showing the exponential convergence of the output of the closed-loop system to the unknown NE point under a set of mild conditions. For this purpose, we need to establish the exponential stability for a time-varying ancillary system. By the converse Lyapunov theorem, this result guarantees the existence of a time-varying quadratic Lyapunov function for the ancillary system, which in turn leads to the construction of a suitable Lyapunov function for the closed-loop system, thus leading to the solution of the problem. A numerical example is presented to validate the effectiveness of our distributed algorithm.},

The resulted Pythagorean equation enables establishing an adaptive threshold driven by the residual signal and using gap metric as the similarity measure. In this projection-based fault detection framework, the design and implementation of the residual generators and threshold setting can be uniformly addressed, which provides a systematic solution to the detection issues in linear discrete-time varying systems.

We extend the trigonometric change of variables to the 2-D case and further improve it, leading to a dynamic extension with the corresponding proportional-integral controller, where sampled-data control is implemented via a generalized hold device. By employing the corresponding Itô formulas for stochastic ordinary differential equation (ODEs) and PDEs, respectively, and suggesting a nontrivial stochastic extension of the descriptor method, we derive linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) for finding the controller dimension and gain that guarantees the global mean-square $L^{2}$ exponential stability for the full-order closed-loop system.

In order to enhance the transmission reliability, a full-duplex relay is deployed between sensors and the filter, and a self-interference cancellation scheme is introduced to eliminate the interference caused by the relay itself. To accommodate the digital communication manner, a binary encoding scheme is adopted, and a sequence of random variables obeying Bernoulli distribution is introduced to characterize statistical behaviors of the random bit flips. The objective of the addressed problem is to design an unscented Kalman filter over full-duplex relay networks with binary encoding schemes that reflects the impacts of the decoding error, the bit flips, and the full-duplex relay on the filtering performance. A sufficient condition is developed using the matrix inverse lemma to guarantee the exponential mean-square boundedness of the filtering error.

For this setup, we propose a novel decentralized algorithm, called double averaging and gradient projection (DAGP). We achieve global optimality through a novel distributed tracking technique we call distributed null projection. Further, we show that DAGP can be used to solve unconstrained problems with nondifferentiable objective terms with a problem reduction scheme. Assuming only smoothness of the objective terms, we study the convergence of DAGP and establish sublinear rates of convergence in terms of feasibility, consensus, and optimality, with no extra assumption (e.g., strong convexity). For the analysis, we forego the difficulties of selecting Lyapunov functions by proposing a new methodology of convergence analysis, which we refer to as aggregate lower-bounding. To demonstrate the generality of this method, we also provide an alternative convergence proof for the standard gradient descent algorithm with smooth functions.},

By expressing the matrix product $KC$ as a sum of rank one matrices, new necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of a static output feedback controller are derived in terms of linear programming (LP) conditions. One of the advantages of the proposed LP method is that constraints on the system can be dealt with explicitly and easily. Thus, by following this LP approach, other problems are solved, for instance, stabilization with restricted sign control, stabilization with nonsymmetrical constrained control, and stabilization with state constraint. Furthermore, this proposed technique is also used to derive an iterative LP algorithm, which computes the gain matrix of the static output feedback controller. Finally, illustrative examples confirm the effectiveness and applicability of theoretical results, and they also show that the proposed LP method has advantages over existing approaches.},

  abstract     = {In this article, we consider the problem of finding an optimal trajectory of a single agent tasked with harvesting data from multiple mobile sensor nodes in a wireless sensor network. We describe data transmission using a free-space broadcast communication model and formulate an optimal control problem to extract the data from all the nodes in minimal time. In a 1-D mission space, we demonstrate that the optimal motion strategy can be expressed in parametric form. Within this strategy, the agent's motion is determined by a sequence of two modes, alternating between full-speed travel and a motion derived from a parametric convex combination function of sensor velocities. We present two approaches for solving the parametric optimal control problem, a gradient-descent-based scheme and a heuristic search method. The effectiveness of these methods is demonstrated through simulations.},

First, at each sensor node, the system state is transformed into a linear combination of a group of nodes' local observable states, allowing for distributed estimation by estimating a reduced-order state for each node. Second, without requiring initial conditions, the estimation scheme based on generalized modulating functions is employed to estimate each node's local observable state variables through algebraic integral formulas, which are robust against corrupting noises. Subsequently, leveraging the obtained distributed state expression and cross-agent communications with networked delays, a nonasymptotic and robust distributed state estimator is designed. Furthermore, an estimation error bound in noisy cases is provided. Finally, two simulation examples are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach.},

  abstract     = {This article investigates the continuous-time optimal distributed coordination problem with resource allocation constraints for general linear multiagent systems. The study is conducted over a connected undirected graph. By integrating the tracking controller design with global resource allocation optimization, fully distributed state-feedback controllers are proposed to solve optimization problems with output-based local objective functions. The dynamics of the entire multiagent system are well studied at the equilibrium point, which solves the optimal resource allocation and keeps system stable at the same time. The characteristics of the stable states are extracted as additional optimization constraints. By transferring the output-based optimization problem of general linear dynamics systems to a combination of a state-based optimization problem of single-integrator dynamics systems and a state tracking problem, the state equation of the system dynamics can be simplified through appropriate transformation, thereby decreasing the difficulty that brings to the performance index optimization, eliminating assumptions about the structure of the system state matrices, and achieving output stability and performance optimality simultaneously. The team performance, formed by a sum of privately known convex local objective functions and a demand for the total resource, is optimized in a fully distributed fashion. Sufficient conditions are given to ensure that the multiagent system with the proposed algorithms can reach the optimal resource allocation. Numerical simulations are provided to verify the feasibility of the controllers.},

This allows the tedious coordinate transformation in the original filter to be avoided, and significantly reduces the computational cost of numerical integration. Moreover, a detailed computational complexity analysis is provided, we compare scenarios in which these Lie algebraic particle filters can estimate efficiently, and discuss their respective drawbacks.

This challenge is particularly prominent in the global output regulation of nonlinear systems. The current state of the art in global robust adaptive output regulators is limited to achieving a weaker form of integral-ISS. In this article, we present an ISS-based design framework for a class of nonlinear systems with input perturbation via a novel adaptive output regulator. Specifically, we introduce a new adaptive internal model comprising an internal model candidate, a parameter estimator, and a filter. This innovative design transforms the original output regulation problem into a robust stabilization problem. We leverage the cyclic small-gain theorem to design a robust stabilizer, ensuring that the resulting closed-loop system achieves global ISS with the perturbation acting as the input.},

If the aggregation is not a bisimulation, these quotient systems can be further replaced by probabilistic networks based on the relative frequency of transitions, which contain full information about the input–output dynamics. As an inverse problem of aggregation, simulated identification of finite-valued networks is studied. We give an upper bound on the minimal number of nodes required to identify a system, and design an online algorithm to reproduce the internal state dynamics from given input–output sequences.

To improve communication efficiency, a compressed distributed NE seeking (C-DNES) algorithm is proposed to obtain an NE for games, where the differences between decision vectors and their estimates are compressed. The proposed algorithm is compatible with a general class of compressors, including both unbiased and biased compressors. Moreover, our approach only requires the adjacency matrix of the directed graph to be row-stochastic, in contrast to past works that relied on balancedness or specific global network parameters. It is shown that C-DNES not only inherits the advantages of conventional distributed NE algorithms, achieving linear convergence rate for games with restricted strongly monotone mappings, but also saves communication costs in terms of transmitted bits. Finally, numerical simulations illustrate the advantages of C-DNES in saving communication cost by an order of magnitude under different compressors.},

  abstract     = {In this article, we investigate the joint problem of dynamics learning and tracking control for a class of parabolic partial differential equation (PDE) systems with infinite-dimensional uncertain nonlinear dynamics. A new learning control scheme is proposed based on the deterministic learning (DL) theory. One key feature of the proposed scheme is its capability of accurately learning the system's nonlinear uncertain dynamics during real-time tracking control with provable stability and convergence of the overall PDE closed-loop system. Specifically, the Galerkin method is first employed to deal with the infinite dimensionality of the PDE system; a novel DL-based adaptive learning control scheme is then proposed using dual radial basis function neural networks (RBF NNs), in which a pair of RBF NNs are employed to address, respectively, the matched and unmatched components of uncertain nonlinear system dynamics. This control scheme is finally examined on the original PDE system, and it is rigorously proved that: first the PDE system's state tracks the prescribed reference trajectory with guaranteed closed-loop stability and tracking accuracy; and second locally accurate identification of the PDE system's dominant nonlinear uncertain dynamics can be achieved with provable convergence of associated NN weights to their optimal values, thereby the learned knowledge can be ultimately stored and represented by the convergent constant RBF NN models. Based on this, an experience-based control scheme is further proposed, which is capable of recalling the associated learned knowledge in real-time to further improve control performance and reduce computational complexity with maintained provable stabilization. It is worth stressing that although this work is focused particularly on parabolic PDE systems, it is groundbreaking with important technical breakthroughs that would facilitate a more complete extension of the DL theory from traditional ordinary differential equation systems to PDE systems in the future. Extensive simulation studies have been conducted to demonstrate effectiveness and advantage of the proposed results.},

Nevertheless, the question of the tuning of the observer to achieve satisfactory estimation performance remains largely open. In this context, we present a general design framework for the online tuning of the observer gains. Our starting point is a robust nominal observer designed for a general nonlinear system, for which an input-to-state stability property can be established. Our goal is then to improve the performance of this nominal observer. We present for this purpose a new hybrid multi-observer scheme, whose flexibility can be exploited to enforce various desirable properties, e.g., fast convergence and good sensitivity to measurement noise. We prove that an input-to-state stability property also holds for the proposed scheme and, importantly, we ensure that the estimation performance in terms of a quadratic cost is (strictly) improved. We illustrate the efficiency of the approach in improving the performance of given nominal observers in two numerical examples (Van der Pol oscillator and lithium-ion battery model).},

In this article, we propose PIE representations for a large class of such PDE models, including higher order derivatives, boundary-valued inputs, and coupling with ordinary differential equations. The main technical contribution that enables this extension is a generalization of Cauchy's rule for repeated integration. The process of conversion of a complex PDE model to a PIE is simplified through a PDE modeling interface in the open-source software PIETOOLS.

We use the setting of spatially invariant systems as an idealization for which concrete and detailed results are given. Such estimators are known to have a degree of spatial localization in the sense that the estimator gains decay in space, with the spatial decay rates serving as a proxy for how far measurements need to be shared in an optimal distributed estimator. In particular, we examine the dependence of spatial decay rates on problem specifications such as system dynamics, measurement, and process noise variances, as well as their spatial autocorrelations. We propose nondimensional parameters that characterize the decay rates as a function of problem specifications. In particular, we find an interesting matching condition between the characteristic lengthscale of the dynamics and the measurement noise correlation lengthscale for which the optimal centralized estimator is completely decentralized. A new graphical technique—termed the branch point locus—is introduced to quantify spatial decay rates in terms of analyticity regions in the complex spatial frequency plane. Our results are illustrated through two case studies of systems with dynamics modeled by diffusion and the Swift–Hohenberg equation, respectively.},

This allows, e.g., to specify transmission accuracies for individual elements or to constrain the bandwidth available for the transmission of subsets of elements. The method is simple to implement, computationally efficient, and thus, suitable for resource-constrained systems. In addition, a methodology for learning triggering condition parameters from an application-specific dataset is presented. The performance of the proposed approach is quantitatively assessed in terms of data reduction and conservativeness using estimate data derived from real-world vehicle trajectories from the InD-dataset, demonstrating substantial data reduction with minimal overconservativeness.

A graph is introduced to represent the network topology of the large-population system, where nodes represent subpopulations called clusters and edges represent communication relationship. Agents in each cluster are homogeneous and coupled with each other through the global cluster mean field term, which is the stack of average state of agents in each cluster. First, under the centralized information pattern, we use variational analysis to obtain the necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of optimal centralized open-loop controller characterized by a system of forward–backward stochastic differential equations (FBSDEs). Next, by tackling high-dimensional FBSDEs with two coupled low-dimensional Riccati equations, we construct the optimal centralized feedback controller, which composed of the individual state and the global cluster mean field term. Then, under the distributed information pattern, an asymptotically unbiased mean field estimator for each agent is designed to estimate the local cluster mean field terms according to the given network topology. Finally, a set of asymptotically optimal distributed controllers is proposed based on the mean field estimator and its asymptotically social optimality is further proved. A numerical simulation is conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed distributed controller.},

Under such a scheme, the local information is quantized into a bit string by the remote sensor based on a probabilistic quantizer, and then the bit string is transmitted via memoryless binary symmetric channels (BSCs). Due to the communication link noises, the bit flipping occurs in a random manner, and thus, the transmission of the bit string would suffer from specific bit-error rates. With the received bits, a recursive binary-encoding-based quantized Kalman filter is established in the approximate minimum mean-square error (MMSE) sense, which relies on the Gaussian approximation of the conditional probability density function at each iteration. Furthermore, the proposed estimator is shown to be of a Kalman-like type through performance analysis, which exhibits computational complexity comparable to the conventional Kalman filter. Subsequently, a posterior Cramér-Rao lower bound is derived for the proposed binary-encoding-based quantized Kalman filter. The effectiveness of the proposed estimator is demonstrated through numerical results.},

Computability theory provides a unique framework for the formal and mathematically rigorous analysis of algorithms and computing machines. Therefore, computability theory is essential in the domain of safety- and life-critical technology, where the formal verification of automated systems is necessary. Based on the RSE problem, we establish a simple mathematical model of virtual-twin systems that entails a formal notion of integrity (i.e., a state where the virtual entity accurately mirrors its physical counterpart). The model's notion of integrity is related to the question of whether the system under consideration is capable of computing the communication channel's zero-error capacity and corresponding zero-error codes. While this task is known to exceed the theoretical capabilities of Turing computers, we prove its formal feasibility within the model BSS machines. As different authors have proposed BSS machines as potential model of some forms of analog computing, this article serves as a proof-of-concept for a theoretical analog supremacy of unconventional information-processing hardware. Considering recent advances in the development of such hardware, forms of analog supremacy will likely become relevant in the future of cyber-physical systems and information technology.},

Significantly, this result is applicable to both continuous and discrete time systems, unlike many existing local stability results. This theorem is then specialized into simpler-to-compute corollaries and expanded to additional theorems which provide useful additional insights. This article ends with two salient specializations of key results developed herein: one is a type of input-restricted small-gain stability theorem with one system bounded by a linear gain and the other by a quadratic gain; and the other is a type of input-restricted passivity theorem. For both of these specializations, which are not stable for all energy bounded inputs, an example is provided where the feedback interconnection is shown to be stable when the energy of exogenous inputs is below a given threshold.},

  abstract     = {Efforts by the reinforcement learning community to close the sim-to-real gap have resulted in policy optimization objectives, which are distinct from, although related to, existing objectives in robust control, such as ${\mathcal {H}}_{\infty }$ methods. The disparity from the familiar control methods makes it challenging to make rigorous claims about these methods, and to predict the implications on performance of training a policy with a particular level of robustness. This in turn makes selecting the level of robustness a heavily heuristic exercise. Toward addressing these issues, we study the synthesis problem for a control objective consisting of both zero-mean stochastic disturbances, and bounded adversarial disturbances entering the state and measurement under linear dynamics and quadratic cost. We show that this problem admits a linear time-invariant controller that has a form closely related to suboptimal ${\mathcal {H}}_{\infty }$ solutions. We also study the tradeoffs induced by optimizing the control objective in the presence of an adversary by examining how such a solution degrades controller performance in the absence of an adversary. To this end, we provide a quantitative performance–robustness tradeoff analysis in two analytically tractable cases: state feedback control and state prediction. In these special cases, we demonstrate that the severity of the tradeoff depends in an interpretable manner upon system-theoretic properties, such as the spectrum of the controllability Gramian, the spectrum of the observability Gramian, and the stability of the system. This may provide practitioners guidance for determining how much robustness to incorporate based on a priori system knowledge, and conversely how to design systems where the tradeoff is less severe. We empirically validate our results by comparing the performance of the controller against standard baselines, and plotting performance–robustness tradeoff curves.},

The transmission of photons in the waveguide can construct a feedback channel with a delay determined by the length of the waveguide. We model the dynamics of the atomic and photonic states of the cavity-QED system as a linear control system with delay. By tuning the control parameters such as the coupling strengths among the atom, cavity and waveguide, the eigenstates of the quantum system can be exponentially stable or unstable, and the exponential stability of the linear quantum control system with delay is related with the generation of single- and multiphoton states. Besides, when the cavity-QED system is coupled with multiple parallel waveguides, the emitted photons oscillate among different waveguides and the stability of quantum states is influenced by the feedback loop length and coupling strengths among waveguides.},

The key to our approach consists of mapping conditions for positive invariance to sum-of-squares constraints via the Positivstellensatz from real algebraic geometry. Based on these conditions, we propose a framework for verifying safety of CBF-based control including single CBFs, high-order CBFs, multi-CBFs, and systems with trigonometric dynamics and actuation constraints.

Al'brekht's power-series method is used to solve the Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman equations for polynomial approximations to the energy functions. The contribution of this article lies in the numerical implementation of the method based on the Kronecker product, enabling scalability to over 1000 state dimensions. The tensor structure and symmetries arising from the Kronecker product representation are key to the development of efficient and scalable algorithms. We derive the explicit algebraic structure for the equations, present rigorous theory for the solvability and algorithmic complexity of those equations, and provide general purpose open-source software implementations for the proposed algorithms. The method is illustrated on two simple academic models, followed by a high-dimensional semidiscretized PDE model of dimension as large as $n=1080$.},

  abstract     = {Social networks often exert social pressure, causing individuals to adapt their expressed opinions to conform to their peers. An agent in such systems can be modeled as having an (true and unchanging) inherent belief while broadcasting a declared opinion at each time step based on his/her inherent belief and the past declared opinions of his/her neighbors. An important question in this setting is parameter estimation: how to disentangle the effects of social pressure to estimate inherent beliefs from declared opinions. This is useful for forecasting when agents' declared opinions are influenced by social pressure while real-world behavior only depends on their inherent beliefs. To address this, Jadbabaie et al. (2023) formulated the interacting Pólya urn model of opinion dynamics under social pressure and studied it on complete-graph social networks using an aggregate estimator, and found that their estimator converges to the inherent beliefs unless majority pressure pushes the network to consensus. In this work, we study this model on arbitrary networks, providing an estimator that converges to the inherent beliefs even in consensus situations. Finally, we bound the convergence rate of our estimator in both consensus and nonconsensus scenarios; to get the bound for consensus scenarios (which converge slower than nonconsensus), we additionally found how quickly the system converges to consensus.},

The first algorithm obtains $\mathcal {O}(\sqrt{T}(C_{T}+1))$ dynamic regret bound when each local loss is a general convex composite function, where $C_{T}$ is the path variation. If $C_{T}$ can be estimated in advance for convex or strongly convex local loss with a time-varying nonsmooth regularizer, then dynamic regret bounds are, respectively, in the order of $\mathcal {O}(\sqrt{T(C_{T}+1)})$ and $\mathcal {O}(\log T(1+C_{T}))$.

  abstract     = {Distributed online learning has been proven extremely effective in solving large-scale machine learning problems over streaming data. However, information sharing between learners in distributed learning also raises concerns about the potential leakage of individual learners' sensitive data. To mitigate this risk, differential privacy, which is widely regarded as the “gold standard” for privacy protection, has been widely employed in many existing results on distributed online learning. However, these results often face a fundamental tradeoff between learning accuracy and privacy. In this article, we propose a locally differentially private gradient-tracking-based distributed online learning algorithm that successfully circumvents this tradeoff. We prove that the proposed algorithm converges in mean square to the exact optimal solution while ensuring rigorous local differential privacy, with the cumulative privacy budget guaranteed to be finite even when the number of iterations tends to infinity. The algorithm is applicable even when the communication graph among learners is directed. To the best of authors' knowledge, this is the first result that simultaneously ensures learning accuracy and rigorous local differential privacy in distributed online learning over directed graphs. We evaluate our algorithm's performance by using multiple benchmark machine-learning applications, including logistic regression of the “mushrooms” dataset and convolutional neural-network-based image classification of the “MNIST” and “CIFAR-10” datasets, respectively. The experimental results confirm that the proposed algorithm outperforms existing counterparts in both training and test accuracies.},

This problem is called a maximum entropy density control problem. Specifically, the running cost is given by quadratic forms of the state and the control input, and the initial and target distributions are Gaussian. We first reveal that our problem boils down to solving two Riccati difference equations coupled through their boundary values. Based on them, we give the closed-form expression of the unique optimal policy. Next, we show that the optimal density control of a backward system can be obtained simultaneously with the forward-time optimal policy. The backward solution gives another expression of the forward solution. Finally, by considering the limit where the entropy regularization vanishes, we derive the unregularized density control in closed form.},

  abstract     = {This article proposes an iterative distributed model predictive control (DMPC) algorithm for multiple dynamically decoupling linear systems subject to both local state and input constraints, as well as coupling constraints that may be nonconvex (e.g., collision avoidance constraints). This issue has not been extensively explored, particularly in the context of allowing flexible termination of inner optimization problem calculations in accordance with the sample time. In this article, we present a framework based on the successive convex approximation for iteratively solving the MPC optimal control problem (OCP) at each time step. The framework has several attractive features. Specifically, 1) it transforms the MPC OCP into a series of strongly convex subproblems that can be effectively handled by distributed systems; 2) it allows termination at any time, with the potential for solutions to converge to a stationary point of the original nonconvex OCP if the sample time permits; and 3) the customized distributed version of the Newton method used in this framework notably accelerates the convergence rate for solving each subproblem, outperforming existing gradient-based methods. Under reasonable assumptions, recursive feasibility of the proposed DMPC algorithm and stability of the resulting closed-loop systems are ensured. The effectiveness of the DMPC algorithm is demonstrated through a multiagent formation control scenario, which includes collision avoidance among agents and obstacles.},

In a networked system, each agent is capable of constructing its local observer adaptively and transmitting its estimation to neighbors through discrete communication, thereby achieving accurate estimation of the system state while saving communication resources effectively. Specifically, first, the target system state can be decomposed into detectable and undetectable parts through detectability decomposition. Based on this, an adaptive event-triggered distributed observer is proposed, employing event-based adaptive coupling gains without the necessity for any global information. Additionally, a dynamic event-triggered mechanism with a mixed event-triggered threshold is introduced to generate the event-triggered sequence. Subsequently, the effectiveness of the proposed observer is verified through the analysis of estimation error and the assessment of Zeno behavior.

Via standard assumptions for the terminal cost and constraint, we establish distributionally robust long-term and stagewise performance guarantees for the closed-loop system. We further demonstrate that a common choice of the terminal cost, i.e., via the discrete-algebraic Riccati equation, renders the origin input-to-state stable for the closed-loop system. This choice also ensures that the exact long-term performance of the closed-loop system is independent of the choice of ambiguity set for the DRMPC formulation. Thus, we establish conditions under which DRMPC does not provide a long-term performance benefit relative to stochastic MPC. To solve the DRMPC optimization problem, we propose a Newton-type algorithm that empirically achieves superlinear convergence and guarantees the feasibility of each iterate. We demonstrate the implications of the closed-loop guarantees and the scalability of the proposed algorithm via two examples.

Based on the observed value, a feedback controller is proposed, which undergoes quantization and operates on the distributed actuators within the domain. By employing the Lyapunov direct method, it is demonstrated that the observer can accurately track the system state with exponential precision, and the closed-loop system is exponentially converged.

Noninterference is a typical notion to describe information flow security, for which multilevel intransitive noninterference (MINI) is an advanced variant. Since there is a lack of rigorous approach to assessing MINI, this article achieves so via observability theory. For systems modeled by labeled Petri nets (LPNs), two MINI properties, i.e., positive MINI (PMINI) and bipolar MINI (BMINI), are considered. First, a necessary and sufficient condition for their assessment is established via language equivalence. Language equivalence analyses for PMINI and BMINI are based on the existing trace equivalence and the proposed INI bisimulation, respectively. INI bisimulation is more comprehensive to describe negative noninterference than bisimulation. Second, another necessary and sufficient condition is established after the transformation of MINI assessment problem to nonblocking analysis problem. The core of such a problem transformation is the stepwise construction of nonblocking analyzer. This stepwise construction allows MINI assessment to proceed online before terminating at an appropriate time. In addition, this stepwise construction fully employs the concurrency of LPNs so that MINI can be assessed in a multithreaded way. Both online and multithreaded MINI assessments can improve assessment efficiency.},

  abstract     = {In the conventional framework for distributed fault prognosis of discrete-event systems (DESs), it is assumed that observable events are always observed [such case is called static event observations (SEOs)]. However, the assumption may not hold in many DESs such as sensor networks. This article introduces the concept of distributed fault prognosis with dynamic event observations (DEOs), in which observable events are not always observed. Communication models and extended models are constructed, based on which, for each local prognoser, an extended dynamic observation mask with two forms is constructed to capture its aggregate information. In order to verify prognosability subject to DEOs, one algorithm whose complexity is polynomial in the number of states but exponential in the number of local prognosers is presented. Furthermore, one significant condition for prognosability subject to DEOs is derived.

  abstract     = {In this article, we address the problem of learning optimal control policies for systems with uncertain dynamics and high-level control objectives specified as linear temporal logic (LTL) formulas. Uncertainty is considered in the workspace structure and the outcomes of control decisions giving rise to an unknown Markov decision process (MDP). Existing reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms for LTL tasks typically rely on exploring a product MDP state-space uniformly (using e.g., an $\epsilon$-greedy policy) compromising sample-efficiency. This issue becomes more pronounced as the rewards get sparser and the MDP size or the task complexity increase. In this article, we propose an accelerated RL algorithm that can learn control policies significantly faster than competitive approaches. Its sample-efficiency relies on a novel task-driven exploration strategy that biases exploration toward directions that may contribute to task satisfaction. We provide theoretical analysis and extensive comparative experiments demonstrating the sample-efficiency of the proposed method. The benefit of our method becomes more evident as the task complexity or the MDP size increases.},

  abstract     = {State estimation of robotic systems is essential to implementing feedback controllers, which usually provide better robustness to modeling uncertainties than open-loop controllers. However, state estimation of soft robots is very challenging because soft robots have theoretically infinite degrees of freedom while existing sensors only provide a limited number of discrete measurements. This work focuses on soft robotic manipulators, also known as continuum robots. We design an observer algorithm based on the well-known Cosserat rod theory, which models continuum robots by nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs) evolving in geometric Lie groups. The observer can estimate all infinite-dimensional continuum robot states, including poses, strains, and velocities, by only sensing the tip velocity of the continuum robot, and hence it is called a “boundary” observer. More importantly, the estimation error dynamics is formally proven to be locally input-to-state stable. The key idea is to inject sequential tip velocity measurements into the observer in a way that dissipates the energy of the estimation errors through the boundary. The distinct advantage of this PDE-based design is that it can be implemented using any existing numerical implementation for Cosserat rod models. All theoretical convergence guarantees will be preserved, regardless of the discretization method. We call this property “one design for any discretization.” Extensive numerical studies are included and suggest that the domain of attraction is large and the observer is robust to uncertainties of tip velocity measurements and model parameters.},

Identifying the system parameters directly leads to a large number of variables and a highly nonconvex objective function. Instead, our approach introduces a novel reformulation that incorporates biological organizational features and turns the identification problem into a scalar variable optimization of a discontinuous, nonconvex objective function. We prove that the minimizer of the objective function is unique and establish that the solution of the optimization problem leads to the identification of all the desired system parameters. These results are the basis to introduce an algorithm to find the optimizer by searching the different regions corresponding to the domain of definition of the objective function. To deal with measurement noise in sampled data, we propose a modification of the original algorithm whose identification error is linearly bounded by the magnitude of the measurement noise. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms through simulations on synthetic and experimental data.},

However, the three topics have received limited attention in existing literature, both separately and in combination. In this article, we address the multiplayer pursuit–evasion game integrating these key topics, where the pursuers with simple motions strive to capture as many evaders, characterized by damped double integrators, as possible, meanwhile minimizing the task makespan. To this end, we establish an overall framework and sequentially tackle four key issues, leading to an effective solution to the entire problem. We first propose a novel isochron-based method to derive the capture condition and acquire the optimal pursuit and evasion strategies. Then, we enhance the usability of the capture condition by geometrically deriving the analytical form of the pursuer's winning region with respect to a given evader. Third, leveraging the concept of winning regions, we determine the lower boundary of pursuers' sensing range, ensuring sufficient information acquisition for evader allocation while avoiding selection conflicts. Finally, we propose a fully distributed allocation algorithm for each pursuer allowing the pursuer team to converge to the optimal evader allocation. By combining these contributions, we successfully provide an effective solution to the entire problem. Various simulations are conducted to show the effectiveness of our proposed methods.},

  abstract     = {In this article, we study a pursuit–evasion game between two players with heterogeneous kinematics, where the pursuer is with damped double-integrator dynamics and the evader is with single-integrator dynamics. The pursuer aims at capturing the evader as soon as possible, while the evader wants to avoid or delay the capture. Traditional methods to solve pursuit–evasion games rely on the Hamilton–Jacobi–Isaacs (HJI) equations and retrogressive path equations, which are very complicated and nonintuitive, thus failing to obtain a complete solution. To overcome these challenges, we develop an intuitive isochron-based method to thoroughly analyze all possible situations of the game and a concise geometric approach to calculate the optimal strategies, providing a complete solution to this game. Specifically, the isochron-based method effectively leverages three main factors: the players' motion capability, the pursuer's capture capability, and the players' states. Based on these, we analyze the players' superiority and the geometrical features of their isochrones and the intersections, thus acquiring concise conditions that determine the game's outcome. For the success-capture cases, we propose a new geometric approach to calculate the target points of the players and then obtain the closed-loop state feedback optimal pursuit and evasion strategies. We then get the corresponding value function and provide a validation using the HJI equation. For the success-evasion cases, we exploit the intersection of the players' isochrones to design some effective evasion strategies, which ensure that the evader can always avoid or delay the capture. Finally, some numerical simulations are carried out to validate the effectiveness and applicability of our results.},

To reduce tracking errors, the perturbed max-plus linear system is partitioned into a switching max-plus linear system by a permutation matrix. Based on a local maximum terminal set, each mode of the switching max-plus linear system is assigned with an optimal control problem to track the reference signal. Minimum dwell-time is designed to ensure the feasibility of the switching MPC and the stability of the switching max-plus linear system via Hausdorff metric analyses and $\infty$-norm hypercube invariance. Numerical simulations show the effectiveness and superiority of the switching MPC for a perturbed max-plus linear system.},

One of the optimization algorithms is developed based on a multistage structural framework and another is based on a single-stage one. Contrary to the necessary customization of multistage structures in the prescribed-time distributed optimization, this study bridges the gap on the single-stage structured prescribed-time ZGS algorithm. Different from the existing multistage algorithms, the proposed optimization algorithms are proven to converge to the optimal solution within a prescribed-time under more mild conditions. Besides, for the first time, a singularity-free prescribed-time distributed optimization algorithm based on time-varying scaling function is proposed. Furthermore, the robustness of the singularity-free algorithm in rejecting external disturbances is also analyzed. The simulation involving a rendezvous formation problem is elaborated to demonstrate the singularity-free prescribed-time convergence and enhanced robustness of the proposed approaches.},

  abstract     = {This study addresses the intricate challenge of decentralized output-feedback control for stochastic non-triangular nonlinear interconnected systems with unknown time-varying sensor sensitivity in a dynamic event-triggered context. The presence of stochastic disturbances, non-triangular structural uncertainties, and evolving sensor sensitivity distinguishes this problem of global asymptotic stability from conventional event-triggered control scenarios. Existing event-triggered control approaches with static event conditions encounter difficulties in simultaneously ensuring zero tracking/stabilization error and preventing the occurrence of Zeno behavior. In this work, we develop a novel solution to address this complex issue. First, we establish a linear relationship between the state vector of each interconnected subsystem and two error vectors through a unique coordinate transformation. This transformation effectively handles the complexities introduced by non-triangular structural uncertainties. Second, we introduce a decentralized dynamic event-triggered output-feedback control strategy, which involves a state observer and a decentralized output-feedback controller. Unlike conventional event-triggered control methods with static event conditions, this strategy formulates a modified clock-based dynamic triggering mechanism by introducing an auxiliary variable that evolves based on predicted plant state values, while utilizing a clock variable to guarantee the existence of a positive lower bound on inter-execution times. Rigorous Lyapunov analysis confirms the global asymptotic stability in probability of the closed-loop system, with the states and the output of each local subsystem converging to the equilibrium at the origin in probability. In addition, the existence of a minimal dwell-time between triggering instants is guaranteed. Finally, we substantiate the advantages and efficiency of the proposed algorithm through comprehensive numerical simulations.},

  abstract     = {This article explores the problem of distributed optimization for functions that are smooth and nonstrongly convex over directed networks. To address this issue, an improved distributed Nesterov gradient tracking (IDNGT) algorithm is proposed, which utilizes the adapt-then-combine rule and row-stochastic weights. A main novelty of the proposed algorithm is the introduction of a scale factor into the gradient tracking scheme to suppress the consensus error. By the estimate sequence approach, the dynamics of the error due to the unbalance of directed networks is analyzed and it is shown that a sublinear convergence rate can be achieved with a vanishing step size. Numerical results suggest that the performance of IDNGT is comparable to that of the centralized Nesterov gradient descent algorithm.},

  abstract     = {As networked control systems continue to evolve, ensuring the privacy of sensitive data becomes an increasingly pressing concern, especially in situations where the controller is physically separated from the plant. In this article, we propose a secure control scheme for computing linear quadratic control in a networked control system utilizing two networked controllers, a privacy encoder, and a control restorer. Specifically, the encoder generates two state signals blurred with random noise and sends them to the controllers, while the restorer reconstructs the correct control signal. The proposed design effectively preserves the privacy of the control system's state without sacrificing the control performance. We theoretically quantify the privacy-preserving performance in terms of the state estimation error of the controllers and the disclosure probability. In addition, the proposed privacy-preserving scheme is also proven to satisfy differential privacy. Moreover, we extend the proposed privacy-preserving scheme and evaluation method to cases where collusion between two controllers occurs. Finally, we verify the validity of our proposed scheme through simulations.},

  abstract     = {Safety-critical control is significant for autonomous system applications where safety is an utmost concern. Control-barrier-function (CBF)-based control has shown its promising potential and power in delivering formal safe property of dynamic nonlinear systems. The presence of disturbances, whether from matched or unmatched channels, negatively impacts CBF-based control, leading to violations of formal safety guarantees and degraded control performance. In this article, a new safety-critical disturbance rejection control approach is proposed for nonlinear systems subject to unmatched disturbances. Owing to the naturally intractable mismatching condition, the disturbances and their high order derivatives could generate considerable negative impacts on not only the high order CBF but also the control Lyapunov function. To this end, an observer-based disturbance rejection CBF is proposed, delivering a new robust adaptive mechanism to deal with the disturbances. It is shown that by fully exploiting the disturbance estimates and adequately quantifying the impacts of estimation errors, the proposed approach provides attractive properties like formal robust safety guarantee and nominal control performance recovery under unmatched disturbances. Simulation results of path following of a drone suffering wind disturbances verify the benefits of the proposed solution in collision avoidance and retaining nominal safety performance.},

  abstract     = {Iterative learning control (ILC) is a widely used method for controlling repetitive processes. However, its superior learning capability from cycle to cycle is mostly predicated on the assumption that the initial state for all cycles is identical and at the desired point. In engineering practice, this assumption can be overly strict. A more common scenario involves the initial state varying randomly from cycle to cycle. In this article, we propose an optimally selected cycle-based ILC scheme to address the issue of randomly varying initial states. Our approach involves selecting an optimal cycle for iterative learning by evaluating both the potential impact of initial state variations and the tracking performance of historical cycles. By extending the learning mechanism of ILC from learning from the previous cycle to learning from the past optimally selected cycle, our scheme ensures improvement after each iteration of learning. In addition, our scheme has been adapted to accommodate uncertain systems with greater generality. The feasibility and convergence properties of our scheme are investigated through theoretical analysis. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness and other properties of the proposed method through a benchmark numerical example.},

By combining PTUR and a newly proposed fractional-power-type update rule (FTUR), a fractional-proportional-type update rule is proposed to achieve fast convergence for scenarios where the tracking errors can be large or small. The nonlinearity of fractional power term and tracking error accumulation along the time axis introduce considerable challenges in convergence analysis and convergence rate estimation. Thus, a novel analysis method is proposed for nonlinear recursion with perturbation where the convergence is established as per nonlinear tracking-error dynamics. The limits of the tracking errors are demonstrated independent of the system matrices. The relationship between the convergence limit and initial tracking error is examined. Moreover, the local and global convergence rates are provided. The proposed approach exhibits an advantage in terms of the convergence rate compared with PTUR and FTUR. Optimal parameter selection is achieved based on the convergence rate. The theoretical results are confirmed via numerical simulations.},

It incorporates dual asynchronous triggering mechanisms for both the system's output and control input, utilizing a specifically designed adaptive filtering method. The first mechanism aims to reduce the burden on sensor to controller communication, while the second determines when the controller needs to be updated. Particularly, an adaptive neural state observer, reliant on the filtered version of sampled output, is designed to estimate the system's states. Then, differentiable virtual controls are formulated using the estimated states within the framework of the dynamic surface control. Hence, the proposed approach reduces the number of triggering mechanisms and required communication channels compared to existing results. By using the online approximation technique with adaptation schemes, the unknown nonlinearities are approximated without the need for global Lipschitz and linear growth conditions, as well as without encountering overparameterization issue. Finally, the closed-loop stability is analyzed, and proofs for the avoidance of Zeno behavior are provided.},

In this article, we study distributed solvers for network linear equations over a network with node-to-node communication messages compressed as scalar values. Our key idea lies in a dimension compression scheme that includes a dimension-compressing vector and a data unfolding step. The compression vector applies to individual node states as an inner product to generate a real-valued message for node communication. In the unfolding step, such scalar message is then plotted along the subspace generated by the compression vector for the local computations. We first present a compressed consensus flow that relies only on such scalarized communication, and show that linear convergence can be achieved with well excited signals for the compression vector. We then employ such a compressed consensus flow as a fundamental consensus subroutine to develop distributed continuous-time and discrete-time solvers for network linear equations, and prove their linear convergence properties under scalar node communications. With scalar communications, a direct benefit would be the reduced node-to-node communication channel burden for distributed computing.

We derive simultaneous sublinear dynamic regret and constraint violation bounds for OIPM-TEC under standard assumptions. For applications where a given tolerance around optima is accepted, we employ an alternative OCO performance metric—the epsilon-regret—and a more computationally efficient algorithm, the epsilon-OIPM-TEC that possesses sublinear bounds under this metric.

Furthermore, we characterize the interplay among spectral abscissa, eventual exponential positivity, and log-norm. These results, when applied to the repelling signed Laplacians, expand existing knowledge on relationships among the semiconvergence, eventual exponential positivity, and accretiveness in multiple aspects: first, introduce a new element, i.e., the algebraic connectivity of a signed digraph into the relationship; second, accommodate a relaxed version of accretiveness allowing positive diagonal scaling; third, provide a uniform treatment of repelling signed Laplacian and a generalization of it associated with bipartite consensus.},

The leader system is neutrally stable with unknown parameters in its system matrix. Such a leader system can produce discrete-time multitone sinusoidal signals with arbitrary magnitudes, arbitrary phases, and unknown frequencies. The adaptive distributed observer for the uncertain leader system is obtained via a two-step design. In the first step, both the state and the unknown parameters are estimated by the recent techniques for estimating the unknown frequencies of discrete-time multitone sinusoidal signals. In the second step, a state-based adaptive distributed observer over jointly connected switching networks for the estimated unknown parameters and the estimated state of the leader system is designed. It is shown that the proposed output-based adaptive distributed observer is capable of estimating the state of the leader system over jointly connected switching networks, as well as estimating the unknown parameters in the uncertain system matrix of the leader system.

This article concentrates on the examination of error dynamics in affine group systems when exposed to external disturbances or random noises. To this end, we first characterize linear group systems equivalently by homomorphism of its transition flow and linearity of its Lie algebra. Next, we investigate linear group systems that are spread by a Brownian motion in tangent spaces. We show that the Itô stochastic differential equation in the Lie algebra space has a linear drift component and an additional “pinning” term. We apply these findings in analyzing error dynamics, a specific linear group system, with smooth disturbances and random noises. The error dynamics is expressed in the group and the Lie algebra. An explicit and accurate derivation of error dynamics is provided for a concrete example of $SE_{2}(3)$, which plays a vital role in inertial-based navigation and other robotics applications.},

  abstract     = {The optimal filtering problem for general nonlinear and continuous state-observation systems attracts lots of attention in the control theory. The essence of optimal filtering requires solving the Duncan–Mortensen–Zakai (DMZ) equation in a computationally feasible way. Under the pioneering work of Yau-Yau filtering, the DMZ equation is reduced to a pathwise computation of a forward Kolmogorov equation with time-varying initial conditions, which is very challenging. To overcome the computational difficulty, in this article, we proposed a new efficient filtering algorithm consisting of a forward Kolmogorov equation solver based on a physics-informed neural network and a probability density approximator based on generalized Legendre polynomials. By utilizing the advanced deep learning method and classical Galerkin approximation, our developed algorithm not only maintains the high accuracy of the spectral method but also removes massive computational loads in the offline part. Furthermore, the convergence of our method is proved. Numerical experiments have been carried out to verify the feasibility of the new method. Regarding accuracy and efficacy, the newly proposed deep generalized Legendre–Galerkin algorithm outperforms other popular suboptimal methods including the extended Kalman filter and particle filter.},

A set of sensors observe some linear time-invariant systems, and obtain their local state estimates using Kalman filters independently. The local state estimates are encoded in a data packet, which is sent to a remote estimator over packet length-dependent lossy networks, i.e., the packet arrival probability is exponentially decreasing with the packet length. The tradeoff arises between the packet arrival probability and the data size. To improve the remote estimation performance, one needs to design a transmission scheduling policy to determine how many as well as which sensors transmit data at each time instant, which is formulated here as a Markov decision process (MDP) model. There exists an optimal stationary policy for the MDP model, which is verified to possess a threshold structure. Based on this, a structure-aware reinforcement learning algorithm is proposed to approximate the MDP's optimal policy. Some simulation examples are given to verify the optimal policy's structure, and illustrate the performance of the proposed structure-aware reinforcement learning algorithm.},

This article focuses on global exponential stabilization (GES) of a linear parabolic PDE systems on space–time scales by using point-based collocated and noncollocated observations. First, we give the definitions of space–time scales, which contain four cases: continuous time and continuous space, continuous time and discrete space, discrete time and continuous space, and discrete time and discrete space. Wirtinger inequality on space scales is demonstrated, which provides mathematically analytical technique for PDE systems on space–time scales. Second, point-based collocated stabilization control strategy is developed for parabolic PDE systems on space–time scales. Third, considering the fact that sensors and actuators are always placed at different locations, a noncollocated point-based feedback controller is designed by using the observer estimation states. Different from the existing literature, the spatial domain does not need to be divided again according to the actuator and sensor locations. By using the Lyapunov function method, calculus on space–time scales, integration by parts, and Wirtinger inequality on space scales, sufficient criteria are developed such that the closed-loop systems can achieve GES. Finally, numerical simulation examples are presented to show the effectiveness of the developed point-based controllers.},

One of the central challenges tackled in this study pertains to the efficient resolution of these infinite-dimensional TBLMIs. Exploiting the structured nature of such problems, we introduce a consistent truncation method that effectively reduces the problem to a finite-dimensional convex optimization problem. By consistent, we mean that the solution to this finite-dimensional problem allows to closely approximate the infinite-dimensional solution with arbitrary precision. Furthermore, we establish a link between the harmonic framework and the time domain setting, emphasizing the advantages over periodic differential LMIs. We illustrate that our proposed framework is not only theoretically sound but also practically applicable to solving $H_{2}$ and $H_\infty$ harmonic control design problems. To enable this, we extend the definitions of $H_{2}$ and $H_\infty$ norms into the harmonic space, leveraging the concepts of the harmonic transfer function and the average trace operator for Toeplitz block operators.

  abstract     = {Distributed online learning is gaining increased traction due to its unique ability to process large-scale datasets and streaming data. To address the growing public awareness and concern about privacy protection, plenty of algorithms have been proposed to enable differential privacy in distributed online optimization and learning. However, these algorithms often face the dilemma of trading learning accuracy for privacy. By exploiting the unique characteristics of online learning, this article proposes an approach that tackles the dilemma and ensures both differential privacy and learning accuracy in distributed online learning. More specifically, while ensuring a diminishing expected instantaneous regret, the approach can simultaneously ensure a finite cumulative privacy budget, even in the infinite time horizon. To cater for the fully distributed setting, we adopt the local differential-privacy framework, which avoids the reliance on a trusted data curator that is required in the classic “centralized” (global) differential-privacy framework. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first algorithm that successfully ensures both rigorous local differential privacy and learning accuracy. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is evaluated using machine learning tasks, including logistic regression on the the “mushrooms” datasets and convolutional neural network-based image classification on the “MNIST” and “CIFAR-10” datasets.},

  abstract     = {This article proposes a distributed stochastic projection-free algorithm for large-scale constrained finite-sum optimization whose constraint set is complicated such that the projection onto the constraint set can be expensive. The global cost function is allocated to multiple agents, each of which computes its local stochastic gradients and communicates with its neighbors to solve the global problem. Stochastic gradient methods enable low computational complexity, while they are hard and slow to converge due to the variance caused by random sampling. To construct a convergent distributed stochastic projection-free algorithm, this article incorporates variance reduction and gradient tracking techniques in the Frank–Wolfe (FW) update. We develop a novel sampling rule for the variance reduction technique to reduce the variance introduced by stochastic gradients. Complete and rigorous proofs show that the proposed distributed projection-free algorithm converges with a sublinear convergence rate and enjoys superior complexity guarantees for both convex and nonconvex objective functions. By comparative simulations, we demonstrate the convergence and computational efficiency of the proposed algorithm.},

  abstract     = {The problem of reconciling a prior probability law on paths with data was introduced by Schrödinger in 1931 and 1932. It represents an early formulation of a maximum likelihood problem. This specific formulation can also be seen as the control problem to modify the law of a diffusion process so as to match specifications on marginal distributions at given times. Thereby, in recent years, this so-called Schrödinger's bridge problem has been at the center of the uncertainty control development. However, an understudied facet of this program has been to address uncertainty in space (state) and time, modeling the effect of tasks being completed contingent on meeting a certain condition at some random time instead of imposing specifications at fixed times. The present work is a study to extend Schrödinger's paradigm on such an issue, and herein, it is tackled in the context of random walks on directed graphs. Specifically, we study the case where one marginal is the initial probability distribution on a Markov chain, while others are marginals of stopping (first-arrival) times at absorbing states, signifying completion of tasks. We show when the prior law on paths is Markov, a Markov policy is once again optimal to satisfy those marginal constraints with respect to a likelihood cost following Schrödinger's dictum. Based on this, we present the mathematical formulation involving a Sinkhorn-type iteration to construct the optimal probability law on paths matching the spatio-temporal marginals.},

We derive the exact formula for the propagation of mean and covariance expressed in the form of expectation in a continuous-time setting from the governing Fokker–Planck equation. Two approximate propagation methods are discussed based on the exact formula. One uses numerical quadrature and another utilizes the expansion of moments. For the latter one, a closed-form second-order propagation formula is derived. We apply the general method to the joint attitude and angular momentum uncertainty propagation problem and numerical experiments demonstrate the two approximation methods.

  abstract     = {Calculating fixed points of a nonlinear function is a central problem in many areas of science and engineering with applications ranging from the study of dynamical systems to optimization and game theory. Fixed-point iteration methods provide a simple way to calculate the fixed point of nonexpansive mappings and they have been studied extensively. Emerging applications, however, necessitate the study of fixed-point calculation under various perturbations. For instance, in the data-driven identification of dynamical systems, the learning is typically erroneous, which in turn impacts the subsequent fixed calculations, which itself is an essential step for control. Motivated by such settings, in this work, we establish a general mathematical modeling framework for the study of inexact fixed-point iteration (FPI) algorithms. In doing so, we leverage and extend the recent advances in the stochastic optimization literature to derive new methods and convergence analysis results. In particular, adopting this view enables us to present a unified mathematical model to study the impact of inexact computations in both expansive and nonexpansive scenarios, a new technical approach for the analysis of inexact FPI methods, and a new inexact FPI method, which under certain assumptions, enjoys a faster convergence rate than traditional FPI algorithms in the expansive case.},

First, the replay attack effect on the residual is derived and analyzed. The residual change induced by replay attack is characterized explicitly, and the detection performance analysis based on two different test statistics is given. Second, based on the replay attack effect characterization, targeted passive and active designs for detection performance enhancement are proposed. Regarding the passive design, four optimization schemes regarding different cost functions are proposed with optimal parity matrix solutions, and the unified solution to the passive optimization schemes is obtained; the active design is enabled by a marginally stable filter so as to enlarge the replay attack effect on the residual for detection.

Under very general working assumptions (not even assuming that a stationary profile exists), sufficient conditions are established to assess the asymptotic properties of the proposed active learning methodology so that, if the parameters characterizing the action–reaction mappings converge, a stationary action profile is achieved. Such conditions hence act also as certificates for the existence of such a profile.

The constraint is important since most physical systems cannot switch rapidly between different modes and its presence also eliminates the problem of chattering solutions by construction. We investigate the topology of the optimization space and show that it lacks structure to define local minima. A framework is developed for defining optimal solutions as stationary points of optimality functions and an optimality function is proposed for characterizing the necessary conditions for optimality. The challenges posed by dwell time constraints to algorithmic implementation are addressed by exploring the geometric properties of the so-called mode insertion gradient, and a technique is developed for rapidly updating of the mode sequence. The algorithm's convergence to an optimal solution is proved and simulation results are provided to demonstrate the algorithm's efficacy.},

Further, a class of matrix operations induced by fairly common $n$-port network connections is examined. The intrinsic phase properties of networks under such connections are preserved. Concretely, a scalable phase-preserving criterion is proposed, which involves only the phase properties of individual subnetworks, under the matrix operations featured by connections. This criterion ensures that the phase range of the integrated network can be verified effectively and that the scalability of the analyses can be maintained. In addition, the inverse operations of the considered connections, that is, network subtractions with correspondences are examined. With the known phase ranges of the integrated network and one of its subnetworks, the maximal allowable phase range of the remaining subnetwork can also be determined explicitly in a unified form for all types of subtractions.

Our purpose is to design an event-protecting policy such that any user, either legal or unauthorized, who visits a secret state must have an authorization that satisfies the requirement of confidentiality of the state. We consider the criteria of optimality on protecting policies as to protecting policies with a minimum degree of disturbance to legal users' normal operations. To this aim, we use Moore machines to model the dynamics of the clearance level of users when using the system. Then, we develop an auxiliary data structure called the generalized secret automaton, based on which we propose a method to design a protecting policy using the classical supervisory control theory. The minimally disruptive protecting policy is then represented by an automaton called the secret enforcer whose state size is polynomial both in the number of the plant states and the number of secret states in the plant.},

  abstract     = {This article addresses the isolation problem of collusive false data injection attacks and covert attacks for interconnected systems, particularly in establishing generalized graph-dependent conditions responsible for attack isolation. Two algorithms involving inclusive neighbor information and neighbor information are introduced to accomplish attack isolation. By exploring the mechanism of attack collusion, it is found that both the number of subsystems' one-hop neighbors and the size of cycles in the graph play significant roles in attack isolation. Besides, it is interesting to note that their impacts on attack isolation can be mutually compensated. Then, the worst attack collusion cases for the proposed algorithms under different cycle sizes are developed, based on which, several equivalent sufficient yet sharp graph conditions for the isolation of false data injection attacks and covert attacks are, respectively, provided with the notion of $(r,s)$-isolability. It is revealed that the inclusive neighbor information-based algorithm is more effective for isolating false data injection attacks. In contrast, the neighbor information-based algorithm is more suitable for isolating covert attacks. Finally, simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the theoretical results.},

  abstract     = {A variety of practical problems can be modeled by the decision-making process in multiplayer games where a group of self-interested players aim at optimizing their own local objectives, while the objectives depend on the actions taken by others. The local gradient information of each player, essential in implementing algorithms for finding game solutions, is all too often unavailable. In this article, we focus on designing solution algorithms for multiplayer games using bandit feedback, i.e., the only available feedback at each player's disposal is the realized objective values. To tackle the issue of large variances in the existing bandit learning algorithms with a single oracle call, we propose two algorithms by integrating the residual feedback scheme into single-call extragradient methods. Subsequently, we show that the actual sequences of play can converge almost surely to a critical point if the game is pseudomonotone plus and characterize the convergence rate to the critical point when the game is strongly pseudomonotone. The ergodic convergence rates of the generated sequences in monotone games are also investigated as a supplement. Finally, the validity of the proposed algorithms is further verified via numerical examples.},

In particular, to our knowledge, CEDAS enjoys so far the shortest transient time (with respect to the graph specifics) for achieving the convergence rate of centralized SGD, which behaves as $\mathcal {O}(n{C^{3}}/(1-\lambda _{2})^{2})$ under smooth strongly convex objective functions and $\mathcal {O}(n^{3}{C^{6}}/(1-\lambda _{2})^{4})$ under smooth nonconvex objective functions, where $(1-\lambda _{2})$ denotes the spectral gap of the mixing matrix, and $C&gt;0$ is the compression-related parameter.

In this article, we study these dynamics in General Lotto games, a class of models describing the competitive allocation of resources between two opposing players. We propose a two-stage formulation where one of the players has reserved resources that can be strategically preallocated across the battlefields in the first stage of the game as reinforcements. The players then simultaneously allocate their remaining real-time resources, which can be randomized, in a decisive final stage. Our main contributions provide complete characterizations of the optimal reinforcement strategies and resulting equilibrium payoffs in these multistage General Lotto games. Interestingly, we determine that real-time resources are at least twice as effective as reinforcement resources when considering equilibrium payoffs.},

Each subsystem in the network performs its local updates by using the information received from its neighbors, be it possibly outdated. The communication delays with respect to different neighbors are assumed to be arbitrary but bounded. The objective function consists of a twice differentiable coupling term and an aggregated private term. The private function of each subsystem is the sum of two possibly nonsmooth terms, one of which is composed of a linear mapping. We propose a primal-dual fixed point algorithm framework based on the adapted metric for two scenarios where the coupling among subsystems is only enacted by the global objective function and enforced both by the global objective function and the linear mapping. The adapted metric method utilizes an adequate quadratic approximation of the global objective function as the updating step-size to exploit the second-order information. Under some mild assumptions, the convergence of the proposed algorithms is rigorously analyzed based on the quasi-Fejér monotonicity.

  abstract     = {Distributed stochastic nonconvex optimization problems have recently received attention due to the growing interest of signal processing, computer vision, and natural language processing communities in applications deployed over distributed learning systems (e.g., federated learning). We study the setting where the data is distributed across the nodes of a time-varying directed network, a topology suitable for modeling dynamic networks experiencing communication delays and straggler effects. The network nodes, which can access only their local objectives and query a stochastic first-order oracle to obtain gradient estimates, collaborate to minimize a global objective function by exchanging messages with their neighbors. We propose an algorithm, novel to this setting, that leverages stochastic gradient descent with momentum and gradient tracking to solve distributed nonconvex optimization problems over time-varying networks. To analyze the algorithm, we tackle the challenges that arise when analyzing dynamic network systems that communicate gradient acceleration components. We prove that the algorithm's oracle complexity is $\mathcal {O}(1/\epsilon ^{1.5})$, and that under Polyak-$\text{L}$ojasiewicz condition the algorithm converges linearly to a steady error state. The proposed scheme is tested on several learning tasks: a nonconvex logistic regression experiment on the MNIST dataset, an image classification task on the CIFAR-10 dataset, and an NLP classification test on the IMDB dataset. We further present numerical simulations with an objective that satisfies the PL condition. The results demonstrate superior performance of the proposed framework compared to the existing related methods.},

An instance of this scenario is considered: multiple pairs of agents, each pair consisting of a transmitting sensor and a receiver acting as an estimator, communicate strategically over shared communication networks in the presence of a jammer who may launch a denial-of-service attack in the form of packet collisions. Using the so-called coordinator approach, we cast this problem as a zero-sum game between the coordinator, who jointly optimizes the transmission and estimation policies, and a jammer, who optimizes its probability of performing an attack. We consider two cases: point-to-point channels and large-scale networks with a countably infinite number of sensor–receiver pairs. When the jammer proactively attacks the channel, we find that this game is nonconvex from the coordinator's perspective. However, we construct a saddle point equilibrium solution for any multivariate Gaussian input distribution for the observations despite the lack of convexity. In the case where the jammer is reactive, we obtain a customized algorithm based on sequential convex optimization, which converges swiftly to first-order Nash equilibria. Interestingly, we discovered that when the jammer is reactive, it is often optimal to block the channel even when it knows that the channel is idle to create ambiguity at the receiver.},

The parameterized model limits the destructivity because it cannot cover all patterns. To overcome this, we investigate a generalized deception attack model with an unparameterized form. The resulting optimal attack patterns are nonlinear and discontinuous but can be analytically formalized. As a consideration of optimality, we consider two scenarios for attacks: the myopic scenario, focusing on current system time-step performance, and the nonmyopic one, considering both pregiven system time-step and steady-state performance. A suboptimal attack with explicit pattern and estimation error is also proposed to reduce computational load. The conditions for the equivalence of different optimal attack models are provided. Moreover, we summarize typical stealthiness constraints and improve the proposed attacks on them. Finally, numerical simulations validate our theoretical results.},

We first extend the assumption that the steady-state generator is linear in the exogenous signal to the more relaxed assumption that it is polynomial in the exogenous signal. In addition, a nonparametric learning framework is proposed to eliminate the construction of an explicit regressor, as required in the adaptive method, which can potentially simplify the implementation and reduce the computational complexity of existing methods. With the help of the proposed framework, the robust nonlinear output regulation problem can be converted into a robust nonadaptive stabilization problem for the augmented system with integral input-to-state stable inverse dynamics. Moreover, a dynamic gain approach can adaptively raise the gain to a sufficiently large constant to achieve stabilization without requiring any a priori knowledge of the uncertainties appearing in the dynamics of the exosystem and the system. Furthermore, we apply the nonparametric learning framework to globally reconstruct and estimate multiple sinusoidal signals with unknown frequencies without the need for adaptive parametric techniques. An explicit nonlinear mapping can directly provide the estimated parameters, which will exponentially converge to the unknown frequencies. Finally, a feedforward control design is proposed to solve the linear output regulation problem using the nonparametric learning framework.

  abstract     = {The discrete-time, infinite-horizon linear quadratic regulator (LQR) is studied with the objective of establishing a unified perspective on the problem by relying simultaneously on Dynamic Programming and the discrete Minimum Principle. While it is well known that the two strategies independently yield the optimal solution, it is shown here that their combination provides much deeper insights on the nature of the optimal solution and on the strategies by means of which it can be computed. More precisely, the optimal cost, captured by the matrix P, and the feedback gain matrix K are jointly related via the observability matrix of the underlying state/costate (Hamiltonian) dynamics when the state alone is measured. Such an abstract property is then instrumental for deriving alternative characterizations of the optimal solution. First, an algebraic equation, referred to as the policy algebraic equation, is established in the variable K alone and with dimension typically much smaller than the size of the classic ARE arising in discrete-time LQR, although comprising polynomial equations of higher degree. This equation permits the direct construction of the optimal feedback gain (i.e., the actor) without the need for the simultaneous computation of the optimal cost (i.e., the critic). The structure of the policy algebraic equation naturally lends itself to an iterative approach towards its solution, which is restricted to the space of policies alone and which does not require the explicit solution of any intermediate (linear) equation at each step. Furthermore, as a consequence of the above properties, it is possible to derive a Riccati equation in P, although with coefficients defined by polynomial functions of K, with the property that the constant and quadratic terms are symmetric and sign-definite. This aspect is remarkably different from the classic ARE associated to the discrete-time LQR and more akin to the continuous-time counterpart.},

  abstract     = {In this article, we discuss the stabilization problem for stochastic functional differential systems (SFDSs) with sampled-data delayed output. Different from the traditional stochastic systems with continuous or periodic output signals, the system output measurements under consideration are only available at sampling times and they are aperiodic. To deal with this problem, we propose a compensator for the unmeasurable system states and a novel aperiodic event-triggered control (AETC) based on the compensator and output to guarantee a good convergence of the state error. Subsequently, we apply the Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional method (LKFM) to solve the difficulty induced by the delays involved in both SFDSs and output values. Then, the mean-square exponential stabilization of SFDSs is established by AETC and LKFM. Finally, the obtained results are verified by a two-stage chemical reactor system.},

  abstract     = {This technical note deals with asymptotic stabilization of general nonlinear discrete-time systems by dynamic output feedback control. First, a sufficient condition for the dynamic output feedback stabilization with the closed-loop domain of attraction (DOA) estimation is given. For a given Lyapunov function of the plant state and the controller state, the negative-definite domain (NDD) in the $(z_+$-$u$-$z$-$y)$-space is proposed, where $z_+,u,z$, and $y$ denote the next controller state, the current control input, the current controller state and the current plant output, respectively. All points $(z_+;u;z;y)$ in the NDD can make the time difference of the Lyapunov function negative-definite for the controller state $z$ and all plant states in a set of plant states, which is determined by the controller state $z$ and the plant output $y$. The NDD in the $(z_+$-$u$-$z$-$y)$-space could be viewed as an unstructured dynamic output feedback stabilization controller set. And any invariant subset of the projection of the NDD in the $(z_+$-$u$-$z$-$y)$-space onto the $(z$-$x)$-space is an estimate of the DOA for the closed-loop, where $x$ denotes the current plant state. Second, based on the NDD, the controller design problem is converted to a set approximation problem in Euclidean space. Using numerical set approximation methods, dealing with strong nonlinearities is no longer the bottleneck. An estimation method for the unstructured dynamic output feedback stabilization controller set is proposed based on interval analysis, which is a kind of guaranteed numerical method for approximating sets.},

It employs a dynamics update law and a state synchronizing control law, collectively termed a two-level controller, to facilitate synchronization in heterogeneous MASs autonomously. Nevertheless, the existing theory is constrained by the requirement of network topology information for calculating sufficiently large gains to design both the dynamics update law and the state synchronizing control law. To overcome this limitation, this article proposes a novel design for the two-level controller, enabling synchronization without reliance on network topology. The design parameters undergo adaptive updates until achieving autonomous synchronization, herein termed adaptive autonomous synchronization.},

In our method, the generalized blended dynamics is presented to analyze the heterogeneity of systems. By utilizing polynomial Lyapunov functions, the synchronization criterion for HPNSs under directed topology is presented, along with a bounded set where the synchronization errors of HPNSs reside when the time progresses towards infinity. Compared with the existing criteria from quadratic Lyapunov functions, our results yield a smaller bounded set and thus are less conservative. Drawing upon the established criterion, the synchronization verification problem is transformed into a sum-of-squares optimization problem. This consequential optimization problem aligns with the paradigm of convex programming, thereby affording a polynomial-time solvability. The proposed optimization algorithm efficiently generates polynomial Lyapunov functions, facilitating automatic verification of bounded synchronization. Finally, two examples are given to demonstrate the efficacy of our method.},

First, a distributed synergistic hybrid controller is synthesized by leveraging a coadjoint incidence matrix to assign to neighboring agents a hybrid feedback that is based on their relative position. It leads to robust and global asymptotic stability in tree networks. Second, the existence of synergistic potential functions (SPFs)—the key ingredient for deriving the hybrid feedback—is established on compact Lie groups. Moreover, a direct extension shows that there exists an SPF on the noncompact special Euclidean group $\text{SE}(n)$. In contrast with some existing results, the proposed controller removes the invariance condition on the hybrid feedback, and the existence of the SPF ensures that our controller is applicable to many Lie groups of practical interests. Finally, a worked example of multiple planar rigid-body systems on $\text{SE} (2)$ is used to illustrate our approach.},

  abstract     = {Distributed Nash equilibrium (NE) seeking problems for networked games have been widely investigated in recent years. Despite the increasing attention, communication expenditure is becoming a major bottleneck for scaling up distributed approaches within limited communication bandwidth between agents. To reduce communication cost, an efficient event-triggered and compressed distributed NE seeking (ETC-DNES) algorithm is proposed in this article to obtain an NE for games over directed graphs, where the communication efficiency is improved by event-triggered exchanges of compressed information among neighbors. ETC-DNES saves communication costs in both transmitted bits and rounds of communication. Furthermore, our method only requires the row-stochastic property of the adjacency matrix, unlike previous approaches that hinged on doubly stochastic communication matrices. We provide convergence guarantees for ETC-DNES on games with restricted strongly monotone mappings and testify its efficiency with no sacrifice on the accuracy. The algorithm and analysis are extended to a compressed algorithm with stochastic event-triggered mechanism, i.e., stochastic event-triggered and compressed distributed NE seeking (SETC-DNES) algorithm. In SETC-DNES, we introduce a random variable in the triggering condition to further enhance the algorithm efficiency. We demonstrate that SETC-DNES guarantees linear convergence to the NE while achieving even greater reductions in communication costs compared to ETC-DNES. Finally, numerical simulations illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.},

The original contribution of the article is to present two new strong Lyapunov functions (e.g., Lyapunov functions with negative definite derivative), assessing global uniform asymptotic stability properties under the classical persistency of excitation condition. The first Lyapunov function, in the continuous-time framework, covers general (full-order) gradient-like adaptive observer forms—possibly taking into account the presence of projection algorithms and exhibiting piecewise continuous regressor matrices—that have so far restrictively required uniform boundedness of the (everywhere defined) derivative of the regressor. The second Lyapunov function, in the discrete-time framework, owns the advantage feature of being nonanticipating (e.g., characterized by a causal time-varying matrix that is available at runtime), which allows the designer to solve further adaptation issues.},

Then, according to the identified ASP of packets, a scheme is designed to allocate the attack power to each channel with the help of the signal-to-noise ratio such that packets with higher ASP would face attacks with more power. Subsequently, the relationships are characterized among the attack parameter, the ASP, the attack power, and the constrained energy via stochastic analysis method, and the threshold of the attack parameter is designed to achieve a balance between the attack effects and the energy constraint.

  abstract     = {In this article, we consider partially observable timed automata endowed with a single clock. A time interval is associated with each transition specifying at which clock values it may occur. In addition, a resetting condition associated to a transition specifies how the clock value is updated upon its occurrence. This work deals with the estimation of the current state given a timed observation, i.e., a succession of pairs of an observable event and the time instant at which the event has occurred. The problem of state estimation for a timed automaton is reduced to the reachability analysis of an associated zone automaton, which provides a purely discrete event description of the behavior of the timed automaton. An algorithm is formulated to provide an approach for state estimation of a timed automaton based on the assumption that the clock is reset upon the occurrence of each observable transition.},

A system is said to be predictable with respect to a fault pattern if any complete fault behavior in a fault pattern can be correctly predicted before its occurrence, where the fault patterns are characterized by a particular composition of a labeled Petri net with a fault pattern net. In this article, we construct a fault pattern predictor net and a basis fault pattern predictor graph (PG) that is based on the notion of basis markings. By exploiting the fault pattern predictor net and basis fault pattern PG, we derive a necessary and sufficient condition to check fault pattern predictability, which does not need the full reachability/coverability graph of a net, thus gaining practical computation benefits.},

Both state-feedback and static output-feedback cases are investigated. Instead of using case-by-case relaxation techniques, we propose a tractable first-order method to solve this structural optimal control problem. More specifically, we equivalently reformulate it as a constrained optimization and characterize its first-order optimality condition via Karush–Kuhn–Tucker conditions. To solve this NP-hard problem, we propose a novel optimization method, called log-barrier search (LBS), which incorporates a modified log-barrier term into the control objective function and adaptively changes its parameters during the computation process. The convergence of our method is theoretically guaranteed and at least a stationary solution can be obtained. We compare the proposed method with other existing algorithms, where the LBS method shows a very competitive performance in both speed and optimality.},

  abstract     = {In this article, a rate-coded secure control is investigated for the consensus of multiagent systems (MASs). The challenge lies in how to design a broadcasting protocol when the communication bit is critical, and to strengthen its security at the same time. A novel rate-coded algorithm is designed for MASs from an encoding–decoding viewpoint, where only an encrypted $L$-length codeword, instead of the sensitive system information, is transmitted over the network between each agent and its neighbors whenever the triggering condition is satisfied. Unlike most existing results, our algorithm's triggering condition is correlated with the changing rate of the transmitted signal, effectively alleviating the signal distortion problem when its changing rate is too small or too large. As a result, the proposed rate-coded secure control not only ensures uniformly bounded consensus outcomes without continuous monitoring of neighbors' states but also reduces bandwidth requirements and enhances communication security. Finally, simulation results are given to illustrate the effectiveness of our theoretical finding.},

We employ power means and generalized functional means to capture robust satisfaction over space and time. We show that our general definition encompasses many of the STL robustness functions in the literature. Most importantly, we show how that our notion of robustness addresses the two main limitations of the the traditional robustness (masking and locality), which currently limit using robustness-based approaches for control. The proposed robustness function parameters affect the conservativeness of the score, and can be chosen based on desired performance. We show how the proposed robustness can be used for control.},

The salient feature of this work is that the switching communication networks can be uniformly strongly connected, and the communication delays are allowed to be arbitrarily unknown, time-varying and bounded. To solve the problem, we construct a distributed estimator for each player to estimate all players' strategies through unreliable communication networks. Based on the gradient play technique, we design a distributed Nash equilibrium seeking law. Then, we obtain the closed-loop system, which is an interconnected system of a nonlinear subsystem and a linear time-delay subsystem. By constructing the Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional, and designing the controller parameter in the sense of the small gain theorem, we achieve robust Nash equilibrium seeking asymptotically in spite of unreliable communication networks. Finally, we illustrate our proposed approach by its application to practical motion control of mobile robots with an experiment.},

The dual equivalent observability problem is identified. It consists of estimating the boundary sources, localized on a given subset of the boundary, out of boundary measurements on the complementary subset. Classical unique continuation and smoothing properties of the heat equation allow us proving approximate tracking controllability properties and the smoothness of the class of trackable trajectories. We also develop a new transmutation method that allows to transfer known results on the sidewise controllability of the wave equation to the tracking controllability of the heat one. Using the flatness approach, we also give explicit estimates on the cost of approximate tracking control.

In this work, the Bayesian theorem plays a crucial role in two key aspects. First, the unknown uncertainties are estimated using Gaussian process models, which provide mean and variance information incorporated into the QP framework to determine the control inputs. The integration ensures the attainment of desired objectives with high probability. Second, the Bayesian optimization algorithm is employed to optimize some hyperparameters.

  abstract     = {In this work, we consider solving a distributed optimization problem in a multiagent network with multiple agent clusters. In each cluster, the agents manage separable cost functions composed of possibly nonsmooth components and aim to achieve an agreement on a common decision of the cluster. The global cost function is considered as the sum of the individual cost functions associated with affine coupling constraints on the clusters' decisions. To solve this problem, the dual problem is formulated by the concept of Fenchel conjugate. Then, an asynchronous distributed dual proximal gradient algorithm is proposed based on a cluster-based partial and mixed consensus protocol, by which the agents are only required to communicate with their neighbors with communication delays. An ergodic convergence result is provided, and the feasibility of the proposed algorithm is verified by solving a social welfare optimization problem in the simulation.},

Considering the heterogeneity inherent in the MASs, we propose two distributed asynchronous observers. The first observer is developed to estimate the exosystem matrix, and the second is tailored to estimate the exosystem state. To guarantee the estimation accuracy of these observers, we formulate a relationship linking the maximum detection delay of unmatched intervals to the minimum dwell time of matched intervals. Capitalizing on the states from the distributed asynchronous observers and employing the backstepping structure, we proceed to design heterogeneous adaptive controllers for the nonlinear MASs. The effectiveness of our theoretical contributions is substantiated through numerical simulations, which are presented to validate the proposed control strategies.},

The transition and sojourn information is incompletely known, and the coupling between the known (or unknown) transition and unknown (or known) sojourn information renders the known probabilistic information difficult to be fully leveraged, which can lead to conservative results in system analysis and synthesis. To approximate the unknown transition and sojourn information, a polyhedral approach is developed, which facilitates the incorporation of the known probabilistic information coupled with unknown information. Accordingly, novel vertex-based Lyapunov functions are proposed to establish stability conditions. New criteria are established for the stability analysis and control of SMJLSs by incorporating all the jointly known transition and sojourn information, all the known probabilistic information, and both the known and the approximation of unknown probabilistic information, respectively. The effectiveness and superiority of the theoretical results are illustrated by a numerical example and a simulated continuous stirred tank reactor process.},

Our first contribution is to provide sufficient conditions for sISS of networks using sISS vector Lyapunov functions. These sufficient conditions are given in terms of the Lyapunov functions of the agents. We use vector Lyapunov functions, the comparison lemma, and contraction analysis to prove the result.

On the basis of covariant derivative and parallel transport, the original Cucker–Smale model on complete Riemannian manifolds can reach velocity alignment. By using the logarithm map on Riemannian manifolds, an attractive–repulsive force is added, which enables all agents to achieve collision avoidance and aggregation on Riemannian manifolds. The proposed model is consistent with the related model on the Euclidean space. Moreover, five specific complete Riemannian manifolds are taken into consideration: the unit sphere, the hyperboloid, the infinite cylinder, the unit circle, and the special orthogonal group. After giving the corresponding covariant derivatives, parallel transports, and logarithm maps, the explicit forms of the proposed model on those manifolds are shown.

Furthermore, with a dynamic coupling gain on the communications among the interval observers, a completely distributed interval observer is designed without any prerequisite, except for the joint detectability of the partial measurements and the strong connectivity of the properly defined directed sensor network.

Robustness thereby reduces to a problem of subspace estimation. This article proposes a new subspace estimator that recovers the non-persistently exciting (non-PE) subspace for a large class of regressors. This is achieved through a characterization of PE subspaces and the use of principal component analysis. Correctness of the design is proved using matrix perturbation theory, while an averaging analysis demonstrates that the design is best employed as a slow process. We develop a general error model capturing those commonly appearing in adaptive control, and we prove that the $\mu$-modification provides a modular robust design, without compromising error regulation.},

In particular, almost global asymptotic stability of the target location is achieved in 2-D environments under a particular assumption on the obstacles configuration. We also propose a reactive (sensor-based) approach, suitable for real-time implementations in a priori unknown 2-D environments with sufficiently curved convex obstacles, guaranteeing almost global asymptotic stability of the target location.

Resampling is proposed to guarantee the equivalence of lattice PWA approximations and optimal MPC control law at the sample points. Under certain conditions, the disjunctive lattice PWA approximation constitutes a lower bound, whereas the conjunctive version formulates an upper bound of the original optimal control law. The equivalence of the two lattice PWA approximations then guarantees error-free approximations in the domain of interest, which is tested through a statistical guarantee. The performance of the proposed approximation strategy is tested through two simulation examples, and the results show that error-free lattice PWA approximations can be obtained with low offline complexity and small storage requirements.

To optimize the synchronization performance of such networks, topological adjustments have been identified as effective and efficient ways. This article establishes a theoretical framework for accelerating synchronization convergence by introducing an additional directed edge or increasing edge weight to a network topology. The convergence speed is quantified by the second smallest real part of Laplacian matrix eigenvalues, called Fielder eigenvalue. We develop a necessary and sufficient condition guaranteeing synchronization acceleration with additional edge of single-root digraphs, enabling efficiently screening out all such edges through computation of graph Laplacian eigenspace. Moreover, for a sufficiently small topological variation, the accelerating extent and optimal edge can be approximately estimated as well. Numerical examples demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed identification method of acceleration edges.},

In this problem, the system state evolves on the nonlinear manifold $ \mathit{SE}(3)\times \mathbb {R}^{3\mathit{n}}$, on which we design dynamic extensions such that the deterministic VI-SLAM problem can be reformulated—without any approximation—into online constant parameter identification, expressed as a linear regression. This demonstrates that deterministic VI-SLAM can be translated into a linear least squares problem globally and exactly. Based on this observation, we propose a novel SLAM observer, following the recently established parameter estimation-based observer methodology. A notable merit of the proposed observer is its almost global asymptotic stability. Unlike most existing methods, its convergence does not rely on persistency of excitation or uniform complete observability—assumptions commonly used in stability proofs that can be challenging to satisfy in real-world applications.},

In other words, “practical safety” is maintained during the entire period of convergence to the constrained extremum. Our design is based on quadratic program (QP) CBF style filters for safety, which is applied in an average and estimated sense. Using nonsmooth analysis tools, we guarantee semiglobal practical asymptotic (SPA) stability of the global constrained optimum, practical convergence to the safe set if starting in a condition violating the CBF, and practical safety for all time—semiglobally—if starting in safe set. The safety result of this article is analogous with modern notions of SPA stability, guaranteeing that, for any small violation of safety, there exist design coefficients that guarantee that such a small violation is not exceeded. This article outlines a set of sufficient conditions on the barrier and objective functions, and by way of a Lyapunov argument, we demonstrate that nonconvex constrained optimization problems can be solved. We present these results in the setting of a static map and a dynamical system. A simulation example illustrates the results.},

Despite its simple formulation, versatility, and predisposition to be employed in model-free settings, the LP approach has not enjoyed the same popularity as the other methods. The reason is the often poor scalability of the exact LP approach and the difficulty to obtain bounded solutions for a reasonable amount of constraints. We mitigate these issues here, by investigating fundamental geometric features of the LP and developing sufficient conditions to guarantee finite solutions with minimal constraints. In the model-free context, we show that boundedness can be guaranteed by a suitable choice of dataset and objective function.},

We first construct these representations and their stable inverses in the contraction framework and then provide a parameterization of stabilizing controllers by additionally assuming incremental input-to-state stability for the image representation. Focusing on constant metrics results in a parameterization of all stabilizing controllers rendering the closed-loop systems IES with respect to constant metrics if an observer having the same dimension as a system can be designed. After that, we revisit the presented image and kernel representations from the variational viewpoint and show that their variational systems are, respectively, image and kernel representations for the variational systems of the original nonlinear systems. Then, we interpret the proposed controller parameterization in terms of the Youla–Kuc̆era parameterization for variational systems.},

We propose a linear filter and derive the corresponding optimal gain functional in the sense of the minimum mean square error, analogous to the classic Kalman filter. By modeling the measurement noise as a wide-sense stationary random field, we are able to derive the optimal linear filter explicitly, in contrast to previous derivations of Kalman filters in distributed-parameter settings. Interestingly, we find that we need only impose conditions that are finite-dimensional in nature to ensure that the filter is asymptotically stable. The proposed filter is verified via simulation of a linearized system with a pinhole camera sensor.},

Each subsystem has a local observer and access to one part of the measurement outputs and information exchanged through communication networks. This article focuses on the design of distributed observer with jointly connected directed switching networks. The problem presents challenges due to passive switching modes and the open-loop unboundedness that results from local observability. To overcome these challenges, we develop a network transformation mapping method whereby each local observer can classify itself into an independent subgraph based on independent judgment. Next, an observable decomposition and reorganization method is developed for the digraph case to ensure that each subgraph possesses independent dynamic properties. Asymptotic omniscience is then proven using a developed recursive proof method. This article includes many previous results as special cases, because most are only suitable for undirected switching topologies or fast-switching cases. An adaptive coupling gain design is proposed to simplify the calculation and verification of conditions that guarantee asymptotic omniscience. Finally, simulation results with the power system show the validity of the developed theory.},

The convergence of the EM algorithm for MAP estimation is investigated, and it is proven that the sequence of estimates converges to a local optimal solution.

A novel concept of modal functional observability coinciding with the notion of modal observability is proposed. This notion introduces necessary and sufficient conditions for functional observability and detectability in a unified way without resorting to system observability decomposition, and facilitates the design of a functionally observable/detectable system. Afterward, SFO is redefined rigorously from a generic perspective, contrarily to the definition of structural observability. A complete graph-theoretic characterization for SFO is proposed. Based on these results, the problems of selecting the minimal sensors from a prior set to achieve functional observability and SFO are shown to be NP-hard. Nevertheless, supermodular set functions are established, leading to greedy heuristics that can find approximation solutions to these problems with provable guarantees in polynomial time. A closed-form solution along with a constructive procedure is also given for the unconstrained case on systems with diagonalizable state matrices. Notably, our results also yield a polynomial-time verifiable case for structural target controllability, a problem that may be hard otherwise.},

Without using the model or its simulator, the proposed approach can learn a piecewise affine Lyapunov function with a finite and fixed offline dataset. The learnt Lyapunov function is robust to any dynamics that are consistent with the ofline dataset, and its computation is based on second-order cone programming.

The proposed approach introduces a new type of integral transformation to tackle in-domain couplings in the different subsystems while guaranteeing a “clear actuation path” between the control input and the different subsystems. Then, it is possible to state several essential properties of each subsystem: output trajectory tracking, input-to-state stability, and predictability (the possibility of designing a state prediction). We recursively design a stabilizing state-feedback controller by combining these properties. We then design a state observer that reconstructs delayed values of the states.

In this article, we propose the first receding horizon scheme based on the repeated computation of finite horizon regret-optimal policies, and we establish stability and safety guarantees for the resulting closed-loop system. Our derivations combine novel monotonicity properties of clairvoyant policies with suitable terminal ingredients. We prove that our scheme is recursively feasible, stabilizing, and that it achieves bounded regret relative to the infinite horizon clairvoyant policy. Last, we show that the policy optimization problem can be solved efficiently through convex–concave programming.

We provide simulation relations for enabling correct-by-design control refinement that are founded on coupling uncertainties of stochastic systems via subprobability measures.

  abstract     = {This article presents a new paradigm to stabilize uncertain stochastic linear systems. Herein, second moment polytopic (SMP) systems are proposed that generalize systems with both uncertainty and randomness. The SMP systems are characterized by second moments of the stochastic system matrices and the uncertain parameters. Further, a fundamental theory for guaranteeing stability of the SMP systems is established. It is challenging to analyze the SMP systems owing to both the uncertainty and randomness. An idea to overcome this difficulty is to expand the SMP systems and exclude the randomness. Because the expanded systems contain only the uncertainty, their stability can be analyzed via robust stability theory. The stability of the expanded systems is equivalent to statistical stability of the SMP systems. These facts provide sufficient conditions for the stability of the SMP systems as linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). In controller design for the SMP systems, the LMIs reduce to cubic matrix inequalities (CMIs) whose solutions correspond to feedback gains. The CMIs are transformed into simpler quadratic matrix inequalities (QMIs) that can be solved using optimization techniques. Moreover, solving such nonconvex QMIs is relaxed into the iteration of a convex optimization. Solutions to the iterative optimization provide feedback gains that stabilize the SMP systems. As demonstrated here, the SMP systems represent linear dynamics with uncertain distributions and other existing systems such as independently identically distributed dynamics and random polytopes. Finally, a numerical simulation shows the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

Through deriving properties of switching laws regarding signs and dimension, this article proposes a definite condition for time-optimal control. Guided by the developed theory, a trajectory planning method named the manifold-intercept method (MIM) is developed. The proposed MIM can plan time-optimal jerk-limited trajectories with full state constraints, and can also plan near-optimal nonchattering higher order trajectories with negligible extra motion time compared to optimal profiles. Numerical results indicate that the proposed MIM outperforms all baselines in computational time, computational accuracy, and trajectory quality by a large gap.},

Here, we prove a much crisper and detailed bound on the closed-loop behavior consisting of three terms: a decaying exponential on the initial condition, a linear-like convolution bound on the exogenous inputs, and a constant scaled by the square root of the constant in the denominator of the estimator update law; we also provide an upper bound on the two-norm of the tracking error.

While synchronous algorithms are heavily impacted by a few slow nodes or edges in the graph (the straggler problem), their asynchronous counterparts are notoriously harder to parameterize. Indeed, their convergence properties for networks with heterogeneous communication and computation delays have defied analysis so far. In this article, we use a continuized framework to analyze asynchronous algorithms in networks with delays. Our approach yields a precise characterization of convergence time and of its dependence on heterogeneous delays in the network. Our continuized framework benefits from the best of both continuous and discrete worlds: the algorithms it applies to are based on event-driven updates. They are thus essentially discrete, and hence, readily implementable. Yet their analysis is essentially in continuous time, relying in part on the theory of delayed ordinary differential equations. Our algorithms moreover achieve an asynchronous speedup: their rate of convergence is controlled by the eigengap of the network graph weighted by local delays instead of the network-wide worst-case delay as in previous analyses. Our methods thus enjoy improved robustness to stragglers.},

  abstract     = {System stabilization via policy gradient (PG) methods has drawn increasing attention in both control and machine learning communities. In this article, we study their convergence and sample complexity for stabilizing linear time-invariant systems in terms of the number of system rollouts. Our analysis is built upon a discounted linear quadratic regulator (LQR) method which alternatively updates the policy and the discount factor of the LQR problem. First, we propose an explicit rule to adaptively adjust the discount factor by exploring the stability margin of a linear control policy. Then, we establish the sample complexity of PG methods for stabilization, which only adds a coefficient logarithmic in the spectral radius of the state matrix to that for solving the LQR problem with a prior stabilizing policy. Finally, we perform simulations to validate our theoretical findings and demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on a class of nonlinear systems.},

  abstract     = {Safety control of dynamical systems using barrier functions relies on knowing the full state information. This article introduces a novel approach for safety control in uncertain multiple-input–muiltiple-output (MIMO) systems with partial state information. The proposed method combines the synthesis of a vector norm barrier function and a dynamic output feedback safety controller to ensure robust safety enforcement. The safety controller guarantees the invariance of the barrier function under uncertain dynamics and disturbances. To address the challenges associated with safety verification using partial state information, a barrier function estimator is developed. This estimator employs an identifier-based state estimator to obtain a state estimate that is affine in the uncertain model parameters of the system. By incorporating a priori knowledge of the limits of the uncertain model parameters and disturbances, the state estimate provides a robust upper bound for the barrier function. Comparative analysis with existing control barrier function-based methods shows the advantage of the proposed approach in enforcing safety constraints under tight input constraints and the utilization of estimated state information.},

Our first technical contribution is to show the stability in the game theoretic sense of these equilibria on a specific local subset of the original feasible set. Remarkably, we show that the proposed notion of local equilibrium can be equivalently formulated as the solution of a quasi-variational inequality with equal Lagrange multipliers. Next, under the additional proximal smoothness assumption of the coupled feasible set, we define conditions for the existence and local uniqueness of an LGNE. To compute such an equilibrium, we propose two discrete-time dynamics, or fixed-point iterations implemented in a centralized fashion. Our third technical contribution is to prove convergence under (strongly) monotone assumptions on the pseudogradient mapping of the game and proximal smoothness of the coupled feasible set. Finally, we apply our theoretical results to a noncooperative version of the optimal power flow control problem.},

In Part II, this approximation is applied to system level synthesis, a recent approach based on a clever reparameterization, to develop a new technique for optimal control design. To solve system level synthesis problems, prior work relies on finite impulse response approximations that lead to deadbeat control, and that can experience infeasibility and increased suboptimality, especially in systems with large separation of time scales. The new design method does not result in deadbeat control, is convex and tractable, always feasible, can incorporate prior knowledge, and works well for systems with large separation of time scales. Suboptimality bounds with convergence rate depending on the geometry of the pole selection are provided. An example demonstrates superior performance of the method.},

In the current work, we investigate the latter two solutions, which are relatively unexplored in subspace identification methods. Our experimental results, from a large random sample of system models, show that our proposed estimators reduce the median of estimation risks by 10% compared with traditional subspace methods.

Existing proofs for this setting either assume a projection step in the algorithm to simplify the analysis, or require a fairly intricate argument to ensure stability of the iterates. We ask: Is it possible to retain the simplicity of a projection-based analysis without actually performing a projection step in the algorithm? Our main contribution is to show this is possible via a novel two-step argument. In the first step, we use induction to prove that under a standard choice of a constant step-size $\alpha$, the iterates generated by TD learning remain uniformly bounded in expectation. In the second step, we establish a recursion that mimics the steady-state dynamics of TD learning up to a bounded perturbation on the order of $O(\alpha ^{2})$ that captures the effect of Markovian sampling. Combining these pieces leads to an overall approach that considerably simplifies existing proofs. We conjecture that our inductive proof technique will find applications in the analyses of more complex stochastic approximation algorithms, and conclude by providing some examples of such applications.},

It not only requires that the parameters of the systems but also the equivalent systems cannot be identified by any identification approaches. Thus, it is a much more challenging problem than the existing analysis of parameter unidentifiability. In this article, we focus on the condition for dynamic unidentifiability for an arbitrarily parameterized system and design the controller to make the system dynamics unidentifiable. Specifically, we first define dynamic unidentifiability by taking equivalent systems into consideration. Then, we obtain the necessary and sufficient condition for unidentifiability based on the Fisher information matrix. This condition is derived by analysis of the relationship between the unidentifiable parameters and the Hessian matrix of the system function. Next, we propose a controller design scheme for ensuring dynamic unidentifiability for linear systems. We prove that for controllable and observable linear time-invariant systems, dynamic unidentifiability is equivalent to the requirement of a low-rank controller. Finally, the controller design problem is solved by transforming it into a model order-reduction problem. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by simulation.},

The decay rate of the closed-loop system is highly sensitive to the choice of material parameters and the design of the state feedback amplifiers. This article focuses on investigating the design of state feedback amplifiers to achieve a maximal exponential decay rate, which is essential for effectively suppressing oscillations in these beams. Through this design process, we explicitly determine the safe intervals of feedback amplifiers that ensure the theoretically found maximal decay rate, with the potential for even better rates. Our numerical results reaffirm the robustness of the decay rate within the chosen range of feedback amplifiers, while deviations from this range significantly impact the decay rate.

Then, we propose a cost-free and data-independent initialization strategy, which enables us, for the first time, to remove the initialization assumption of feasible full-Newton interior-point algorithms. We prove that the number of iterations of our proposed algorithm is only dimension-dependent (data-independent), simple-calculated, and exact (not worst-case) with the value $\left\lceil {\log (\frac{2n}{\epsilon })}/{-2\log (\frac{\sqrt{2n}}{\sqrt{2n}+\sqrt{2}-1})}\right\rceil \!+ 1$, where $n$ denotes the problem dimension and $\epsilon$ denotes the constant stopping tolerance.

Specifically, we propose a novel inverse optimal control method to identify the weighting matrices of a discrete-time finite horizon LQR, and we also provide the corresponding identifiability conditions. Then, we obtain the optimal estimate of the control horizon using binary search, and finally, reconstruct the LQR problem with aforementioned estimates.

Compared with other mechanisms, periodic event-triggered control can automatically guarantee a Zeno-free behavior and avoid the continuous monitoring of triggered conditions. First, a new periodic event-triggered distributed observer, which is based on the fully asynchronous communication data, is proposed to estimate the leader information. Second, a new distributed predictor feedback control method is proposed for the considered nonlinear MASs with input delay. By coordinate transformation, the MASs are mapped into new coupled ordinary differential equations–partial differential equations (ODE-PDE) target systems with some disturbance-like terms. Then, we show that the COR problem is solvable. At last, to further save the communication resource, a periodic event-triggered mechanism is considered in the sensor-to-controller transmission in every agent. A new periodic event-triggered filter is proposed to deal with the periodic event-triggered feedback data. The MASs with input delay are mapped into coupled ODE-PDE target systems with sampled data information. Then, Lyapunov–Krasovskii functions are constructed to demonstrate the exponential stability of the MASs. Simulations verify the validity of the proposed results.},

  abstract     = {In this article, we study, for the first time, the stability of linear delayed discrete-time systems with small parameter $\varepsilon &gt; 0$ and rapidly varying coefficients. Recently, an efficient constructive approach to averaging-based stability via a novel delay-free transformation was introduced for continuous-time systems. Our paper extends this approach to discrete-time systems. We start by introducing a discrete-time change of variables that leads to a perturbed averaged system. By employing Lyapunov analysis, we derive linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) for finding the maximum values of the small parameter $\varepsilon &gt; 0$ and delay (either constant or time-varying) that guarantee exponential stability of the original system. We show that differently from the continuous-time, in the discrete-time, given any bounded delay, there exists a small enough $\varepsilon$ such that our LMIs are feasible (i.e., the system is exponentially stable). Numerical examples illustrate the efficiency of the proposed approach.},

  abstract     = {Existing online continuous-time parameter estimation laws provide exact (asymptotic/exponential or finite/fixed time) identification of dynamical linear/nonlinear systems parameters only if the external perturbations are vanishing to zero or independent with the regressor of the system. However, in real systems the disturbances are almost always nonvanishing and dependent with the regressor. In the presence of perturbations with such properties the abovementioned identification approaches ensure only boundedness of a parameter estimation error. The main goal of this study is to close this gap and develop a novel online continuous-time parameter estimator that guarantees the exact asymptotic identification of unknown parameters of linear systems in the presence of unknown but bounded perturbations and has relaxed convergence conditions. To achieve the aforementioned goal, it is proposed to augment the deeply investigated dynamic regressor extension and mixing (DREM) procedure with the novel instrumental variables (IV)-based extension scheme with averaging. Such an approach allows one to obtain a set of scalar regression equations with asymptotically vanishing perturbation if the initial disturbance that affects the plant is bounded and independent not with the system regressor, but with the IV. It is rigorously proved that a gradient estimation law designed on the basis of such scalar regressions ensures online unbiased asymptotic identification of the parameters of the perturbed linear systems if some weak independence and excitation assumptions are met. Theoretical results are illustrated and supported with adequate numerical simulations.},

  abstract     = {We study the adaptive robust optimal control (AROC) problem for linear systems as an extension of finite-dimensional adaptive robust optimization problems. Given a continuous-time linear system under uncertain disturbance inputs with robust state and control constraints, the AROC problem finds the optimal control law adaptive to disturbance trajectories, which achieves the lowest worst-case cost. Then, the functional constraint generation (FCG) algorithm is designed, which extends the well-known constraint generation approach to the infinite-dimensional problem. The FCG algorithm consists of: first, a master problem that finds the optimal control solution under a collection of disturbance trajectories selected from the uncertainty set, and second, a subproblem that finds the worst-case disturbance trajectory for a given control solution and adds it to the master problem. Considering each iteration in the FCG algorithm as an operator updating control solutions, we prove that this operator has a unique fixed point as the optimal solution of the AROC problem. Further, by the monotone convergence theory of operators, we prove that the FCG algorithm converges to the optimal solution of the AROC problem. This result establishes the consistency between the convergence properties of the constraint generation approach for the infinite-dimensional optimization problem and finite-dimensional counterpart.},

To solve this problem, we develop a learning-based algorithm involving inverse optimization and forward optimal control to estimate the master cost parameter and design the slave shared controller simultaneously. A sharing rule based on the estimation of the master cost parameter is proposed, which makes the interaction effective by affecting the control effort paid by the slave directly and continuously. In addition, by using a Lyapunov-like control barrier function, we design a novel safety-critical controller, which can be combined with the shared controller to realize safe trajectory tracking.

The unique feature of the proposed control approach lies in addressing the technical challenges related to recursive feasibility of the optimization problem and stability of the closed-loop system posed by exogenous signal estimation and estimation errors. First, the original system is transformed into a new dynamic system by means of regulator equations and disturbance observer techniques, which enables output regulation problems to be reformulated into state stabilization problems. For the constraints reconstruction, a robust positively invariant set sequence is then skillfully designed to provide bounds for the deviations between the transformed system and its corresponding nominal system. A hierarchical control strategy is utilized that comprises two components: the first is an optimal controller designed to stabilize the nominal system with tightened constraints, while the second is a feedback controller used to restrain the deviations between the nominal and transformed systems. Constraints satisfaction can be directly verified through set operations, and the theoretical guarantees are ensured through rigorous theoretical analysis. Furthermore, the proposed framework also encompasses the output-feedback case. The numerical simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in addressing constrained output regulation problems, even when the exogenous signal is partially available.},

The estimation problem is combinatorial in nature, and so many methods require substantial computational and storage resources as the number of sensors increases. To reduce the complexity, the proposed method performs the attack identification with local subsets of the measurements, not with the set of all measurements. A condition for nonlinear attack identification is introduced as a relaxed version of existing redundant observability condition. It is shown that an attack identification can be performed even when the entire state cannot be recovered from the measurements. As a result, although a portion of measurements are compromised, they can be locally identified and excluded from the state estimation, and thus, the true state can be recovered. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.},

This issue can make their state estimates useless during transient periods and whenever disturbances follow in quick succession. In this article, we propose an approach to fighting observer error peaking at its root. By directly reconstructing the system state from the output and its derivatives, we obtain an approximation of the true state that is used to drastically reduce the transient error, even if the output measurement is noisy. We provide proofs of stability of the resulting nonlinear modification to the standard linear observer structure and illustrate its effectiveness by means of simulation. We prove that the principle of separation holds for this observer structure and discuss a rigorous design procedure which guarantees stability. In particular, we show that the matrix for feedback of the direct state reconstruction can be chosen in a convex cone in the space of $\mathbb {R}^{n\times n}$ matrices. This cone can easily be calculated explicitly.},

Using the half-space representation and the vertex representation, we propose three equivalent conditions to certify monotonicity of a dynamical system with respect to a polyhedral cone. We then introduce the notion of gauge norm associated with a cone and provide closed-from formulas for computing gauge norms associated with polyhedral cones. A key feature of gauge norms is that contractivity of monotone systems with respect to them can be efficiently characterized using simple inequalities. This result generalizes the well-known criteria for Hurwitzness of Metzler matrices and provides a scalable approach to search for Lyapunov functions of monotone systems with respect to polyhedral cones. Finally, we study the applications of our results in transient stability of dynamic flow networks and in scalable control design with safety guarantees.},

Moreover, we establish the $p$th moment exponential stabilization criterion for any $p&gt;0$, which is more general and meaningful for practical application than those results only considering the case of $p =2$.

It leads to an aggregated network which satisfies control equivalence, i.e., such that the optimal control values for the original network can be exactly recovered from those of the aggregated one. The algorithm is based on a partition refinement method originally devised for systems of ordinary differential equations, here extended and applied to linear dynamics on complex networks.

  abstract     = {A typical cyber-physical system setup includes a local system sending measurements of its internal state to a remote state estimator. A form of attack consists of an eavesdropper observing this information exchange. Secrecy coding schemes have been recently proposed to achieve immunity to eavesdropping. The essential idea consists in coding the transmitting information in a way such that a single packet lost by the eavesdropper causes an irrecoverable error of its state estimation. Common limitations of the available methods are the assumptions that the local system can directly measure its internal state and that the system is unstable. In this work, we drop these assumptions and consider the general case in which measurements are noisy linear combinations of an inaccessible internal state and that the system is not necessarily unstable. To design the coding scheme, we introduce the concept of total secrecy, meaning that if the eavesdropper misses a packet that is available at the remote estimator, the former behaves as if no further packets were received. We derive a sufficient condition for total secrecy, as well as the code achieving this property. Also, for the case in which we cannot guarantee total secrecy, we address the problem of designing a code achieving maximum secrecy in some sense. We present numerical examples illustrating our claims.},

Departing from the classical minimax estimation, this article focuses on the globalized robust estimation (GRE), which minimizes the estimator's fragility to attain an acceptable loss compared with the nominal model. The GRE problem has an easily specified hyperparameter as compared to the maximal radius in the classical minimax estimation. Besides, it considers all possible densities for better adaptability to different uncertainties. First, the solution to the GRE problem subject to the Kullback–Leibler (K–L) divergence constraint is rigorously studied such that the explicit expressions of the least-squares estimator and the most-sensitive density are derived. Consequently, we formulate the robust filtering problem as a game to obtain the iterative equation of the globalized robust Kalman filter (GRKF). Moreover, the convergence of the proposed GRKF is established for systems with time-invariant nominal models. Finally, simulated examples show that the proposed GRKF outperforms the standard Kalman filter and the classical robust Kalman filter.},

In this situation, decentralized and distributed output-feedback controllers are designed to regulate the states of all plants to the equilibrium point within a prescribed time. The stability analysis is based upon a blend of graph-theoretic, matrix-theoretic, and system-theoretic tools with the application of matrix pencil and time-varying feedback playing a central role. In particular, the control objective is divided into two subobjectives, where the first is decentralized prescribed-time regulation and the second is distributed prescribed-time leader-following consensus tracking.

  abstract     = {Detection and tracking of underwater target play an important role in enhancing the marine sensing ability. Currently, the above mission is usually conducted in a single platform, and there is a lack of necessary cooperation between different platforms. This article employs unmanned aerial/surface/underwater vehicles (UAV–USV–UUV) to develop a cooperation detection and tracking solution for underwater target. We first use the measure theory to construct a heterogeneous detection mode, such that the target detection probability can be maximized by adjusting the formation shape between USV and UUV. After the target is detected by the UAV–USV–UUV networks, a deep learning algorithm called depth deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) is designed for UUV to track the trajectory of target. In order to guarantee the communication connectivity among UAV, USV, and UUV, a multistep location prediction strategy is incorporated into the tracking procedure. Note that the advantages of our solution are highlighted as: 1) the cooperation of UAV, USV, and UUV in this article can improve the detection probability over the single platform system; and 2) the DDPG-based tracking algorithm in this article is more efficient for handling continuous complex underwater environment as compared with the deep Q-network. Finally, simulation and experimental results are both presented to verify the effectiveness of our solution. As such, our solution is more useful for the marine engineer to remotely sense the ocean from the communication and control viewpoints.},

  abstract     = {This article investigates the finite horizon jointly optimal local and remote linear quadratic (LQ) control problem for a networked control system (NCS) with multiple subsystems. Each subsystem is governed by a general multiplicative noise stochastic system and is equipped with both a local controller and a remote controller. Due to the unreliable uplink channels, the remote controller can only access unreliable state information of all subsystems, while the downlink channels from the remote controller to the local controllers are perfect. The difficulties of the LQ control problem for such a system arise from the different information structures of the local controllers and the remote controller. By developing the Pontryagin maximum principle, the necessary and sufficient solvability conditions are derived, which are based on the solution to a group of forward and backward difference equations (G-FBSDEs). The G-FBSDEs, however, cannot be decoupled by existing techniques. By introducing a group of new auxiliary information filtration and utilizing the orthogonal decomposition method, the G-FBSDEs is thus solved, and the decoupling method is novel. Furthermore, based on the solution to new asymmetric coupled Riccati equations, the optimal control strategies are derived where we verify that the separation principle holds for the multiplicative noise NCSs with packet dropouts.},

This article develops a new result on the analysis of switched systems comprised of locally practically stable subsystems using multiple Lyapunov-like functions. Local practical stability of the overall switched system and convergence of the applied tracking control policies to a neighborhood of the optimal tracking control policies is then proven for an arbitrary switching sequence provided that a set of sufficient gain conditions and a minimum dwell-time condition are satisfied.

The study of this matrix problem heavily relies on the Davis–Wielandt shells of matrices, providing a profound insight into matrices subjected to simultaneous gain and phase constraints. This understanding is pivotal for establishing a less conservative sufficient condition for the matrix sectored-disk problem, from which we formulate several robust feedback stability conditions against sectored-disk uncertainty.

Second, a distributed controller is designed to achieve a desired configuration with ambiguity under the class of relative measurements. The designed controller combines the cooperative and individual control of agents to remove the ambiguity from the configuration. The best performance is obtained in that the ambiguity in the coordination is the smallest. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of this controller through simulations and an experiment.

Compared with existing methods, the proposed algorithm has the following advantages. First, this algorithm can solve the distributed optimization problem, in which the global objective function is pseudoconvex and the local objective functions are subdifferentially regular in the global feasible region; Moreover, each agent can have different constraints. Second, this algorithm does not require exact penalty parameters or projection operators. Third, the subgradient gains for different agents may be nonuniform. Fourth, all agents reach a consensus in finite time. It is proven that under certain assumptions, from an arbitrary initial state, the solutions of all the agents will enter their local inequality feasible region and remain there, reach consensus in finite time, and converge to the optimal solution set of the primal distributed optimization problem.

This algorithm promotes the distributed application of existing centralized accelerated momentum methods, especially for constrained nonsmooth problems. Under certain assumptions and conditions on the step-size and momentum coefficient, the convergence and optimality of the proposed algorithm can be guaranteed through a rigorous theoretical analysis, and a convergence rate of $\mathcal {O}(\text {ln}k/ \sqrt{k})$ in objective value is also established.

Under mild compactness and data-collection assumptions, SOS tightenings in rising degree will converge to recover the true worst-case optimal $\ell ^\infty$ (extended) superstabilizing controllers. With some conservatism, quadratically stabilizing controllers with certified $\mathcal {H}_{2}$ performance bounds can also be found. The performance of this SOS method is improved through the application of a Theorem of Alternatives while retaining tightness, in which the unknown noise variables are eliminated from the consistency set description.

This work specifically targets some prevalent challenges inherent to distributed learning: 1) online training, i.e., the local data change over time; 2) asynchronous agent computations; 3) unreliable and limited communications; and 4) inexact local computations. To tackle these challenges, we apply the distributed operator theoretical (DOT) version of the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), which we call “DOT-ADMM.” We prove that if the DOT-ADMM operator is metric subregular, then it converges with a linear rate for a large class of (not necessarily strongly) convex learning problems toward a bounded neighborhood of the optimal time-varying solution, and characterize how such neighborhood depends on 1)–4). We first derive an easy-to-verify condition for ensuring the metric subregularity of an operator, followed by tutorial examples on linear and logistic regression problems. We corroborate the theoretical analysis with numerical simulations comparing DOT-ADMM with other state-of-the-art algorithms, showing that only the proposed algorithm exhibits robustness to 1)–4).},

First, a type of asynchronous mode-dependent sliding surface is designed. Then, the control law is novelly proposed upon the allowable maximum settling time based on the fixed-time theory, and a new criterion is given to address the reachability of each subsliding surface within the mode-running interval.

This setup uses noise to account for uncertainty in either gradient evaluation or iteration updates, and it includes Polyak's heavy-ball and Nesterov's accelerated methods as special cases. For strongly convex quadratic problems, we use the steady-state variance of the error in the optimization variable to quantify noise amplification and identify fundamental stochastic performance tradeoffs. Our approach utilizes the Jury stability criterion to provide a novel geometric characterization of conditions for linear convergence, and it reveals the relation between the noise amplification and convergence rate as well as their dependence on the condition number and the constant algorithmic parameters. This geometric insight leads to simple alternative proofs of standard convergence results and allows us to establish “uncertainty principle” of strongly convex optimization: for the two-step momentum method with linear convergence rate, the lower bound on the product between the settling time and noise amplification scales quadratically with the condition number. Our analysis also identifies a key difference between the gradient and iterate noise models: while the amplification of gradient noise can be made arbitrarily small by sufficiently decelerating the algorithm, the best achievable variance for the iterate noise model increases linearly with the settling time in the decelerating regime. Finally, we introduce two parameterized families of algorithms that strike a balance between noise amplification and settling time while preserving orderwise Pareto optimality for both noise models.},

  abstract     = {In this article we develop a generalized stability framework for stochastic discrete-time linear systems that enriches the ways in which the distribution of the state energy can be characterized. We use tools from finance and operations research called risk functionals (i.e., risk measures) to facilitate diverse distributional characterizations. In contrast, classical stochastic stability notions characterize the state energy on average or in probability, which can obscure the variability of stochastic system behavior. After drawing connections between various risk-aware stability concepts for nonlinear systems, we specialize to linear systems and derive sufficient conditions for the satisfaction of some risk-aware stability properties. These results pertain to real-valued coherent risk functionals and a mean-conditional-variance functional. The results reveal novel noise-to-state stability properties, which assess disturbances in ways that reflect the chosen measure of risk.},

  abstract     = {Anisotropy in temperature, chemical potential, or ion concentration, provides the fuel that feeds dynamical processes that sustain life. At the same time, anisotropy is a root cause of incurred losses manifested as entropy production. In this work we study how to minimize such entropic losses using the framework of stochastic optimal control. Specifically, we consider a rudimentary model of an overdamped stochastic thermodynamic system that is in contact with heat baths of different temperatures simultaneously, and seek the entropy-minimizing control that steers the system between thermodynamic states in finite time. It is known that when the system is in contact with a single heat bath, the entropy production is due to dissipation and can be expressed in terms of a quadratic functional in the control effort—the square of the $W_{2}$ optimal mass transport (OMT) distance traversed by the thermodynamic state. Anisotropy on the other hand complicates substantially the mechanism of entropy production since, besides dissipation, seepage of energy between the heat sources by way of the system dynamics is often a major additional contributing factor. A key result of this article is to show that in the presence of anisotropy, minimization of entropy production can once again be expressed via a modified OMT problem. However, in contrast to the isotropic situation that leads to classical OMT and the so-called Wasserstein $W_{2}$ metric, entropy production may not vanish when the thermodynamic state remains unchanged; this is due to the fact that maintaining a nonequilibrium steady-state (NESS) incurs an intrinsic entropic cost that can be traced back to the seepage of heat between heat baths. NESSs represent hallmarks of life, since living matter by necessity operates far from equilibrium. Therefore, the question studied herein, to characterize minimal entropy production in anisotropic environments, appears of central importance in biological processes and on how such processes may have evolved to optimize for available usage of resources.},

More precisely, we focus on the MID property for spectral values with overorder multiplicity, i.e., a multiplicity larger than the order of the DDE. We highlight the fact that a root of overorder multiplicity is necessarily a root of a particular polynomial, called the elimination-produced polynomial, and we address the MID property using a suitable factorization of the corresponding characteristic function involving special functions of Kummer type. Additional results and discussion are provided in the case of the $n$th order integrator, in particular on the local optimality of a multiple root.

The pursuers cooperate to protect a convex region from the evaders who try to reach the region. We propose a multiplayer onsite and close-to-goal (MOCG) pursuit strategy that can tell and achieve an increasing lower bound on the number of guaranteed defeated evaders. This pursuit strategy fuses the subgame outcomes for multiple pursuers against one evader with hierarchical optimal task allocation in the receding-horizon manner. To determine the qualitative subgame outcomes of who is the game winner, we construct three pursuit winning regions and strategies under which the pursuers guarantee to win against the evader, regardless of the unknown evader strategy. First, we utilize the expanded Apollonius circles and propose the onsite pursuit winning that achieves the capture in finite time. Second, we introduce convex goal-covering polygons (GCPs) and propose the close-to-goal pursuit winning for the pursuers whose visibility region contains the whole protected region, and the goal-visible property will be preserved afterwards. Third, we employ Euclidean shortest paths (ESPs) and construct a pursuit winning region and strategy for the nongoal-visible pursuers, where the pursuers are firstly steered to positions with goal visibility along ESPs. In each horizon, the hierarchical optimal task allocation maximizes the number of defeated evaders and consists of four sequential matchings: capture, enhanced, nondominated and closest matchings. Numerical examples are presented to illustrate the results.},

  abstract     = {Parameterization is a necessary step for learning unstructured unknown dynamical systems. In this article, we aim to balance the tradeoff between expressiveness and complexity when selecting models for parameterizing unstructured dynamics using universal regression models. Rather than using a fixed set of basis functions in the regression model, we introduce the event-triggered basis augmentation (ETBA) technique for adaptive estimation, which gradually builds up an expressive regression model on the fly. Kernel regression is applied in ETBA to approximate a general class of unstructured dynamics. With the inner product structure of reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHS), the residue of the regression model is characterized as the component of unknown dynamics that is orthogonal to all the existing basis functions. With this characterization, new basis functions can be strategically included in the regression model to meet certain stability certificates of adaptive estimation. Among existing basis augmentation methods for learning dynamical systems, the unique advantage of ETBA is that it does not require state derivatives to accomplish the learning. Compared to traditional methods of learning dynamical systems, ETBA uses fewer basis functions without sacrificing expressiveness of the model. We illustrate these two advantages in numerical example. We further study the formulation of ETBA in multiagent systems, for which we propose the condition of collaborative persistent excitation in RKHS to guarantee convergence of function estimation.},

In this context, recent literature has studied increasingly sophisticated false data injection attacks, with the aim to design mitigative measures that improve the systems' security. Notably, data-driven attack strategies—whereby the system dynamics is oblivious to the adversary—have received increasing attention. However, many of the existing works on the topic rely on the implicit assumption of linear system dynamics, significantly limiting their scope. Contrary to that, in this work, we design and analyze a truly model-free false data injection attack that applies to general linear and nonlinear systems. More specifically, we aim at designing an injected signal that steers the output of the system toward a (maliciously chosen) trajectory. We do so by designing a zeroth-order feedback optimization policy and jointly using probing signals for real-time measurements. We then characterize the quality of the proposed model-free attack through its optimality gap, which is affected by the dimensions of the attack signal, the number of iterations performed, and the convergence rate of the system. Finally, we extend the proposed attack scheme to systems with internal noise. Extensive simulations show the effectiveness of the proposed attack scheme.},

Fundamental challenges here differing from existing works are twofold: 1) only output data rather than full state data are available; 2) policy iteration cannot be performed since admissible control policy is not available. To solve the problem, an adaptive observer and an adaptive solver are designed and simultaneously applied to observe the states, estimate the uncertain parameters, and solve the nonlinear regulator equations. Then, a data-driven value iteration algorithm is designed based on the observed data to solve a positive semidefinite Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman equation resulting from the formulated problem with rigorous convergence analysis. It is guaranteed that the resulting closed-loop system is uniformly ultimately bounded under the designed data-driven value iteration algorithm. Finally, a simulation study on the designed algorithm is presented using a van der Pol oscillator to demonstrate its effectiveness.},

Two feedback solutions are given, using exact and inaccurate optimization algorithms, thus establishing interesting tradeoffs between continuous-time dynamics and computationally expensive iterative discrete-time parametric optimization schemes.

  abstract     = {Solving chance-constrained stochastic optimal control problems is a significant challenge in control. This is because no analytical solutions exist for up to a handful of special cases. A common and computationally efficient approach for tackling chance-constrained stochastic optimal control problems consists of a deterministic reformulation, where hard constraints with an additional constraint-tightening parameter are imposed on a nominal prediction that ignores stochastic disturbances. However, in such approaches, the choice of constraint-tightening parameter remains challenging, and guarantees can mostly be obtained assuming that the process noise distribution is known a priori. Moreover, the chance constraints are often not tightly satisfied, leading to unnecessarily high costs. This work proposes a data-driven approach for learning the constraint-tightening parameters online during control. To this end, we reformulate the choice of constraint-tightening parameter for the closed loop as a binary regression problem. We then leverage a highly expressive Gaussian process, model for binary regression to approximate the smallest constraint-tightening parameters that satisfy the chance constraints. By tuning the algorithm parameters appropriately, we show that the resulting constraint-tightening parameters satisfy the chance constraints up to an arbitrarily small margin with high probability. Our approach yields constraint-tightening parameters that tightly satisfy the chance constraints in numerical experiments, resulting in a lower average cost than three other state-of-the-art approaches.},

Our approach encompasses a broad range of nonlinear feedback scenarios. To establish the well-posedness of the resulting closed-loop system, we employ the nonlinear semigroup method. Furthermore, we leverage the integral multiplier technique to demonstrate that the stability characteristics of the closed-loop system are dictated by a dissipative ordinary differential equation.

This way, the localization problem can be reduced to finding the conditions for the existence of a unique roto-translation of the trajectory from a known reference frame to the world reference frame, given the collected measurements. As discussed in this article, such conditions can be expressed in terms of the shape of the trajectory, of the layout of the ranging sensors, and of the numbers of measurements collected from each of them. The approach applies to a large class of kinematic models. Focusing on the special case of unicycle kinematics, we provide additional local constructibility results.},

Moreover, the interagent communication edges of the MAS may be blocked by multiple attackers in an asynchronous manner. Since each agent has to quantize the feedback information into finite-bit symbols before transmissions, an asynchronous attack may break the quantization synchronization among neighboring agents. To mitigate the effects of asynchronous attacks, we design a distributed dynamic encoding–decoding scheme, under which the quantization range and the number of occupied bits of each transmission of every communication edge are independently determined and may vary by DoS attacks. Furthermore, we propose an event-triggered quantized consensus protocol, under which distributed event-triggers determine information transmission over each communication edge. Under the proposed methods, we provide a sufficient average bit rate condition to ensure the asymptotic consensus of the concerned MAS. That bit rate condition depends on the dynamics of agents, the communication topology and denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. The proposed methods still works in MASs with bounded network delay and asynchronous DoS attacks. A numerical example is provided to verify the effectiveness of obtained results.},

  abstract     = {This article investigates the problem of interval state and attack signal estimation and fault tolerant consistent control in multiagent systems under the influence of deception attacks. First, the deception attack signal is transformed into an auxiliary state vector to generate a state-augmented multiagent system, which makes the estimation problem tractable with a state observer. In addition, an event-triggered mechanism is designed for the observer to reduce unnecessary network communication. Next, a zonotope-based interval estimation technique is investigated to obtain upper and lower bounds for deception-attack estimates consistent with the real environment, taking into account the uncertainty of the system. Furthermore, a leader-follower-based state-consistent control strategy is designed, in which the estimation of the deception-attack signal is incorporated as a compensation to achieve state-consistent control. Finally, the validity of the proposed methodology is verified with vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) aircrafts as an example.},

  abstract     = {Projected dynamical systems (PDSs) form a class of discontinuous constrained dynamical systems, and have been used widely to solve optimization problems and variational inequalities. Recently, they have also gained significant attention for control purposes, such as high-performance integrators, saturated control, and feedback optimization. In this work, we establish that locally Lipschitz continuous dynamics, involving Control Barrier Functions (CBFs), namely, CBF-based dynamics, approximate PDSs. Specifically, we prove that trajectories of CBF-based dynamics uniformly converge to trajectories of PDSs, as a CBF-parameter approaches infinity. Toward this, we also prove that CBF-based dynamics are perturbations of PDSs, with quantitative bounds on the perturbation. Our results pave the way to implement discontinuous PDS-based controllers in a continuous fashion, employing CBFs. We demonstrate this on an example on synchronverter control. Moreover, our results can be employed to numerically simulate PDSs, overcoming disadvantages of existing discretization schemes, such as computing projections to possibly nonconvex sets. Finally, this bridge between CBFs and PDSs may yield other potential benefits, including novel insights on stability.},

For this, a Koopman eigenstructure assignment problem is solved, which amounts to determining a feedback of the Koopman open-loop eigenfunctionals assigning a desired finite set of closed-loop Koopman eigenvalues and eigenfunctionals to the closed-loop system. It is shown that the designed controller only needs a finite number of open-loop Koopman eigenvalues and modes of the state. They are determined by extending the classical Krylov-dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) to parabolic systems. For this, only a finite number of pointlike outputs and their temporal samples, as well as temporal samples of the inputs, are required, resulting in a data-driven solution to the eigenstructure assignment problem. Exponential stability of the closed-loop system in the presence of small Krylov-DMD errors is verified. An unstable diffusion-reaction system demonstrates the new data-driven controller design technique for distributed-parameter systems.},

First, the dual convergence and $\mathcal {L}_{\infty }$ performance are addressed for the positive zonotope by constructing proper mode-dependent radius and center functions.

Considering challenges when communication delays occur, we then devise an asynchronous distributed algorithm to seek a generalized Nash equilibrium. This asynchronous scheme arbitrarily activates one player to start new computations independently at different iteration instants, which means that the picked player can use the involved outdated information from itself and its neighbors to perform new updates. In theoretical aspect, we provide explicit conditions on algorithm parameters, for instance, the step-sizes to establish a sublinear convergence rate for the synchronous version. Next, the asynchronous algorithm guarantees almost sure convergence in expectation under the same step-size conditions and some standard assumptions.

Then, a novel adaptive event-triggered mechanism is proposed to save more communication resources and reduce the computational burden among agents, and the Zeno behavior is ruled out strictly. The control protocol proposed in this article does not involve global information, thus it can be implemented in a fully distributed manner. Furthermore, a new Lyapunov function is constructed using a graph-based diagonal matrix to achieve the consensus of MASs under directed graphs. Generally, distinct from the existing results, the proposed model-free DRL-based fully distributed ETC protocol has the following features: 1) only using the intermittent local information; 2) not requiring the model information and global graph information; and 3) applicable to the more general directed graph.

The reward function composing of the linear quadratic control consumption and the power consumption is provided on account of energy constraints of the sensor and the attacker. To proactively overcome the difficulty in characterizing or computing the Stackelberg equilibrium (SE), the formulated game is actively transformed into a Markov decision process under a restricted information structure, enabling the extraction of essential SE properties. In addition, the reward function is approximated to derive an analytical expression of a suboptimal SE of the game based on an approximate dynamic programming.

Modeling the algorithm as a linear parameter-varying (LPV) system, we construct a parameterized linear matrix inequality condition that certifies algorithm performance, which is solved using a result for polytopic LPV systems. Our results provide convergence rate guarantees when the step size lies within a restricted interval. Moreover, we recover existing rate bounds when this interval reduces to a single point, i.e., a constant step size. Finally, we note that the convergence rate depends only on the condition number of the problem. In contrast, the noise amplification performance depends on the individual values of the strong convexity and smoothness parameters, and varies inversely with them for a fixed condition number.},

The inspiration is driven by two challenging issues that remain unsolved in the field of prescribed-time stabilization: first, the singularity induced by infinity control magnitudes at the prescribed time instant, and second, the incapability of driving state behavior after the prescribed time. To tackle the challenges, we formulate a hybrid stabilizing controller by utilizing both the state-scaling technique and a finite-time stabilizing process, which is bounded on the whole-time horizon and guarantees the existence of the solutions of the closed-loop system. Superior to the current prescribed-time stabilization results, the proposed strategy is not only able to ensure that the states of the closed-loop system converge to a compact set within a designated time and belongs to the set afterward, and enjoys finite-time convergence ultimately, but also manipulate intricate dynamics and parameter uncertainties effectively. Finally, simulation examples are given to demonstrate the validity of the proposed strategy.},

In contrast to the one based on quadratic Lyapunov functions, the proposed approach provides necessary and sufficient conditions for stability in both discrete and continuous time. Remarkably, the resulting conditions are computationally tractable and can be verified using algorithms with guaranteed convergence, in contrast to other set-theoretical tools. In addition, the proposed method is shown to be flexible enough to incorporate knowledge of the system, such as restrictions on the rate of variation of the parameters or the kind of disturbances and/or unmodeled dynamics encompassed, allowing to establish nonconservative robust stability conditions.

Furthermore, the sliding mode boundary controller (SMBCr) is designed to steer system states to the SMS in finite time. A criterion is established for robust exponential stability by utilizing the Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional method and Wirtinger's inequality. Second, the boundary-output-based observer is constructed, and the observer-based SMBC is investigated. The observer states are required to reach the specified SMS in finite time. Then, a sufficient criterion is obtained that ensures the resultant system to realize robust exponential stability under the designed observer-based SMBCr.

In this article, we prove practical asymptotic stability of an (controlled) equilibrium for EDMD-based model predictive control, in which the optimization step is conducted using the data-based surrogate model. To this end, we derive novel bounds on the estimation error that are proportional to the norm of state and control.

The second method is the preset-trajectory-based preassigned performance control method, which, in addition to guaranteeing that the output tracking error can be confined within the prescribed performance envelope, is free from the singularity problem of the control law, a problem that may appear in the existing prescribed performance control methods under some unexpected situations (e.g., sensor faults).

A system is said to be $\boldsymbol{[T_{l},T_{u}]}$-opaque (respectively, $\boldsymbol{[T_{l},+\infty)}$-opaque) if no timed observation can lead to the exposure of specified states (called secret states) within a finite time window (respectively, an infinite time window) starting at the time instant ${\bm T_{l}}$. Based on the design principle of a timed observer developed in our previous work, we show that the timed observer of a system can be used to estimate the set of states in which the system may stay within certain (finite or infinite) time windows. The key of this approach is to determine whether a given time value is a possible elapsed time value from one observer state to another according to the structural information of the timed observer. From this methodology, we present two algorithms to verify the proposed opacity notions. The complexities of the algorithms are $\boldsymbol{\mathcal{O}}(2^{|X|})$ and $\boldsymbol{\mathcal{O}}(2^{3\cdot {|X|}})$, respectively, and the complexity of the structural analysis of the observer is $\boldsymbol{\mathcal{O}}((|Q|+2)\cdot 2^{2\cdot |X|})$, where $\boldsymbol{|X|}$ and $\boldsymbol{|Q|}$ are the numbers of states and labels in a plant.},

This framework utilizes a predictor–corrector mechanism, in which the predictor's role is to generate a predicted solution through proximally contractive mapping, and the corrector's objective is to refine this predicted solution via an inertial update rule. We proceed to provide a convergence analysis for our algorithm design framework by using proximal-point and contraction inequality techniques. Our analysis demonstrates that methods developed within this framework are guaranteed to converge and achieve an ergodic sublinear convergence rate of $\mathit{O}(1/{\mathit{k}})$ in the worst-case scenario. Moreover, our approach is capable of ensuring convergence with a nonergodic rate for the linearly equality-constrained convex optimization problems.

While majority of the adaptive control schemes in literature address the case of constant parameters, recent research has conceptualized improved adaptive control techniques for time-varying systems with rigorous stability proofs. The proposed work is an effort toward a similar direction, where a novel dual adaptation mechanism is introduced to efficiently tackle the time-varying nature of the parameters. Projection and $\sigma$-modification algorithms are strategically combined using congelation of variables to claim a global result for the tracking error space. While the classical adaptive systems demand a restrictive condition of persistence of excitation (PE) for accurate parameter estimation, the proposed work relies on a milder condition, called initial excitation (IE) for the same. A rigorous Lyapunov stability analysis is carried out to establish boundedness of the closed-loop system with a tighter ultimate bound compared to existing results. Further, it is analytically shown that the proposed work can recover the performance of previously designed IE-based adaptive controller in case of time invariant systems.},

More specifically, the regularization algorithm is involved to compensate for the absence of strict/strong monotonicity of game mapping and the gradient play is utilized to optimize players' objectives. The event-triggered leader-following consensus protocol is introduced to achieve distributed estimation of all players' actions, where communication transmissions among neighbors occur only when the preset event-triggering conditions are satisfied and communication topologies are switching. It is shown that the proposed seeking strategy can asymptotically steer players' actions to the least-norm Nash equilibrium of merely monotone games with reduced communication resources.

  abstract     = {We consider the design of event-triggered distributed controllers for multi-agent systems that are digitally implemented on local computation platforms and communicate over a packet-based network. Each agent is equipped with a local triggering mechanism that is only evaluated at the local sampling instants, thereby, taking a periodic event-triggered approach in which the sampling intervals are allowed to vary (jitter). Moreover, the locally triggered transmissions are subject to unknown, bounded delays, and a destination protocol is locally implemented to only send the packet to a selection of the neighboring agents at each triggering instant. Building upon the framework of Part I, we present an emulation-based design of the local periodic event-triggering rules, including the MASP, so that, under appropriate conditions, a general dissipativity property holds for the overall system. Interestingly, the presented digital implementation requires only minor modifications to the conditions presented in Part I. In addition, we show how to exploit the destination protocols to ensure resilience to information loss issues such as packet losses and denial-of-service. We conclude this article with case studies on the consensus of single integrator agents and a nonlinear stabilization problem.},

  abstract     = {We present a framework for the design of time- and event-triggered communication schemes for a broad class of multiagent systems (MAS). The framework is general in the sense that we consider a class of heterogeneous nonlinear MAS with directed communication graphs subject to disturbances and the inevitable imperfections induced by packet-based networked communication, such as time-varying transmission delays and intervals. Under suitable conditions, the designed distributed time- or event-triggered communication schemes lead to an MAS that is dissipative with respect to a desired supply rate, and thus can be used to study various properties such as $\mathcal {L}_{p}$-gain stability, input-to-state stability, and passivity. Strictly positive lower bounds on the interevent times are ensured and robustness to nonuniform time-varying delays in terms of maximum allowable delays is guaranteed. In addition, the framework allows for the consideration of destination protocols, which determine, at each transmission instant, to which (groups of) agent(s) a local output measurement is being transmitted. These destination protocols can be used to include packet loss and denial-of-service, as will be shown in the second part of this paper.},

  abstract     = {This article is devoted to stochastic convergence theorems for stochastic impulsive systems (SISs) and their application to discrete-time stochastic feedback control (DTSFC). A general stochastic Barbălat's lemma, which only requires that the concerned stochastic processes are almost surely integrable rather than absolutely integrable in the sense of expectation, for piecewise continuous adapted processes is first proposed, which is truly parallel to the deterministic one. As an extension of this lemma, a general stochastic convergence theorem is established for SISs, which can reveal and sufficiently apply the possible active contribution of the existing noise in the underlying system. To derive easy-to-check stability conditions, a series of LaSalle-type theorems and dwell-time-based conditions are established for stochastic stability/convergence of SISs. In contrast to preceding results, these stability criteria cannot only characterize the stabilizing noise but also be applicable to SISs with both continuous and discrete unstable dynamics. Moreover, supported by the LaSalle-type theorems, the almost sure exponential stabilization problems by DTSFC in both time- and event-triggered control schemes are solved. Particularly, the proposed methods remove the global Lipschitz condition required in the literature and provide an explicit computation of the maximum allowable sampling period. Finally, four numerical examples with comparisons are used to illustrate the theoretical results.},

The objective of RAC is for nonfaulty/normal agents to converge to the average of their initial values despite the erroneous effects from malicious agents. To this end, we propose a successful distributed iterative RAC algorithm for the multiagent networks with general directed topologies. The proposed algorithm has two parts at each iteration: 1) detection and 2) averaging. For the detection part, we propose two distributed algorithms and one of them can detect malicious agents with only the information from direct in-neighbors. For the averaging part, we extend the applicability of an existing averaging algorithm where normal agents can remove the effects from malicious agents so far, after they are detected. Another important feature of our method is that it can handle the case where malicious agents are neighboring and collaborating with each other to mislead the normal ones from averaging. This case cannot be solved by existing detection approaches in related literature. Moreover, our algorithm is efficient in storage usage especially for large-scale networks as each agent only requires the values of neighbors within two hops. Lastly, numerical examples are given to verify the efficacy of the proposed algorithms.},

We propose a novel learning-based rounding method aimed at converting a provided weighted sensor schedule into a sparse, unweighted schedule while preserving a comparable level of observability performance to the original weighted schedule. We introduce the notion of L-systemic performance measures, which enjoy characteristics such as homogeneity, monotonicity, convexity, and Lipschitz continuity, covering a range of well-known measures. We integrate the initialization of the weighted sensor schedule, achieved via a convex relaxation of a combinatorial optimization problem based on an L-systemic measure, into our rounding approach. We show that this produces an unweighted sensor schedule that achieves a $(1+\epsilon)$ near-optimal approximation solution while ensuring system observability. Our polynomial-time deterministic framework provides a performance guarantee compared to the optimal solution for all types of L-systemic performance measures, including a class of nonsubmodular metrics.

The proposed algorithm converges asymptotically to the average of the initial values of the trustworthy (nonmalicious) nodes, which we refer to as the trustworthy average, as long as the underlying topology that describes the information exchange among the trustworthy nodes is connected. We first present a distributed iterative algorithm that assumes that each node receives (at each iteration or periodically) side information about the trustworthiness of the other nodes, and it uses such trust assessments to determine whether or not to incorporate messages received from its neighbors, as well as to make proper adjustments in its calculation depending on whether a previously trustworthy neighbor becomes untrustworthy or vice-versa. We show that, as long as the trust assessments for each trustworthy node eventually reflect correctly the status (trustworthy or untrustworthy) of its neighboring nodes, the algorithm guarantees asymptotic convergence to the trustworthy average. We subsequently discuss how the proposed algorithm can be enhanced with functionality that enables each node to obtain trust assessments about its neighbors by utilizing information that it receives from its two-hop neighbors at infrequent, perhaps randomly chosen, time instants.},

As the proposed controller design is framed as a semidefinite program, it allows for an efficient solution. Further, we enhance the geometry of the region of attraction through a heuristic algorithm that establishes a connection between the employed Koopman lifting and the dynamics of the system.

In this article, we consider opacity in linear dynamical systems and study four opacity classes—initial-state, current-state, $K$-step and infinite-step opacity, and show that they are fundamentally connected to two subspaces of the linear system—the weakly unobservable subspace and the weakly unconstructible subspace. With these subspaces, we derive conditions for the opacity of secret states under constrained and unconstrained state and input sets. Further, we establish that a tradeoff exists between opacity and security in the system. We show this in two ways: 1) We prove that an opaque system always permits undetectable attacks. 2) We show that expanding the set of opaque states in the system expands the set of undetectable attacks.

This provides an a priori upper bound on the remaining model uncertainty after exploration, which can further be leveraged in a gain-scheduling controller design that guarantees robust performance. This leads to a semidefinite program-based design which computes an exploration strategy with finite excitation bounds and minimal energy, and a gain-scheduled controller with probabilistic performance bounds that can be implemented after exploration.

Following the information exchange, each agent updates the estimation of the posterior distributions based on the observed reward and the received information from the neighboring agents. Then, each agent decides which arm to select at the next iteration based on the estimated posterior distribution.

Players have a fixed initial endowment and are faced with the task of investing in the common resource without forcing it to failure. The return from the common resource is subject to uncertainty and stochasticity, and is perceived by the players in a prospect-theoretic manner based on their behavioral characteristics. The Fragile CPR Game admits a unique Nash equilibrium (NE), and it has been shown in the literature that the best response dynamics converge to the NE. In this article, we look at the Fragile CPR Game through the lenses of Games in Satisfaction Form. We refer to the corresponding game as the Fragile SAT-CPR Game. Our main and novel result states that the Fragile SAT-CPR Game admits the optimal satisfaction equilibrium (OSE) and that the proposed risk minimizing dynamics, which are based on the best response dynamics, converge to the OSE. This equilibrium point results in minimizing the probability that the CPR collapses, while the players can obtain the same payoffs as in the NE point. Numerical evaluations indicate that in the OSE the probability that the common resource collapses can be decreased by approximately 95% compared to corresponding one in the NE case, while at the same time the players enjoy the same utility values.

  abstract     = {Autonomous systems often have logical constraints arising, for example, from safety, operational, or regulatory requirements. Such constraints can be expressed using temporal logic specifications. The system state is often partially observable. Moreover, it could encompass a team of multiple agents with a common objective but disparate information structures and constraints. In this article, we first introduce an optimal control theory for partially observable Markov decision processes with finite linear temporal logic constraints. We provide a structured methodology for synthesizing policies that maximize a cumulative reward while ensuring that the probability of satisfying a temporal logic constraint is sufficiently high.

These sufficient conditions are based upon linear programming or, in some special cases, establishing the Hurwitzness of a particular Metzler matrix. To prove these sufficient conditions, we develop novel results on non-Euclidean logarithmic norms and a novel necessary and sufficient condition for contractivity of systems with locally Lipschitz dynamics.

To bridge this gap, we propose a novel scalar map on the specified manifold with boundary, which is proved to be a valid navigation function under mild condition. Moreover, it is shown that the gradient of the proposed navigation function can be utilized to solve the constrained attitude control problem of a rigid body.

The motivation arises from the increasing complexity and vulnerability of CPSs, which are prone to various networked challenges, including random DoS attacks and transmission delays. In addition, the presence of time-varying parameters further exacerbates the difficulty in designing stabilizing control strategies. To tackle this challenging issue, we propose two distinct approaches. First, we utilize the frozen technique, leading to the derivation of two explicit sufficient conditions. This technique exploits the concept of “freezing” the time-varying system parameters, providing a novel way to circumvent the construction of Lyapunov functions. The second method involves extending the generalized spectral radius to CPSs for the first time, allowing us to obtain an easily computable adjoint spectral radius. With this extension, we establish necessary and sufficient conditions for achieving exponential stabilization. The effectiveness of our proposed methods is illustrated through two simulation examples.},

This article can be divided into two parts. First, the design of sampled-data-based controllers (SDBCs) via lifting technique (LT) for SDSs with asynchronous switching is discussed. Then, for SDSs with SDBCs, this article takes a further step to design sampled-data-based PIC, which is also based on the LT. For SDBCs design, there are two techniques: 1) the LT and 2) the input time delay method (ITDM). In the case of linear systems, the LT yields better results. However, for nonlinear SDSs modeled by unsolvable equations, there is no prior research on the application of the LT. Thus, in the first part of this article, the LT for nonlinear SDSs with asynchronous switching is generalized. Moreover, comparisons are presented between the LT and the ITDM, showing the superiority of the LT. In the second part, focusing on the design of PICs, some novel mathematical techniques are introduced. This article utilizes the auxiliary system method based on the LT, which is capable of addressing cases where $T&lt; \delta$, with $T$ and $\delta$ denoting the control frame and sampling interval, respectively. Finally, one numerical example and one comparison are provided to show the process of controller design and the superiority of the generalized LT.},

Our bounds accurately capture the role of control-theoretic parameters and we are able to show that systems that are hard to control are also hard to learn to control; when instantiated to state feedback systems we recover the dimensional dependency of earlier work but with improved scaling with system-theoretic constants, such as system costs and Gramians.

Next, we relax these conditions and define approximate information states that can be learned from output data without knowledge of system dynamics.

Then, a novel event-triggered distributed dual averaging (ETDDA) algorithm is designed to solve this dual problem, in which event-triggered mechanisms can tremendously save communication resources. We prove that the convergence of the proposed ETDDA algorithm can be guaranteed as long as the step-size satisfies the specifically designed condition and the triggering threshold bound is square summable. Moreover, we propose a distributed stopping criterion to terminate our ETDDA algorithm when the output solution meets the specified optimality and the coupled constraint is satisfied, thereby avoiding infinite iterations and saving computational resources. The recursive feasibility and the closed-loop stability under the proposed iterative DMPC approach are strictly proved.

This article aims to study the robust model predictive control problem for a class of disturbed asynchronously switched systems with occasional controller disconnection. To mitigate the adverse effect of additive disturbances, a tube-based switched model predictive control strategy is designed by properly tightening original constraints. For the feasibility concern, the minimum mode-dependent dwell time is computed offline so as to ensure that reachable sets from an initial region are included in a common feasible set. Furthermore, a nonconservative stability condition is proposed for switched systems from a set-theoretic perspective. Based on this superior result, two stability strategies with distinct converging speeds are proposed to guarantee the closed-loop system to be uniformly asymptotically stable with constructed terminal constraints. Effectiveness of the theoretical results is validated via a simulation of time-varying communication networks.},

Under this condition, not only the relationship between the output regulation of linear stochastic systems and that of linear deterministic systems is established, but also the solvability in some special cases is discussed. In the case where the control input is not invoked in the tracking error, there almost always exists a bounded and deterministic solution if the stochastic output regulator equation has a bounded solution, which provides a new approach without estimating the Brownian motion. This approach can deal with the crucial issue that the stochastic output regulator equation may not be solved in a practical sense, since the solution depends on the Brownian motion which may not be measured in most real scenes.

  abstract     = {Proportional-integral-derivative (PID) control has been the workhorse of control technology for about a century. Yet to this day, designing and tuning PID controllers relies mostly on either tabulated rules (Ziegler–Nichols) or on classical graphical techniques (Bode). Our goal in this article is to take a fresh look on PID control in the context of optimizing stability margins for low-order (first- and second-order) linear time-invariant systems. Specifically, we seek to derive explicit expressions for gain and phase margins that are achievable using PID control, and thereby gain insights on the role of unstable poles and nonminimum-phase zeros in attaining robust stability. In particular, stability margins attained by PID control for minimum-phase systems match those obtained by more general control, while for nonminimum-phase systems, PID control achieves margins that are no worse than those of general control modulo to a predetermined factor. Furthermore, integral action does not contribute to robust stabilization beyond what can be achieved by PD control alone.},

  abstract     = {In this article, we study the simultaneous actuator selection and controller design problem for linear quadratic regulation with Gaussian noise over a finite horizon of length $T$ and unknown system model. We consider episodic and nonepisodic settings of the problem and propose online algorithms that specify both the sets of actuators to be utilized under a cardinality constraint and the controls corresponding to the sets of selected actuators. In the episodic setting, the interaction with the system breaks into $N$ episodes, each of which restarts from a given initial condition and has length $T$. In the nonepisodic setting, the interaction goes on continuously. Our online algorithms leverage a multiarmed bandit algorithm to select the sets of actuators and a certainty equivalence approach to design the corresponding controls. We show that our online algorithms yield $\sqrt{N}$-regret for the episodic setting and $T^{2/3}$-regret for the nonepisodic setting. We extend our algorithm design and analysis to show scalability with respect to both the total number of candidate actuators and the cardinality constraint. We numerically validate our theoretical results.},

  abstract     = {Passivity is a well-established concept for continuous-time systems. Yet, its application to discrete time, delay, or other classes of systems is somewhat limited, leading to inconsistencies and disparities. In this article, we study a new notion, $\varrho$-passivity, which reduces to standard passivity in the continuous-time case but addresses some of the aforementioned limitations when applied to other classes of systems. In particular, in an abstract input–output setting, we show that $\varrho$-passivity is preserved under a class of interconnections, thereby extending the existing passivity results. Moreover, we explore the relationship between $\varrho$-passivity and stability, and we derive sufficient conditions for high-gain, low-gain, and causal stabilizability by static output feedback. Finally, in contrast to the standard passivity notion, we prove that $\varrho$-passivity is preserved under sampling for a class of nonlinear systems and discretization methods. Overall, the results of this article constitute the first step toward a unifying passivity theory embracing all the different domains and systems classes relevant to systems and control theory.},
