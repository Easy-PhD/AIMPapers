That article also summarized some recent large verdicts for patents asserted by academic institutions and provided several reasons why this series may be of interest to the readership of IEEE Micro, most notably because the inventors are well known and several well-known computer architects worked as experts on this case. Part II described the complaints, namely, it described the plaintiff, Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation (“WARF”), the inventors, and WARF’s allegations as to how Apple’s products infringed WARF’s patent. Part III described Apple’s answer to the allegations in WARF’s complaint, Apple’s counterclaims, and WARF’s response to those counterclaims. Part IV examined Apple’s allegation of inequitable conduct by the inventors, a technical analysis of that allegation, and Judge Conley’s legal analysis of the sufficiency of Apple’s allegations.},

Past work has shown how linear representations can be effectively used to optimize problems expressed in max-plus algebras, but efficient general-purpose arithmetic operations have remained elusive. We present negative-logarithmic delay-space arithmetic as a completely new approach to temporal coding. Under this approach, general-purpose arithmetic is transformed to a “soft” version of the standard temporal operations in such a way that preserves all of the algebraic identities. We further show that these soft operations can be approximated by composing the original “sharp” temporal operators, resulting in simple, energy-efficient implementations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this novel arithmetic with a near-sensor architecture for energy-efficient convolutions. Cycle-over-cycle operation is supported through temporal recurrence, dramatically limiting the need for expensive domain conversions or noise-prone temporal memories.},

To overcome the scalability shortcomings of current methods, we propose BlitzCoin, a fully decentralized hardware-based PM coupled with optimized unified voltage and frequency regulation. We evaluated BlitzCoin through register transfer-level simulations of multiple SoCs targeted toward different application domains. The results are further validated through silicon measurements of a fabricated 12-nm many-accelerator SoC that includes BlitzCoin. Our evaluations show that BlitzCoin is markedly faster than state-of-the-art centralized PM strategies, with 8 × to 12 × lower response times. This results in 25%–34% throughput improvement and allows for scaling to 7 × to 13 × larger SoCs, all with a small area overhead of <1%. BlitzCoin is an addition to the open source ESP SoC platform, offering a foundation for further exploration of PM strategies.},

Despite this limitation, there is growing demand for energy-efficient in-order cores due to privacy and sustainability concerns. Scalar vector runahead (SVR) provides an elegant solution by extracting high memory-level parallelism through piggybacking on existing instructions executed on the processor that lead to future irregular memory accesses. SVR speculatively executes multiple transient, independent, parallel instances of memory accesses and their instruction chains, by initiating memory accesses from many different values of a predicted induction variable. This approach moves mutually independent memory accesses next to each other to hide dependent stalls. With a hardware overhead of only 2 KiB and without the need for hardware vector extensions, SVR delivers 3.2× higher performance than a baseline three-wide in-order core inspired by an Arm Cortex A510, and 1.3× higher performance than an out-of-order core, while halving energy consumption.},

Yet, high-level source optimization remains challenging due to the intricate nature of understanding code semantics. Our approach unifies machine learning techniques with established insights and tools from computer architecture to tackle the inherent challenges of high-level optimization. In this work, we introduce a framework that harnesses large language models (LLMs) for high-level program optimization. We curate a dataset of competitive C++ submissions, each accompanied by extensive unit tests to capture performance-improving patterns. To mitigate the variability of performance measurements, we develop an evaluation harness using the gem5 full-system simulator. Our results show a mean speedup of 6.86, outperforming the average human optimization of 3.66×. We also give an overview of subsequent work in this space, describing how LLM-driven optimization enables autonomously applying performance-improving edits across billions of lines of code in Google data centers.},

Growing power demands of artificial intelligence (AI) in the cloud industry has become a global problem.5 Our analysis shows that LLM inference involves two distinct phases: a compute-intensive prefill phase and a memory-intensive decode phase, each with different resource needs. Running them together introduces inefficient scheduling. Furthermore, unlike the prefill phase, the decode phase can run on lower-cost and lower-power hardware. Building on these insights, we propose Splitwise, a scheduling technique that splits prefill and decode phases across different machines to achieve better throughput. Additionally, Splitwise allows phase-specific hardware optimization. By efficiently transferring request state between machines, Splitwise achieves up to 2.35× more throughput within the same power and cost budgets, or 1.4× higher throughput at 20% lower cost and same power.},

On the theory side, we propose a set of analyses that can be applied using only the algorithm specification—the cascade of Einsums summations. On the practice side, we use the new analyses to understand and taxonomize the space of attention algorithms and to iteratively build up an efficient, high-utilization accelerator. Our resulting design, FuseMax, achieves an average 6.7× speedup on attention and 5.3× speedup on end-to-end transformer inference over the prior state of the art, FLAT, while using 79% and 83% of the energy, respectively.},

To maximize resource utilization while ensuring quality of service, a natural approach is to virtualize NPUs for efficient resource sharing for multitenant ML services. However, virtualizing NPUs is challenging. This is not only due to the lack of system abstraction support for NPU hardware, but also due to the lack of architectural and instruction set architecture (ISA) support for fine-grained operator scheduling. This article presents Neu10, an NPU virtualization framework consisting of 1) an abstraction called vNPU for fine-grained virtualization of the heterogeneous compute units in a physical NPU (pNPU), 2) a vNPU allocator that enables pay-as-you-go pricing and flexible vNPU-to-pNPU mappings, and 3) an ISA extension of modern NPU architecture for fine-grained tensor operator scheduling for multiple vNPUs. We evaluate Neu10 with a production-level simulator to demonstrate its benefits over state-of-the-art NPU sharing approaches.},

We built three GreenSKU prototypes, integrating energy-efficient CPUs, reusing old dynamic RAM via compute express link, and reusing old solid-state drives. We reveal challenges that limit GreenSKUs’ carbon savings at scale and may prevent their adoption by cloud providers. To address these challenges, we developed a novel framework, GSF (GreenSKU Framework), that enables cloud providers to systematically evaluate GreenSKUs’ carbon savings at scale. By implementing GSF within Microsoft Azure’s production constraints, we demonstrate that GreenSKUs reduce net cloud emissions by 8%, which is globally significant.

Traditional approaches based on fixed-size matrix multiplications often fall short in scalability and flexibility. RNGD (pronounced “Renegade”), a second-generation tensor contraction processor, introduces an innovative architecture designed to exploit the parallelism and data locality inherent in tensor computations. Its coarse-grained processing elements (PEs) can operate as a unified large-scale unit or as multiple independent units, providing flexibility for various tensor shapes. Key innovations, such as a circuit switch-based fetch network, input broadcasting, and buffer-based reuse mechanisms, further enhance computational efficiency.

Most such prior accelerators are fixed-function, which is insufficient for two reasons. First, applications typically include both dense and sparse components, and second, the algorithms that comprise these applications are constantly evolving. To address these challenges, we designed a programmable accelerator called Onyx for both sparse tensor algebra and dense workloads. Onyx extends a coarse-grained reconfigurable array (CGRA) optimized for dense applications with composable hardware primitives to support arbitrary sparse tensor algebra kernels. In this article, we show that we can further optimize Onyx by adding a small set of hardware features for parallelization that significantly increase both temporal and spatial utilization of the CGRA, reducing runtime by up to 6.2×.},

  abstract     = {Compute Express Link (CXL) memory brings extra bandwidth and capacity via Peripheral-Component-Interconnect-Express-based memory expansion beyond double-data-rate-based dynamic random-access memory. This article introduces the CXL 2.0 memory expansion solution, which incorporates two parts: 1) a CXL memory expander prototype and 2) the heterogeneous memory software development kit. We demonstrate the feasibility of our CXL memory solution by implementing it on CacheLib, Meta’s general-purpose key-value caching engine. We highlight how our application design and guidelines for CXL memory enable resolving the shortcomings of conventional memory system architectures. Our proposals enable 1) expanding memory bandwidth and capacity or 2) considerable DRAM savings. Evaluation results show that we can achieve a 25% increase in memory bandwidth, up to 15% throughput gain, and a 9% latency reduction. Furthermore, in hybrid cache using nonvolatile memory (NVM), expanding the RAM cache area with CXL memory, which is relatively cheaper than DRAM, enhances the throughput and hit ratio due to reduced NVM input–output.},

  abstract     = {Graphics processing units (GPUs) have become prevalent across various domains due to their high throughput and energy efficiency. A major challenge in GPU computing is branch divergence, which occurs when the control flow paths of concurrently executing threads diverge. Branch divergence significantly degrades performance, as diverged threads are executed in a serialized, time-sliced manner. To mitigate this issue, we propose a novel approximate computing technique for GPUs. Our method approximates the results of diverged threads by selectively terminating their execution. Furthermore, it incorporates a dynamic mechanism that adjusts both the probability of termination and the number of instructions executed before termination, based on user-defined parameters. This technique allows users to balance execution speed and result accuracy, offering greater flexibility in controlling computational quality. Additionally, by changing the approximation aggressiveness at runtime, we can accommodate applications such as virtual reality/augmented reality, where the demand for accuracy changes in real-time.},

To achieve these goals, we propose four innovative ideas: a dual-processing element array (D-PEA) with reduced memories, a synchronous row connection and processing element (PE) architecture, a concatenable crypto arithmetic logic unit, and heterogeneous PEs. Our MRCA 2.0 has been successfully implemented on the TySOM-3A field-programmable gate array platform across 19 different algorithms. Our application-specific integrated circuit experiment on 45-nm CMOS technology shows that MRCA 2.0 reduces area and power consumption by 1.6 and 1.4 times, respectively, compared to the previous MRCA. Compared to related works, MRCA 2.0 outperforms in throughput by 1.63–28.3 times and in energy efficiency by 1.6–3.4 times, while also offering better flexibility in supporting more 64-bit algorithms.},

It combines point neural network (PNN)-based 3-D segmentation with lidar SLAM to minimize pose errors due to the lack of perception in previous SLAM. The proposed processor is designed with a heterogeneous multicore architecture that utilizes single instruction, multiple data and reconfigurable processing elements to fully support its three main operations: k-nearest neighbor (KNN), PNN, and nonlinear optimization. It accelerates KNN operations with spherical bin partitioning optimized for the distribution of lidar data to eliminate unnecessary search spaces. In addition, the proposed spatiotemporal-aware computing minimizes excessive memory overhead and workload imbalance in KNN and PNN operations. Consequently, fabricated with 28-nm CMOS technology, the processor achieves 8.245 mJ/frame of energy consumption and a maximum performance of 20.7-ms latency, successfully demonstrating real-time semantic lidar SLAM system with 99.86% lower power consumption compared to modern CPU+GPU platforms.},

  abstract     = {Interconnection networks are crucial in data centers and supercomputers, ensuring high communication bandwidth and low latency under demanding traffic patterns from data-intensive applications. These patterns can cause congestion, affecting system performance if not addressed efficiently. Current congestion control techniques, like data center quantized congestion notification (DCQCN), struggle to precisely identify which packets cause congestion, leading to false positives. We propose the enhanced congestion point (ECP) mechanism, which accurately identifies congesting packets. ECP monitors packets at the head of switch ingress queues, flagging them as congesting when queue occupancy exceeds a threshold and packet requests are rejected. Additionally, ECP introduces a reevaluation mechanism to cancel the identification of congesting packets if they no longer contribute to congestion after rerouting. We evaluated ECP using a network simulator modeling various configurations and realistic traffic patterns. Results show that ECP significantly improves congestion detection accuracy with a low error margin, enhancing DCQCN performance.},

Many works have tried to optimize the process of producing collective algorithms and running collective communications, which act as a bottleneck to distributed ML. However, different works use their own collective algorithm representation, resulting in a fragmented optimization environment. We propose a standardized workflow leveraging a common representation format based on Chakra Execution Trace, a widely used graph-based representation of distributed ML workloads. This common representation enables us to view collective communications at the same level as workload operations and decouple producer and consumer tools, enhancing interoperability and reducing engineering effort. We provide a proof of concept of this standardized workflow by simulating the collective algorithms generated by MSCCLang domain-specific language and the topology-aware collective algorithm synthesizer (TACOS) through the accelerator scaling for training simulator (ASTRA-sim) distributed ML simulator using multiple network configurations.},

The message passing interface (MPI) is a dominant model for parallel programming. Among its primitives, MPI_Alltoall is a communication-intensive operation widely employed in numerous applications, yet it remains challenging to optimize. Alltoall algorithms are mainly classified into flat and hierarchical. The hierarchical designs avoid the slowdown of intra/inter-node communication by decoupling them. Hierarchical designs also reduce network congestion by limiting concurrently injected messages. This work demonstrates hierarchical designs also improve connection scalability in remote direct memory access networks. This improvement is attributed to the cache thrashing happening inside network adapters. All of these advantages of hierarchical schemes collectively contribute to the network scalability of Alltoall. We propose and evaluate a network-agnostic design on InfiniBand and Omni-Path clusters, showing benefits at both micro-benchmark and application levels over other MPI libraries.},

However, implementing such a solution on a large scale and maintaining it over time is a big challenge. This is due to the need to not only update the device firmware to remove errors and extend the functionality of the devices but also to update the ML models. This imposes several requirements for device monitoring and management mechanisms. In this article, we discuss not only the required aspects that an IoT system should meet, but we also show how they fit into the ML model management process.},

  abstract     = {The Internet of Intelligent Vehicles is becoming increasingly important, and embedded machine learning is gaining popularity due to new development paradigms. However, the demand for machine learning model updates on embedded systems has become relevant in multiple scenarios. This article proposes a methodology for tiny machine learning operations within the context of the Internet of Intelligent Vehicles, utilizing affordable microcontrollers based on the ESP32 platform. The solution presented in the article consists of two ESP32 devices: one functioning as a radio station (RS) and the other as the microcontroller of an onboard diagnostic (OBD-II) scanner. The RS hosts the updated model and transmits it to the OBD-II scanner using the Espressif Systems Peer-to-Peer Over Wi-Fi communication protocol over 802.11 Wi-Fi. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvement in model performance postupdate, but the article also identifies critical challenges to model robustness because of the use of the interpreter method on microcontrollers.},

The chiplet market is projected to significantly ramp up in the next few years, and we need to be able to support chiplets from multiple vendors in the same package. These realities create new test and debug challenges through all stages of chiplet productization from sort to in field. There is a scaling challenge to test and debug efficiently without growing package pin count; there is a challenge of test time reduction and interoperability when testing and debugging with chiplets from multiple vendors. Additionally, silicon lifecycle management (SLM) of chiplets in a system in package (SIP) for manufacturing quality monitoring and in-field predictive analysis is a significant challenge. This article presents a comprehensive test, debug, and SLM architecture for addressing these challenges in a Universal Chiplet Interconnect Express-based SIP, paving the way for an open chiplet ecosystem.},

Central to a successful chiplet-based product is the die-to-die interconnect technology between the chiplets. Based on product requirements, some chiplet designs can utilize a single interconnect technology such as 2-D signals over an organic substrate or higher-density 2.5-D integration technologies. With increasing demands on compute and memory capabilities, high-performance products are now moving to heterogeneous integration, which combines multiple advanced packaging technologies all within a single system on chip. To address the market demands for high-performance artificial intelligence solutions, AMD has introduced the AMD Instinct MI300X accelerator.

  abstract     = {Today, packaging plays a crucial role in determining chip performance in systems. As transistor sizes shrink and chip sizes grow to meet increasing processing demands, wafer yield drops. Connecting smaller chips within a package or using multidie designs has gained attention as it improves yield, enables intellectual property reuse, enhances performance, and lowers costs. The Universal Chiplet Interconnect Express standard, developed by industry leaders, supports these efforts by enabling different dies, or chiplets, to work together smoothly. Various structures based on this standard, such as standard 2-D organic substrate, 2.5-D through-silicon via interposer, Fanout redistribution layer organic interposer, and 3-D hybrid bonding, have been suggested. Despite the benefits, die integration faces challenges due to dense and intricate connections. This article focuses on achieving effective die-to-die connectivity using organic and advanced packaging. These patterns have been validated through simulations and the fabrication of the test chip.},

The rise in cost per transistor (CPT) is outweighing scaling benefits from advances in generational process technology. These diminishing silicon economies of scale have pushed foundries, EDA companies, and the manufacturing ecosystem to enable chiplet designs. Developments in packaging technology and standardization of die-to-die interfaces provide technology gains offsetting challenges of die sizes and CPT. Standards bodies and IP implementers have risen to the challenge, providing solutions to interface bottlenecks. We examine standards for chiplet and die-to-die interfaces, such as UCIe and the work done in the industry to enable these. Architectural partitions for chiplet implementations and development of reusable components that enable a future chiplet marketplace are considered. The juggernaut for differentiation and disaggregation in the more-than-Moore era continues to build momentum. We examine these trends and recent technology advances, looking at future directions for implementations.},
