We want to address this shortcoming with our library gafro. This article presents an overview of the implementation details as well as a tutorial of gafro, an efficient C++ library targeting robotics applications using geometric algebra. The library focuses on using conformal geometric algebra. Hence, various geometric primitives are available for computation as well as rigid body transformations. The modeling of robotic systems is also an important aspect of the library. It implements various algorithms for calculating the kinematics and dynamics of such systems as well as objectives for optimization problems. The software stack is completed by Python bindings in pygafro and a ROS interface in gafro_ros.},

It assumes the reader has no prior knowledge of mining and builds context gradually through focused discussion and short summaries of common open-pit mining operations. The principal activities that take place may be categorized in terms of resource development, mine-, rail- and port operations. From mineral exploration to ore shipment, there are roughly nine steps in between. These include: geological assessment, mine planning and development, production drilling and assaying, blasting and excavation, transportation of ore and waste, crush and screen, stockpile and load-out, rail network distribution, and ore-car dumping. The objective is to describe these processes and provide insights on some of the challenges / opportunities from the perspective of a decade-long industry-university R&D partnership.},

  abstract     = {Connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) and robot swarms (RSs) hold transformative potential for enhancing safety, efficiency, and sustainability in the transportation and manufacturing sectors. Extensive testing and validation of these technologies are crucial for their deployment in the real world. While simulations are essential for initial testing, they often have limitations in capturing the complex dynamics of real-world interactions. This limitation underscores the importance of small-scale testbeds. These testbeds provide a realistic, cost-effective, and controlled environment for testing and validating algorithms, acting as an essential intermediary between simulation and full-scale experiments. This work serves to facilitate researchers’ efforts in identifying existing small-scale testbeds suitable for their experiments and provide insights for those who want to build their own. In addition, it delivers a comprehensive survey of the current landscape of these testbeds. We derive 62 characteristics of testbeds based on the well-known sense–plan–act paradigm and offer an online table comparing 23 small-scale testbeds based on these characteristics. The online table is hosted on our designated public webpage, https://bassamlab.github.io/testbeds-survey, and we invite testbed creators and developers to contribute to it. We closely examine nine testbeds in this article, demonstrating how the derived characteristics can be used to present testbeds. Furthermore, we discuss three ongoing challenges concerning small-scale testbeds that we identified, i.e., small-scale to full-scale transition, sustainability, and power and resource management.},

  abstract     = {Hand posture recognition technology makes humancomputer interaction more natural and efficient. Existing hand posture recognition algorithms are mainly based on RGB images or depth data, each of which has its limitations: the former is susceptible to the interference of lighting and background color, while the latter is difficult to capture details and affects accuracy. To overcome these problems, fusion of RGB images and depth data has become a research trend. However, traditional static fusion methods use fixed modal weights, which are difficult to adapt to the complex relationships between modalities and lead to performance degradation. To cope with this problem, this paper proposes a Fusion module, including Multi-Scale Gated Extraction modules (MSGE) for multi-scale feature extraction and gating mechanism, Context Sensitive Dynamic Filtering modules (CSDF) for dynamically adjusting the weights according to the modal importance, and Importance Weighted Fusion modules (IWF) for adaptive weighting. Based on this, this paper proposes a network that fuses RGB information and depth data, named Dynamic Importance-Weighted Fusion Network (DIWFNet). This network utilizes a dual-branch YOLOv5 framework integrated with four Fusion modules, fully leveraging the complementary nature of RGB images and depth data. Through dynamic weight distribution and adaptive feature convolution, it precisely captures and models the complex interactions between different modalities, enhancing the accuracy and robustness of hand posture recognition. Our method has shown excellent performance on the CUG dataset, NTU dataset, and self-built dataset, and has been successfully applied to robots in real operational environments.},

This work introduces and evaluates a novel personalized context-aware method for modeling users’ proxemics preferences during human-robot interactions. Using an interactive augmented reality interface, we collected a set of user-preferred distances from the robot and employed an active transfer learning approach to fine-tune a specialized deep learning model. We evaluated this approach through two user studies: 1) a convenience population study (N = 24) to validate the efficacy of the active transfer learning approach; and 2) a user study involving older adults (N = 15) to assess the system’s usability. We compared the data collected with the augmented reality interface and with the physical robot to examine the relationship between proxemics preferences for a virtual robot versus a physically embodied robot. We found that fine-tuning significantly improved model performance: on average, the error in testing decreased by 26.97% after fine-tuning. The system was well-received by older adult participants, who provided valuable feedback and suggestions for future work.},

  abstract     = {Although the Internet of Robotic Things (IoRT) has enhanced the productivity of robotic systems in conjunction with the Internet of Things (IoT), it does not inherently support seamless human-robot collaboration. This paper presents HuBotVerse, a unified framework designed to foster the evolution of the Internet of Human and Intelligent Robotic Things (IoHIRT). HuBotVerse is advantageous due to its unique features, including security, user-friendliness, manageability, and its open-source nature. Moreover, this framework can seamlessly integrate various Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) interfaces to facilitate collaborative control between humans and robots. Here, we emphasize a Digital Twin-Based Mixed Reality (MR) interface, which enhances teleoperation efficiency by offering users an intuitive and immersive way to interact. To evaluate the effectiveness of HuBotVerse, we conducted user studies based on a pick-and-place task. Feedback was gathered through questionnaires, complemented by a quantitative analysis of key performance metrics, user experience, and the NASA Task Load Index (NASA-TLX). Results indicate that the fusion of MR and HuBotVerse within a comprehensive framework significantly improves the efficiency and user experience of teleoperation. Moreover, the follow-up questionnaires reflect the advantages of the HuBotVerse framework in terms of evident user-friendliness, manageability, and usability in homecare or healthcare applications.

  abstract     = {This article brings the concept of neuroergonomic workcell with its essential components (psychological and physical assessment, nonphysical, physical, and strategic support) for improving the well-being and productivity of workers at their workplaces. A proof-of-concept neuroergonomic human-centered workstation is demonstrated in a real factory environment for a typical industrial laborious task: assembly. The pilot workstation introduces a fully portable, noninvasive electroencephalogram (EEG)-based users’ mental workload assessment, a nonobtrusive human–machine interface, illustrative graphical assembly guidelines, a collaborative robot assistant, and an intelligent task scheduler. The subjects’ performance and workload were assessed using a NASA Task Load Index questionnaire, three EEG workload indices, hand gesture detection accuracy, the number of errors, and task duration. We identified a notable correlation between multiple EEG indices of workload and NASA score results. The new workstation boosts productivity with better performance and fewer errors on the assembly line while reducing mental demand. Its modular design ensures easy integration and adaptation into factory settings, optimizing manual assembly processes.},

  abstract     = {Autonomous excavator systems can alleviate the issues caused by the shortage of skilled labor forces and increasing labor costs. For autonomous excavation, real-time landscape estimation, excavation path generation, control, and precise landscape inspection are all essential. In this article, we propose and experimentally validate an integrated autonomous excavator system incorporating all these elements. Specifically, unlike previous research, we introduce a sensor arrangement capable of sufficiently covering the regions of interest regardless of the inclination of the target landscape, a motion planning method that satisfies geometric and physical constraints, and a precise postexcavation inspection module using only onboard sensors. The proposed methodology was experimentally validated using a real 30-ton hydraulic excavator. It successfully performed a cutting task on an upward slope with 45° inclination and achieved a centimeter-level accuracy through autonomous repetitive excavation; also, the proposed postexcavation inspection method demonstrated subcentimeter precision within seconds using onboard sensors only.},

The purpose of the Int-Ball2 project is to assist astronauts and reduce their workload in the International Space Station (ISS). This robot is an upgrade from the first Int-Ball, enhancing the propulsion subsystem for greater maneuverability and adding a new docking station (DS) for autonomous battery recharging. This study performed comprehensive ground tests for autonomous maneuvering and docking, employing a combination of a fully software-based simulator, a hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) simulator, and a planar air-bearing facility. After a successful launch to the ISS, the Int-Ball2 demonstrated its ability to work in microgravity without relying on astronaut support. The results obtained from ground and orbital tests underscored the effectiveness of our system design and ground verification approach. Further, we present key technologies essential for the Int-Ball2’s successful implementation on board the ISS. We expect the insights from this project to be invaluable to future missions involving free-flying robots in microgravity.},

  abstract     = {Industrial facilities such as chemical factories, gas terminals, and power plants can contain kilometers of piping that require meticulous inspection for leaks and defects prior to operation. This is a costly and time-consuming process that sometimes requires dismantling sections of pipe. While current internal inspection devices such as borescopes, “pipe inspection gadgets,” rovers, and drones serve specific purposes, none can effectively maneuver through multiple bends with large diameter changes while pulling a tethered sensor. As a first step in addressing this need, we tackled the mobility challenge without a sensor, developing a 33-m-long, 1-m-wide, soft, inflatable vine robot for accessing hard-to-reach spaces in dangerous industrial facilities. We also investigated ways to mount sensors to large-scale vine robots, identified key challenges in doing so, and provide the framework for a potential solution. Our work addresses many modeling, design, and scaling challenges, including frictional properties, gravitational effects, pneumatic control, and portability. To validate the device’s capabilities, we conducted testing at a Bechtel facility in Houston, TX, USA. Our portable device successfully navigated a 24-m-long section of oil and gas piping, negotiating a 90° bend, a vertical section, a blockage, and an open chamber. Our work not only represents a substantial advancement in addressing current pipe navigation challenges but also establishes a new benchmark as the world’s largest soft robot, showcasing the effectiveness of pneumatic principles at large scales.},

In this sense, this article presents the first prototype of Ona, an autonomous last-mile delivery robot that, in contrast to existing platforms, has a medium-sized storage capacity with the capability of navigating in both street and pedestrian areas. Herein we describe the platform and position it with respect to other existing prototypes, providing its main software modules and the first validation experiments, carried out in the Barcelona Robot Lab (Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya); Esplugues de Llobregat (next to Barcelona); and Debrecen (Hungary), which are representative urban scenarios. In such validations, we focus our analysis on the key localization module, whose errors could cascade down the rest of the navigation pipeline (e.g., planning or control). Aside from robotic technical details, we also include the results of the technology acceptance by the public present in the Esplugues de Llobregat test, collected in situ through a survey.},

  abstract     = {Actuators play a crucial role in robotics, determining the force and speed capabilities necessary for varied tasks, directly affecting the performance of the robotic system. With the growing reliance on robotics in both industrial applications and daily life, innovative actuator research has expanded significantly. Despite advances, traditional actuators encounter limitations in performance and operational range due to inherent physical constraints. To address these challenges, variable transmission mechanisms (VTMs) have emerged over the past decade as one of the alternative solutions, enhancing the adaptability and efficiency of robotic systems. However, there is currently a lack of survey articles that comprehensively cover the mechanisms and working principles of VTMs in robotics. This review article fills this gap by offering an extensive analysis of VTM applications in robotics. It categorizes VTMs based on their mechanisms and principles, presents case studies on both commercial and experimental VTMs, and provides insights into future prospects.},

  abstract     = {MRI-guided intervention for the liver and kidney has achieved considerable progress in tumour diagnosis and treatment over the past two decades. However, due to the space constraints associated with the narrow and deep bore of the MRI machines, it is still extremely challenging for clinicians to position and drive the needle-shaped probes used for delivering the treatment where the targeted tumoral mass is located. MRIcompatible robotic systems have been investigated by several research teams worldwide, both in academia and industry. These endeavours aim to address challenges related to the confined workspace within MRI machine bores. The goal is to facilitate the shift from CT-guided to MRI-guided interventions, leveraging the advantages of MRI, including its exceptional soft tissue contrast, non-ionizing radiation, and versatile multi-angle imaging capabilities. In this article, we systematically review the state-of-the-art MRI-guided needle insertion robots for the treatment of the liver and kidney in order to identify challenges, trends and potential research gaps in this field. Furthermore, this review encompasses robotic systems designed for anatomically similar regions or exhibiting comparable structures to those intended for interventions in the liver and kidney. These systems, which have shown potential for application in this field, are discussed to explore possibilities within this domain. The review concludes by proposing future research directions in this area.},

Until now, the da Vinci surgical system (Intuitive Surgical Inc, Sunnyvale, California) has been the most widely adopted robot of this kind, with more than 6,700 systems in current clinical use worldwide [1]. To accelerate research on robotic-assisted surgery, the retired first-generation da Vinci robots have been redeployed for research use as “da Vinci Research Kits” (dVRKs), which have been distributed to research institutions around the world to support both training and research in the sector. In the past ten years, a great amount of research on the dVRK has been carried out across a vast range of research topics. During this extensive and distributed process, common technical issues have been identified that are buried deep within the dVRK research and development architecture, and were found to be common among dVRK user feedback, regardless of the breadth and disparity of research directions identified. This paper gathers and analyzes the most significant of these, with a focus on the technical constraints of the first-generation dVRK, which both existing and prospective users should be aware of before embarking onto dVRK-related research. The hope is that this review will aid users in identifying and addressing common limitations of the systems promptly, thus helping to accelerate progress in the field.},

The sim2real approach faces challenges due to mismatches between simulation and reality. These discrepancies arise from inaccuracies in modeling physical phenomena and asynchronous control, among other factors. To this end, we introduce EAGERx, a framework with a unified software pipeline for both real and simulated robot learning. It can support various simulators and aids in integrating state, action and time-scale abstractions to facilitate learning. EAGERx’s integrated delay simulation, domain randomization features, and proposed synchronization algorithm contribute to narrowing the sim2real gap. We demonstrate (in the context of robot learning and beyond) the efficacy of EAGERx in accommodating diverse robotic systems and maintaining consistent simulation behavior.

  abstract     = {Humans can autonomously learn the relationship between sensation and motion in their own bodies, estimate and control their own body states, and move while continuously adapting to the current environment. On the other hand, current robots control their bodies by learning the network structure described by humans from their experiences, making certain assumptions on the relationship between sensors and actuators. In addition, the network model does not adapt to changes in the robot’s body, the tools that are grasped, or the environment, and there is no unified theory, not only for control but also for state estimation, anomaly detection, simulation, and so on. In this study, we propose a Generalized Multisensory Correlational Model (GeMuCo), in which the robot itself acquires a body schema describing the correlation between sensors and actuators from its own experience, including model structures such as network input/output. The robot adapts to the current environment by updating this body schema model online, estimates and controls its body state, and even performs anomaly detection and simulation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this method by applying it to tool-use considering changes in grasping state for an axis-driven robot, to joint-muscle mapping learning for a musculoskeletal robot, and to full-body tool manipulation for a low-rigidity plasticmade humanoid.},

The haptic interface platform enables a human operator to control the robot intuitively by measuring the operator's motion with a motion capture system, providing haptic feedback to the user’s arms, fingers, and feet, and providing 3D image feedback. Additionally, facial animation further enhances immersion by synchronizing the face expression of the robot with the user’s voice. The proposed teleoperation system offers a promising solution for the human-oriented robotic avatar system, which was verified through a global competition, the $10M ANA Avatar XPRIZE.

The gait reward is designed to distribute motor torque evenly across all legs, contributing to more balanced power usage and mitigating performance bottlenecks due to single-motor saturation.

This work aims to prove that learning dynamic jumping is possible without relying on imitating a reference trajectory by leveraging a curriculum design. Starting from a vertical in-place jump, we generalize the learned policy to forward and diagonal jumps and, finally, we learn to jump across obstacles. Conditioned on the desired landing location, orientation, and obstacle dimensions, the proposed approach yields a wide range of omnidirectional jumping motions in real-world experiments. In particular, we achieve a 90 cm forward jump, exceeding all previous records for similar robots. Additionally, the robot can reliably execute continuous jumping on soft grassy grounds, which is especially remarkable as such conditions were not included in the training stage.},

Although various techniques and robotic systems have been developed for en-bloc tumor resection, achieving a negative resection margin remains challenging with standard resectoscopes. Here, we present the Robot-Optimized Bladder Endoscopy Resection of Tumor (ROBERT) system, a dual-arm robotic system designed to fit into a standard irrigation sheath along with an endoscope. The ROBERT system offers enhanced dexterity and payload capacity, allowing surgeons to perform en-bloc tumor resections effectively. In both ex-vivo and in-vivo experiments, the ROBERT system achieved negative margins, with muscular tissue visually identified in the excised samples. The fastest resection was completed in approximately 6 minutes, and the largest excised tissue size was 15 ×15 × 3mm. These results demonstrate ROBERT system’s feasibility and potential for improving bladder tumor resection outcomes.},

  abstract     = {This paper proposes a master-slave operated robotic system that features the novel slave manipulator with a modular distal continuum section to address the shortcomings of traditional transanal endoscopic microsurgery (TEM). The slave manipulator consists of two 7-DoF surgical instruments and a 5-DoF endoscopic arm that are designed with distal continuum structures and unfolded with a Y configuration after inserting through a transanal port to enhance hand-eye coordination and instrument triangulation. The proposed robot is designed for adaptation in narrow and shallow rectal spaces, facilitating intuitive hand-eye coordination and enhanced operational dexterity with reduced obstruction of the field of view. A novel hybrid coaxial continuum unit (HCCU) has been designed to offer excellent bending characteristics and structural stiffness. This unit has been developed as a modular design and supports different connection configurations to form the multi-DoF surgical instruments and endoscopic arm. FEA-based structure optimization has been implemented to improve the mechanical performances of the HCCU unit. Dexterity optimization under anatomical constraints is proposed to improve the maneuverability of the multi-DoF distal continuum section. Experimental investigations on bending and anti-twisting performances on the designed HCCU joint are carried out. The average error value of distal positioning within [- 100°, 100°] does not exceed 1.10%, and the torsional stiffness is 6.86 mNm/°. The payload capability of the surgical instrument has been investigated to demonstrate a maximum value of 5 N. The robotic system is prototyped and the trajectory tracking experiments have been performed to validate its positioning accuracy. The user study has been investigated, and the simulated operation tasks that include grape peeling and suturing operations as well as apricot suturing and threading operations, have been performed. The experimental results demonstrate its potential to be utilized in TEM surgery with an extensive surgical field of view and excellent maneuverability.},

Many activities we do routinely, such as driving a car, require real-time system manipulation as well as substantial field-specific knowledge. Recent breakthroughs in natural language processing, particularly with large language models (LLMs), are empowering humanoid robots to access and process vast information sources and operate systems with an unprecedented level of autonomy. This article introduces PIBOT, a humanoid robot that can pilot unmodified general aviation (GA) aircraft, physically manipulating instruments while following strict rules of the air and verbally communicating with copilots and air traffic controllers (ATCs). Building on these capabilities, we developed an LLM-based task planner that interprets natural language commands, translating them into action sequences. Then, the behavior decision module breaks tasks into precise limb movements, enabling humanlike control of cockpit instruments. In a series of rigorous simulations, PIBOT demonstrates its capabilities to successfully take off and land an airplane from a cold-and-dark start, showcasing its potential for a fully autonomous robot pilot.},

  abstract     = {Humanoid robots are envisioned as embodied intelligent agents capable of performing a wide range of human-level loco-manipulation tasks, particularly in scenarios that require strenuous and repetitive labor. However, learning these skills is challenging due to the high degrees of freedom of humanoid robots, and collecting sufficient training data for humanoid is a laborious process. Given the rapid introduction of new humanoid platforms, a cross-embodiment framework that allows generalizable skill transfer is becoming increasingly critical. To address this, we propose a transferable framework that reduces the data bottleneck by using a unified digital human model as a common prototype and bypassing the need for retraining on every new robot platform. The model learns behavior primitives from human demonstrations through adversarial imitation, and the complex robot structures are decomposed into functional components, each of which are trained independently and dynamically coordinated. Task generalization is achieved through a human-object interaction graph, and skills are transferred to different robots via embodiment-specific kinematic motion retargeting and dynamic fine-tuning. Our framework is validated on five humanoid robots with diverse configurations, demonstrating stable loco-manipulation and highlighting its effectiveness in reducing data requirements and increasing the efficiency of skill transfer across platforms.},

Existing techniques in the graphics community often prioritize visual fidelity over physics-based feasibility, posing a significant challenge for deploying bipedal systems in practical applications. This article addresses these issues through bounded residual reinforcement learning (RL) to produce physics-based high-quality motion imitation onto legged humanoid robots that enhance motion resemblance while successfully following the reference human trajectory. Our framework, Imitation to Control Humanoid Robots Through Bounded Residual Reinforcement Learning (I-CTRL), reformulates motion imitation as a constrained refinement over nonphysics-based retargeted motions. I-CTRL excels in motion imitation with simple and unique rewards that generalize across five robots. Moreover, our framework introduces an automatic priority scheduler (APS) to manage large-scale motion datasets when efficiently training a unified RL policy across diverse motions. The proposed approach signifies a crucial step forward in advancing the control of bipedal robots, emphasizing the importance of aligning visual and physical realism for successful motion imitation.},

However, direct RL application is hindered by time-consuming trial-and-error processes, necessitating training in simulation before real-world transfer. This introduces a reality gap that degrades performance. Although various methods have been proposed for sim-to-real transfer, they have not been validated on a consistent hardware platform, making it difficult to determine which components are key to overcoming the reality gap. In contrast, we systematically evaluate techniques to enhance RL policy robustness during sim-to-real transfer by controlling variables and comparing them on a single robot to isolate and analyze the impact of each technique. These techniques include dynamics randomization, state history usage, noise/bias/delay modeling, state selection, perturbations, and network size. We quantitatively assess the reality gap by simulating diverse conditions and conducting experiments on real hardware. Our findings provide insights into bridging the reality gap, advancing robust RL-trained humanoid robots for real-world applications.},

Often, the question is framed in the familiar household or office setting, with implied expectations of robust locomotion on uneven and cluttered terrain and compliant interaction with people, objects, and the environment. Moreover, the question implies the existence within the humanoid robot of a set of embodied loco-manipulation skills implemented by a motion planner, skills that are retrievable when given the corresponding commands. In this article, we formulate an answer to this question in the form of an efficient, modular, and extensible motion planner. We demonstrate its use with three challenging scenarios, designed to highlight both the robot’s safe operation and its precise movement in unstructured environments. Additionally, we discuss key techniques derived from our experience in the practical implementation of torque-controlled humanoid robots.},

This allows such machines to perform complex tasks alongside humans, while ensuring safety during operations. Following these principles, this article presents the robot COMAN+, focusing on its hardware capabilities and software implementations. COMAN+ is developed by the Humanoid and Human Centered Mechatronics (HHCM) Research Line at Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia: It is a human-sized torque-controlled humanoid assembled with a focus on robustness, reliability, and strength. Its custom-made actuation system and sturdy yet lightweight skeleton make it ideal for working in rough conditions with a high power-to-weight ratio for heavy-duty tasks.},
