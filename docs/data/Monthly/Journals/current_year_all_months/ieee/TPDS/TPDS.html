  abstract     = {Seismic exploration is a geophysical method used for imaging subsurface structures, capable of providing high-resolution images of the underground. In seismic data processing, Kirchhoff Pre-Stack Depth Migration (KPSDM) serves as one of the key techniques, playing a critical role in significantly enhancing the lateral resolution of imaging and providing accurate characterization of subsurface media. However, with the continuous growth in high-density seismic data volumes, the computational efficiency of KPSDM is primarily constrained by substantial computational loads, end-to-end I/O bottlenecks, and data storage pressures. To address the performance optimization challenges of computation-intensive applications that require frequent large-scale data transfers between the host and accelerator devices, this paper proposes GAP-DCCS, a GPU-based Generic Acceleration Paradigm with efficient Data Compression and Caching Strategy, which includes the following core strategies: (1) For compute-intensive modules, a GPU-based three-dimensional parallel acceleration is implemented, combined with memory access optimization techniques and overlapping strategies for data transfer and computation, to improve GPU resource utilization; (2) To alleviate the storage pressure of large-scale datasets, the BitComp compression algorithm is introduced to efficiently compress task data while maintaining output stability, significantly reducing storage requirements and end-to-end data transfer volume; (3) To tackle the I/O bottleneck caused by frequent large-scale data transfers between the host and devices, an adaptive dynamic caching data management mechanism is designed to effectively increase data reuse rates and markedly reduce end-to-end transfer frequency. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed optimization method significantly enhances the computational performance of KPSDM, achieving a speedup of 123.51× on a single NVIDIA Tesla A800 GPU compared to a 16-core CPU. This optimization paradigm has not only been effectively validated in KPSDM but also offers a referable high-performance computing solution for other large-scale data processing tasks.},

  abstract     = {Edge computing enables low-latency data access by caching popular content on edge servers. However, server unavailability at runtime can increase retrieval latency when requests are redirected to the cloud. To enhance availability, erasure coding (EC) has been employed to ensure full data access for all users in an edge storage system (ESS). Existing approaches for edge data placement place coded blocks across the entire system without considering data popularity. As a result, they often suffer from high data retrieval latency. In addition, they are designed to process data items individually. Data placed earlier will limit the placement options for subsequent files because edge servers with the most neighbors in the system can be easily exhausted. Some files cannot be placed properly to accommodate user demands. This increases users’ data retrieval latency further. This paper investigates the edge data placement (EDP) problem with popularity awareness. We formulate EDP as a mixed-integer programming problem and prove its $\mathcal{NP}$-hardness. We then design an exact algorithm (EDP-O) that decomposes the problem into three convex subproblems and solves it iteratively, and an approximation algorithm (EDP-A) with a guaranteed $\ln N$ approximation ratio for large-scale systems. Experiments on real-world datasets show that EDP-O and EDP-A reduce average retrieval latency by 18.4% and 15.6% in small-scale settings, while EDP-A achieves 54.7% latency reduction and 34.9% lower discard rate in large-scale scenarios compared to four baselines.},

Nonetheless, the practical deployment of neural network quantum states (NNQS) in large-scale electronic structure analyses faces challenges, chiefly the high sampling cost and the complexity of local energy computations. To overcome these computational barriers, we present an innovative data-parallel NNQS-Transformer implementation. This implementation introduces a hybrid multi-layer workload balancing strategy that effectively addresses previous load imbalance issues while leveraging Julia’s portability to achieve targeted performance optimizations. Through extensive testing, we validate our approach using comprehensive quantum chemistry calculations on systems containing up to 120 spin orbitals, where previous methods were limited to much smaller scales. The implementation demonstrates exceptional scalability on the Sunway platform, achieving 92% strong scaling and 98% weak scaling efficiencies when utilizing up to 37 million processor cores. These significant performance improvements mark a crucial step toward making NNQS calculations practical for real-world quantum chemistry applications.},

  abstract     = {The rapid growth of AIoT devices brings huge demands for DNNs deployed on resource-constrained devices. However, the intensive computation and high memory footprint of DNN inference make it difficult for the AIoT devices to execute the inference tasks efficiently. In many widely deployed AIoT use cases, multiple local AIoT devices launch DNN inference tasks randomly. Although local collaborative inference has been proposed to accelerate DNN inference on local devices with limited resources, multitasking local collaborative inference, which is common in AIoT scenarios, has not been fully studied in previous works. We consider multitasking local client-server collaborative inference (MLCCI), which achieves efficient DNN inference by offloading the inference tasks from multiple AIoT devices to a more powerful local server with parallel pipelined execution streams through Wi-Fi 6. Our optimization goal is to minimize the mean end-to-end latency of MLCCI. Based on the experiment results, we identify three key challenges: high communication costs, high model initialization latency, and congestion delay brought by task interference. We analyze congestion delay in MLCCI and its stochastic fluctuations with queuing theory and propose Chorus, a high-performance adaptive MLCCI framework for AIoT devices, to minimize the mean end-to-end latency of MLCCI against stochastic congestion delay. Chorus generates communication-efficient model partitions with heuristic search, uses a prefetch-enabled two-level LRU cache to accelerate model initialization on the server, reduces congestion delay and its short-term fluctuations with execution stream allocation based on the cross-entropy method, and finally achieves efficient computation offloading with reinforcement learning. We established a system prototype, which statistically simulated many virtual clients with limited physical client devices to conduct performance evaluations, for Chorus with real devices. The evaluation results for various workload levels show that Chorus achieved an average of $1.4\times$, $1.3\times$, and $2\times$ speedup over client-only inference, and server-only inference with LRU and MLSH, respectively.},

  abstract     = {In the Industrial Internet of Things (IoT), data heterogeneity across different devices poses a huge challenge to federated learning techniques, significantly reducing the performance of federated learning models. Additionally, the large number of devices participating in IoT federated learning and training imposes a substantial computational burden on cloud servers. Current federated learning research primarily adopts centralized or discentralized learning architectures, which cannot fundamentally solve these issues. To address this, we propose a novel semi-centralized cloud-edge-device hierarchical federate learning framework that integrated both centralized and decentralized federated learning approaches. Specifically, only a subset of adjacent devices forms small-scale ring clusters, and the cloud server aggregates the ring models to construct a global model. To mitigate the impact of data heterogeneity across devices, we use an incremental subgradient optimization algorithm within each ring cluster to enhance the generalization ability of the ring cluster models. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach effectively reduces the impact of data heterogeneity, improves model performance, and significantly alleviates the communication burden on cloud servers compared to centralized and discentralized federated learning frameworks. Indeed, the framework proposed in this paper aims to balance the strengths of centralized federated learning and ring federated learning. It achieves superior performance in addressing the data non-IID problem compared to centralized federated learning architectures while also mitigating issues associated with excessively large rings in ring architectures.},

Modern GPUs, equipped with Tensor Cores, offer massive parallelism that can significantly accelerate graph algorithms. However, leveraging Tensor Cores, originally designed for dense matrix multiplication, to handle sparse workloads for triangle counting presents non-trivial challenges. In this paper, we conduct an in-depth analysis of the state-of-the-art techniques that utilizes Tensor Cores for matrix operations, identifying critical performance shortfalls. Based on these insights, we introduce ToT, which enhances the utilization of Tensor Cores and expands their functionalities for diverse sparse matrix operations. In experiments, ToT is evaluated against state-of-the-art methods. ToT outperform the second-fastest method with an 3.81× speedup in end-to-end execution. Also, it achieves up to 17.00× memory savings. This work represents a pioneering exploration into utilizing Tensor Cores for accelerating the triangle counting algorithm.},

  abstract     = {Federated learning (FL) is an emerging distributed machine learning paradigm that enables collaborative model training without sharing local data. Despite its advantages, FL suffers from substantial communication overhead, which can affect training efficiency. Recent efforts have mitigated this issue by quantizing model updates to reduce communication costs. However, most existing methods apply quantization only after local training, introducing quantization errors into the trained parameters and potentially degrading model accuracy. In this letter, we propose Federated Bit Freezing (FedBiF), a novel FL framework that directly learns quantized model parameters during local training. In each communication round, the server first quantizes the model parameters and transmits them to the clients. FedBiF then allows each client to update only a single bit of the multi-bit parameter representation, freezing the remaining bits. This bit-by-bit update strategy reduces each parameter update to one bit while maintaining high precision in parameter representation. Extensive experiments are conducted on five widely used datasets under both IID and Non-IID settings. The results demonstrate that FedBiF not only achieves superior communication compression but also promotes sparsity in the resulting models. Notably, FedBiF attains accuracy comparable to FedAvg, even when using only 1 bit-per-parameter (bpp) for uplink and 3 bpp for downlink communication.},

Recent advancements have aimed to accelerate SpMM by harnessing the powerful Tensor Cores found in modern GPUs. However, despite these efforts, existing methods frequently encounter performance degradation when ported across different Tensor Core architectures. Recognizing that scalable SpMM across multiple generations of Tensor Cores relies on the effective use of general-purpose instructions, we have meticulously developed a SpMM library named SSpMM. However, a significant conflict exists between granularity and performance in current Tensor Core instructions. To resolve this, we introduce the innovative Transpose Mapping Scheme, which elegantly implements fine-grained kernels using coarse-grained instructions. Additionally, we propose the Register Shuffle Method to further enhance performance. Finally, we introduce Sparse Vector Compression, a technique that ensures our kernels are scalable with both structured and unstructured sparsity. Our experimental results, conducted on four generations of Tensor Core GPUs using over 3,000 sparse matrices from well-established matrix collections, demonstrate that SSpMM achieves an average speedup of 2.04 ×, 2.81 ×, 2.07 ×, and 1.87 ×, respectively, over the state-of-the-art SpMM solution. Furthermore, we have integrated SSpMM into PyTorch, achieving a 1.81 × speedup in end-to-end Transformer inference compared to cuDNN.},

  abstract     = {With the development of Ethereum, numerous blockchains compatible with Ethereum’s execution environment (i.e., Ethereum Virtual Machine, EVM) have emerged. Developers can leverage smart contracts to run various complex decentralized applications on top of blockchains. However, the increasing number of EVM-compatible blockchains has introduced significant challenges in cross-chain interoperability, particularly in ensuring efficiency and atomicity for the whole cross-chain application. Existing solutions are either limited in guaranteeing overall atomicity for the cross-chain application, or inefficient due to the need for multiple rounds of cross-chain smart contract execution. To address this gap, we propose IntegrateX, an efficient cross-chain interoperability system that ensures the overall atomicity of cross-chain smart contract invocations. The core idea is to deploy the logic required for cross-chain execution onto a single blockchain, where it can be executed in an integrated manner. This allows cross-chain applications to perform all cross-chain logic efficiently within the same blockchain. IntegrateX consists of a cross-chain smart contract deployment protocol and a cross-chain smart contract integrated execution protocol. The former achieves efficient and secure cross-chain deployment by decoupling smart contract logic from state, and employing an off-chain cross-chain deployment mechanism combined with on-chain cross-chain verification. The latter ensures atomicity of cross-chain invocations through a 2PC-based mechanism, and enhances performance through transaction aggregation and fine-grained state lock. We implement a prototype of IntegrateX. Extensive experiments demonstrate that it reduces up to 61.2% latency compared to the state-of-the-art baseline while maintaining low gas consumption.},

  abstract     = {Real-time systems are increasingly shifting from single processors to multiprocessors, where software must be parallelized to fully exploit the additional computational power. While the scheduling of real-time parallel tasks modeled as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) has been extensively studied in the context of global scheduling, the scheduling and analysis of real-time DAG tasks under partitioned scheduling remain far less developed compared to the traditional scheduling of sequential tasks. Existing approaches primarily target plain fixed-priority partitioned scheduling and often rely on self-suspension–based analysis, which limits opportunities for further optimization. In particular, such methods fail to fully leverage fine-grained scheduling management that could improve schedulability. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for scheduling periodic DAG tasks, in which each DAG task is transformed into a set of real-time transactions by incorporating mechanisms for enforcing release offsets and intra-task priority assignments. We further develop corresponding analysis techniques and partitioning algorithms. Through comprehensive experiments, we evaluate the real-time performance of the proposed methods against state-of-the-art scheduling and analysis techniques. The results demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms existing methods for scheduling periodic DAG tasks across a wide range of parameter settings.},

  abstract     = {With the increase of demand for computing resources and the struggle to provide the necessary energy, power-aware resource management is becoming a major issue for the High-performance computing (HPC) community. Including reliable energy management to a supercomputer’s resource and job management system (RJMS) is not an easy task. The energy consumption of jobs is rarely known in advance and the workload of every machine is unique and different from the others. We argue that the first step towards properly managing power is to deeply understand the power consumption of the workload, which involves predicting the workload power consumption and exploiting it by using smart power-aware scheduling algorithms. Crucial questions are (i) how sophisticated a prediction method needs to be to provide accurate workload power predictions, and (ii) to what point an accurate workload’s power prediction translates into efficient power management. In this work, we proposed a method to predict and exploit HPC workloads power consumption with the objective of reducing the supercomputers power consumption, while maintaining the management (scheduling) performance of the RJMS. Our method exploits workload submission logs with power monitoring data, and relies on a mix of lightweight power prediction methods and a classical EASY Backfillling inspired heuristic. Then, we model and solve the power capping scheduling as a greedy knapsack algorithm. This algorithm improves the Quality of Service and avoids starvation while keeping the solution lightweight. We base this study on logs of Marconi 100, a 980-node supercomputer. We show using simulation that a lightweight history-based prediction method can provide accurate enough power prediction to improve the energy management of a large scale supercomputer compared to energy-unaware scheduling algorithms. These improvements have no significant negative impact on performance.},

  abstract     = {We study two offline job scheduling problems where tasks can be processed on a limited number of energy-efficient edge machines or offloaded to an unlimited supply of energy-inefficient cloud machines (called rejected). The objective is to minimize total energy consumption. First, we consider scheduling without deadlines, formulating it as a scheduling problem with rejection, where rejection costs are proportional to processing times. We propose a novel $\frac{5}{4}(1+\epsilon )$-approximation algorithm, $\mathcal {BEKP}$, by associating it to a Multiple Subset Sum problem, improving upon the existing $ (\frac{3}{2} - \frac{1}{2m})$-approximation for arbitrary rejection costs. Next, we address scheduling with deadlines, aiming to minimize the weighted number of rejected jobs. We position this problem within the literature and introduce a new $(1-\frac{(m-1)^{m}}{m^{m}})$-approximation algorithm, $\mathcal {MDP}$, inspired by an interval selection algorithm with a $(1-\frac{m^{m}}{(m+1)^{m}})$-approximation for arbitrary rejection costs. Experimental results demonstrate that $\mathcal {BEKP}$ and $\mathcal {MDP}$ obtain better results (lower costs or higher profits) than other state-of-the-art algorithms while maintaining a competitive or better time complexity.},

  abstract     = {The sequential semantics of many concurrent data structures, such as stacks and queues, inevitably lead to memory contention in parallel environments, thus limiting scalability. Semantic relaxation has the potential to address this issue, increasing the parallelism at the expense of weakened semantics. Although prior research has shown that improved performance can be attained by relaxing concurrent data structure semantics, there is no one-size-fits-all relaxation that adequately addresses the varying needs of dynamic executions. In this paper, we first introduce the concept of elastic relaxation and consequently present the Lateral structure, which is an algorithmic component capable of supporting the design of elastically relaxed concurrent data structures. Using the Lateral, we design novel elastically relaxed, lock-free queues, stacks, a counter, and a deque, capable of reconfiguring relaxation during run-time. We establish linearizability and define worst-case bounds for relaxation errors in our designs. Experimental evaluations show that our elastic designs match the performance of state-of-the-art statically relaxed structures when no elastic changes are utilized. We develop a lightweight, contention-aware controller for adjusting relaxation in real time, and demonstrate its benefits both in a dynamic producer-consumer micro-benchmark and in a parallel BFS traversal, where it improves throughput and work-efficiency compared to static designs.},

With that aim, this work introduces Layered Queuing-Graph Neural Networks (LQ-GNN), a novel Machine Learning (ML) approach to develop a generalized performance prediction model for microservice-based applications. Unlike previous works focused on individual applications, our proposal aims for a versatile model applicable to any microservice-based application, integrating the Layered Queueing Network (LQN) modeling with Graph Neural Networks (GNN). LQ-GNN allows to efficiently estimate the response time of applications under different resource allocations and placements on the computing continuum. The obtained evaluation results indicate that the proposed model achieves a prediction error below 10% when considering different evaluation scenarios. Compared to existing methodologies, our approach balances prediction accuracy and computational efficiency, making it viable for real-time deployments. Consequently, ML-based performance prediction can significantly enhance the resource management and elasticity control of microservice-based architectures, leading to more resilient and efficient systems.},

  abstract     = {In Internet of Things(IoT), the combination of cloud computing and edge computing becomes a new computing paradigm to provide users with low-latency data services. However, for the limited resource, high dynamic, and wide distributed characteristics of IoT devices, it becomes a great challenge to realize the universal application of edge servers and the cloud-edge computing allocation. Meanwhile, most of the schemes ignore the leakage of data access pattern privacy when accessing data. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a privacy-preserving access control scheme for IoT data. Based on the cloud-edge-end framework, we design a pervasive edge computing protocol, which allows well-resourced devices to become edge servers at suitable geographic locations and users to outsource and access IoT data through the nearest edge server. It increases the flexibility of the cloud-edge collaborative system as well as the efficiency of data processing. Users do not need to interact beyond the network edge to enjoy the data services. Furthermore, a novel attribute-based encryption scheme is designed based on a modified Lightweight Secret Sharing Scheme to optimize computing task allocation and reduce the computation burden on end devices, without attribute information leakage. In addition, we also design a Transform algorithm and a Cloud-edge Interaction protocol to hide access pattern privacy efficiently. We analyze the feasibility of the scheme and demonstrate that the scheme is semantically secure and conceals access pattern privacy. Simulation experiments based on real IoT data show that the scheme is efficient and suitable for IoT scenarios.},

  abstract     = {Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) effectively alleviates the pressure on limited in-vehicle computing resources and energy supply caused by computation-intensive vehicular applications. However, the uneven spatial distribution of users leads to load imbalance among adjacent MEC servers, significantly increase the latency and energy consumption costs for vehicles. Therefore, achieving optimal configuration of available computing resources in MEC servers to accomplish the goal of low-latency and low-energy task offloading has become a critical issue to address. To tackle this problem, this study proposes a Multi-RSU Load Balancing (MRLB) strategy based on multi-hop network technology. This strategy dynamically allocates computing tasks to neighboring RSU server clusters with available computing resources through task segmentation and computation offloading mechanisms. Meanwhile, adaptive resource allocation strategies are implemented based on task quantity and task scale characteristics. Specifically, this study designs a multi-RSU collaborative offloading algorithm based on Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) to solve the optimal offloading decision. Additionally, by integrating the Lagrange multiplier method and Sequential Quadratic Programming (SQP) algorithm, the joint optimization of imbalanced task segmentation decisions and optimal CPU frequency allocation decisions for RSU servers is achieved. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve efficient multi-RSU resource allocation and ensure coordinated optimization of both system latency and energy consumption costs across diverse device conditions and varying network scenarios, particularly in load-imbalanced situations.},

  abstract     = {Serverless edge computing is an efficient way to execute event-driven, short-duration, and bursty IoT data processing tasks on resource-limited edge servers, using on-demand resource allocation and dynamic auto-scaling. In this paradigm, function requests are handled in virtualized environments, e.g., containers. When a function request arrives online, if there is no container in memory to execute it, the serverless platform will initialize such a container with non-negligible latency, known as cold start. Otherwise, it results in a warm start with no latency in previous studies. However, based on our experiments, we find there is a remarkable third case called Late-Warm, i.e., when a request arrives during the container initializing, its latency is less than a cold start but not zero. In this paper, we study online container caching in serverless edge computing to minimize the total latency with Late-Warm and other practical issues considered. We propose OnCoLa, a novel $O(T_{c}K)$-competitive algorithm supporting request relaying on multiple edge servers. Here, $T_{c}$ and $K$ are the maximum container cold start latency and the memory size, respectively. Extensive simulations on two real-world traces demonstrate that OnCoLa consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art container caching algorithms and reduces the latency by 23.33%. Experiments on Raspberry Pi and Jetson Nano show that OnCoLa reduces latency by up to 21.38% compared with the representative lightweight policy.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, blockchain oracle, as the key link between blockchain and real-world data interaction, has greatly expanded the application scope of blockchain. In particular, the emergence of the Multi-Data Source (MDS) oracle has greatly improved the reliability of the oracle in the case of untrustworthy data sources. However, the current MDS oracle scheme requires nodes to obtain data redundantly from multiple data sources to guarantee data reliability, which greatly increases the resource overhead and response time of the system. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a Secure and Efficient Multi-data Source Oracle framework (SEMSO), where nodes only need to access one data source to ensure the reliability of final data. First, we design a new off-chain data aggregation protocol TBLS, to guarantee data source diversity and reliability at low cost. Second, according to the rational man assumption, the data source selection task of nodes is modeled and solved based on the Bayesian game under incomplete information to maximize the node’s revenue while improving the success rate of TBLS aggregation and system response speed. Security analysis verifies the reliability of the proposed scheme, and experiments show that under the same environmental assumptions, SEMSO takes into account data diversity while reducing the response time by 23.5%.},

Communication efficiency and fairness are two major issues that need to be both satisfied when federated learning systems are deployed in practice. Simultaneously guaranteeing both of them, however, is exceptionally difficult because simply combining communication reduction and fairness optimization approaches often causes non-converged training or drastic accuracy degradation. To bridge this gap, we propose FedEFsz. On the one hand, it integrates the state-of-the-art error-bounded lossy compressor SZ3 into cross-silo federated learning systems to significantly reduce communication traffic during the training. On the other hand, it achieves a high fairness (i.e., rather consistent model accuracy and performance across different clients) through a carefully designed heuristic algorithm that can tune the error-bound of SZ3 for different clients during the training. Extensive experimental results based on a GPU cluster with 65 GPU cards show that FedEFsz improves the fairness across different benchmarks by up to 60.88% and meanwhile reduces the communication traffic by up to $315\times$.},

To solve this problem, this paper proposes a universal ultra-low-delay and zero-jitter traffic scheduling model. Based on this model, this paper further designs a performance-balanced algorithm. The algorithm improves traffic scheduling success rate through joint routing and scheduling, increases network bandwidth utilization through hybrid traffic scheduling, and achieves low computation overhead through policy-based searching. Finally, extensive experiments demonstrate that the algorithm effectively balances performance metrics across diverse real-world scenarios.

  abstract     = {Exascale high-performance computing (HPC) systems face critical resource management challenges such as massive energy consumption in megawatts per facility, performance variability for identical jobs, and resource utilization inefficiencies. Traditional single-objective schedulers cannot address these multifaceted challenges effectively. This paper introduces HARMONIC (Holistic Adaptive Resource Management Optimizing Next-generation Interconnected Computing), a novel framework that simultaneously optimizes performance, energy efficiency, and resilience through uncertainty-aware multi-objective optimization. Our approach distinguishes aleatoric uncertainty (inherent system variability) from epistemic uncertainty (modeling limitations) using Bayesian neural networks and employs graph-based representations to capture complex system dependencies. Experimental validation in both simulated environments and controlled testbeds demonstrates significant improvements over state-of-the-art schedulers: 10–19% energy reduction, 16–25% throughput improvement and 18–32% performance variability reduction. These results translate to potential annual savings of multimillion dollars per exascale facility while enhancing scientific productivity through improved experimental reproducibility.},

  abstract     = {Containerized Edge computing offers lightweight, reliable, and quick solutions to latency-critical Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) applications. Existing solutions considering multiple Quality of Service (QoS) parameters either overlook the intricate relation of QoS parameters or pose significant scheduling overheads. Furthermore, reactive decision-making can damage Edge servers at peak load, incurring escalated costs and wasted computations. Resource provisioning, scheduling, and ML model selection substantially influence energy consumption, user-perceived accuracy, and delay-oriented Service Level Agreement (SLA) violations. Addressing contrasting objectives and QoS simultaneously while avoiding server faults is highly challenging in the exposed heterogeneous and resource-constrained Edge continuum. In this work, we propose the EdgeAIBus framework that offers a novel joint container management and ML model selection algorithm based on Importance Weighted Actor-Learner Architecture to optimize energy, accuracy, SLA violations, and avoid server faults. First, Patch Time Series Transformer (PatchTST) is utilized for CPU usage predictions of Edge servers for its 8.51% Root Mean Squared Error and 5.62% Mean Absolute Error. Leveraging pipelined predictions, EdgeAIBus conducts consolidation, resource oversubscription, and ML/DL model switching with possible migrations to conserve energy, maximize utilization and user-perceived accuracy, and reduce SLA violations. Simulation results show EdgeAIBus oversubscribed 110% cluster-wide CPU with real usage up to 70%, conserved 14 CPU cores, incurred less than 1% SLA violations with 2.54% drop in inference accuracy against industry-led Model Switching Balanced load and Google Kubernetes Optimized schedulers. Google Kubernetes Engine experiments demonstrate 80% oversubscription, 14 CPU cores conservation, 1% SLA violations, and 3.81% accuracy loss against the counterparts. Finally, constrained setting experiment analysis shows that PatchTST and EdgeAIBus can produce decisions within 100 ms in a 1-core and 1 GB memory device.},

  abstract     = {Morphological operations are critical in high-resolution biomedical image processing. Their efficient execution relies on an irregular flood-filling strategy consolidated in the Irregular Wavefront Propagation Pattern (IWPP). IWPP was designed for GPUs and achieved significant gains compared to previous work. Here, however, we have revisited IWPP to identify the key limitations of its GPU implementation and proposed a novel more efficient strategy. In particular, the IWPP most demanding phase consists of tracking active pixels, those contributing to the output, that are the ones processed during the execution. This computational strategy leads to irregular memory access, divergent execution, and high storage (queue) management costs. To address these aspects, we have proposed the novel execution strategy called Irregular Wavefront Megapixel Propagation Pattern (IWMPP). IWMPP introduces a coarse-grained execution approach based on fixed-size square regions (instead of pixels in IWPP), referred to as megapixels (MPs). This design reduces the number of elements tracked and enables a regular processing within MPs that, in turn, improves thread divergence and memory accesses. IWMPP introduces optimizations, such as Duplicate Megapixel Removal (DMR) to avoid MPs recomputation and Tiled-Ordered (TO) execution that enforces a semistructured MPs execution sequence to improve data propagation efficiency. Experimental results using large tissue cancer images demonstrated that the IWMPP GPU attains significant gains over the state-of-the-art (IWPP). For morphological reconstruction, fill holes, and h-maxima operations, on the RTX 4090, the IWMPP GPU is up to 17.9×, 45.6×, and 14.9× faster than IWPP GPU, respectively, while at the same time reducing memory demands. IWMPP is an important step to enable quick processing of large imaging datasets.},

Simultaneously, the effects of data locality on reduce tasks are determined by the intermediate data partitioning. While suffering from the problem of data skew, the existing intermediate data partitioning methods only achieves load balancing for reduce tasks. To address the problem, this paper optimizes the data locality for reduce tasks by integrating intermediate data partitioning and task scheduling in Spark framework. First, it presents a distribution skew model to divide the key clusters into skewed and non-skewed distribution. Then, a data locality and load balancing-aware intermediate data partitioning method is proposed, where a priority allocation strategy for the key clusters with skewed distribution is presented, and a balanced allocation strategy for the key clusters with non-skewed distribution is presented. Finally, it proposes a data locality-aware reduce task scheduling algorithm, where an online self-adaptive NARX (nonlinear autoregressive with external input) model is developed to predict the idle time of node. It can ensure that the delayed scheduling decision made can complete the data transmission of reduce tasks earlier. We implement our proposals in Spark-3.5.1 and evaluate the performance using several representative benchmarks. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method and algorithm can reduce the job/application running time by approximately 4% to 46% and decrease the total volume of data transmission by approximately 8% to 54%.},

In this article, we propose DynPipe, an interference-aware asynchronous pipeline framework to optimize the end-to-end training performance in highly dynamic computing environments. By characterizing the non-overlapped communication overheads and convergence rate conditioned on stage-wise staleness, DynPipe carefully crafts an optimized pipeline partition that harmonizes the hardware speed with statistical convergence. Moreover, DynPipe deploys a non-intrusive random forest model that utilizes runtime stage statistics to evaluate the impact of environmental changes, such as task interference and network jitter, on the training efficiency. Following the evaluation guidance, DynPipe adaptively adjusts partition plan to restore both intra and inter-stage load balancing, thereby facilitating seamless pipeline reconfiguration in dynamic environments. Extensive experiments show that DynPipe outperforms state-of-the-art systems, accelerating the time-to-accuracy by 1.5-3.4×.},

However, training GNNs on large-scale graphs is very challenging due to the size of real-world graphs and the message-passing architecture of GNNs. One promising approach for scaling GNNs is distributed training across multiple accelerators, where each accelerator holds a partitioned subgraph that fits in memory to train the model in parallel. Existing distributed GNN training methods require frequent and prohibitive embedding exchanges between partitions, leading to substantial communication overhead and limited the training efficiency. To address this challenge, we propose XDGNN, a novel distributed GNN training method that eliminates the forward communication bottleneck and thus accelerates training. Specifically, we design an explanation-guided subgraph expansion technique that incorporates important structures identified by eXplanation AI (XAI) methods into local partitions, mitigating information loss caused by graph partitioning. Then, XDGNN conducts communication-free distributed training on these self-contained partitions through training the model in parallel without communicating node embeddings in the forward phase. Extensive experiments demonstrate that XDGNN significantly improves training efficiency while maintaining the model accuracy compared with current distributed GNN training methods.},

The current focus is on optimizing and accelerating these global operations rather than removing them, as the latter involves systematic changes to the system software stack and may impact program semantics. Given this background, we propose a systematic solution named MIST to safely eliminate global operations in MPI startup and termination. Through optimizing the generation of communication addresses, designing reliable communication protocols, and exploiting the resource release mechanism, MIST eliminates all global operations to achieve MPI instant startup and termination while ensuring correct program execution. Experiments on Tianhe-2 A supercomputer demonstrate that MIST can reduce the MPI_Init() time by 32.5-77.6% and the MPI_Finalize() time by 28.9-85.0%.},

While existing approaches work well with regular, fully functional mesh structures, they falter in real-world scenarios where hardware has irregular shapes or non-functional cores caused by defects or resource fragmentation. To address these limitations, we propose a novel mapping method based on an innovative space-filling curve: the Adaptive Locality-Preserving (ALP) curve. Using a unique divide-and-conquer construction algorithm, the ALP curve ensures adaptability to meshes of any shape while maintaining crucial locality properties—essential for efficient mapping. Our method demonstrates exceptional computational efficiency, making it ideal for large-scale deployments. These distinctive characteristics enable our approach to handle complex scenarios that challenge conventional methods. Experimental results show that our method matches state-of-the-art solutions in regular-shape mapping while achieving significant improvements in irregular scenarios, reducing communication overhead by up to 57.1%.},

Nevertheless, contemporary Virtual Machine (VM) live migration methods are burdened by substantial resource consumption. In terms of memory management, disaggregated memory offers an effective solution to enhance memory utilization, but leaves a gap in addressing CPU underutilization. Our findings highlight a considerable opportunity to optimize live migration in the context of disaggregated memory systems. We introduce Anemoi, a resource management system that seamlessly integrates VM live migration with memory disaggregation to address the aforementioned gap. In the context of disaggregated memory, remote memory becomes accessible from destination nodes, effectively eliminating the need for extensive network transmission of memory pages, and thereby significantly reducing migration time. In addition, we propose using memory replicas as an optimization to the live migration system. To mitigate the overhead of potential excessive memory consumption, we develop a dedicated compression algorithm. Our evaluations demonstrate that Anemoi leads to a notable 69% reduction in network bandwidth utilization and an impressive 83% reduction in migration time compared to traditional VM live migration. Additionally, our compression algorithm achieves an outstanding space-saving rate of 83.6%.},

In end-edge-cloud environments, workflow applications typically exhibit complex task dependencies. Meanwhile, parallel tasks from multi-MDs result in an expansive solution space for offloading decisions. Therefore, determining optimal offloading plans for highly dynamic and complex end-edge-cloud environments presents significant challenges. The existing studies on offloading tasks for multi-MD workflows often adopt centralized decision-making methods, which suffer from prolonged decision time, high computational overhead, and inability to identify suitable offloading plans in large-scale scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose a Multi-agent Collaborative method for Workflow Task offloading in end-edge-cloud environments with the Actor-Critic algorithm called MCWT-AC. First, each MD is modeled as an agent and independently makes offloading decisions based on local information. Next, each MD’s workflow task offloading decision model is obtained through the Actor-Critic algorithm. At runtime, an effective workflow task offloading plan can be gradually developed through multi-agent collaboration. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that the MCWT-AC exhibits superior adaptability and scalability. Moreover, the MCWT-AC outperforms the state-of-art methods and can quickly achieve optimal/near-optimal performance.},

  abstract     = {Fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) enables direct computation on encrypted data, making it a crucial technology for privacy protection. However, FHE suffers from significant performance bottlenecks. In this context, GPU acceleration offers a promising solution to bridge the performance gap. Existing efforts primarily focus on single-class FHE schemes, which fail to meet the diverse requirements of data types and functions, prompting the development of hybrid multi-class FHE schemes. However, studies have yet to thoroughly investigate specific GPU optimizations for hybrid FHE schemes. In this article, we present an efficient GPU-based FHE scheme switching acceleration named Chameleon. First, we propose a scalable NTT acceleration design that adapts to larger CKKS polynomials and smaller TFHE polynomials. Specifically, Chameleon tackles synchronization issues by fusing stages to reduce synchronization, employing polynomial coefficient shuffling to minimize synchronization scale, and utilizing an SM-aware combination strategy to identify the optimal switching point. Second, Chameleon is the first to comprehensively analyze and optimize critical switching operations. It introduces CMux-level parallelization to accelerate LUT evaluation and a homomorphic rotation-free matrix-vector multiplication to improve repacking efficiency. Finally, Chameleon outperforms the state-of-the-art GPU implementations by 1.23× in CKKS HMUL and 1.15× in bootstrapping. It also achieves up to 4.87× and 1.51× speedups for TFHE bootstrapping compared to CPU and GPU versions, respectively, and delivers a 67.3× average speedup for scheme switching over CPU-based implementation.},

  abstract     = {In decentralized edge computing environments, user devices need to perceive the status of neighboring devices, including computational availability and communication delays, to optimize task offloading decisions. However, probing the real-time status of all devices introduces significant overhead, and probing only a few devices can lead to suboptimal decision-making, considering the massive connectivity and non-stationarity of edge networks. Aiming to balance the status probing cost and task offloading performance, we study the joint transmission and computation status probing problem, where the status and offloading delay on edge devices are characterized by general, bounded, and non-stationary distributions. The problem is proved to be NP-hard, even with known offloading delay distributions. To handle this case, we design an efficient offline method that guarantees a $(1-1/e)$ approximation ratio via leveraging the submodularity of the expected offloading delay function. Furthermore, for scenarios with unknown and non-stationary offloading delay distributions, we reformulate the problem using the piecewise-stationary combinatorial multi-armed bandit framework and develop a change-point detection-based online status probing (CD-OSP) algorithm. CD-OSP can timely detect environmental changes and update probing strategies via using the proposed offline method and estimating offloading delay distributions. We prove that CD-OSP achieves a regret of $\mathcal {O}(NV\sqrt{T\ln T})$, with $N$, $V$, and $T$ denoting the numbers of stationary periods, edge devices, and time slots, respectively. Extensive simulations and testbed experiments demonstrate that CD-OSP significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, which can reduce the probing cost by up to 16.18X with a 2.14X increase in the offloading delay.},

  abstract     = {Approximate membership query (AMQ) data structures can approximately determine whether an element exists in a given dataset. They are widely used in parallel and distributed systems (e.g., high-performance databases, distributed cache systems, and bioinformatics systems) to avoid unnecessary dataset accesses, thereby accelerating massive data processing. For AMQ data structures used in the above systems, achieving high throughput, low false positive rate, and large capacity objectives simultaneously is critical but challenging. Porting AMQ data structures from DRAM to persistent memory makes it possible to achieve the above three objectives simultaneously, but this porting is not a trivial task. Specifically, existing AMQ data structures generate numerous random accesses and/or sequential writes on persistent memory, resulting in poor throughput. Therefore, in the conference version of this paper, we proposed a novel AMQ data structure called wormhole filter, which achieves high throughput on persistent memory, thereby achieving the above three objectives simultaneously. In this journal version, we extend our prior work by introducing parallel wormhole filters to enhance parallel performance. Additionally, we integrate parallel wormhole filters into the LevelDB database system to show that porting AMQ data structures to persistent memory significantly improves system end-to-end throughput. Theoretical analysis and experimental results show that wormhole filters significantly outperform state-of-the-art AMQ data structures. For example, wormhole filters achieve 12.06× insertion throughput, 1.98× positive lookup throughput, and 8.82× deletion throughput of the best competing baseline.},

  abstract     = {Dynamic resource allocation guarantees the performance of CGRA multi-task, but incurs a wide range of incompatible contexts (config & data) to the CGRA architecture. However, traditional context switch approaches including online config transformation and data reloading may significantly block the task to process inputs under new resource allocation decisions, resulting in the limited task throughput. To address this issue, online config transformation can be avoided if compatible configs have been prepared through offline pre-mapping, but traditional CGRA mappers require days to achieve comprehensive pre-mapping with considerable quality. Besides, online data reloading can also be eliminated through memory sharing, but the traditional arbiter-based approach has the difficulty of trading off physical complexity and memory access parallelism. PreTrans is the first system design to achieve the efficient CGRA multi-task context switch. PreTrans first avoids the online config transformation through a software incremental pre-mapper, which re-utilizes the previously finished pre-mapping results to dramatically accelerate the pre-mapping of subsequent resource allocation decisions with negligible mapping quality loss. Second, PreTrans replaces the traditional arbiter with a hardware data transceiver to better support the memory sharing that eliminates data reloading, which allows each tile to possess an individual memory that maximizes the access parallelism without introducing significant physical overhead. The overall evaluation demonstrates that PreTrans achieves 1.13 $\sim 2.46\times$ throughput improvement on pipeline and parallel multi-task scenarios, and can reach the target throughput immediately after the new resource allocation decision takes effect. Ablation study further shows that the pre-mapper is more than 3 magnitudes faster than the traditional CGRA mapper while maintaining more than 99% of the optimal mapping quality, and the data transceiver only introduces 9.02% hardware area overhead under 16 × 16 CGRA.},

  abstract     = {Serverless computing relies on keeping functions alive or pre-warming them before invocation to mitigate the cold start problem, stemming from the overhead of initializing function startup environments. However, under constrained cloud resources, accurately predicting the invocation patterns of sparse functions remains challenging. This limits the formulation of effective pre-warm and keep-alive strategies, leading to frequent cold starts and degraded user satisfaction. To address these challenges, we propose SPFaaS, a hybrid framework based on sparse function prediction. To enhance the learnability of sparse function invocation data, SPFaaS takes into account the characteristics of cloud service workloads along with the features of pre-warm and keep-alive strategies, transforming function invocation records into probabilistic data. It captures the underlying periodicity and temporal dependencies in the data through multiple rounds of sampling and the combined use of Gated Recurrent Units and Temporal Convolutional Networks for accurate prediction. Based on the final prediction outcome and real-time system states, SPFaaS determines adaptive pre-warm and keep-alive strategies for each function. Experiments conducted on two real-world serverless clusters demonstrate that SPFaaS outperforms state-of-the-art methods in reducing cold starts and improving user satisfaction.},

  abstract     = {Memory underutilization poses a significant challenge in cloud services, leading to performance inefficiencies and resource wastage. The tightly coupled computing and memory resources in cloud servers are identified as the root cause of this problem. To address this issue, memory pooling has been the subject of extensive research for decades, providing centralized or distributed shared memory pools as flexible memory resources for various applications running on different servers. However, existing memory disaggregation solutions sacrifice memory resources, add extra hardware (such as memory boxes/blades/drives), and degrade memory performance to achieve flexibility. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes MemTunnel, a rack-scale host memory pooling architecture that provides a low-cost memory pooling solution based on Compute Express Link (CXL). MemTunnel is the first hardware and software architecture to offer symmetric, memory-semantic memory pooling over CXL, with an FPGA-based platform to demonstrate its feasibility in a real implementation. MemTunnel is orthogonal to the existing CXL-based memory pool and provides an additional layer of abstraction for memory disaggregation. Evaluation results show that MemTunnel achieves comparable performance to the existing CXL-based memory pool for a single machine and provides better rack-scale performance with minor hardware overheads.},

  abstract     = {Variant calling, which identifies genomic differences relative to a reference genome, is critical for understanding disease mechanisms, identifying therapeutic targets, and advancing precision medicine. However, as two critical stages in this process, serial processing in local assembly and the computational dependencies in Pair-HMM make variant calling highly time-consuming. Moreover, optimizing only one of these stages often shifts the performance bottleneck to the other. This article observes that the similarity between reads allows parallel processing in the local assembly and that alignment information from the local assembly can significantly diminish the burdensome computations in Pair-HMM. Accordingly, this article co-optimizes the software and hardware for both steps to achieve the best performance. First, we collect $k$-mer locations in each read during the local assembly process and utilize the similarity between reads to make it parallel. Second, we propose the mPair-HMM algorithm, leveraging location information to split a Pair-HMM computation task into multiple independent sub-tasks, improving the computation’s parallelism. To fully exploit the parallelism stemming from the novel algorithms, we propose an end-to-end accelerator VCAx for variant calling that accelerates both stages in collaboration. Evaluation results demonstrate that our implementation achieves up to a 7× speedup over the GPU baseline for local assembly and a 3.16× performance improvement compared to the state-of-the-art ASIC implementation for Pair-HMM.},

  abstract     = {Hyperconverged Infrastructures (HCIs) combine processing and storage elements to meet the requirements of data-intensive applications in performance, scalability, and quality of service. As an emerging paradigm, HCI should couple with a variety of traditional performance improvement approaches such as I/O caching in virtualized platforms. Contemporary I/O caching schemes are optimized for traditional single-node storage architectures and suffer from two major shortcomings for multi-node architectures: a) imbalanced cache space requirement and b) imbalanced I/O traffic and load. This makes existing schemes inefficient in distributing cache resources over an array of separate physical nodes. In this paper, we propose an Efficient and Load Balanced I/O Cache Architecture (ELICA), managing the solid-state drive (SSD) cache resources across HCI nodes to enhance I/O performance. ELICA dynamically reconfigures and distributes the SSD cache resources throughout the array of HCI nodes and also balances the network traffic and I/O cache load by dynamic reallocation of cache resources. To maximize the performance, we further present an optimization problem defined by Integer Linear Programming to efficiently distribute cache resources and balance the network traffic and I/O cache relocations. Our experimental results on a real platform show that ELICA improves quality of service in terms of average and worst-case latency in HCIs by 3.1× and 23%, respectively, compared to the state-of-the-art.},

  abstract     = {Memory disaggregation has emerged as a promising architecture for improving resource efficiency by decoupling the computing and memory resources. But building efficient range indices in such an architecture faces three critical challenges: (1) coarse-grained concurrency control schemes for coordinating concurrent read/write operations with node splitting incur high contention under the skewed and write-intensive workloads; (2) existing data layouts fail to balance consistency verification and hardware acceleration via SIMD (Single Instruction Multiple Data); and (3) naive caching schemes struggle to adapt to rapidly changing access patterns. To address these challenges, we propose Mariana, a memory-disaggregated skiplist index that integrates three key innovations. First, it uses a fine-grained (i.e., entry-level) latch mechanism combined with dynamic node resizing to minimize the contention and splitting frequency. Second, it employs a tailored data layout for leaf node, which separates keys and values to enable SIMD acceleration while maintaining consistency checks with minimal write overhead. Third, it implements an adaptive caching strategy that tracks node popularity in real-time to optimize network bandwidth utilization during the index traversal. Experimental results show that Mariana achieves $1.7\times$ higher throughput under write-intensive workloads and reduces the P90 latency by 23% under the read-intensive workloads, when comparing to the state-of-the-art indices on disaggregated memory.},

Specifically, a k-means algorithm is presented to select inference nodes, participating training clients, and aggregation servers referring to network conditions and data quality. Furthermore, a reinforcement learning method is utilized to allocate the computation and bandwidth resources during inference, training, and aggregation, thereby further improving the quality of service (QoS) and training efficiency.

Second, core allocation based approaches ignore workload dynamics within decision intervals, potentially increasing contention for CPU time among tasks on the same core. Third, existing approaches lack strategies to allocate more resources to critical tasks that incur higher penalty costs when the node’s capacity is insufficient. This article proposes a reinforcement learning based hybrid CPU scaling approach that allocates quota and cores jointly, aiming to minimize penalty costs for timeouts. Based on the embedding generated from a fine-grained CPU demand series, we allocate CPU quotas and determine a dynamic workload-aware core sharing scheme using an attention mechanism that combines respective demands and global criticality regarding penalty costs.

A new dynamic multiresource fair allocation model with time discount utility is proposed in this article, where users can arrive and depart at different time slots. We propose a new any price share time discount (APS-TD) mechanism for this model, which accounts for the users’ time discount utility while maintaining desirable properties. We prove that the APS-TD mechanism satisfies cumulative incentive sharing (CSI), i.e., that the cumulative utility of each user is not lower than the cumulative utility generated by evenly allocating the available resources in each time slot; cumulative strategyproofness (CSP), where users cannot increase their cumulative utility by falsely reporting their demands in any time slot; cumulative Pareto optimality (CPO), i.e., where no allocation can increase the cumulative utility of one user without reducing the cumulative utility of another user in any time slot; cumulative envy-freeness (CEF), where users who arrive later should not prefer allocations from other users who arrive first in any time slot; time discount share fairness (TDSF), where users with higher time discount values occupy larger resource shares in each time slot unless the utility levels of both users are generated by evenly allocating resources; and bottleneck fairness (BF), where the allocation should satisfy max-min fairness with respect to the bottleneck resources contained in each time slot. We run the APS-TD mechanism on Alibaba trace-driven data to demonstrate the performance enhancement achieved by our proposed mechanism over the existing mechanism extensions.

  abstract     = {Geo-distributed computing, a paradigm that assigns computational tasks to globally distributed nodes, has emerged as a promising approach in cloud computing, edge computing, cloud-edge computing, and supercomputer computing (SC). It enables low-latency services, ensures data locality, and handles large-scale applications. As global computing capacity and task demands increase rapidly, scheduling tasks for efficient execution in geo-distributed computing systems has become an increasingly critical research challenge. It arises from the inherent characteristics of geographic distribution, including heterogeneous network conditions, region-specific resource pricing, and varying computational capabilities across locations. Researchers have developed diverse task scheduling methods tailored to geo-distributed scenarios, aiming to achieve objectives such as performance enhancement, fairness assurance, and fault-tolerance improvement. This survey provides a comprehensive and systematic review of task scheduling techniques across four major distributed computing environments, with an in-depth analysis of these approaches based on their core scheduling objectives. Through our analysis, we identify key research challenges and outline promising directions for advancing task scheduling in geo-distributed computing.},

  abstract     = {Mobile Virtual Reality (MVR), which aims to provide high-quality VR services to mobile devices of end users, has become the latest trend in virtual reality developments. The current MVR solution is to remotely render frame data from a cloud server, while the potential of edge computing in MVR is underexploited. In this paper, we propose a new approach named MUCVR to achieve high-quality interactive MVR collaboration for multiple users by exploiting edge computing. First, we design “vertical” edge–cloud collaboration for VR task rendering, in which foreground interaction is offloaded to an edge server for rendering, while the background environment is rendered by the cloud server. Correspondingly, the VR device of a user is only responsible for decoding and displaying. Second, we propose the “horizontal” multi-user collaboration based on edge–edge cooperation, which synchronizes the data among edge servers. Finally, we implement the proposed MUCVR on an MVR device and the Unity VR application engine. The results show that MUCVR can effectively reduce the MVR service latency, improve the rendering performance, reduce the computing load on the VR device, and, ultimately, improve users’ quality of experience.},

  abstract     = {Modern scientific experiments produce ever-increasing amounts of data, soon requiring ExaFLOPs computing capacities for analysis. Reaching such performance requires purpose-built supercomputers with $O(10^{3})$ nodes, each hosting multicore CPUs and multiple GPUs, and applications designed to exploit this hardware optimally. Given that each supercomputer is generally a one-off project, the need for computing frameworks portable across diverse CPU and GPU architectures without performance losses is increasingly compelling. We investigate the performance portability () of a real-world application: the solver module of the AVU–GSR pipeline for the ESA Gaia mission. This code finds the astrometric parameters of ${\sim} 10^{8}$ stars in the Milky Way using the LSQR iterative algorithm. LSQR is widely used to solve linear systems of equations across a wide range of high-performance computing applications, elevating the study beyond its astrophysical relevance. The code is memory-bound, with six main compute kernels implementing sparse matrix-by-vector products. We optimize the previous CUDA implementation and port the code to further six GPU-acceleration frameworks: C++ PSTL, SYCL, OpenMP, HIP, KOKKOS, and OpenACC. We evaluate each framework’s performance portability across multiple GPUs (NVIDIA and AMD) and problem sizes in terms of application and architectural efficiency. Architectural efficiency is estimated through the roofline model of the six most computationally expensive GPU kernels. Our results show that C++ library-based (C++ PSTL and KOKKOS), pragma-based (OpenMP and OpenACC), and language-specific (CUDA, HIP, and SYCL) frameworks achieve increasingly better performance portability across the supported platforms with larger problem sizes providing better scores due to higher GPU occupancies.},

The proposed approach can be applied to a variety of nonlinear dynamics models with runtime specification of parameters and network topologies. Parallelizing the solution of equations for different network elements is performed transparently and, in contrast to available tools, does not require parallel programming from end-users. The runtime scheduler takes into account the performance of computing and communication resources to reduce downtime and to achieve a quasi-optimal parallelizing speed-up. The proposed approach was implemented, and its efficiency is proven by numerous applications for simulating large dynamical networks with 103-108 elements described by Hodgkin–Huxley, FitzHugh–Nagumo, and Kuramoto models, for investigating pathological synchronization during Parkinson’s disease, analyzing multi-stability, for studying chimera and solitary states in 3D networks, etc. All the above computations may be performed using symmetrical multiprocessors, graphic processing units, and a network of workstations within the same run and it was demonstrated that near-linear speed-up can be achieved for large networks.

  abstract     = {Large Language Models (LLMs) are reshaping mobile AI. Directly deploying LLMs on mobile devices is an emerging paradigm that can widely support different mobile applications while preserving data privacy. However, intensive memory footprint, long inference latency and high energy consumption severely bottlenecks on-device inference of LLM in real-world scenarios. In response to these challenges, this work introduces m$^{2}$LLM, an innovative framework that performs joint optimization from multiple dimensions for on-device LLM inference in order to strike a balance among performance, realtimeliness and energy efficiency. Specifically, m$^{2}$LLM features the following four core components including : 1) Hardware-aware Model Customization, 2) Elastic Chunk-wise Pipeline, 3) Latency-guided Prompt Compression and 4) Layer-wise Resource Scheduling. These four components interact with each other in order to guide the inference process from the following three dimensions. At the model level, m$^{2}$LLM designs an elastic chunk-wise pipeline to expand device memory and customize the model according to the hardware configuration, maximizing performance within the memory budget. At the prompt level, facing the stochastic input, m$^{2}$LLM judiciously compresses the prompts in order to guarantee the first token can be generated in time while maintaining the semantic information. Additionally, at the system level, the layer-wise resource scheduler is employed in order to complete the token generation process with minimized energy consumption while guaranteeing the realtimeness in the highly dynamic mobile environment. m$^{2}$LLM is evaluated on off-the-shelf smartphone with represented models and datasets. Compared to baseline methods, m$^{2}$LLM delivers 2.99–13.5× TTFT acceleration and 2.28–24.3× energy savings, with only a minimal model performance loss of 2% –7% .},

  abstract     = {Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) is widely used to efficiently fine-tune large language models (LLMs), leading to multiple models fine-tuned from the same pre-trained LLM. State-of-the-art LLM serving systems colocate these LoRA models on the same GPU instances for concurrent serving, which decreases memory usage and boosts efficiency. However, the unawareness of the SLO requirements of each LoRA service and the interference between requests from different LoRA services can cause significant SLO violations. This paper presents Cannikin, a multi-LoRA inference serving system that optimizes the minimum of the SLO attainments of all LoRA services in the serving system, denoted as lagger-SLO attainment. We obtain insights from the characterization of a real-world multi-LoRA serving trace, which reveals the stable input/output lengths of the most popular LoRA services. This motivates Cannikin to propose an SLO-aware scheduling algorithm that prioritizes requests based on efficient deadline estimation. Cannikin further detects the influence of interference between different LoRA services on SLO violations and eliminates the bias between these services. The evaluation using real-world traces demonstrates that compared to the state-of-the-art multi-LoRA serving systems, Cannikin can handle up to 3.6× higher rates or 2.8× more burstiness while maintaining the SLO attainment of each LoRA service $&gt; $ 90% .},

Therefore, we introduce a new algorithm, named Network Division Positioning (NDP), to tackle this issue. In NDP, we use a similarity function to derive the distance between neighboring nodes and explore the routing concurrently, facilitating efficient distance measurement. Next, we analyze measurement errors between landmark nodes to define a threshold that filters out incorrect distances, ensuring measuring and positioning accuracy. We initially identify collinearity issues to enhance positioning robustness by examining the positional relationship between unpositioned nodes and their nearest landmark node. Subsequently, we addressed the poor positioning results and built the subnetwork utilizing the nearest landmark node and its associated measurement distance, seeking the most accurate and robust estimated position within this subnetwork. The simulation results demonstrate that NDP outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of efficiency, accuracy, and robustness when dealing with various irregular networks. Specifically, NDP enhances positioning accuracy by at least 40.82% in terms of the average median.},

  abstract     = {In performance engineering of composed services, coordinated provisioning can reduce the amount of resources required to meet end-to-end response time objectives. To this aim, various intertwined aspects of the application architecture need to be taken into account, notably including precedence constraints in the composition of elementary services, along with their durations and sensitivity to the scaling of provisioned resources. We address coordinated provisioning of resources for elementary services with stochastic durations with general distributions (i.e., including non-exponential distributions). We compose services in a workflow where precedence constraints define a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) and the distribution of the end-to-end (E2E) response time is subject to a Service Level Objective (SLO). We leverage a surrogate model of service performance, assuming a low workload of workflow requests (i.e., a single-request scenario) and service durations inversely proportional to provisioned resources. Given the total amount of resources, our approach derives the service provisioning that optimizes the workflow E2E response time distribution, by exploiting a compositional approach and by using stochastically ordered approximations to manage dependencies in non-well-nested precedence DAGs. Then, the approach scales provisioned resources up or down to determine the minimum amount of resources needed to satisfy the SLO, while leaving the remaining resources for horizontal scaling in order to manage multiple workflow requests at high workloads. Experiments consider low-workload and high-workload scenarios, different relations between elementary service durations and provisioned resources, and workflow topologies taken from benchmarks or randomly generated with controlled statistics, using elementary service durations from a dataset of the literature. Results show that the technique is feasible also for workflows with a thousand of services and that it outperforms other provisioning methods in fitting the SLO using the same resource amount and in minimizing the resource amount needed to fit the SLO.},

  abstract     = {LSM-tree-based Key-value systems are widely used in many internet applications, known for their superior write performance. Compaction operations, responsible for maintaining the pyramidal storage structure of the LSM-tree to ensure acceptable read performance, pose significant performance bottlenecks. The application of high-performance SSDs and lightweight user-space file systems in LSM storage alleviates IO bandwidth bottlenecks, but it amplifies the computational resource consumption of compaction when KV is small and medium, shifting the bottleneck from IO to computation. To mitigate the computational bottleneck of compaction, we propose GPComp, a GPU-accelerated compaction strategy for high-performance SSDs with lightweight user-space file systems. GPComp features efficient GPU compaction units and a CPU-GPU cooperative compaction acceleration strategy. We introduce a user-space file system specifically designed for LSM storage, TopFS-GPU. It implements an SPDK-based SSD-GPU P2P IO stack to enhance data transfer throughput in GPU-accelerated Compaction. It features an asynchronous write-back cache strategy, facilitating mixed read-write workloads in LSM-tree-based key-value systems. Additionally, our pipeline mechanism overlaps GPU computations with SSD-GPU IO, increasing system throughput. Implemented based on LevelDB, GPComp shows up to a 2.65x increase in average write throughput and a 2.32x improvement in mixed read-write throughput, with a P99 tail latency reduction of up to 169.65% compared to state-of-the-art methods.},

Therefore, a performance tuning framework with tensorized instruction compilation for automatic tensor generation is necessary for efficient deployment. These novel tensorized instruction, along with the emerging machine learning models, bring tremendous engineering challenges in compilation-based methods. They suffer from a large design space exploration with rough measurement accuracy and poor transferability among specialized instructions with certain hardware constraints. This paper presents a novel performance model for automatic code optimization with tensorized instruction. Central to the performance model is the assignment feature that not only clearly specifies the behaviour of instruction with computation and data movement abstraction, but also formally defines the matching problem from algorithm to tensorized instructions. Meanwhile, a simple yet efficient design with attention-inspired modules to accurately predict the performance of optimized tensor program by capturing global and long-range dependencies within a complete scheduling space. Compared with state-of-the-arts, our performance model can predict the optimal implementation of code configurations with tensorized instruction to reduce inference latency and search time by up to 1.21× and 3.41× on modern DNN benchmarks. Furthermore, with pre-trained parameters, our performance can quickly adapt to different workloads and platforms on tensorized instruction via transfer learning.},

  abstract     = {Structural clustering is one of the most popular graph clustering methods, which has achieved great performance improvement by utilizing GPUs. Even though, the state-of-the-art GPU-based structural clustering algorithm, $\mathsf {GPUSCAN}$, still suffers from efficiency issues since lots of extra costs are introduced for parallelization. Moreover, $\mathsf {GPUSCAN}$ assumes that the graph is resident in the GPU memory. However, the GPU memory capacity is limited currently while many real-world graphs are big and cannot fit in the GPU memory, which makes $\mathsf {GPUSCAN}$ unable to handle large graphs. Motivated by this, we present a new GPU-based structural clustering algorithm, ${\mathsf {GPUSCAN^{++}}}$, in this paper. To address the efficiency issue, we propose a new progressive clustering method tailored for GPUs that not only avoid high parallelization costs but also fully exploits the computing resources of GPUs. To address the GPU memory limitation issue, we propose a partition-based algorithm for structural clustering that can process large graphs with limited GPU memory. We conduct experiments on real graphs, and the experimental results demonstrate that our algorithm can achieve up to 168 times speedup compared with the state-of-the-art GPU-based algorithm when the graph can be resident in the GPU memory. Moreover, our algorithm is scalable to handle large graphs. As an example, our algorithm can finish the structural clustering on a graph with 1.8 billion edges using less than 2 GB GPU memory.},

  abstract     = {Efficiently training large language models (LLMs) on commodity cloud resources remains challenging due to limitations in network bandwidth and accelerator memory capacity. Existing training systems can be categorized based on their pipeline schedules. Depth-first scheduling, employed by systems like Megatron, prioritizes memory efficiency but restricts the overlap between communication and computation, causing accelerators to remain idle for over 20% of the training time. Conversely, breadth-first scheduling maximizes communication overlap but generates excessive intermediate activations, exceeding memory capacity and slowing computation by more than 34%. To address these limitations, we propose a novel elastic pipeline schedule that enables fine-grained control over the trade-off between communication overlap and memory consumption. Our approach determines the number of micro-batches scheduled together according to the communication time and the memory available. Furthermore, we introduce a mixed sharding strategy and a pipeline-aware selective recomputation technique to reduce memory usage. Experimental results demonstrate that our system eliminates most of the 28% all-accelerator idle time caused by communication, with recomputation accounting for less than 1.9% of the training time. Compared to existing baselines, PipeMesh improves training throughput on commodity clouds by 20.1% to 33.8%.},

However, edge clouds are often resource-constrained, which makes resource allocation a challenging issue. In addition, edge cloud servers must make allocation decisions with only limited information available, since the arrival of future client tasks might be impossible to predict, and the states and behavior of neighboring servers might be obscured. We focus on a distributed resource allocation method in which servers operate independently and do not communicate with each other, but interact with clients (tasks) to make allocation decisions. We follow a two-round bidding approach to assign tasks to edge cloud servers, and servers are allowed to preempt previous tasks to allocate more useful ones. We evaluate the performance of our system using realistic simulations and real-world trace data from a high-performance computing cluster. Results show that our heuristic improves system-wide performance by 20-25% over previous work when accounting for the time taken by each approach. In this way, an ideal trade-off between performance and speed is achieved.},

  abstract     = {Deep learning is experiencing a rise in large-scale models. Training large-scale models is costly, prompting researchers to train large-scale models on commodity servers that more researchers can access. The massive number of parameters necessitates the use of model parallelism training methods. Existing studies focus on training with pipeline model parallelism. However, the tensor model parallelism (TMP) is inevitable when the model size keeps increasing, where frequent data-dependent communication and computation operations significantly reduce the training efficiency. In this article, we present Oases, an automated TMP method with overlapped communication to accelerate large-scale model training on commodity servers. Oases proposes a fine-grained training operation schedule to maximize overlapping communication and computation that have data dependence. Additionally, we design the Oases planner that searches for the best model parameter partition strategy of TMP to achieve further accelerations. Unlike existing methods, Oases planner is tailored to model the cost of overlapped communication-computation operations. We evaluate Oases on various model settings and two commodity clusters, and compare Oases to four state-of-the-art implementations. Experimental results show that Oases achieves speedups of 1.01–1.48× over the fastest baseline, and speedups of up to 1.95× over Megatron.},

  abstract     = {DIMM-based Near-Memory-Processing (NMP) kernel offloading enables a program to execute in computation-enabled DIMM buffer chips, bypassing the bandwidth-constrained CPU main memory bus for high performance. Yet, it also enables programs to access memory without restrictions and protection from CPU, resulting in potential security hazards. To protect general NMP kernel offloading even with malicious privileged software, a heterogeneous TEE is required. However, for architectural design simplification, the conventional heterogeneous TEE design isolates host CPU process from NMP kernel’s memory and vice versa, such that CPU TEE and trusted NMP driver can protect CPU processes and NMP kernels in complete separation. Such isolation results in redundant input/output data movement between the two isolated memory spaces, with half of the movement performed by host CPU. Worsened by limited CPU memory bandwidth, we identify that such redundancy severely bottlenecks the performance of many potential NMP applications. To overcome this bottleneck, we propose to abandon isolation and share the NMP kernel memory with its host CPU process. Based on this idea, we design SSS-DIMM, an efficient TEE for DIMM-based NMP kernel offloading that removes the redundant data movement via Secure Space Sharing. SSS-DIMM resolves the two security challenges faced by memory sharing: to provide consistent security guarantees on CPU processes and NMP kernels with CPU TEE and the NMP driver for both memory ownership (allocation) and views (mapping), and to ensure that cryptography metadata be securely shared and synchronized between CPU and NMP unit. Our evaluation shows that SSS-DIMM maintains both security and high performance.},

  abstract     = {Fuzzy-rough sets-based feature selection (FRFS), as an effective data pre-processing technique, has drawn significant attention with the growing prevalence of large-scale datasets. However, centralized FRFS approaches suffer from the following shortcomings: 1) low computational efficiency, 2) bottlenecks in memory and computational resources, and 3) strict limitation of collaborative implementation using non-shared datasets owned by different data providers. These limitations highlight the growing necessity of integrating FRFS into a distributed FS framework. Nevertheless, most existing distributed FS schemes are reliant on a designated central server to collect and merge the local results from all slave nodes, which may result in several challenges including single point of failure risk, lack of trust and reliability, and lack of transparency and traceability. To relieve the above issues, this paper proposes a blockchain assisted distributed FS framework, successfully implementing a distributed solution for FRFS (BDFRFS). First, this framework introduces blockchain to merge, reach consensus and publish the global results generated during each iteration of FRFS, including the currently selected feature subset with its corresponding similarity matrix and dependency degree. This not only eliminates the reliance of central server and alleviates the burden on the central server, but also enhances the credibility and traceability of the results. Additionally, the implementation of FRFS is designed within this framework, utilizing three strategies to improve the efficiency of centralized FRFS: 1) eliminating the irrelevant and redundant features prior to the executing FRFS; 2) removing redundant and unnecessary computations involved in generating the similarity matrices; and 3) enabling parallel computation of dependency degrees. Finally, the experimental results conducted on eight large-scale datasets demonstrate that the proposed framework can significantly reduce the runtime cost and improve the classification accuracy compared to centralized FRFS and several distributed FS approaches.},

However, existing AIM systems, whether based on traditional optimization control methods or machine learning, suffer from low computational efficiency and a lack of robustness in ensuring safety, respectively. To overcome these limitations, we propose an innovative AIM scheme rooted in Safe Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning (MADRL). We initially model the safe MADRL problem as a constrained Markov game (CMG) and tackle it with our multi-agent projective constrained policy optimization (MAPCPO). This method first optimizes policy updates within the Kullback-Leibler divergence trust region to maximize performance, and then projects these optimized policies onto the bounds of risk constraints, thus ensuring safety. Building on this, we introduce a Risk-Bounded RL for Autonomous Intersection Management (RbRL-AIM) algorithm. This algorithm adopts an architecture that consists of an LSTM based policy neural network, a reward value network, and a risk neural network. These components, through the MAPCPO policy, enable continuous learning from complex and random intersection traffic environments, thereby facilitating the safe, efficient, and smooth control of vehicles at intersections. Our method is validated in a CARLA simulation, showing significant gains in computational and traffic efficiency over baseline optimization control methods. Compared to non-safety-aware MADRL methods, our approach achieves zero collisions and improved ride comfort.},

  abstract     = {Federated tree-based models are popular in many real-world applications owing to their high accuracy and good interpretability. However, the classical synchronous method causes inefficient federated tree-based model training due to tree node dependencies. Inspired by speculative execution techniques in modern high-performance processors, this paper proposes FTSeir, a novel and efficient speculative federated learning system. Instead of simply waiting, FTSeir optimistically predicts the outcome of the prior tree node. By resolving tree node dependencies with a neural network-based split point predictor, the training tasks of child tree nodes can be executed speculatively in advance via separate threads. This speculation enables cross-layer concurrent training, thus significantly reducing the waiting time. Furthermore, we propose an eager verification mechanism to promptly identify mispredictions, thereby reducing wasted computing resources. On a misprediction, an incomplete rollback is triggered for quick recovery by reusing the output of the mis-speculative training, which reduces computational requirements. We implement FTSeir and evaluate its efficiency in a real-world federated learning setting with six public datasets. Evaluation results demonstrate that FTSeir achieves up to 3.45× and 3.60× speedup over the state-of-the-art gradient boosted decision trees and random forests implementations, respectively.},

  abstract     = {In this article, we propose a novel resource management technique for heterogeneous supercomputing systems affected by manufacturing variability. Our proposed technique called VAHRM (Variation-Aware Heterogeneous Resource Management) takes a holistic approach to job scheduling on highly heterogeneous computing resources. VAHRM preferentially allocates energy-efficient computing resources to an energy-consuming job in a job queue, considering the impact on both the job turnaround time and the power consumption of individual resources. Furthermore, we have developed a novel approach to modeling the power consumption of computing resources that have manufacturing variability. Our approach called TSMVA (Two-Stage Modeling with Variation Awareness) enables us to generate the first variation-aware GPU power models, which can correctly estimate the power consumption of each GPU for a given job. Our experimental results show that, compared to conventional first-come-first-serve (FCFS) and state-of-the-art variation-aware scheduling algorithms, VAHRM can achieve respective improvements in system energy efficiency of up to 5.8% and 5.4% (4.5% and 4.2% on average) while reducing the average turnaround time of 21.2% and 11.9%, respectively, for various workloads obtained from a production system.},

  abstract     = {Gradient compression is a promising approach to alleviating the communication bottleneck in data parallel deep neural network (DNN) training by significantly reducing the data volume of gradients for synchronization. While gradient compression is being actively adopted by the industry (e.g., Facebook and AWS), our study reveals that there are two critical but often overlooked challenges: 1) inefficient coordination between compression and communication during gradient synchronization incurs substantial overheads, and 2) developing, optimizing, and integrating gradient compression algorithms into DNN systems imposes heavy burdens on DNN practitioners, and ad-hoc compression implementations often yield surprisingly poor system performance. In this paper, we propose a compression-aware gradient synchronization architecture, CaSync, which relies on flexible composition of basic computing and communication primitives. It is general and compatible with any gradient compression algorithms and gradient synchronization strategies and enables high-performance computation-communication pipelining. We further introduce a gradient compression toolkit, CompLL, to enable efficient development and automated integration of on-GPU compression algorithms into DNN systems with little programming burden. Lastly, we build a compression-aware DNN training framework HiPress with CaSync and CompLL. HiPress is open-sourced and runs on mainstream DNN systems such as MXNet, TensorFlow, and PyTorch. Evaluation via a 16-node cluster with 128 NVIDIA V100 GPUs and a 100 Gbps network shows that HiPress improves the training speed over current compression-enabled systems (e.g., BytePS-onebit, Ring-DGC and PyTorch-PowerSGD) by 9.8%–69.5% across six popular DNN models.},

One of efficient approaches is the micro-batch-based pipeline parallelism (MBPP), e.g., GPipe and Terapipe. Based on the MBPP, we establish a time-cost model with the basic time function of layers, which considers computing time and communication time simultaneously as well as considers they are nonlinear with the amount of input data. Focusing on the jointly optimal solutions of network division and data partition, we propose a Cross-Search algorithm with Improved Multi-dimensional Dichotomy (CSIMD). Through theoretical derivation, we prove improved multi-dimensional dichotomy (IMD) has appreciable theoretical optimality and linear computational complexity significantly faster than the state-of-the-art methods including dynamic programming and recursive algorithm. Extensive experiments on both CNN-based and transformer-based neural networks demonstrate our proposed CSIMD can obtain optimal network division and data partition schemes under MBPP. On average, the training speeds of CSIMD in CNN- and transformer-based DNNs are respectively $(2.0, 2.5)\times$ and $(2.66, 5.48)\times$ of (MBPP-R, MBPP-E).},

  abstract     = {Federated learning (FL) enables a set of client devices to collaboratively train a model without sharing raw data. This process, though, operates under the constrained computation and communication resources of edge devices. These constraints combined with systems heterogeneity force some participating clients to perform fewer local updates than expected by the server, thus slowing down convergence. Exhaustive tuning of hyperparameters in FL, furthermore, can be resource-intensive, without which the convergence is adversely affected. In this work, we propose GeL, the guess and learn algorithm. GeL enables constrained edge devices to perform additional learning through guessed updates on top of gradient-based steps. These guesses are gradientless, i.e., participating clients leverage them for free. Our generic guessing algorithm (i) can be flexibly combined with several state-of-the-art algorithms including FedProx, FedNova, FedYogi or ScaleFL; and (ii) achieves significantly improved performance when the learning rates are not best tuned. We conduct extensive experiments and show that GeL can boost empirical convergence by up to 40% in resource-constrained networks while relieving the need for exhaustive learning rate tuning.},

  abstract     = {In serverless inference, complex prediction tasks are executed as workflows, relying on efficient state transfer across multiple functions. Serverless platforms typically deploy each function in a separate stateless container, depending on external processes for state management, which often results in suboptimal system utilization and increased latency. We introduce WasmFlow, a novel framework designed for serverless inference that ensures low latency and high throughput. This is achieved through process-level virtualization using WebAssembly. WasmFlow operates functions on a per-thread basis within compact WebAssembly modules, significantly reducing startup times and memory usage. The framework has two key features. (1) Efficient Memory Sharing: WasmFlow facilitates direct and rapid state transfer between functions using threads within the WebAssembly runtime. This is enabled through lightweight, lock-free, zero-copy intra-process communication, complemented by effective inter-process RPC. (2) System Optimizations: We further optimize WasmFlow with an advanced synchronization technique between functions, an affinity-aware workflow scheduler, and adaptive request batching. Implemented and integrated within the Kubernetes ecosystem, WasmFlow’s performance was evaluated using synthetic workloads and real-world Azure traces, including typical serverless workflows and ML models. Our results demonstrate that WasmFlow dramatically outperforms existing serverless frameworks. It reduces P90 end-to-end latency by 74x and 78x, increases function density by 1.7x and 223x compared to Faasm and SPRIGHT, and improves system throughput by 12.3x and 8.8x over Knative and WasmEdge, respectively.},

We present a formal treatment of ABSE, addressing the primary design and implementation challenges, defining its generic components and rules for adherence to ensure global consistency.

We describe its architecture and Field Programmable Gate Array implementation, measure its performance, and compare it with prior solutions. HIPAS achieves the highest quality evaluation, the highest performance with speed-ups up to several hundreds, and the best energy efficiency. The main novelty is the algorithm implementation as a circular pipeline and a Finite State Machine with pseudo-parallel processing. Although Othello was recently claimed to be weakly solved, the game remains unsolved in a stronger sense. A weak solution only shows how to force a draw. It does not guarantee a win if the opponent makes a mistake. HIPAS can validate the weak solution faster and more efficiently. A multi-threaded NTest software component evaluating the beginning and part of the middle game, combined with one or more instances of HIPAS for handling the remainder can provide a stronger solution.},

  abstract     = {In programmable networks, measurement tasks are placed on programmable switches to monitor network traffic at line rate. These tasks typically require substantial resources (e.g., significant SRAM), while programmable switches are constrained by limited resources due to their hardware design (e.g., Tofino ASIC), making distributed deployment essentially. Measurement tasks must monitor specific network locations or traffic flows, introducing significant complexity in deployment optimization. This target-constrained nature makes task optimization on switches (e.g., task merging) become device-dependent and order-dependent, which can lead to deployment failures or performance degradation if ignored. In this paper, we introduce DisPLOY, a novel target-constrained distributed deployment framework specifically designed for network measurement tasks on the data plane. DisPLOY enables operators to specify monitoring targets—network traffic or device/link—across multiple switches. Given the monitoring targets, DisPLOY effectively minimizes redundant operations and optimizes deployment to achieve both resource efficiency (e.g., minimizing stage consumption) and high-performance monitoring (e.g., high accuracy). We implement and evaluate DisPLOY through deployment on both P4 hardware switches (Intel Tofino ASIC) and BMv2. Experimental results show that DisPLOY significantly reduces stage consumption by up to 66% and improves ARE by up to 78.4% in flow size estimation while maintaining end-to-end performance.},

  abstract     = {Traditional exclusive cloud resource allocation for deep learning training (DLT) workloads is unsuitable for advanced GPU infrastructure, leading to resource under-utilization. Fortunately, DLT workload co-location provides a promising way to improve resource utilization. However, existing workload co-location methods fail to accurately quantify interference among DLT workloads, resulting in performance degradation. To address this problem, this article proposes an interference-aware scheduling approach for DLT workloads based on co-location performance prediction, dubbed ‘ISACPP’. ISACPP first builds an edge-fusion gated graph attention network (E-GGAT) that incorporates DL model structures, underlying GPU types, and hyper-parameter settings to predict co-location performance. Since the co-location state changes as each workload is completed, ISACPP proposes a multi-stage co-location interference quantification model derived from the predicted co-location performance to identify the GPU device with the minimum overall interference. Experimental results demonstrate that ISACPP can accurately estimate the co-location performance of DLT workloads with a maximum prediction error of 8.72%, 1.9%, and 4.4% for execution time, GPU memory consumption, and GPU utilization, respectively. Meanwhile, ISACPP can significantly shorten workload makespan by up to 34.9% compared to state-of-the-art interference-aware scheduling methods.},

There have been increasing studies on LEO satellite networking. It is a crucial problem how to evaluate these studies in a systematic and reproducible manner. In this paper, we present OpenSN, i.e., an open source library for emulating large-scale satellite network (SN). Different from Mininet-based SN emulators (e.g., LeoEM), OpenSN adopts container-based virtualization, thus allows for running distributed routing software on each node, and can achieve horizontal scalability via flexible multi-machine extension. Compared to other container-based SN emulators (e.g., StarryNet), OpenSN streamlines the interaction with Docker command line interface and significantly reduces unnecessary operations of creating virtual links. These modifications improve emulation efficiency and vertical scalability on a single machine. Furthermore, OpenSN separates user-defined configuration from container network management via a Key-Value Database that records the necessary information for SN emulation. Such a separation architecture enhances the function extensibility. To sum up, OpenSN exhibits advantages in efficiency, scalability, and extensibility, thus is a valuable open source library that empowers research on LEO satellite networking. Experiment results show that OpenSN constructs mega-constellations 5X-10X faster than StarryNet, and updates link state 2X-4X faster than LeoEM. We also verify the scalability of OpenSN by successfully emulating the five-shell Starlink constellation with a total of 4408 satellites.},

While machine learning (ML) algorithms have shown potential in data prefetching to hide memory access latency, existing approaches face challenges with phase transitions and irregular memory access patterns in graph applications. To address these challenges, we introduce GraFetch, a specialized prefetching system for accelerating graph applications. GraFetch comprises of 1) a novel Hierarchical Hybrid Prefetching (HHP) framework that supports the cooperation of phase-specific ML predictors for high-complexity pattern prefetching and rule-based prefetchers for low-complexity pattern prefetching; and 2) Domain Specific Machine Learning (DSML) models integrated in the framework, which incorporate domain knowledge of graph applications to detect phases, recognize patterns, and predict memory accesses. We evaluate our approach using popular GA frameworks GPOP and X-Stream, and state-of-the-art GNN frameworks PyG and DGL. Our domain specific attention-based memory access predictors achieve 7.4% higher F1-score for delta (consecutive address jump) prediction and 15.35% higher accuracy@10 for page prediction compared with basic attention models.

However, its broader adoption has been hindered by performance limitations. Consequently, researchers have turned to GPUs for efficient FHE implementation. Nevertheless, most have predominantly favored integer units due to their ease of use, overlooking the considerable computational potential of floating-point units in GPUs. Recognizing this untapped floating-point computational power, our article introduces GIF-FHE, an extensive exploration and implementation of FHE, leveraging GPUs’ integer and floating-point instructions for FHE acceleration. We develop a comprehensive suite of low-level and middle-level FHE primitives, offering multiple implementation variants with support for three word size configurations ($64/52/32$.},

Our research proposes a novel adaptive FL framework specifically engineered to synchronize computational capacities within heterogeneous edge computing landscapes. Building upon the proof of convergence boundaries for local aggregation model, this algorithm adapts the number of iterations for local updates by considering the resource consumption relationship between local aggregation model and the local updated model by various clients. This method exhibit adaptability within an environment where disparities in edge device computational capacities exist, effectively balancing computational prowess among diverse devices and enhancing the output performance of federated learning. Experiments on MNIST and PlantVillage datasets show that in heterogeneous environments, our algorithm outperforms existing methods, improving the loss function by at least 16.87% and the convergence speed by at least 2 times, in various environments (MobileNet, AlexNet).},

This situation is exacerbated in the new Sunway supercomputer, where each process is limited to a mere 16 GB of memory. Herein, we present a novel parallel implementation of plane wave density functional theory on the new Sunway supercomputer (PWDFT-SW). PWDFT-SW fully extracts the benefits of Sunway supercomputer by extensively refactoring and calibrating our algorithms to align with the system characteristics of the Sunway system. Through extensive numerical experiments, we demonstrate that our methods can substantially decrease both computational costs and memory usage. Our optimizations translate to a speedup of 64.8x for a physical system containing 4,096 silicon atoms, enabling us to push the limit of PW-based DFT calculations to large-scale systems containing 16,384 carbon atoms.},

To overcome these limitations, we introduce ZeroTracer, an in-kernel online distributed tracing system equipped with an eBPF-based (extended Berkeley Packet Filter) trace generator. ZeroTracer tailors for tracking HTTP requests due to its popularity in microservice systems. In our evaluations, ZeroTracer achieves remarkable trace accuracy (i.e., over 91% ) and maintains stable performance under different workload concurrency. Moreover, ZeroTracer outperforms other non-invasive approaches which fail to reconcile accurate request causality. Notably, ZeroTracer effectively tracks end-to-end requests in multi-threaded microservice applications, which is absent in existing invasive distributed tracing systems with third-party library instrumentation. Moreover, ZeroTracer introduces a negligible overhead, with latency increasing by only 0.5% –1.2% and a modest 3% –5.8% increase in CPU and memory consumption.},

However, most current ciphertext search schemes are designed for the centralized cloud computing platforms and they are inefficient and inapplicable in Big Data scenarios. A proxy server based system is a cloud computing extension. This new pattern moves some of the data storage and computation burden from end users to the edge servers and it greatly decrease the resource costs of data users. In this paper, we propose a searchable encryption scheme assisted by cloud computing and proxy servers for Big Data, which can accomplish Lightweight Fine-grained access control and Efficient multi-keyword top-k ciphertext Search synchronously (LFES). To cope with all types of data, we design an innovative fine-grained access control mechanism based on attribute-based encryption and key distribution protocol. Thus, the scheme only allows users with licensed attributes to access data efficiently. Then, a public key searchable encryption scheme is proposed based on privacy Protection Set Intersection (PSI) and the proxy server model. Our scheme greatly reduces the computation burden on end-users and improves retrieval efficiency. Meanwhile, to prevent tampering with stored ciphertexts, a practical data integrity audit mechanism is also designed. Security analysis illustrates that the LFES can resist Chosen Keyword Attack (CKA) and Keyword Guessing Attack (KGA). Finally, the simulation shows that the LFES is efficient and feasible in practice.},

While progress has been made in developing dynamic allocators for substantial applications, their real-world applicability is still limited due to inefficient memory access behaviors. This paper introduces AlignMalloc, a novel memory management system that aligns with the Unified Virtual Memory (UVM) prefetching strategy, significantly enhancing both memory allocation and access performance in large-scale dynamic allocation scenarios. We analyze the fundamental inefficiencies in UVM access and first reveal the mismatch between memory access and UVM prefetching methods. To resolve this issue, AlignMalloc implements a warp-aware memory rearrangement strategy that exploits the regularity of warps to align with the UVM’s static prefetching setup. Additionally, AlignMalloc introduces an OR tree-based structure within a host-co-managed framework to further optimize dynamic allocation. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that AlignMalloc substantially outperforms current state-of-the-art systems, achieving up to $2.7 \times$ improvement in dynamic allocation and $2.3 \times$ in memory access. Additionally, eight real-world applications with diverse memory access patterns exhibit consistent performance enhancements, with average speedups $1.5 \times$.},

However, traditional VC schemes, originally designed for cloud computing, face challenges when applied to MEC environments, such as scalability issues, robustness, and efficiency concerns. To this end, we propose a verifiable distributed computation scheme for MEC, where computation tasks are distributed between a cloud server cluster (consisting of $n$ servers) and an edge server. The cloud handles most of the computation through parallel sub-tasks, while the edge server verifies intermediate results and performs minimal computation to recover the final outcome. Our scheme guarantees that the result can be recovered if at least $t$ servers, out of a total of $n$ servers in the cloud server cluster, perform their computations honestly. By leveraging batch verification and matrix-optimized polynomial evaluations, our scheme significantly enhances scalability, fault tolerance, and efficiency. The extensive analysis and simulations demonstrate that our proposed scheme is more feasible than existing solutions.},

To address this, we introduce a framework for composing parallel DRL systems on heterogeneous platforms consisting of general-purpose processors (CPUs) and accelerators (GPUs, FPGAs). Our innovations include: 1. A general training protocol agnostic of the underlying hardware, enabling portable implementations across various processors and accelerators. 2. Efficient design exploration and automatic task placement enabling parallelization of tasks within each DRL primitive over one or multiple heterogeneous devices. 3. Incorporation of DRL-specific optimizations on runtime scheduling and resource allocation, facilitating parallelized training and enhancing the overall system performance. 4. High-level API for productive development using the framework. We showcase our framework through experimentation with three widely used DRL algorithms, DQN, DDPG, and SAC, on three heterogeneous platforms with diverse hardware characteristics and interconnections.

  abstract     = {Cross-Silo federated learning is widely used for scaling deep neural network (DNN) training over data silos from different locations worldwide while guaranteeing data privacy. Communication has been identified as the main bottleneck when training large-scale models due to large-volume model parameters and gradient transmission across public networks with limited bandwidth. Most previous works focus on gradient compression, while limited work tries to compress parameters that can not be ignored and extremely affect communication performance during the training. To bridge this gap, we propose FedCSpc: an efficient cross-silo federated learning system with an XAI-driven adaptive parameter compression strategy for large-scale model training. Our work substantially differs from existing gradient compression techniques due to the distinct data features of gradient and parameter. The key contributions of this paper are fourfold. (1) Our designed FedCSpc proposes to compress the parameter during the training using the state-of-the-art error-bounded lossy compressor – SZ3. (2) We develop an adaptive compression error bound adjustment algorithm to guarantee the model accuracy effectively. (3) We exploit an efficient approach to utilize the idle CPU resources of clients to compress the parameters. (4) We perform a comprehensive evaluation with a wide range of models and benchmarks on a GPU cluster with 65 GPUs. Results show that FedCSpc can achieve the same model accuracy as FedAvg while reducing the data volume of parameters and gradients in communication by up to 7.39× and 288×, respectively. With 32 clients on a 4 Gb size model, FedCSpc significantly outperforms FedAvg in wall-clock time in the emulated WAN environment (at the bandwidth of 1 Gbps or lower without loss of generality).},

  abstract     = {To ensure high-performance processing capabilities across diverse application scenarios, Big Data frameworks such as Spark and Flink usually provide a number of performance-related parameters to configure. Considering the computation scale and the characteristic of repeated executions of typical recurring Big Data processing jobs, how to automatically tune parameters for performance optimization has emerged as a hot research topic in both academic and industry. With the advantages in interpretability and generalization ability, causal inference-based methods recently prove their advancement over conventional search-based and machine learning-based methods. However, the complexity of Big Data frameworks, the time-varying input dataset size of a recurring job and the limitation of a single causal structure learning algorithm together prevent these methods from practical application. Therefore, in this paper, we design and implement CausalConf, a datasize-aware configuration auto-tuning approach for recurring Big Data processing jobs via adaptive causal structure learning. Specifically, the offline training phase is responsible for training multiple datasize-aware causal structure models with different causal structure learning algorithms, while the online tuning phase is responsible for recommending the next promising configuration in an iterative manner via the Multi-Armed Bandit-based optimal intervention set selection as well as the novel datasize-aware causal Bayesian optimization. To evaluate the performance of CausalConf, a series of experiments are conducted on our local Spark cluster with 9 different previously unknown target applications from HiBench. Experimental results show that the performance speed ratio achieved by CausalConf compared to the four recent and representative baselines can respectively reach 1.45×, 1.31×, 1.26× and 1.54× on average and up to 2.53×, 1.55×, 1.57×, 2.18×. Besides, the average total online tuning cost of CausalConf is reduced by 8.85%, 14.26%, 18.58%, and 14.29%, respectively.},

  abstract     = {Burckhardt et al. proposed a formal specification framework for eventually consistent replicated data types, denoted $(vis, ar)$, based on the notions of visibility and arbitration relations. However, being specific to eventually consistent systems, this framework has two limitations. First, it does not cover non-convergent consistency models since arbitration $ar$ is a total order over events. Second, it does not cover the consistency models in which each event is required to be aware of the return values of some events that are visible to it when justifying its return value. These limitations make the $(vis, ar)$ framework not generic enough to specify and reason about important weak consistency models such as Causal Memory and PRAM. In this article, we extend this framework to a more generic one called $(vis, ar, V)$ for weakly consistent replicated data types. To specify non-convergent consistency models as well, we relax the arbitration relation $ar$ to be a partial order. To overcome the second limitation, we allow to specify for each event $e$, a subset $V(e)$ of its visible set whose return values cannot be ignored when justifying the return value of $e$. To make it practically feasible, we provide candidates for the visibility and arbitration relations and the $V$ function. By combining candidates for these three components, we are able to specify not only existing consistency models but also new ones that are reasonable and promising for practical usefulness. We then show how to specify consistency models in our framework, and provide three case studies.},

Existing centralized and distributed scheduling systems fall short in meeting performance requirements due to computational overload on the scheduler, cluster state management overhead, and scheduling conflicts. To address these challenges, this article introduces Beehive, a novel lightweight decentralized scheduling framework. In Beehive, each cluster node can schedule tasks within its local neighborhood, effectively reducing resource management overhead and scheduling conflicts. Moreover, all nodes are interconnected in a small-world network, an efficient structure that allows tasks to access resources across the entire cluster through global routing. This lightweight design enables Beehive to scale efficiently, supporting over 10,000 nodes and up to 80,000 task submissions per second without causing single-node scheduling bottlenecks. Experimental results demonstrate that Beehive significantly reduces scheduling latency. Specifically, 99% of tasks are scheduled within 100 milliseconds, and scheduling throughput can increase linearly with the number of nodes. Compared to existing centralized and distributed scheduling frameworks, Beehive substantially alleviates scheduling bottlenecks, particularly for high-frequency, short-lived tasks.},

Given an undirected graph with non-negative weights for edges and a set of pairs of vertices called terminals, the Steiner Forest Problem is to find the minimum cost subgraph that connects each of the terminal pairs together. We design a family of parallel greedy algorithms based on a sequential heuristic greedy algorithm called Paired Greedy, which iteratively connects the terminal pairs that have the minimum distance. The family of parallel algorithms consists of a set of algorithms exhibiting various degrees of parallelism determined by the number of pairs that are connected in parallel in each iteration of the algorithms. We implement and run the algorithms on a multi-core system and perform an extensive experimental analysis. We analyzed the performance of the algorithms on a rich library of Steiner Forest instances with various underlying graph types. The results show that our proposed parallel algorithms achieve significant speedup with respect to the sequential Paired Greedy algorithm and provide solutions with costs that are very close to those of the solutions obtained by the sequential Paired Greedy algorithm. We provide recommendation on selecting the type of parallel algorithm and its parameters in order to achieve the most efficient results for each class of instances.},

  abstract     = {Coarse-grained reconfigurable arrays (CGRAs) have emerged as promising candidates for digital signal processing, biomedical, and automotive applications, where energy efficiency and flexibility are paramount. Yet existing CGRAs suffer from the Amdahl bottleneck caused by constrained control handling via either off-device communication or expensive tag-matching mechanisms. More importantly, mapping control flow onto CGRAs is extremely arduous and time-consuming due to intricate instruction structures and hardware mechanisms. To counteract these limitations, we propose Raccoon, a portable and lightweight framework for CGRAs targeting vast control flows. Raccoon comprises a comprehensive approach that spans microarchitecture, HW/SW interface, and compiler aspects. Regarding microarchitecture, Raccoon incorporates specialized infrastructure for branch- and loop-level control patterns with concise execution mechanisms. The HW/SW interface of Raccoon includes well-characterized abstractions and instruction sets tailored for easy compilation, featuring custom operators and architectural models for control-oriented units. On the compiler front, Raccoon integrates advanced control handling techniques and employs a portable mapper leveraging reinforcement learning and Monte Carlo tree search. This enables agile mapping and optimization of the entire program, ensuring efficient execution and high-quality results. Through the cohesive co-design, Raccoon can empower various CGRAs with robust control-flow handling capabilities, surpassing conventional tagged mechanisms in terms of hardware efficiency and compiler adaptability. Evaluation results show that Raccoon achieves up to a 5.78× improvement in energy efficiency and a 2.24× reduction in cycle count over state-of-the-art CGRAs. Raccoon stands out for its versatility in managing intricate control flows and showcases remarkable portability across diverse CGRA architectures.},

  abstract     = {Li et al. in [Inf. Process. Lett. 77 (2001) 35–41] proposed the shuffle-cube $SQ_{n}$, a hypercube variant, as an attractive interconnection network topology for massive parallel and distributed systems. Diameter and symmetry are two desirable measures of network performance in terms of transmission delay and routing algorithms. Almost all $n$-regular hypercube variants of dimension $n$ have diameter not less than $n/2$. The diameter of the shuffle-cube is approximately a quarter of the diameter of the hypercube of the same dimension, making it a competitive candidate network topology. By far, symmetric properties of the shuffle-cube remain unknown. In this paper, we show that $SQ_{n}$ is not vertex-transitive for $n&gt; 2$, which is not an appealing property in interconnection networks. This shortcoming limits the practical application of the shuffle-cube. To overcome this limitation, two novel variants of the shuffle-cube, namely simplified shuffle-cube $SSQ_{n}$ and balanced shuffle-cube $BSQ_{n}$ are introduced, and their vertex-transitivity are proved simultaneously. By proposing the shuffle-cube-like graph, we obtain that both $SSQ_{n}$ and $BSQ_{n}$ are maximally connected, implying high connectivity similar to the hypercube. Additionally, super-connectivity, a refined parameter of connectivity, of $SSQ_{n}$ and $BSQ_{n}$ are also determined. Then, by vertex-transitivity of $SSQ_{n}$ and $BSQ_{n}$, routing algorithms of $SSQ_{n}$ and $BSQ_{n}$ are given for all $n&gt; 2$ respectively. We show that both $SSQ_{n}$ and $BSQ_{n}$ possess Hamiltonian cycle embedding for all $n&gt; 2$, and we also show that $SSQ_{n}$ is Hamiltonian-connected. It is noticeable that each vertex of $SSQ_{n}$ is contained in exactly one clique of size four, making it also a viable interconnection topology for data center networking since each clique of size four can be viewed as an efficient local data processing cluster of the network. Finally, as a by-product of proving vertex-transitivity of $BSQ_{n}$, we mend a flaw in the Property 3 in [IEEE Trans. Comput. 46 (1997) 484–490].},

  abstract     = {Event matching is a key component in a large-scale content-based publish/subscribe system. The performance of most existing algorithms is easily affected by the subscription matching probability. In this article, we propose a new data structure, named $AWB^+$-$Tree$, which is based on the width of the predicates, to efficiently index the subscriptions. The most notable feature of $AWB^+$-$Tree$ is its ability to combine the advantages of different matching methods, thus achieving high and robust performance in dynamic environments. First, we implement both a forward matching method (AFM) and a backward matching method (ABM) based on $AWB^+$-$Tree$. Then, we introduce a hybrid matching method (AHM) that combines AFM and ABM. Moreover, we extend $AWB^+$-$Tree$ in three aspects: approximate matching, string type matching, and fine-grained parallelization. We conducted extensive experiments to evaluate the performance of the proposed matching algorithms on synthetic and real-world datasets. The experiment results reveal that AHM achieves a reduction in matching time by up to 53.8% compared to the state-of-the-art method. Additionally, AHM exhibits improved performance robustness, with up to a 76.9% reduction in terms of the standard deviation of matching time. Particularly in dynamic scenarios, AHM is at least 2.3 times faster and 41.3% more stable than its counterparts. Furthermore, by implementing parallelization, the matching speed of 8 threads can be accelerated by 4.16 times compared to the single-thread matching speed.},

  abstract     = {Serverless computing promises to be a cost effective form of on demand computing. To fully utilize its cost saving potential, workflows must be configured with the appropriate amount of resources to meet their response time Service Level Objective (SLO), while keeping costs at a minimum. Since determining and updating these configuration models manually is a nontrivial and error prone task, researchers have developed solutions for automatically finding configurations that meet the aforementioned requirements. However, our initial experiments show that even when following best practices and using state-of-the-art configuration tools, resources may still be considerably over- or underprovisioned, depending on the size of functions’ input payload. In this paper we present ChunkFunc, an SLO- and input data-aware framework for tuning serverless workflows. Our main contributions include: i) an SLO- and input size-aware function performance model for optimized configurations in serverless workflows, ii) ChunkFunc Profiler, an auto-tuned, Bayesian Optimization-guided profiling mechanism for profiling serverless functions with typical input data sizes to build a performance model, and iii) ChunkFunc Workflow Optimizer, which uses these models to determine an input size dependent configuration for each serverless function in a workflow to meet the SLO, while keeping costs to a minimum. We evaluate ChunkFunc on real-life serverless workflows and compare it to two state-of-the-art solutions, showing that it increases SLO adherence by a factor of 1.04 to 2.78, depending on the workflow, and reduces costs by up to 61% .},

  abstract     = {Instruction reordering is an essential optimization technique used in both compilers and multi-core processors to enhance parallelism and resource utilization. Although the original intent of this technique is to benefit the program, some improper reordering can significantly impact the program correctness, which we call instruction reordering vulnerability (IRV). However, existing methods detect IRV by defining CPU instruction reordering rules to schedule execution paths while neglecting compiler reordering, and thus generate false positives that require manual filtering and resulting in inefficiency. To bridge this gap, in this paper, we propose the IRV detection method, IRHunter, which analyzes IRV characteristics and extracts vulnerability patterns, integrating program dependency analysis for compiler reordering and memory model constraints for CPU reordering. Specifically, we use static analysis based on specific patterns to narrow the analysis scope, and adopt log-based dynamic analysis to confirm vulnerability by checking the log constraints. We built the IRV benchmark to compare IRHunter with five state-of-the-art tools (i.e., GENMC, Nidhugg, CBMC, SHB, BiRD). IRHunter detected all 19 errors, doubling the best model checking tools’ performance, with half the false positive rate of leading data race detectors. It was 10× faster on small programs and outperformed data race detectors on large programs.},

Therefore, SpGETT can be performed by first converting the input tensors into matrices, then invoking high performance variants of SpGEMM, and finally reconverting the resultant matrix into a tensor. Alternatively, one can carry out the scalar operations underlying SpGETT in the realm of tensors without matrix formulation. We discuss the building blocks in both approaches and formulate a hashing-based method to avoid costly search or redirection operations. We present performance results with the current state-of-the-art SpGEMM-based approaches, existing SpGETT approaches, and a carefully implemented SpGETT approach with a new fine-tuned hashing method, proposed in this article. We evaluate the methods on real world tensors by contracting a tensor with itself along varying dimensions. Our proposed hashing-based method for SpGETT consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art method, achieving a 25% reduction in sequential execution time on average and a 21% reduction in parallel execution time on average across a variety of input instances.},

Offloading a computation to the many-core acceleration fabric implies synchronization and communication overheads which can hamper overall performance and efficiency, particularly for small and fine-grained parallel tasks. In this work, we present a detailed, cycle-accurate quantitative analysis of the offload overheads on Occamy, an open-source massively parallel RISC-V based heterogeneous MPSoC. We study how the overheads scale with the number of accelerator cores. We explore an approach to drastically reduce these overheads by co-designing the hardware and the offload routines. Notably, we demonstrate that by incorporating multicast capabilities into the Network-on-Chip of a large (200+ cores) accelerator fabric we can improve offloaded application runtimes by as much as 2.3x, restoring more than 70% of the ideally attainable speedups. Finally, we propose a quantitative model to estimate the runtime of selected applications accounting for the offload overheads, with an error consistently below 15%.},

  abstract     = {Application developers often need to employ a combination of software such as communication middleware and cloud-based services to deal with the challenges of heterogeneity and network dynamism in the edge-to-cloud continuum. Consequently, developers write extra glue code peripheral to the application’s core business logic, to provide interoperability between interacting software frameworks. Each software framework comes with its own framework-specific API, and as technology evolves, the developer must keep up with the changing APIs by updating the glue code in their application. Thus, framework-specific APIs hinder interoperability and cause technology fragmentation. We propose a design of a middleware-based distributed operating system (OS) called OneOS to realize a computing paradigm that alleviates such interoperability challenges. OneOS provides a single system image of the distributed computing platform, and transparently provides interoperability between software components through the standard POSIX API. Using OneOS’s domain-specific language, users can compose complex distributed applications from legacy POSIX programs. OneOS tolerates failures by adopting a distributed checkpoint-restore algorithm. We evaluate the performance of OneOS against an open-source IoT Platform, ThingsJS, using an IoT stream processing benchmark suite, and a video processing application. OneOS executes the programs about 3x faster than ThingsJS, reduces the code size by about 22%, and recovers the state of failed applications within 1 s upon detecting their failure.},

  abstract     = {Graph partitioning is of great importance to optimizing the performance and cost of geo-distributed graph analytics applications. However, it is non-trivial to obtain efficient and effective partitioning due to the challenges brought by the large graph scales, dynamic graph changes and the network heterogeneity in geo-distributed data centers (DCs). Existing studies usually adopt heuristic-based methods to achieve fast and balanced partitioning for large graphs, which are not powerful enough to address the complexity in our problem. Further, graph structures of many applications can change at various frequencies. Dynamic partitioning methods usually focus on achieving low latency to quickly adapt to changes, which unfortunately sacrifices partitioning effectiveness. Also, such methods are not aware of the dynamicity of graphs and can over sacrifice effectiveness for unnecessarily low latency. To address the limitations of existing studies, we propose DistRLCut, a novel graph partitioner which leverages Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) to solve the complexity of the partitioning problem. To achieve fast partitioning for large graphs, DistRLCut adapts MARL to a distributed implementation which significantly accelerates the learning process. Further, DistRLCut incorporates two techniques to trade-off between partitioning effectiveness and efficiency, including local training and agent sampling. By adaptively tuning the number of local training iterations and the agent sampling rate, DistRLCut is able to achieve good partitioning results within an overhead constraint required by graph dynamicity. Experiments using real cloud DCs and real-world graphs show that, compared to state-of-the-art static partitioning methods, DistRLCut improves the performance of geo-distributed graph analytics by 11%-95%. DistRLCut can partition over 28 million edges per second, showcasing its scalability for large graphs. With varying graph changing frequencies, DistRLCut can improve the performance by up to 71% compared to state-of-the-art dynamic partitioning.},

While most FPGA accelerator focus on high performance and energy-efficiency, analyzing the worst-case execution time (WCET) bound is essential for using CNN accelerations in real-time embedded systems design. In this work, we show that in a multi-DPU environment, the observed worst-case inference time for a CNN inference task could become 3X larger w.r.t. the best case inference time, which prompts the prominent importance of a static timing analysis for FPGA-based CNN inference. We propose, to the best of the authors’ knowledge, the first static timing analysis framework for CNN inference in a multi-DPU environment. The proposed framework introduces a generalized timing behavior model for shared bus arbitration and memory access contention between parallel running DPU engines. Additionally, it incorporates a fine-grained memory access contention analysis that takes into account the characteristics of deep learning applications. For a single-DPU environment, the analysis result is 27% tighter in average compared with the state-of-the-art results. Furthermore, our proposed method produces relatively tight estimated results in the multi-DPU environment.},

However, compared with the powerful Matrix MACs, the vectorized units of the AI processors cannot efficiently carry the existing Taylor expansion implementation of Single Instruction Multiple Data (SIMD) parallelism. Leveraging the Matrix MACs for Taylor expansion becomes an ideal direction. In previous studies, migrating optimized algorithms to the Matrix MACs requires matrix generation during the runtime. The generation is expensive and even cancels the accelerations brought by the Matrix MACs on the AI processors, which Taylor expansion also suffers. This article presents Cube-fx, a mapping algorithm of Taylor expansion for multiple functions onto Matrix MACs. Cube-fx expresses the building and computation in matrix multiplications without inefficient dynamic matrix generation.

Virtual machine placement (VMP) has been extensively studied as a means to provide flexible and scalable cloud services while optimizing energy efficiency. Yet, the increasing complexity and diversity of applications have posted VMP suffering from waste of resources and bottlenecks due to unbalanced utilization of multi-dimensional resources. To address these issues, this article proposes a bi-objective optimization model for VMP that jointly optimizes power consumption and multi-dimensional resource utilization. Solving this large-scale bi-objective model presents a significant challenge in balancing performance and computational complexity. To tackle this, an enhanced decomposition-based multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA/D) based on $\varepsilon$-domination, termed $\varepsilon$-IMOEA/D-M2M is designed to provide solutions for the proposed optimization. Compared with both heuristics and evolutionary algorithms, performance evaluations demonstrate that our proposed VMP algorithm effectively reduces power consumption and balances multidimensional resource utilization while significantly decreasing running time compared to both heuristic and traditional evolutionary algorithms.},

While most existing schedulers expedite DLT workloads by considering GPU sharing and elastic training, they neglect layer elasticity, which dynamically freezes certain layers of a network. This technique has been shown to significantly speed up individual workloads. In this paper, we explore how to incorporate layer elasticity into DLT scheduler designs to achieve higher cluster-wide efficiency. A key factor that hinders the application of layer elasticity in GPU clusters is the potential loss in model accuracy, making users reluctant to enable layer elasticity for their workloads. It is necessary to have an efficient layer-elastic system, which can well balance training accuracy and speed for layer elasticity. We introduce IceFrog, the first scheduling system that utilizes layer elasticity to improve the efficiency of DLT workloads in GPU clusters. It achieves this goal with superior algorithmic designs and intelligent resource management. In particular, (1) we model the frozen penalty and layer-aware throughput to measure the effective progress metric of layer-elastic workloads. (2) We design a novel scheduler to further improve the efficiency of layer elasticity. We implement and deploy IceFrog in a physical cluster of 48 GPUs. Extensive evaluations and large-scale simulations show that IceFrog reduces average job completion times by 36-48% relative to state-of-the-art DL schedulers.},

Unfortunately, the inherent scheduler of NPU does not consider real-time scheduling. Therefore, it cannot meet real-time requirements of airborne embedded systems.

The proposed workload-aware NPU performance model can accurately predict the remaining execution time of the task when it runs with other tasks concurrently. The soft preemptive real-time scheduling algorithm can provide approximate preemption capability by dynamically adjusting the NPU computing resources of tasks. Finally, we implement a prototype NPU scheduler of the airborne embedded system for the fixed-wing UAV. The proposed models and algorithms are validated on both the simulated and realistic task sets.

  abstract     = {High-dimensional sparse data emerge in many critical application domains such as healthcare and cybersecurity. To extract meaningful insights from massive volumes of these multi-dimensional data, scientists employ unsupervised analysis tools based on tensor decomposition (TD) methods. However, real-world sparse tensors exhibit highly irregular shapes and data distributions, which pose significant challenges for making efficient use of modern parallel processors. This study breaks the prevailing assumption that compressing sparse tensors into coarse-grained structures (i.e., tensor slices or blocks) or along a particular dimension/mode (i.e., mode-specific) is more efficient than keeping them in a fine-grained, mode-agnostic form. Our novel sparse tensor representation, Adaptive Linearized Tensor Order (${\sf ALTO}$), encodes tensors in a compact format that can be easily streamed from memory and is amenable to both caching and parallel execution. In contrast to existing compressed tensor formats, ${\sf ALTO}$ constructs one tensor copy that is agnostic to both the mode orientation and the irregular distribution of nonzero elements. To demonstrate the efficacy of ${\sf ALTO}$, we accelerate popular TD methods that compute the Canonical Polyadic Decomposition (CPD) model across different types of sparse tensors. We propose a set of parallel TD algorithms that exploit the inherent data reuse of tensor computations to substantially reduce synchronization overhead, decrease memory footprint, and improve parallel performance. Additionally, we characterize the major execution bottlenecks of TD methods on multiple generations of the latest Intel Xeon Scalable processors, including Sapphire Rapids CPUs, and introduce dynamic adaptation heuristics to automatically select the best algorithm based on the sparse tensor characteristics. Across a diverse set of real-world data sets, ${\sf ALTO}$ outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches, achieving more than an order-of-magnitude speedup over the best mode-agnostic formats. Compared to the best mode-specific formats, which require multiple tensor copies, ${\sf ALTO}$achieves $5.1\times$ geometric mean speedup at a fraction (25% ) of their storage costs. Moreover, ${\sf ALTO}$ obtains $8.4\times$ geometric mean speedup over the state-of-the-art memoization approach, which reduces computations by using extra memory, while requiring 14% of its memory consumption.},

  abstract     = {GPUs are widely used hardware acceleration platforms in many areas due to their great computational throughput. In the meanwhile, GPUs are vulnerable to transient hardware faults in the post-Moore era. Analyzing the error resilience of GPUs are critical for both hardware and software. Statistical fault injection approaches are commonly used for error resilience analysis, which are highly accurate but very time consuming. In this work, we propose GEREM, a first framework to speed up fault injection process so as to estimate the error resilience of GPU microarchitectures swiftly and precisely. We find early fault behaviors can be used to accurately predict the final outcomes of program execution. Based on this observation, we categorize the early behaviors of hardware faults into GPU Early Fault Manifestation models (EFMs). For data structures, EFMs are early propagation characteristics of faults, while for pipeline instructions, EFMs are heuristic properties of several instruction contexts. We further observe that EFMs are determined by static microarchitecture states, so we can capture them without actually simulating the program execution process under fault injections. Leveraging these observations, our GEREM framework first profiles the microarchitectural states related for EFMs at one time. It then injects faults into the profiled traces to immediately generate EFMs. For data storage structures, EFMs are directly used to predict final fault outcomes, while for pipeline instructions, machine learning is used for prediction. Evaluation results show GEREM precisely assesses the error resilience of GPU microarchitecture structures with $237\times$ speedup on average comparing with traditional fault injections.},

  abstract     = {Federated learning (FL) has recently garnered significant attention in edge intelligence. However, FL faces two major challenges: First, statistical heterogeneity can adversely impact the performance of the global model on each client. Second, the model transmission between server and clients leads to substantial communication overhead. Previous works often suffer from the trade-off issue between these seemingly competing goals, yet we show that it is possible to address both challenges simultaneously. We propose a novel communication-efficient personalized FL framework for edge intelligence that estimates the low-rank component of the training model gradient and stores the residual component at each client. The low-rank components obtained across communication rounds have high similarity, and sharing these components with the server can significantly reduce communication overhead. Specifically, we highlight the importance of previously neglected residual components in tackling statistical heterogeneity, and retaining them locally for training model updates can effectively improve the personalization performance. Moreover, we provide a theoretical analysis of the convergence guarantee of our framework. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, achieving up to 89.18% reduction in communication overhead and 91.00% reduction in computation overhead while maintaining comparable personalization accuracy compared to previous works.},

  abstract     = {In modern parallel system architectures, prefetchers are essential to mitigating the performance challenges posed by long memory access latencies. These architectures rely heavily on efficient memory access patterns to maximize system throughput and resource utilization. Prefetch aggressiveness is a central parameter in managing these access patterns; although increased prefetch aggressiveness can enhance performance for certain applications, it often risks causing cache pollution and bandwidth contention, leading to significant performance degradation in other workloads. While many existing prefetchers rely on static or simple built-in aggressiveness controllers, a more flexible, adaptive approach based on system-level feedback is essential to achieving optimal performance across parallel computing environments. In this paper, we introduce an Adaptive Prefetch Aggressiveness Control (APAC) framework that leverages Reinforcement Learning (RL) to dynamically manage prefetch aggressiveness in parallel system architectures. The APAC controller operates as an RL agent, which optimizes prefetch aggressiveness by dynamically responding to system feedback on prefetch accuracy, timeliness, and cache pollution. The agent receives a reward signal that reflects the impact of each adjustment on both performance and memory bandwidth, learning to adapt its control strategy based on workload characteristics. This data-driven adaptability makes APAC particularly well-suited for parallel architectures, where efficient resource management across cores is essential to scaling system performance. Our evaluation with the ChampSim simulator demonstrates that APAC effectively adapts to diverse workloads and system configurations, achieving performance gains of 6.73$\%$ in multi-core systems compared to traditional Feedback Directed Prefetching (FDP). By improving memory bandwidth utilization, reducing cache pollution, and minimizing inter-core interference, APAC significantly enhances prefetching performance in multi-core processors. These results underscore APAC’s potential as a robust solution for performance optimization in parallel system architectures, where efficient resource management is paramount for scaling modern processing environments.},

  abstract     = {The key performance bottleneck of large-scale graph processing on memory-limited GPUs is the host-GPU graph data transfer. Existing GPU-accelerated graph processing frameworks address this issue by managing the active subgraph transfer at runtime. Some frameworks adopt explicit transfer management approaches based on explicit memory copy with filter or compaction. In contrast, others adopt implicit transfer management approaches based on on-demand accesses with the zero-copy mechanism or unified virtual memory. Having made intensive analysis, we find that as the active vertices evolve, the performance of the two approaches varies in different workloads. Due to heavy redundant data transfers, high CPU compaction overhead, or low bandwidth utilization, adopting a single approach often results in suboptimal performance. Moreover, these methods lack effective cache management methods to address the irregular and sparse memory access pattern of graph processing. In this work, we propose a hybrid transfer management approach that takes the merits of both two transfer approaches at runtime. Moreover, we present an efficient vertex-centric graph caching framework that minimizes CPU-GPU communication by caching frequently accessed graph data at runtime. Based on these techniques, we present HytGraph, a GPU-accelerated graph processing framework, which is empowered by a set of effective task-scheduling optimizations to improve performance. Experiments on real-world and synthetic graphs show that HytGraph achieves average speedups of 2.5 ×, 5.0 ×, and 2.0 × compared to the state-of-the-art GPU-accelerated graph processing systems, Grus, Subway, and EMOGI, respectively.},

  abstract     = {Fine-grained deduplication (also known as delta compression) can achieve a better deduplication ratio compared to chunk-level deduplication. This technique removes not only identical chunks but also reduces redundancies between similar but non-identical chunks. Nevertheless, it introduces considerable I/O overhead in deduplication and restore processes, hindering the performance of these two processes and rendering fine-grained deduplication less popular than chunk-level deduplication to date. In this paper, we explore various issues that lead to additional I/O overhead and tackle them using several techniques. Moreover, we introduce MeGA, which attains fine-grained deduplication/restore speed nearly equivalent to chunk-level deduplication while maintaining the significant deduplication ratio benefit of fine-grained deduplication. Specifically, MeGA employs (1) a backup-workflow-oriented delta selector and cache-centric resemblance detection to mitigate poor spatial/temporal locality in the deduplication process, and (2) a delta-friendly data layout and “Always-Forward-Reference” traversal to address poor spatial/temporal locality in the restore workflow. Evaluations on four datasets show that MeGA achieves a better performance than other fine-grained deduplication approaches. Specifically, MeGA significantly outperforms the traditional greedy approach, providing 10–46 times better backup speed and 30–105 times more efficient restore speed, all while preserving a high deduplication ratio.},

  abstract     = {The multi objective shortest path (MOSP) problem, crucial in various practical domains, seeks paths that optimize multiple objectives. Due to its high computational complexity, numerous parallel heuristics have been developed for static networks. However, real-world networks are often dynamic where the network topology changes with time. Efficiently updating the shortest path in such networks is challenging, and existing algorithms for static graphs are inadequate for these dynamic conditions, necessitating novel approaches. Here, we first develop a parallel algorithm to efficiently update a single objective shortest path (SOSP) in fully dynamic networks, capable of accommodating both edge insertions and deletions. Building on this, we propose DynaMOSP, a parallel heuristic for Dynamic Multi Objective Shortest Path searches in large, fully dynamic networks. We provide a theoretical analysis of the conditions to achieve Pareto optimality. Furthermore, we devise a dedicated shared memory CPU implementation along with a version for heterogeneous computing environments. Empirical analysis on eight real-world graphs demonstrates that our method scales effectively. The shared memory CPU implementation achieves an average speedup of 12.74× and a maximum of 57.22×, while on an Nvidia GPU, it attains an average speedup of 69.19×, reaching up to 105.39× when compared to state-of-the-art techniques.},

  abstract     = {Graph neural networks (GNNs) have emerged as powerful tools for addressing non-euclidean problems. GNNs operate through two key execution phases: i) aggregation and ii) combination. In the aggregation phase, the feature data of neighboring graph nodes are gathered, which is expressed as sparse-dense matrix multiplication (SpMM) between an adjacency matrix and a feature embedding table. The combination phase takes the aggregated feature embedding as input to a neural network model with learnable weights. Typically, the adjacency matrix is extremely sparse due to inherent graph structures, making the aggregation phase a significant bottleneck in GNN computations. This paper introduces Graphite, a GNN acceleration framework to overcome the challenge of SpMM operations and enable graphics processing units (GPUs) to exploit massive thread-level parallelism more efficiently via existing dense acceleration units (i.e., tensor cores). To that end, Graphite employs three techniques for GNN acceleration. First, hardware-aware sparse graph reshaping (HAS) rearranges graph structures to replace sparse operations with dense computations, enabling hardware acceleration through GPU tensor cores. Additionally, balanced thread block scheduling (BTS) distributes sparse thread blocks evenly across streaming multiprocessors in GPUs, and zero-aware warp skipping (ZAWS) eliminates ineffective threads that operate on meaningless zeros. Experimental results show that Graphite achieves an average compression rate of 84.1% for adjacency matrices using HAS. Combined with BTS and ZAWS, Graphite delivers an average 1.55x speedup over the conventional SpMM-based GNN computation method.},

However, GPUs in current deep learning clusters are often under-utilized, which hampers the job performance and overall cluster throughput. It is urgent to improve GPU utilization, but existing works lack research on fine-grained allocation for GPU resources, as it typically allocates GPUs as indivisible units. Serverless computing reveals an opportunity to optimize utilization with fine-grained resource allocation methods, but it requires addressing three main challenges: co-location performance degradation, service level objectives guarantee of serverless functions, and cold start overhead. We propose SMore, a framework based on serverless computing to optimize GPU resource utilization of DL clusters. SMore dynamically predicts the possible co-location performance degradation and leverages a degradation-aware scheduling algorithm to ensure that the co-location decisions do not impact workload performance. It also dynamically preloads or offloads DL models by predicting the request numbers of the subsequent period to address the cold start issue. Through actual trace testing on the prototype of SMore, we find that the average GPU utilization can be increased by 34% with degradation being controlled effectively.},

To fill the gap, we propose a unified communication agent named Courier to minimize the number of concurrent flows in cluster computing applications, which is compatible with the mainstream coflow scheduling approaches. To maintain the scheduling order given by the scheduling algorithms, Courier merges multiple flows between each pair of hosts into a unified flow, and determines its order based on that of origin flows. In addition, in order to adapt to various types of topologies, Courier introduces a control mechanism to adjust the number of flows while maintaining the scheduling order. Extensive large-scale trace-driven simulations have shown that Courier is compatible with existing scheduling algorithms, and outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches by about 30% under a variety of workloads and topologies.},

  abstract     = {The cyclical and continuous working characteristics of Internet of Things (IoT) devices make a large amount of the same or similar data, which can significantly consume storage space. To solve this problem, various secure data deduplication schemes have been proposed. However, existing deduplication schemes only perform deduplication based on data similarity, ignoring the internal connection among devices, making the existing schemes not directly applicable to parallel and distributed scenarios like IoT. Furthermore, since secure data deduplication leads to multiple users sharing same encryption key, which may lead to security issues. To this end, we propose a device relationship-based IoT data deduplication scheme that fully considers the IoT data characteristics and devices internal connections. Specifically, we propose a device relationship prediction approach, which can obtain device collaborative relationships by clustering the topology of their communication graph, and classifies the data types based on device relationships to achieve data deduplication with different security levels. Then, we design a similarity-preserving encryption algorithm, so that the security level of encryption key is determined by the data type, ensuring the security of the deduplicated data. In addition, two different data deduplication methods, identical deduplication and similar deduplication, have been designed to meet the privacy requirement of different data types, improving the efficiency of deduplication while ensuring data privacy as much as possible. We evaluate the performance of our scheme using five real datasets, and the results show that our scheme has favorable results in terms of both deduplication performance and computational cost.},

  abstract     = {Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a prominent solution for distributed learning environments, enabling collaborative model training without centralized data collection. However, FL faces significant challenges such as data heterogeneity and resource-constraint edge devices for model training and analysis, leading to accuracy degradation and bias in model performance. To address these critical issues, we propose a novel FL strategy named FedTune-SGM, designed to optimize model training in decentralized settings. In this strategy, a cloud-based model is initially trained and fine-tuned on the edge devices with additional layers tailored to the specific data characteristics. This fine-tuning process effectively mitigates the impact of data heterogeneity, enhancing the robustness and generalization capability of the model. FedTune-SGM employs a strategic weighting mechanism that ensures a balanced and equitable contribution from participating edge devices to prevent dominant influences from resource-rich devices and promote a fairer and more accurate aggregated model. Additionally, the proposed strategy integrates a Stackelberg Game model to foster an interactive and dynamic cloud-edge setup that motivates edge devices to invest more effort in model training and ensures the effectiveness of resource-constraint edge devices. Extensive experiments conducted on three diverse datasets highlight the superior performance of the proposed FedTune-SGM strategy compared to state-of-the-art FL techniques in terms of accuracy and robustness while meeting the critical challenges of data heterogeneity and resource limitations in FL environments. Through these innovations, FedTune-SGM paves the way for more reliable and efficient distributed learning systems, unlocking the full potential of FL in practical applications.},

  abstract     = {Federated continual learning (FCL) has attracted growing attention in achieving collaborative model training among edge clients, each of which learns its local model for a sequence of tasks. Most existing FCL approaches aggregate clients’ latest local models to exchange knowledge. This unfortunately deviates from real-world scenarios where each model is optimized independently using the client’s own dynamic data and different clients have heterogeneous tasks. These tasks not only have distinct class labels (e.g., animals or vehicles) but also differ in input feature distributions. The aggregated model thus often shifts to a higher loss value and incurs accuracy degradation. In this article, we depart from the model-grained view of aggregation and transform it into multiple task-grained aggregations. Each aggregation allows a client to learn from other clients to improve its model accuracy on one task. To this end, we propose Loci to provide abstractions for clients’ past and peer task knowledge using compact model weights, and develop a communication-efficient approach to train each client’s local model by exchanging its tasks’ knowledge with the most accuracy relevant one from other clients. Through its general-purpose API, Loci can be used to provide efficient on-device training for existing deep learning applications of graph, image, nature language processing, and multimodal data. Using extensive comparative evaluations, we show Loci improves the model accuracy by 32.48% without increasing training time, reduces communication cost by 83.6%, and achieves more improvements when scale (task/client number) increases.},

  abstract     = {A primary design objective for user-facing services for cloud and edge computing is to maximize query throughput, while meeting query tail latency Service Level Objectives (SLOs) for individual queries. Unfortunately, the existing solutions fall short of achieving this design objective, which we argue, is largely attributed to the fact that they fail to take the query fanout explicitly into account. In this paper, we propose TailGuard based on a Tail-latency-SLO-and-Fanout-aware Earliest-Deadline-First Queuing policy (TF-EDFQ) for task queuing at individual task servers the query tasks are fanned out to. With the task pre-dequeuing time deadline for each task being derived based on both query tail latency SLO and query fanout, TailGuard takes an important first step towards achieving the design objective. A query admission control scheme is also developed to provide tail latency SLO guarantee in the presence of resource shortages. TailGuard is evaluated against First-In-First-Out (FIFO) task queuing, task PRIority Queuing (PRIQ) and Tail-latency-SLO-aware EDFQ (T-EDFQ) policies by both simulation and testing in the Amazon EC2 cloud. It is driven by three types of applications in the Tailbench benchmark suite, featuring web search, in-memory key-value store, and transactional database applications. The results demonstrate that TailGuard can significantly improve resource utilization (e.g., up to 80% compared to FIFO), while also meeting the targeted tail latency SLOs, as compared with the other three policies. TailGuard is also implemented and tested in a highly heterogeneous Sensing-$a$s-a-Service (SaS) testbed for a data sensing service, demonstrating performance gains of up to 33% . These results are consistent with both the simulation and Amazon EC2 results.},

The memory-intensive embedding layers of recommendation systems are the crucial performance bottleneck, with operations manifesting as sparse memory lookups and simple reduction computations. Recent studies propose near-memory processing (NMP) architectures to speed up embedding operations by utilizing high internal memory bandwidth. However, these solutions typically employ a fixed vector partitioning strategy that fail to adapt to changes in data center deployment scenarios and lack practicality. We propose Flips, a flexible partitioning strategy NMP architecture that accelerates embedding layers. Flips supports more than ten partitioning strategies through hardware-software co-design. Novel hardware architectures and address mapping schemes are designed for the memory-side and host-side. We provide two approaches to determine the optimal partitioning strategy for each embedding table, enabling the architecture to accommodate changes in deployment scenarios. Importantly, Flips is decoupled from the NMP level and can utilize rank-level, bank-group-level and bank-level parallelism. In peer-level NMP evaluations, Flips outperforms state-of-the-art NMP solutions, RecNMP, TRiM, and ReCross by up to 4.0×, 4.1×, and 3.5×, respectively.},

  abstract     = {Machine learning has been a driving force in the evolution of tremendous computing services and applications in the past decade. Traditional learning systems rely on centralized training and inference, which poses serious privacy and security concerns. To solve this problem, distributed learning over wireless edge networks (DLWENs) emerges as a trending solution and has attracted increasing research interests. In DLWENs, corresponding services need to be placed onto the edge servers to process the distributed tasks. Apparently, different placement of training services can significantly affect the performance of all distributed learning tasks. In this article, we propose TASP, a task-aware service placement scheme for distributed learning in wireless edge networks. By carefully considering the structures (directed acyclic graphs) of the distributed learning tasks, the fine-grained task requests and inter-task dependencies are incorporated into the placement strategies to realize the parallel computation of learning services. We also exploit queuing theory to characterize the dynamics caused by task uncertainties. Extensive experiments based on the Alibaba ML dataset show that, compared to the state-of-the-art schemes, the proposed work reduces the overall delay of distributed learning tasks by 38.6% on average.},

  abstract     = {Transformer models have shown significant success in a wide range of tasks. However, the massive resources required for its inference prevent deployment on a single device with relatively constrainted resources, thus leaving a high threshold of integrating their advancements. Observing scenarios such as smart home applications on edge devices and cloud deployment on commodity hardware, it is promising to distribute Transformer inference across multiple devices. Unfortunately, due to the tightly-coupled feature of Transformer model, existing model parallelism approaches necessitate frequent communication to resolve data dependencies, making them unacceptable for distributed inference, especially under relatively weak interconnection. In this paper, we propose DeTransformer, a communication-efficient distributed Transformer inference system. The key idea of DeTransformer involves the co-design of Transformer architecture to reduce the communication during distributed inference. In detail, DeTransformer is based on a novel block parallelism approach, which restructures the original Transformer layer with a single block to the decoupled layer with multiple sub-blocks. Thus, it can exploit model parallelism between sub-blocks. Next, DeTransformer contains an adaptive execution approach that strikes a trade-off among communication capability, computing power and memory budget over multiple devices. It incorporates a two-phase planning for execution, namely static planning and runtime planning. The static planning runs offline, containing a profiling procedure and a weight placement strategy before execution. The runtime planning dynamically determines the optimal parallel computing strategy from an expertly crafted search space based on real-time requests. Notably, this execution approach can adapt to heterogeneous devices by distributing workload based on devices’ computing capabilities. We conduct experiments for both auto-regressive and auto-encoder tasks of Transformer models. Experimental results show that DeTransformer can reduce distributed inference latency by up to 2.81× compared to the SOTA approach on 4 devices, while effectively maintaining task accuracy and a consistent model size.},

  abstract     = {Federated learning (FL) addresses privacy concerns by training models without sharing raw data, overcoming the limitations of traditional machine learning paradigms. However, the rise of smart applications has accentuated the heterogeneity in data and devices, which presents significant challenges for FL. In particular, data skewness among participants can compromise model accuracy, while diverse device capabilities lead to aggregation bottlenecks, causing severe model congestion. In this article, we introduce Spread+, a hierarchical system that enhances FL by organizing clients into clusters and delegating model aggregation to edge devices, thus mitigating these challenges. Spread+ leverages hedonic coalition formation game to optimize customer organization and adaptive algorithms to regulate aggregation intervals within and across clusters. Moreover, it refines the aggregation algorithm to boost model accuracy. Our experiments demonstrate that Spread+ significantly alleviates the central aggregation bottleneck and surpasses mainstream benchmarks, achieving performance improvements of 49.58% over FAVG and 22.78% over Ring-allreduce.},

  abstract     = {Logs are a known abstraction used to develop dependable and secure distributed systems. By logging entries on a sequential global log, systems can synchronize updates over replicas and provide a consistent state recovery in the presence of faults. However, their usage incurs a non-negligible overhead on the application's performance. This article presents Beelog, an approach to reduce logging impact and accelerate recovery on log-based protocols by safely discarding entries from logs. The technique involves executing a log compaction during run-time concurrently with the persistence and execution of commands. Besides compacting logging information, the proposed technique splits the log file and incorporates strategies to reduce logging overhead, such as batching and parallel I/O. We evaluate the proposed approach by implementing it as a new feature of the etcd key-value store and comparing it against etcd's standard logging. Utilizing workloads from the YCSB benchmark and experimenting with different configurations for batch size and number of storage devices, our results indicate that Beelog can reduce application recovery time, especially in write-intensive workloads with a small number of keys and a probability favoring the most recent keys to be updated. In such scenarios, we observed up to a 50% compaction in the log file size and a 65% improvement in recovery time compared to etcd's standard recovery protocol. As a side effect, batching results in higher command execution latency, ranging from $ \text{100 ms}$ to $ \text{350 ms}$ with Beelog, compared to the default etcd's $ \text{90 ms}$. Except for the latency increase, the proposed technique does not impose other significant performance costs, making it a practical solution for systems where fast recovery and reduced storage are priorities.},

  abstract     = {Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) efficiently trains large models by using sparse activation to lower costs, selecting a few experts based on data characteristics. However, it faces challenges such as All-to-All communication overhead and load imbalance, with most optimizations targeting dynamic graphs rather than the more efficient static graphs. This study identifies two key challenges in training MoE on static graphs: 1) excessive All-to-All communication (up to 75% of iteration time) and load imbalance (70% of tokens handled by two experts) between experts due to the sparse structure of the MoE model and the token distribution; and 2) inefficient zero-padding for static shapes, leading to unnecessary computational overhead(wasting approximately 50% of resources). Thus, EfficientMoE, a scheduling method based on expert load and data characteristics, is introduced. EfficientMoE first designs a sampler to collect real-time information about token distribution, expert load, etc. It constructs a load prediction model to evaluate expert load. Subsequently, EfficientMoE proposes a dynamic schedule strategy for experts with evaluated expert load, reducing All-to-All communication and addressing load-balancing issues. Additionally, an expert capacity model is proposed to set different capacities for replicas of hot experts before static graph compilation, minimizing computation and storage overhead caused by significant padding. This study implements EfficientMoE in MindSpore and uses 32 Ascend AI accelerators to train an MoE model with 21 billion parameters and evaluate its validity. EfficientMoE demonstrated an improvement of 30% in model training time, approximately 12% reduction in communication time, and saved 35% computational resources across different clusters, compared with Switch transformers, and the Fastermoe method for static graphs.},

Parallel computing resources exhibit heightened computational and energy efficiency when operating with larger batch sizes. However, in the realm of online services, the adoption of a larger batch size may lead to longer response times. This paper aims to provide a dynamic batching scheme that delicately balances latency and efficiency. The system is modeled as a batch service queue with size-dependent service times. Then, the design of dynamic batching is formulated as a semi-Markov decision process (SMDP) problem, with the objective of minimizing the weighted sum of average response time and average power consumption. A method is proposed to derive an approximate optimal SMDP solution, representing the chosen dynamic batching policy. By introducing an abstract cost to reflect the impact of “tail” states, the space complexity and the time complexity of the procedure can decrease by 63.5% and 98%, respectively. Numerical results showcase the superiority of SMDP-based batching policies across various parameter setups. Additionally, the proposed scheme exhibits noteworthy flexibility in balancing power consumption and latency.},

  abstract     = {Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) is a promising technology for secure, non-interactive outsourced computation. One notable method to increase the throughput of FHE-based outsourcing is batching, which typically involves large-scale matrix-matrix multiplications (MM). However, the substantial overhead inherent in existing FHE schemes poses a major challenge for processing these large-scale tasks, often resulting in insufficient memory or prolonged delays on a single machine, making it practically unviable. Utilizing multi-machine parallelism in cloud clusters for outsourced computation offers a natural solution to these obstacles. In this work, we propose FHE4DMM, a distributed algorithm that provides a unified view on encrypted matrices, accommodating various FHE schemes and any matrix dimensions, to accelerate large-scale encrypted MM. A key innovation is its reuse optimizations for parallelized homomorphic computations, which can offer valuable insights for broader FHE-based applications. We utilized FHE4DMM to conduct large-scale square ($4096\times 4096$) and rectangular ($32768\times 32768,32768\times 16$ ) matrix multiplications on 256 machines, achieving computation time of 172.2 s and 76.1 s, respectively, while ensuring a 128-bit security level. For scalability, the experiments demonstrate that FHE4DMM achieves linear speedup for $2^{i}$ ($i$ is from 0 to 6) machines across various matrix dimension cases. In addition, within the range of matrix dimensions that the state-of-the-art (SOTA) distributed FHE-MM algorithm (Huang et al. 2023) can handle, FHE4DMM attains a maximum speedup of 16.62x. To assess its practical performance, FHE4DMM is applied in a basic multi-layer feedforward network. We used 64 machines to perform secure outsourced inference on MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets with encrypted models and data. Compared to using the SOTA, our method achieved speedups of up to 3.54x and 4.22x respectively, with the MM module obtaining a 4.09x and 4.87x speedup.},

  abstract     = {Service function chains (SFCs) are sequences of network functions that provide specific services to meet operators’ needs in today's ISPs and datacenter networks. To improve the performance of SFCs, programmable data planes are used to leverage their low latency and high performance packet processing. However, SFCs need to be adaptable to dynamics such as changes in requirements and attributes. Therefore, the ability to migrate SFCs is essential. Unfortunately, migrating SFCs in distributed programmable data planes is challenging due to the risk of degraded performance and failure to meet SFCs requirements and resource constraints in switches. In this paper, we propose Monte, which provides an effective SFCs migration scheme in distributed programmable data planes. We build a novel integer programming model to represent the migration process with constraints on resource limitations of switches and SFCs attributes in the distributed data plane. Additionally, an SFCs migration algorithm is designed to optimize the migration cost by deeply analyzing resource allocation in the switch pipeline. Monte has been implemented on both P4 software switches (Bmv2) and hardware switches (Intel Tofino ASIC). Extensive evaluation results show that the migration cost in Monte is 94.03% lower on average than the state-of-the-art deployment scheme, and Monte can effectively save pipeline resources.},

  abstract     = {Service composition dynamically integrates various services from multiple providers to meet complex user requirements. However, most existing methods assume centralized control over all services, which is often unrealistic because providers typically prefer to independently manage their own services, posing challenges to the application of traditional methods. Collaborative service composition offers a solution by enabling providers to work together to complete service composition. However, this approach also faces its own challenges. Driven by self-interest, providers may be reluctant to offer services needed by others, and due to business competition, they may wish to share as few services as possible (where sharing services means disclosing service information to other providers). To address these challenges, we propose a novel collaborative service composition approach that comprehensively considers each provider’s self-interest and achieves service composition with minimal service sharing. First, we introduce a “self-interest degree” model to capture providers’ self-interest. This behavior may lead to service refusal, so we design a service availability prediction method based on a reputation model to minimize rejections. Then, we propose a decentralized service composition method. It utilizes historical composition records to mine empirical rules between requirements and services, constructing a correlations matrix, and collaboratively trains a multi-label classification model with other providers under a distributed federated learning framework. Combining the matrix and model outputs, we design a service composition method and a node coordination protocol that completes service composition with minimal service sharing. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in capturing providers’ self-interest and showcase its superior performance compared to existing methods.},

FedHome leverages federated learning (FL) and generative convolutional autoencoders (GCAE) to train models on decentralized edge devices while prioritizing data privacy. A notable challenge in this domain is the class imbalance in health data, where critical events such as falls are underrepresented, adversely affecting model performance. To address this, the research evaluates six oversampling techniques using Stratified K-fold cross-validation: SMOTE, Borderline-SMOTE, Random OverSampler, SMOTE-Tomek, SVM-SMOTE, and SMOTE-ENN. These methods are tested on FedHome's public implementation over 200 training rounds with and without stratified K-fold cross-validation. The findings indicate that SMOTE-ENN achieves the most consistent test accuracy, with a standard deviation range of 0.0167–0.0176, demonstrating stable performance compared to other samplers. In contrast, SMOTE and SVM-SMOTE exhibit higher variability in performance, as reflected by their wider standard deviation ranges of 0.0157–0.0180 and 0.0155–0.0180, respectively. Similarly, the Random OverSampler method shows a significant deviation range of 0.0155–0.0176. SMOTE-Tomek, with a deviation range of 0.0160–0.0175, also shows greater stability but not as much as SMOTE-ENN. This finding highlights the potential of SMOTE-ENN to enhance the reliability and accuracy of personalized health monitoring systems within the FedHome framework.},

Traditionally, GANs are trained in centralized data centers, raising data privacy concerns due to the need for clients to upload their data. To address this, Federated Learning (FL) integrates with GANs, allowing collaborative training without sharing local data. However, this integration is complex because GANs involve two interdependent models—the generator and the discriminator—while FL typically handles a single model over distributed datasets. In this article, we propose a novel asynchronous FL framework for GANs, called AsyncFedGAN, designed to efficiently and distributively train both models tailored for molecule generation. AsyncFedGAN addresses the challenges of training interactive models, resolves the straggler issue in synchronous FL, reduces model staleness in asynchronous FL, and lowers client energy consumption. Our extensive simulations for molecular discovery show that AsyncFedGAN achieves convergence with proper settings, outperforms baseline methods, and balances model performance with client energy usage.},

Despite substantial work in this area, a comprehensive survey on characterizing and understanding GNNs from a computer architecture perspective is lacking. This article presents a comprehensive survey, proposing a triple-level classification method to categorize, summarize, and compare existing efforts, particularly focusing on their implications for parallel architectures and distributed systems.

  abstract     = {Attribute-based encryption (ABE) has emerged as a new paradigm for access control in cloud computing. However, despite the many promising features of ABE, its deployment in real-world systems is still limited, partially due to the expensive cost of its underlying mathematical operations, which often grow linearly with the size and complexity of the system's security policies. This becomes particularly challenging in data-intensive applications, where multiple users may simultaneously access and manipulate large volumes of data, resulting in high levels of concurrency and demand for computing resources, which are too heavy even for high-end servers. Further exacerbating the issues are the functionality and security requirements of a cloud, as they introduce additional computations to both the client and the server. Therefore, in this work, we introduce $ \mathsf{GPABE} $, the first GPU-based parallelization framework for ABE to facilitate its batch processing in cloud computing. By analyzing ABE's major computational workload, we identify multiple arithmetic modules that are common in the design of pairing-based ABEs. Based on the analysis, we further propose to decompose the ABE algorithm into computation graph, which can be efficiently implemented on the GPU platform. Our graph representation bridges the gap between ABE's high-level design and their low-level implementation on GPUs, and is applicable to a variety of popular schemes in the realm of ABE. We then implement $ \mathsf{GPABE} $ as a heterogeneous computing server, with several optimization techniques to improve its throughput. Finally, we evaluate the GPU implementation of several ABE schemes using $ \mathsf{GPABE} $. The results show a speedup of least 51.0× and at most 253.6× for the throughput of ABE algorithms, compared to their state-of-the-art CPU implementations, which preliminarily demonstrated the effectiveness of $ \mathsf{GPABE} $.},

  abstract     = {Temporal Graph Neural Networks (TGNNs) are powerful models to capture temporal, structural, and contextual information on temporal graphs, outperforming other methods in many high-impact downstream tasks. However, achieving high-performance TGNN inference in production environments is challenging because TGNN models suffer from high computation complexity and intrinsic temporal data dependency that hinders data parallelism. In addition, real-world TGNN applications have different latency and throughput requirements. This work presents ViTeGNN, a versatile TGNN inference solution for memory-based TGNNs on FPGAs. ViTeGNN performs algorithm-model-architecture co-design to meet the latency and throughput requirements of real-world TGNN applications. Besides the vanilla inference mode ViTeGNN-bal that updates embeddings for nodes interacting with others, we propose ViTeGNN-lat and ViTeGNN-thpt, optimized for latency and throughput. Our model optimizations include a lightweight method to compute attention scores and a related temporal neighbor pruning strategy to reduce computation and memory accesses. These are holistically coupled with key hardware optimizations that leverage the FPGA hardware. We propose a novel hardware module to execute the complex neighbor update process efficiently. To ensure similar accuracy vis-á-vis the original model, the simplified models are trained using the knowledge distillation technique. We propose a unified hardware design that supports all of these three inference modes without FPGA reconfiguration. Enabled by our flexible hardware architecture, we further propose ViTeGNN-auto, which automatically selects the best inference mode at runtime based on latency and throughput requirements, guided by our accurate performance model. We evaluate the performance of the proposed hardware accelerator on five real-world datasets. ViTeGNN-bal reduces the computation complexity by an average of 62% and memory accesses by an average of 36% with only 0.0042 accuracy loss. Compared with state-of-the-art implementations on CPU and GPU, our FPGA implementation achieves $53.9/26.0/16.1\times$ speedup and $8.2/4.0/2.5\times$ speedup for ViTeGNN-lat/-bal/-thpt, respectively.},

  abstract     = {Data streaming is an ordered sequence of data continuously generated over time, whose dynamic scale is hard to be predicated in advance. Since the traditional integrity verification primitives are not qualified to check the integrity of the retrieved data and the outsourced database in streaming setting, some specific schemes were proposed by adopting the tree-like authentication structure or the combination of signature and accumulator. However, these schemes are not optimal for the owner. The main concerns can be generalized as how to reduce the size of the authentication information to be less than the scale of the data streaming, and enable the resource-constrained owner to check the data integrity without using challenge. To address the problems, we intend to find a new approach to design the scheme by exploiting the novel technique called decentralized vector commitment (DVC). Towards this goal, we first propose a key exposure-freeness chameleon vector commitment scheme, and then present the efficient DVC technique based on our key exposure-freeness chameleon vector commitment scheme. The scheme is finally constructed by leveraging the efficient DVC technique. Besides the integrity verification, our scheme is also sufficient to efficiently distribute the data to a user who is protected from receiving the stale data. To optimize the performance in concurrently retrieving multiple data, we introduce the batch query that reduces large amounts of communication and computation overheads. The security analysis and performance evaluation show that our solutions are secure and efficient.},

  abstract     = {This article finds that existing mutex locks suffer from throughput collapses or latency collapses, or both, in the oversubscribed scenarios where applications create more threads than the CPU core number, e.g., database applications like mysql use per thread per connection. We make an in-depth performance analysis on existing locks and then identify three design rules for the lock primitive to achieve scalable performance in oversubscribed scenarios. First, to achieve ideal throughput, the lock design should keep adequate number of active competitors. Second, the active competitors should be arranged carefully to avoid the lock-holder preemption problem. Third, to meet latency requirements, the lock design should track the latency of each competitor and reorder the competitors according to the latency requirement. We propose a new lock library called HTLL that satisfies these rules and achieves both high throughput and low latency even when the cores are oversubscribed. HTLL only requires minimal human effort (e.g., add several lines of code) to annotate the latency requirement. Evaluation results show that HTLL achieves scalable performance in the oversubscribed scenarios. Specifically, for the real-world database, LMDB, HTLL can reduce the tail latency by up to 97% with only an average 5% degradation in throughput, compared with state-of-the-art alternatives such as Malthusian, CST, and Mutexee locks; In comparison to the widely used pthread_mutex_lock, it can increase the throughput by up to 22% and decrease the latency by up to 80%. Meanwhile, for the under-subscribed scenarios, it also shows comparable performance than state-of-the-art blocking locks.},

This approach is particularly advantageous for parallel hardware accelerators, such as Google's Edge Tensor Processing Unit (TPU), which is widely used for deep neural network (DNN) inference on embedded systems. This paper studies sporadic global non-preemptive fixed-priority (NP-FP) rigid gang scheduling, which is well-suited for DNN applications in Edge TPU pipelines. Each gang task spawns a fixed number of threads that must execute concurrently across distinct processing units. We introduce the first carry-in limitation technique specifically designed for gang task response time analysis, addressing the unique challenges posed by intra-task parallelism. This technique is formulated as a generalized knapsack problem, and we develop both a linear programming relaxation and a dynamic programming approach to solve it under different time complexities. Additionally, we propose the first optimal priority assignment policy for NP-FP gang schedulability tests. Our proposed schedulability analysis and optimal priority assignment policy are evaluated through extensive experiments, including both synthetic task sets and a case study using DNN benchmarks on commercial off-the-shelf Edge TPU accelerators. The results demonstrate that the proposed approaches effectively enhance the state-of-the-art global NP-FP gang schedulability tests, achieving improvements of up to 57.9% for synthetic task sets and 76.7% for Edge TPU benchmarks. Furthermore, we conduct an ablations study to examine the impact of different algorithmic components in the proposed technique, providing valuable insights for future research.},

  abstract     = {Pretrained Foundation Models (PFMs) are regarded as a promising accelerator for the development of various Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications, and have recently been widely fine-tuned to satisfy users’ personalized inference demands. As many users are attracted to PFM-based AI applications, remote data centers are increasingly unable to solely bear the enormous computational demands and meet the delay requirements of inference requests. Mobile edge computing (MEC) offers a viable solution for delivering low-latency inference services by pulling fine-tuned PFMs from the remote data center to cloudlets in the proximity of users. However, a fine-tuned PFM typically comprises billions of model parameters, which are highly resource-intensive, time-consuming, and cost-prohibitive to execute at the edge. To address this, we investigate a novel joint large model selection and pulling problem in MEC networks. The novelty of our study lies in exploring parameter sharing among fine-tuned PFMs based on their common knowledge. Specifically, we first formulate a Non-Linear Integer Programming (NLIP) for the problem to minimize the total delay of implementing all inference requests. We then transform the NLIP into an equivalent Integer Linear Program (ILP) that is much simpler to solve. We further propose a randomized algorithm with a provable approximation ratio for the problem. We also consider the online version of the problem with uncertain request demand, and develop an online learning algorithm with a bounded regret. The crux of the online algorithm is the adoption of the multi-armed bandit technique with restricted context for dynamic admissions of inference requests. We finally conduct extensive experiments based on real datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that our algorithms reduce at least 38% in total delays and average costs, while achieving a 5% improvement in average accuracies.},

Beyond GEMMs, researchers have explored the potential applications of Tensor Cores in matrix factorization, such as QR factorization. However, the inside GEMMs in QR factorization are typically tall and skinny. Compared to compute-bound square GEMMs, these tall and skinny GEMMs are memory bound, leading to suboptimal performance on Tensor Cores. To solve this problem, we indicate the recursive QR factorization can convert the tall and skinny GEMMs to relatively square and large GEMMs, resulting in better performance on Tensor Cores. Besides, we extend the FP16 Tensor-Cores-based QR factorization to accommodate FP32 and FP64 on FP16 and INT8 Tensor Cores, respectively. Additionally, to address the issue of orthogonality loss in the preceding Tensor Cores-based QR factorization, we transition from the Gram-Schmidt to the Householder algorithm while preserving high performance. According to our experimental evaluation conducted on NVIDIA's A100 and GeForce RTX 3090 GPU, the precision levels of FP64, FP32, and FP16 are up to 6.22x, 8.67x, and 4.03x faster, respectively, than the current state-of-the-art implementations.},

  abstract     = {Transformer models have become widely popular in numerous applications, and especially for building foundation large language models (LLMs). Recently, there has been a surge in the exploration of transformer-based architectures in non-LLM applications. In particular, the self-attention mechanism within the transformer architecture offers a way to exploit any hidden relations within data, making it widely applicable for a variety of spatio-temporal tasks in scientific computing domains (e.g., weather, traffic, agriculture). Most of these efforts have primarily focused on accelerating the inference phase. However, the computational resources required to train these attention-based models for scientific applications remain a significant challenge to address. Emerging non-volatile memory (NVM)-based processing-in-memory (PIM) architectures can achieve higher performance and better energy efficiency than their GPU-based counterparts. However, the frequent weight updates during training would necessitate write operations to NVM cells, posing a significant barrier for considering stand-alone NVM-based PIM architectures. In this paper, we present HpT, a new hybrid approach to accelerate the training of attention-based models for scientific applications. Our approach is hybrid at two different layers: at the software layer, our approach dynamically switches from a full-parameter training mode to a lower-parameter training mode by incorporating intrinsic dimensionality; and at the hardware layer, our approach harnesses the combined power of GPUs, resistive random-access memory (ReRAM)-based PIM devices, and systolic arrays. This software-hardware co-design approach is aimed at adaptively reducing both runtime and energy costs during the training phase, without compromising on quality. Experiments on four concrete real-world scientific applications demonstrate that our hybrid approach is able to significantly reduce training time (up to $11.9\times$) and energy consumption (up to $12.05\times$), compared to the corresponding full-parameter training executing on only GPUs. Our approach serves as an example for accelerating the training of attention-based models on heterogeneous platforms including ReRAMs.},

  abstract     = {GPU clusters have been widely used to co-locate various deep learning (DL) workloads in a multi-tenant way. Although such resource sharing can significantly reduce training cost, resource contention and interference among co-located workloads make task scheduling very complex and challenging. To simplify the scheduling problem, existing algorithms usually divide the procedure of scheduling into two sub-tasks, i.e., task placement and resource allocation, and allocate resources according to pre-defined and fixed resource demands. However, such a paradigm significantly constrains the selection of potential scheduling solutions. In this article, we present MAIFS, a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning based scheduling algorithm that handles task placement and resource allocation integratedly, and allows fungible resource allocation based on resource sensitivity of DL workloads. The core of MAIFS lies in two mechanisms. The multi-agent attention mechanism is designed to learn and share inter-related resource state features observed from different agents, which enables agents to explore fungible resource allocation solutions. The dynamic coordination graph mechanism is designed for coordinating interactive task placement decisions of agents during integrated scheduling, so as to mitigate potential task conflicts. Simulated experiments using two large scale production DL workload traces and physical deployment experiments based on a Kubernetes based GPU cluster show that MAIFS can outperform state-of-the-art scheduling algorithms by up to 44% in terms of makespan and 46% in terms of job completion time (JCT).},

  abstract     = {Sharding is a promising solution to scale blockchain by separating the system into multiple shards to process transactions in parallel. However, due to state separation and shard isolation, it is still challenging to efficiently support smart contracts on a blockchain sharding system where smart contracts can interact with each other, involving states maintained by multiple shards. Specifically, existing sharding systems adopt a costly multi-step collaboration mechanism to execute smart contracts, resulting in long latency and low throughput. This article proposes Sparrow, a blockchain sharding protocol achieving one-step execution for smart contracts. To break shard isolation, inspired by non-local hotspot data caching in traditional databases, we propose a new idea of inter-shard caching, allowing a shard to prefetch and cache frequently accessed contract states of other shards. The miner can thus use the inter-shard cache to pre-execute a pending transaction, retrieve all its contract invocations, and commit it to multiple shards in one step. Particularly, we first propose a speculative dispersal cache synchronisation mechanism for efficient and secure cache synchronization across shards in Byzantine environments. Then, we propose a multi-branch exploration mechanism to solve the rollback problem during the optimistic one-step execution of contract invocations with dependencies. We also present a series of conflict resolution mechanisms to decrease the rollback caused by inherent transaction conflicts. We implement prototypes for Sparrow and existing sharding systems, and the evaluation shows that Sparrow improves the throughput by $2.44\times$ and reduces the transaction latency by 30% compared with the existing sharding systems.},

  abstract     = {In cloud data centers, the exponential growth of data places increasing demands on computing, storage, and network resources, especially in multi-tenant environments. While this growth is crucial for ensuring Quality of Service (QoS), it also introduces challenges such as fluctuating resource requirements and static container configurations, which can lead to resource underutilization and high energy consumption. This article addresses online resource provisioning and efficient scheduling for multi-tenant environments, aiming to minimize energy consumption while balancing elasticity and QoS requirements. To address this, we propose a novel optimization framework that reformulates the resource provisioning problem into a more manageable form. By reducing the original multi-constraint optimization to a container placement problem, we apply the interior-point barrier method to simplify the optimization, integrating constraints directly into the objective function for efficient computation. We also introduce elasticity as a key parameter to balance energy consumption with autonomous resource scaling, ensuring that resource consolidation does not compromise system flexibility. The proposed Energy-Efficient and Elastic Resource Provisioning (EEP) framework comprises three main modules: a distributed resource management module that employs vertical partitioning and dynamic leader election for adaptive resource allocation; a prediction module using $\omega$-step prediction for accurate resource demand forecasting; and an elastic scheduling module that dynamically adjusts to tenant scaling needs, optimizing resource allocation and minimizing energy consumption. Extensive experiments across diverse cloud scenarios demonstrate that the EEP framework significantly improves energy efficiency and resource utilization compared to established baselines, supporting sustainable cloud management practices.},

  abstract     = {Cellular automata (CA) are simulation models that can produce complex emergent behaviors from simple local rules. Although state-of-the-art GPU solutions are already fast due to their data-parallel nature, their performance can rapidly degrade in CA with a large neighborhood radius. With the inclusion of tensor cores across the entire GPU ecosystem, interest has grown in finding ways to leverage these fast units outside the field of artificial intelligence, which was their original purpose. In this work, we present CAT, a GPU tensor core approach that can accelerate CA in which the cell transition function acts on a weighted summation of its neighborhood. CAT is evaluated theoretically, using an extended PRAM cost model, as well as empirically using the Larger Than Life (LTL) family of CA as case studies. The results confirm that the cost model is accurate, showing that CAT exhibits constant time throughout the entire radius range $1 \leq r \leq 16$ , and its theoretical speedups agree with the empirical results. At low radius $r=1,2$ , CAT is competitive and is only surpassed by the fastest state-of-the-art GPU solution. Starting from $r=3$ , CAT progressively outperforms all other approaches, reaching speedups of up to $101\times$ over a GPU baseline and up to $\sim \!14\times$ over the fastest state-of-the-art GPU approach. In terms of energy efficiency, CAT is competitive in the range $1 \leq r \leq 4$ and from $r \geq 5$ it is the most energy efficient approach. As for performance scaling across GPU architectures, CAT shows a promising trend that, if continues for future generations, it would increase its performance at a higher rate than classical GPU solutions. A CPU version of CAT was also explored, using the recently introduced AMX instructions. Although its performance is still below GPU tensor cores, it is a promising approach as it can still outperform some GPU approaches at large radius. The results obtained in this work put CAT as an approach with great potential for scientists who need to study emerging phenomena in CA with a large neighborhood radius, both in the GPU and in the CPU.},

  abstract     = {Commercial embedded systems increasingly rely on heterogeneous architectures that integrate general-purpose, multi-core processors, and various hardware accelerators on the same chip. This provides the high performance required by modern applications at a low cost and low power consumption, but at the same time poses new challenges. Hardware resource sharing at various levels, and in particular at the main memory controller level, results in slower execution time for the application tasks, ultimately making the system unpredictable from the point of view of timing. To enable the adoption of heterogeneous systems-on-chip (System on Chips (SoCs)) in the domain of timing-critical applications several hardware and software approaches have been proposed, bandwidth regulation based on monitoring and throttling being one of the most widely adopted. Existing solutions, however, are either too coarse-grained, limiting the control over computing engines activities, or strongly platform-dependent, addressing the problem only for specific SoCs. This article proposes an innovative approach that can accurately control main memory bandwidth usage in FPGA-based heterogeneous SoCs. In particular, it controls system bandwidth by connecting a runtime bandwidth regulation component to FPGA-based accelerators. Our solution offers dynamically configurable, fine-grained bandwidth regulation – to adapt to the varying requirements of the application over time – at a very low overhead. Furthermore, it is entirely platform-independent, capable of integration with any FPGA-based accelerator. Developed at the register-transfer level using a reference SoC platform, it is designed for easy compatibility with any FPGA-based SoC. Experimental results conducted on the Xilinx Zynq UltraScale+ platform demonstrate that our approach (i) is more than $100\times$ faster than loosely-coupled, software controlled regulators; (ii) is capable of exploiting the system bandwidth 28.7% more efficiently than tightly-coupled hardware regulators (e.g., ARM CoreLink QoS-400, where available); (iii) enables task co-scheduling solutions not feasible with state-of-the-art bandwidth regulation methods.},

  abstract     = {It is challenging to scale parallel applications to modern supercomputers because of load imbalance, resource contention, and communications between processes. Profiling and tracing are two main performance analysis approaches for detecting these scalability bottlenecks. Profiling is low-cost but lacks detailed dependence for identifying root causes. Tracing records plentiful information but incurs significant overheads. To address these issues, we present ScalAna , which employs static analysis techniques to combine the benefits of profiling and tracing - it enables tracing's analyzability with overhead similar to profiling. ScalAna uses static analysis to capture program structures and data dependence of parallel applications, and leverages lightweight profiling approaches to record performance data during runtime. Then a parallel performance graph is generated with both static and dynamic data. Based on this graph, we design a backtracking detection approach to automatically pinpoint the root causes of scaling issues. We evaluate the efficacy and efficiency of ScalAna using several real applications with up to 704K lines of code and demonstrate that our approach can effectively pinpoint the root causes of scaling loss with an average overhead of 5.65% for up to 16,384 processes. By fixing the root causes detected by our tool, it achieves up to 33.01% performance improvement.},

  abstract     = {The increasing need for large-scale deep neural networks (DNN) has made parallel training an area of intensive focus. One effective method, microbatch-based pipeline parallelism (notably GPipe), accelerates parallel training in various architectures. However, existing parallel training architectures normally use equal data partitioning (EDP), where each layer's process maintains identical microbatch-sizes. EDP may hinder training speed because different processes often require varying optimal microbatch-sizes. To address this, we introduce UMPIPE, a novel framework for unequal microbatches-based pipeline parallelism. UMPIPE enables unequal data partitions (UEDP) across processes to optimize resource utilization. We develop a recurrence formula to calculate the time cost in UMPIPE by considering both computation and communication processes. To further enhance UMPIPE's efficiency, we propose the Dual-Chromosome Genetic Algorithm for UMPIPE (DGAP) that accounts for the independent time costs of forward and backward propagation. Furthermore, we present TiDGAP, a two-level improvement on DGAP. TiDGAP accelerates the process by simultaneously calculating the end time for multiple individuals and microbatches using matrix operations. Our extensive experiments validate the dual-chromosome strategy's optimization benefits and TiDGAP's acceleration capabilities. TiDGAP can achieve better training schemes than baselines, such as the local greedy algorithm and the global greedy-based dynamic programming. Compared to (GPipe, PipeDream), UMPIPE achieves increases in training speed: $(13.89,11.09)\%$ for GPT1-14, $(17.11, 7.96)\%$ for VGG16 and $\geq (170,100)\%$ for simulation networks.},

While existing parallel RL frameworks encompass a variety of RL algorithms and parallelization techniques, the excessively burdensome communication frameworks hinder the attainment of the hardware's limit for final throughput and training effects on a single desktop. In this article, we propose Spreeze, a lightweight parallel framework for RL that efficiently utilizes a single desktop hardware resource to approach the throughput limit. We asynchronously parallelize the experience sampling, network update, performance evaluation, and visualization operations, and employ multiple efficient data transmission techniques to transfer various types of data between processes. The framework can automatically adjust the parallelization hyperparameters based on the computing ability of the hardware device in order to perform efficient large-batch updates. Based on the characteristics of the “Actor-Critic” RL algorithm, our framework uses dual GPUs to independently update the network of actors and critics in order to further improve throughput. Simulation results show that our framework can achieve up to 15,000 Hz experience sampling and 370,000 Hz network update frame rate using only a personal desktop computer, which is an order of magnitude higher than other mainstream parallel RL frameworks, resulting in a 73% reduction of training time. Our work on fully utilizing the hardware resources of a single desktop computer is fundamental to enabling efficient large-scale distributed RL training.},

  abstract     = {Current deep learning compilers have made significant strides in optimizing computation graphs for single- and multi-model scenarios. However, they lack specific optimizations for asynchronous multi-task inference systems. In such systems, tasks arrive dynamically, leading to diverse inference progress for each model. This renders traditional optimization strategies based solely on the original computation graph suboptimal or even invalid. Furthermore, existing operator scheduling methods do not account for parallel task pipelines involving the same model. Task pipelines present additional opportunities for optimization. Therefore, we propose Task-based Operator Parallelism (TOP). TOP incorporates an understanding of the impact of task arrival patterns on the inference progress of each model. It leverages the multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm MADDPG to cooperatively optimize the task launcher and model scheduler, generating an optimal pair of dequeue frequency and computation graph. The objective of TOP is to enhance resource utilization, increase throughput, and allocate resources judiciously to prevent task backlog. To expedite the optimization process in TOP, we introduce a novel stage partition method using the GNN-based Policy Gradient (GPG) algorithm. Through extensive experiments on various devices, we demonstrate the efficacy of TOP. It outperforms the state-of-the-art in operator scheduling for both single- and multi-model task processing scenarios. Benefiting from TOP, we can significantly enhance the throughput of a single model by increasing its concurrency or batch size, thereby achieving self-acceleration.},

Although the lattice Boltzmann method is good at dealing with the complex boundaries, these sparse complex geometries cause the low computational performance and high memory consumption when the graphics processing unit (GPU) is used to accelerate the numerical computation. These problems would be addressed by compact memory layout, sophisticated memory access and enhanced thread utilization. This paper proposes a GPU-based algorithm to improve the lattice Boltzmann simulations with sparse complex geometries. An access pattern for a single set of distribution functions together with a semi-direct addressing is adopted to reduce memory consumption, while a collected structure of arrays is employed to enhance memory access efficiency. Furthermore, an address index array and a node classification coding scheme are employed to improve the GPU thread utilization ratio and reduce the GPU global memory access, respectively. The accuracy and mesh-independence has been verified by the numerical simulations of Poiseuille flow and porous media flow with face-centered filled spheres. The present algorithm has a significantly lower memory consumption than those based on direct or indirect addressing schemes.

Beyond accurately predicting the per-iteration training time of deep learning recommendation models (DLRM) models with random configurations with a geomean error of 5.21% on two multi-GPU platforms, our prediction pipeline generalizes well to other types of ML workloads, such as Transformer-based natural language processing (NLP) models with a geomean error of 3.00%. Moreover, even without actually running ML workloads like DLRMs on the hardware, it is capable of generating insights such as quickly selecting the fastest embedding table sharding configuration (with a success rate of 85%).},

Decentralized coflow scheduling frameworks are desirable for their scalability in cross-domain deployment but grappling with the challenge of information agnosticism for lack of cross-domain privileges. Current information-agnostic coflow scheduling methods are incompatible with decentralized frameworks for relying on centralized controllers to continuously monitor and learn from coflow global transmission states to infer global coflow information. Alternative methods propose mechanisms for decentralized global coflow information gathering and synchronization. However, they require dedicated physical hardware or control logic, which could be impractical for incremental deployment. This article proposes Slark, a decentralized deadline-aware coflow scheduling framework, which meets coflows’ soft and hard deadline requirements using only local traffic information. It eschews requiring global coflow transmission states and dedicated hardware or control logic by leveraging multiple software-implemented scheduling agents working independently on each node and integrating such information agnosticism into node-specific bandwidth allocation by modeling it as a robust optimization problem with flow information on the other nodes represented as uncertain parameters. Subsequently, we validate the performance robustness of Slark by investigating how perturbations in the optimal objective function value and the associated optimal solution are affected by uncertain parameters. Finally, we propose a firebug-swarm-optimization-based heuristic algorithm to tackle the non-convexity in our problem. Experimental results demonstrate that Slark can significantly enhance transmission revenue and increase soft and hard deadline guarantee ratios by 10.52% and 7.99% on average.},

  abstract     = {Edge storage offers low-latency services to users. However, due to strained edge resources and high costs, enterprises must choose the data that most warrant placement at the edge and place it in the right location. In practice, data exhibit temporal and spatial properties, and variability, which have a significant impact on their placement, but have been largely ignored in research. To address this, we introduce the concept of data temperature, which considers data characteristics over time and space. To consider the influence of spatial relevance among different regions for placing data, inspired by PageRank, we present a model using data temperature to assess the regional value of data, which effectively leverages collaboration within the edge storage system. We also propose a regional value-based algorithm (RVA) that minimizes cost while meeting user response time requirements. By taking into account the correlation between regions, the RVA can achieve lower latency than current methods when creating an equal or even smaller number of replicas. Experimental results validate the efficacy of the proposed method in terms of latency, success rate, and cost efficiency.},

In data centers, it is important to reduce carbon emissions while completing DL training jobs early. In this article, we propose GreenFlow, a GPU cluster scheduler that reduces the average Job Completion Time (JCT) under a carbon emission budget. We first present performance models for DL training jobs to predict the throughput and energy consumption performance under different configurations. Based on the performance models and the carbon intensity of the grid, GreenFlow dynamically allocates GPUs, and adjusts the GPU-level and job-level configurations of DL training jobs. GreenFlow applies network packing and buddy allocation to job placement, thus avoiding extra carbon incurred by resource fragmentations. Evaluations on a real testbed show that when emitting the same amount of carbon, GreenFlow can improve the average JCT by up to 2.15×, compared to competitive baselines.},

Additionally, the limited resource availability requires a trade-off between training performance and long-term costs, particularly in online settings. To address these challenges, this article presents a novel online approach to maximize long-term training efficiency in heterogeneous environments through uneven data assignment and communication-aware model partitioning. A group-based hierarchical architecture combining DP and MP is developed to balance discrepant computation and communication capabilities, and offer a flexible parallel mechanism. In order to jointly optimize the performance and long-term cost of the online DL training process, we formulate this problem as a stochastic optimization with time-averaged constraints. By utilizing Lyapunov’s stochastic network optimization theory, we decompose it into several instantaneous sub-optimizations, and devise an effective online solution to address them based on tentative searching and linear solving. We have implemented a prototype system and evaluated the effectiveness of our solution based on realistic experiments, reducing batch training time by up to 68.59% over state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract     = {Distributed graph analysis usually partitions a large graph into multiple small-sized subgraphs and distributes them into a cluster of machines for computing. Therefore, graph partitioning plays a crucial role in distributed graph analysis. However, the widely used existing graph partitioning schemes balance only in one dimension (number of edges or vertices) or incur a large number of edge cuts, so they degrade the performance of distributed graph analysis. In this article, we propose a novel graph partition scheme BPart and two enhanced algorithms BPart-C and BPart-S to achieve a balanced partition for both vertices and edges, and also reduce the number of edge cuts. Besides, we also propose a neighbor-aware caching scheme to further reduce the number of edge cuts so as to improve the efficiency of distributed graph analysis. Our experimental results show that BPart-C and BPart-S can achieve a better balance in both dimensions (the number of vertices and edges), and meanwhile reducing the number of edge cuts, compared to multiple existing graph partitioning algorithms, i.e., Chunk-V, Chunk-E, Fennel, and Hash. We also integrate these partitioning algorithms into two popular distributed graph systems, KnightKing and Gemini, to validate their impact on graph analysis efficiency. Results show that both BPart-C and BPart-S can significantly reduce the total running time of various graph applications by up to 60% and 70%, respectively. In addition, the neighbor-aware caching scheme can further improve the performance by up to 24%.},

  abstract     = {Modern data centers feature an extensive array of cores that handle quite a diverse range of jobs. Recent traces, shared by leading cloud data center enterprises like Google and Alibaba, reveal that the constant increase in data center services and computational power is accompanied by a growing variability in service demand requirements. The number of cores needed for a job can vary widely, ranging from one to several thousands, and the number of seconds a core is held by a job can span more than five orders of magnitude. In this context of extreme variability, the policies governing the allocation of cores to jobs play a crucial role in the performance of data centers. It is widely acknowledged that the First-In First-Out (FIFO) policy tends to underutilize available computing capacity due to the varying magnitudes of core requests. However, the impact of the extreme variability in service demands on job waiting and response times, that has been deeply investigated in traditional queuing models, is not as well understood in the case of data centers, as we will show. To address this issue, we investigate the dynamics of a data center cluster through analytical models in simple cases, and discrete event simulations based on real data. Our findings emphasize the significant impact of service demand variability, both in terms of requested cores and service times, and allow us to provide insight for enhancing data center performance. In particular, we show how data center performance can be improved thanks to the control of the interplay between service and waiting times through the assignment of cores to jobs.},

  abstract     = {The complexity of data management in HPC systems stems from the diversity in I/O behavior exhibited by new workloads, multistage workflows, and multitiered storage systems. The HDF5 library is a popular interface to interact with storage systems in HPC workloads. The library manages the complexity of diverse I/O behaviors by providing user-level configurations to optimize the I/O for HPC workloads. The HDF5 library exposes hundreds of configuration properties that can be set to alter how HDF5 manages I/O requests for better performance. However, determining which properties to set is quite challenging for users who lack expertise in HDF5 library internals. We propose a paradigm change through our H5Intent software, where users specify the intent of I/O operations and the software can set various HDF5 properties automatically to optimize the I/O behavior. This work demonstrates several use cases where mapping user-defined intents to HDF5 properties can be exploited to optimize I/O. In this study, we make three observations. First, I/O intents can accurately define HDF5 properties while managing conflicts between various properties and improving the I/O performance of microbenchmarks by up to 22×. Second, I/O intents can be efficiently passed to HDF5 with a small footprint of 6.74MB per node for thousands of intents per process. Third, an H5Intent VOL connector can dynamically map I/O intents to HDF5 properties for various I/O behaviors exhibited by our microbenchmark and improve I/O performance by up to 8.8×. Overall, H5Intent software improves the I/O performance of complex large-scale workloads we studied by up to 11×.},

  abstract     = {Information and Communications Technologies (ICT) are an increasingly important contributor to the environmental crisis. Computer scientists need tools for measuring the footprint of the code they produce and for optimizing it. Running Average Power Limit (RAPL) is a low-level interface designed by Intel that provides a measure of the energy consumption of a CPU (and more) without the need for additional hardware. Since 2017, it is available on most x86 processors, including AMD processors. More and more people are using RAPL for energy measurement, mostly like a black box without deep knowledge of its behavior. Unfortunately, this causes mistakes when implementing measurement tools. In this article, we propose to come back to the basic mechanisms that allow to use RAPL measurements and present a critical analysis of their operations. In addition to long-established mechanisms, we explore the suitability of the recent eBPF technology (formerly and abbreviation for extended Berkeley Packet Filter) for working with RAPL. We release an implementation in Rust that avoids the pitfalls we detected in existing tools, improving correctness, timing accuracy and performance, with desirable properties for monitoring and profiling parallel applications. We provide an experimental study with multiple benchmarks and processor models to evaluate the efficiency of the various mechanisms and their impact on parallel software. We show that no mechanism provides a significant performance advantage over the others. However, they differ significantly in terms of ease-of-use and resiliency. We believe that this work will help the community to develop correct, resilient and lightweight measurement tools.},

  abstract     = {The emergence of mobile edge computing (MEC) in distributed systems has sparked increased attention toward edge data management. A conflict arises from the disparity between limited edge resources and the continuously expanding data requests for data storage, making the reduction of data storage costs a critical objective. Despite the extensive studies of edge data deduplication as a data reduction technique, existing deduplication methods encounter numerous challenges in MEC environments. These challenges stem from disparities between edge servers and cloud data center edge servers, as well as uncertainties such as user mobility, leading to insufficient robustness in deduplication decision-making. Consequently, this paper presents a robust optimization-based approach for the edge data deduplication problem. By accounting for uncertainties including the number of data requirements and edge server failures, we propose two distinct solving algorithms: uEDDE-C, a two-stage algorithm based on column-and-constraint generation, and uEDDE-A, an approximation algorithm to address the high computation overhead of uEDDE-C. Our method facilitates efficient data deduplication in volatile edge network environments and maintains robustness across various uncertain scenarios. We validate the performance and robustness of uEDDE-C and uEDDE-A through theoretical analysis and experimental evaluations. The extensive experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly reduces data storage cost and data retrieval latency while ensuring reliability in real-world MEC environments.},

However, the approach could underestimate the actual usage of the underlying physical core for Simultaneous Multi-Threading (SMT) processors, leading to an overestimation of remaining resources. The overestimation propagates from microarchitecture to operating systems and cloud schedulers, which may misguide scheduling decisions, exacerbate CPU overcommitment, and increase Service Level Agreement (SLA) violations. To address the potential overestimation problem, we propose an SMT-aware and purely data-driven approach named Remaining CPU (RCPU) that reserves more CPU resources to restrict CPU overcommitment and prevent SLA violations. RCPU requires only a few modifications to the existing cloud infrastructures and can be scaled up to large data centers. Extensive evaluations in the data center proved that RCPU contributes to a reduction of SLA violations by 18% on average for 98% of all latency-sensitive applications. Under a benchmarking experiment, we prove that RCPU increases the accuracy by 69% in terms of Mean Absolute Error (MAE) compared to the state-of-the-art.},

  abstract     = {With its advantages in ensuring low data retrieval latency and reducing backhaul network traffic, edge computing is becoming a backbone solution for many latency-sensitive applications. An increasingly large number of data is being generated at the edge, stretching the limited capacity of edge storage systems. Improving resource utilization for edge storage systems has become a significant challenge in recent years. Existing solutions attempt to achieve this goal through data placement optimization, data partitioning, data sharing, etc. These approaches overlook the data redundancy in edge storage systems, which produces substantial storage resource wastage. This motivates the need for an approach for data deduplication at the edge. However, existing data deduplication methods rely on centralized control, which is not always feasible in practical edge computing environments. This article presents Ripple, the first approach that enables edge servers to deduplicate their data in a decentralized manner. At its core, it builds a data index for each edge server, enabling them to deduplicate data without central control. With Ripple, edge servers can 1) identify data duplicates; 2) remove redundant data without violating data retrieval latency constraints; and 3) ensure data availability after deduplication. The results of trace-driven experiments conducted in a testbed system demonstrate the usefulness of Ripple in practice. Compared with the state-of-the-art approach, Ripple improves the deduplication ratio by up to 16.79% and reduces data retrieval latency by an average of 60.42%.},

  abstract     = {We present a new framework for designing nonpreemptive and job-size oblivious scheduling policies in the multiserver-job queueing model. The main requirement is to identify a static and balanced sub-partition of the server set and ensure that the servers in each set of that sub-partition can only handle jobs of a given class and in a first-come first-served order. A job class is determined by the number of servers to which it has exclusive access during its entire execution and the probability distribution of its service time. This approach aims to reduce delays by preventing small jobs from being blocked by larger ones that arrived first, and it is particularly beneficial when the job size variability intra resp. inter classes is small resp. large. In this setting, we propose a new scheduling policy, Balanced-Splitting. In our main results, we provide a sufficient condition for the stability of Balanced-Splitting and show that the resulting queueing probability, i.e., the probability that an arriving job needs to wait for processing upon arrival, vanishes in both the subcritical (the load is kept fixed to a constant less than one) and critical (the load approaches one from below) many-server limiting regimes. Crucial to our analysis is a connection with the M/GI/ $s$ / $s$ queue and Erlang’s loss formula, which allows our analysis to rely on fundamental results from queueing theory. Numerical simulations show that the proposed policy performs better than several preemptive/nonpreemptive size-aware/oblivious policies in various practical scenarios. This is also confirmed by simulations running on real traces from High Performance Computing (HPC) workloads. The delays induced by Balanced-Splitting are also competitive with those induced by state-of-the-art policies such as First-Fit-SRPT and ServerFilling-SRPT, though our approach has the advantage of not requiring preemption, nor the knowledge of job sizes.},

  abstract     = {In the edge computing environment, app vendors can distribute popular data from the cloud to edge servers to provide low-latency data retrieval. A key problem is how to distribute these data from the cloud to edge servers cost-effectively. Under current schemes, a file is divided into some data blocks for parallel transmissions from the cloud to target edge servers. Edge servers can then combine received data blocks to reconstruct the file. While this method expedites the data distribution process, it presents potential drawbacks. It is sensitive to transmission delays and transmission failures caused by runtime exceptions like network fluctuations and server failures. This paper presents EdgeHydra, the first edge data distribution scheme that tackles this challenge through fault tolerance based on erasure coding. Under EdgeHydra, a file is encoded into data blocks and parity blocks for parallel transmission from the cloud to target edge servers. An edge server can reconstruct the file upon the receipt of a sufficient number of these blocks without having to wait for all the blocks in transmission. It also innovatively employs a leaderless block supplement mechanism to ensure the receipt of sufficient blocks for individual target edge servers. These improve the robustness of the data distribution process significantly. Extensive experiments show that EdgeHydra can tolerate delays and failures in individual transmission links effectively, outperforming the state-of-the-art scheme by up to 50.54% in distribution time.},

  abstract     = {Edge computing has been developed as a low-latency data driven computation paradigm close to the end user to maximize profit, and/or minimize energy consumption. Edge computing allows each user’s task to analyze locally-acquired sensor data at the edge to reduce the resource congestion and improve the efficiency of data processing. To reduce application latency and data transferred to edge servers it is essential to consider data sharing for some user tasks that operate on the same data items. In this article, we formulate the data sharing-aware allocation problem which has as objectives the maximization of profit and minimization of network traffic by considering data-sharing characteristics of tasks on servers. Because the problem is ${\sf NP-hard}$ , we design the ${\sf DSTA}$ algorithm to find a feasible solution in polynomial time. We investigate the approximation guarantees of ${\sf DSTA}$ by determining the approximation ratios with respect to the total profit and the amount of total data traffic in the edge network. We also design a variant of ${\sf DSTA}$ , called ${\sf DSTAR}$ that uses a smart rearrangement of tasks to allocate some of the unallocated tasks for increased total profit. We perform extensive experiments to investigate the performance of ${\sf DSTA}$ and ${\sf DSTAR}$ , and compare them with a representative greedy baseline that only maximizes profit. Our experimental analysis shows that, compared to the baseline, ${\sf DSTA}$ reduces the total data traffic in the edge network by up to 20% across 45 case study instances at a small profit loss. In addition, ${\sf DSTAR}$ increases the total profit by up to 27% and the number of allocated tasks by 25% compared to ${\sf DSTA}$ , all while limiting the increase of total data traffic in the network.},

  abstract     = {This paper introduces a novel Real Relative encoding Genetic Algorithm (R $^{2}$ GA) to tackle the workflow scheduling problem in heterogeneous distributed computing systems (HDCS). R $^{2}$ GA employs a unique encoding mechanism, using real numbers to represent the relative positions of tasks in the schedulable task set. Decoding is performed by interpreting these real numbers in relation to the directed acyclic graph (DAG) of the workflow. This approach ensures that any sequence of randomly generated real numbers, produced by cross-over and mutation operations, can always be decoded into a valid solution, as the precedence constraints between tasks are explicitly defined by the DAG. The proposed encoding and decoding mechanism simplifies genetic operations and facilitates efficient exploration of the solution space. This inherent flexibility also allows R $^{2}$ GA to be easily adapted to various optimization scenarios in workflow scheduling within HDCS. Additionally, R $^{2}$ GA overcomes several issues associated with traditional genetic algorithms (GAs) and existing real-number encoding GAs, such as the generation of chromosomes that violate task precedence constraints and the strict limitations on gene value ranges. Experimental results show that R $^{2}$ GA consistently delivers superior performance in terms of solution quality and efficiency compared to existing techniques.},
