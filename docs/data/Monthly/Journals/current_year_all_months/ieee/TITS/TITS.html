  abstract     = {Synchronous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) and autonomous navigation technology are fundamental to the intelligence and automation of robots and they represent important research directions in intelligent transportation. This paper proposes an enhanced mapping algorithm based on Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) to address the high precision demands of indoor robot autonomous navigation. The proposed system integrates a Kalman filter to fuse output data from multiple sensors, including a laser odometer, Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), and wheel odometer, achieving precise multi-sensor fusion for localization. Additionally, the system combines the A $^{\ast }$ algorithm with the pure pursuit autonomous navigation algorithm to optimize autonomous navigation performance. Visual information processing incorporates Yolov5 for data augmentation and scene recognition, thereby improving the system’s environmental perception. Experimental validation demonstrates an average mapping accuracy of 0.032 meters and an average navigation accuracy of 0.05 meters. The CPS architecture is highly effective for high-precision mapping and autonomous navigation in unknown and complex indoor environments, demonstrating the ability to improve localization and mapping accuracy in complex indoor environments.},

  abstract     = {Transportation Cyber-Physical Systems (T-CPS) enhance safety and mobility by integrating cyber and physical transportation systems. A key component of T-CPS is the Digital Twin (DT), a virtual representation that enables simulation, analysis, and optimization through real-time data exchange and communication. Although existing studies have explored DTs for vehicles, communications, pedestrians, and traffic, real-world validations and implementations of DTs that encompass infrastructure, vehicles, signals, and communications remain limited due to several challenges. These include accessing real-world connected infrastructure, integrating heterogeneous, multi-sourced data, ensuring real-time data processing, and synchronizing the digital and physical systems. To address these challenges, this study develops a traffic DT based on a real-world connected vehicle corridor. Leveraging the Cellular Vehicle-to-Everything (C-V2X) infrastructure in the corridor, along with communication, computing, and simulation technologies, the DT accurately replicates physical vehicle behaviors, signal timing, communications, and traffic patterns within the virtual environment. Building upon the previous data pipeline, the digital system ensures robust synchronization with the physical environment. Moreover, the DT’s scalable and redundant architecture enhances data integrity, making it capable of supporting future large-scale C-V2X deployments. Lastly, the DT’s ability to provide feedback to the physical system is demonstrated through applications such as signal timing adjustments, vehicle advisory messages, and incident notifications. The proposed DT is a vital tool in T-CPS, enabling real-time traffic monitoring, prediction, and optimization to enhance the safety and mobility of transportation systems.},

  abstract     = {Accurate and reliable traffic speed data prediction is crucial for Transportation Cyber-Physical Systems (T-CPS), as it directly impacts real-time traffic management, safety control, and overall system efficiency. However, existing deep learning-based traffic speed data prediction methods often require extensive training data and lack interpretability in their predictions. Although matrix and tensor factorization-based approaches enhance interpretability, the performance of these approaches is challenged in scenarios with extremely sparse observed data. These challenges greatly undermine the reliability of predictions and compromise the safety control of T-CPS. To alleviate these shortcomings, this paper proposes a Collaborative Bayesian Tensor Factorization (CBTF) method and applies it to the cloud-edge collaborative traffic speed data prediction scenario. By utilizing a shared factor matrix for collaborative tensor factorization, the proposed method can effectively predict missing data even with extremely limited observed data. For model learning, a posterior estimation method based on Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) is developed within a Bayesian framework. This approach not only provides point estimates for traffic speed predictions but also offers interval estimates, greatly improving the reliability and interpretability of the results. Extensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms several existing approaches. Moreover, collaborative learning experiments reveal the superiority of the proposed approach, particularly in scenarios with a large number of edge nodes in a collaborative learning framework, and each edge node’s data is extremely sparse. Finally, the evaluation of the prediction interval validates the reliability of the proposed method.},

A distributed intelligent trust management strategy (ITMS), is presented to mitigate potential internal attackers and false messages in VTCPS. Given the attributes of VTCPS, the system assesses the trustworthiness of vehicle nodes within the network with an enhanced subjective logic model that integrates both direct and indirect trust, thereby building trust connections among nodes based on their contact histories. The reliability of communications is assessed based on node trust and inter-node distance, while deceptive messages and malevolent nodes inside the network are detected according to the trust evaluation outcomes. To assess the efficacy of the proposed method, four distinct assault scenarios were devised, and comparative experiments were executed on the Veins vehicular network simulation platform to evaluate the performance of the ITMS scheme under diverse attack conditions. The experimental findings indicate that the ITMS scheme can proficiently counteract diverse attacks in VTCPS and can still detect the majority of fraudulent messages and malevolent nodes, even with a 40% ratio of malicious nodes. Furthermore, the efficacy of the ITMS scheme markedly surpasses that of the baseline scheme, which consists of a subjective logic model and a distance-based weighted voting mechanism.},

Invisible watermarking, which ensures reliable information traceability without compromising carrier quality, holds significant potential for TCPS. However, achieving high robustness in the real world while maintaining imperceptibility is a challenge. To address this, we propose DGWW (Dual-discriminator GAN-based WaveFusion Watermarking), a novel invisible watermarking method that balances robustness and imperceptibility. The GAN-based approach is well suited for TCPS, as it enables adaptive watermark embedding aligned with the dynamic and heterogeneous nature of transportation data, effectively handling diverse noise conditions and data types. DGWW integrates a WaveFusion Encoding Module, a Dual-Focus Discriminator, and a contrastive learning-based optimization strategy to enhance watermark embedding without degrading robustness. These components leverage multi-frequency information, assess local and global impacts on image quality, and guide model optimization. Experimental results show that DGWW outperforms state-of-the-art methods in visual quality and robustness under various noise conditions, offering a robust and scalable solution for image watermarking in TCPS environments. By maintaining data usability and strong resistance to noise attacks, DGWW advances digital watermarking in intelligent transportation systems.},

  abstract     = {Autonomous vehicles (AVs) offer a promising glimpse into a future where transportation is smarter, safer, and more streamlined. Nevertheless, as AVs continue to interact with conventional vehicles (CVs), the potential for increased complexities and challenges cannot be overlooked, such as the frozen robot problem. This study proposes a regret-based model for motion planning responsibilities, encompassing self-respect and courtesy for conflicting personal interests. By incorporating these reciprocal responsibilities, socially compatible driving behaviors are promoted, and uncertainties in behavior are also reduced. A Self-Respect-Courtesy (SR-C) plane is further introduced, illustrating the interaction intensity and tendency. To navigate the trade-offs of responsibilities in varying situations, the concept of environmental niche is provided. Niches help to characterize the outcomes of specific actions with the resulting conditions to fulfill responsibilities. Finally, a hierarchical multi-agent inverse reinforcement learning algorithm is designed to calibrate the proposed model with NGSIM highway lane-changing cases. We found that the proposed model can significantly improve the calibration results and reduce the predictions error of mandatory lane changes by up to 20%. Moreover, the cross-entropy error also significantly decreases in a stable stage, indicating that responsible actions can safely reduce the behavior uncertainties of interactions. Our research revealed that drivers prioritize courtesy responsibility in discretionary lane changes with more consistency, whereas their self-respect preferences are stronger but show more variability in mandatory lane changes. These findings provide valuable insights into the underlying mechanism of interactions.},

  abstract     = {In underwater acoustic sensor networks (UASNs), source nodes serving as data centers hold significant commercial value and strategic importance, and the leakage of their location information may result in immeasurable negative consequences. Presently, the methods employed to protect the location privacy of source nodes within UASNs face challenges such as limited network security duration, high node energy consumption, and prolonged data transmission delays. Additionally, security research has predominantly focused on passive attacks, with insufficient provisions against active threats. To address these issues, this study proposes a polygonal phantom source position privacy protection algorithm based on a secure zone (PPSZ) in autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV)-aided UASNs. First, a polygonal secure zone is defined with the source node at its center. Phantom nodes are strategically selected from nodes situated outside this zone, leveraging the relative angles between nodes to deter passive attacks while mitigating data transmission delays. Next, the selection of relay nodes is optimized using the Q-learning algorithm, where each node adjusts its selection strategy based on real-time feedback, further lowering node energy consumption. Finally, auxiliary nodes are deployed using a nonuniform clustering strategy to collectively transmit interference signals, effectively disrupt active attacks, and ensure the secure transmission of source data. Simulation results demonstrate that the PPSZ algorithm can better balance the relationships among safety time, node energy consumption, and data transmission delays.},

This methodology initially implements batch normalization techniques to enhance the training process of the deep neural network, subsequently utilizing the quasi-Newton method for optimization to successfully approximate the ideal answer. According to the experimental results, the QNRLO algorithm’s loss function and normalized computation rate have converged after 2,000 iterations, demonstrating the algorithm’s excellent stability and dependability. The findings demonstrate that the computational load and training time can be further optimized by appropriately adjusting certain parameters without compromising convergence performance. Furthermore, the technique incorporates system transmission time allocation into the TCPS model, hence augmenting the model’s practicality.

This paper proposes an Entity and Relation-Aware Cross-Modal Retrieval (ERA-CR) framework, addressing the limitations of traditional video retrieval methods in representing entity relationships and aligning complex semantics in traffic scenarios. In the visual modality, DETR3D and Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) are utilized to extract object-level features and construct spatial relationship graphs, capturing interactions among dynamic entities.

A Transformer-based dynamic multi-scale fusion module integrates global and local features, facilitating fine-grained semantic alignment. Additionally, a contrastive learning-based alignment loss ensures robust consistency in the shared embedding space. Experiments on the NuScenes dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of ERA-CR, achieving R@1 of 62.7% and MAP of 75.6%, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art baselines.

However, these systems face significant challenges, such as computational complexity and the ability to handle ambiguous inputs like shadows in complex environments. This paper introduces a Quantum Deep Convolutional Neural Network (QDCNN) designed to enhance the safety and reliability of CPS in transportation by leveraging quantum algorithms. At the core of QDCNN is the UU $\dagger $ method, which is utilized to improve shadow detection through a propagation algorithm that trains the centroid value with preprocessing and postprocessing operations to classify shadow regions in images accurately. The proposed QDCNN is evaluated on three datasets on normal conditions and one road affected by rain to test its robustness. It outperforms existing methods in terms of computational efficiency, achieving a shadow detection time of just 0.0049352 seconds, faster than classical algorithms like intensity-based thresholding (0.03 seconds), chromaticity-based shadow detection (1.47 seconds), and local binary pattern techniques (2.05 seconds). This remarkable speed, superior accuracy, and noise resilience demonstrate QDCNN’s —key factors for safe navigation in autonomous transportation in real-time. This research demonstrates the potential of quantum-enhanced models in addressing critical limitations of classical methods, contributing to more dependable and robust autonomous transportation systems within the CPS framework.},

  abstract     = {Digital twins-enabled transportation cyber-physical systems are employed in the transportation sector to enhance environmental quality, mobility, and safety. They are digital representations of transportation networks, enable the simulation of these networks’ behavior under various conditions. They can be employed in various transportation sectors, including forecasting traffic congestion, facilitate the optimization of flow and safety, enhance the efficiency of public transportation, improve the efficiency of freight transportation by offering support in this process, facilitates the consideration of future multimodal infrastructure development requirements, furnish drivers with up-to-date information about weather alerts, road closures, and traffic situations in real time, assess numerous aspects like, impacts of various mobility operators, transport users, and environmental conditions. However, the real-time data synchronization in digital twins-enabled transportation cyber-physical systems is accomplished using an open communication channel. Regrettably, the utilization of virtual-reality synthesizing security threats in the network necessitates the implementation of stringent privacy and security procedures, including authentication, encryption, and signature approaches. This study proposes a quantum-key-distribution (QKD)-based authentication protocol for secure communication of digital twins-enabled transportation cyber-physical systems. The integrated quantum in the system ensures the compactness and verifiability of data. The protocol’s security is examined using the Scyhter tool and is verified to be secure by informal security analysis. The proposed scheme achieves its efficiency over current solutions. Moreover, the latest technology and techniques are used to examine the operational capabilities and security features.},

However, the increasing interconnectedness of T-CPS exposes them to sophisticated cyberattacks, necessitating robust intrusion detection systems (IDS) to safeguard against evolving threats. This paper aims to enhance the security of T-CPS by addressing two key challenges: effective anomaly detection and handling imbalanced datasets in intrusion detection tasks. In this paper, we propose ReMeNet (Reconstruction Memory Network), a novel intrusion detection model that combines a memory module with a GAN-based architecture to enhance anomaly detection and data reconstruction. To address the challenge of imbalanced datasets, we incorporate a Vector Quantized Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network (VQ-WGAN) to generate additional samples for underrepresented attack categories, thereby balancing the dataset and improving detection performance. Experimental evaluation on the UNSW-NB15 dataset demonstrates that ReMeNet achieves an accuracy of 91.70%, and an F1-score of 91.63% which outperforms Random Forest by 8.02% and EC-GAN by 3.01%. The results show that ReMeNet effectively handles imbalanced data, improving detection rates across all attack categories in T-CPS.},

  abstract     = {In transportation cyber-physical systems, real-time calculations of crowd density can provide traffic managers with important decision support to help optimise traffic flow and prevent congestion and safety accidents. However, crowd density estimation in complex traffic scenarios requires a comprehensive response to the challenges of background noise interference, dense occlusion, and scale variation. To address these issues, we propose a novel cross-level attention multi-scale context-enhanced crowd counting network (CAMCNet). First, we explore the feasibility of the ResNeXt network as a backbone for crowd counting. The residual structure of the ResNeXt model facilitates the generation of hierarchical scale features. Second, the high-level features extracted by this backbone lack detailed information, hindering the acquisition of accurate spatial location information of the crowd. Therefore, we present a high-level feature enhancement module to further refine the perception of multi-scale context and orientation features. Third, we design a cross-level attention feature fusion module to adaptively aggregate enhanced deep features and shallow features to better cope with the challenges of complex background interference and scale variations simultaneously. Finally, to enhance the robustness of network training, we introduce smooth L1 loss into the overall loss function. On four benchmark datasets, extensive experiments show that CAMCNet outperforms the vast majority of the most advanced methods. In particular, CAMCNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on two large-scale mainstream benchmarks (UCF-QNRF and NWPU) in terms of the MAE.},

  abstract     = {Driver fatigue detection is a critical challenge in Transportation Cyber-Physical Systems (T-CPS), where existing methods often face significant limitations. Conventional approaches typically struggle with issues such as limited accuracy, slow convergence, and high computational costs. These methods often fail to capture the complex temporal and spatial patterns inherent in multimodal physiological signals, such as EEG and EOG, leading to suboptimal performance in real-world scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach that leverages Depthwise Separable Convolutional Neural Networks (DSCNNs) for driver fatigue detection. Our method integrates electroencephalogram (EEG) and electrooculogram (EOG) signals through an innovative feature extraction and fusion process, enhancing the system’s ability to detect fatigue with high accuracy and efficiency. The DSCNN model is designed to overcome the limitations of traditional methods by utilizing depthwise separable convolutions, which reduce computational complexity while maintaining robust performance. We validate our approach using the SEED-VIG dataset and the NTHU drowsy driver dataset, which encompasses a range of driving conditions. The DSCNN model outperforms conventional models in both accuracy and computational efficiency. Specifically, DSCNN achieves the highest F1 score and the lowest time per epoch, making it highly suitable for real-time applications in T-CPS. This advancement represents a significant improvement in driver safety by providing more timely and reliable fatigue warnings, thus advancing the capabilities of intelligent transportation systems.},

These challenges stem from the multidomain nature of the IoV and threats such as data leaks and model-finding attacks, which complicate data processing and model training. To address these issues, in this study, we proposed federated multi-domain learning for IoV (FMD-IoV). FMD-IoV addresses data heterogeneity by employing clustered techniques to group similar viewpoints and multidomain machine learning to map diverse data types into a unified feature space. To address the system heterogeneity caused by diverse vehicle types, the framework introduces a similarity-based aggregation method and model weight de-regularization to enhance robustness and generalizability. Experimental results demonstrated that FMD-IoV reduced the mean square error (MSE) by 0.05 on the Synthia dataset and 0.13 on the CityScape dataset compared with the state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, it maintained or improved the MSE as the number of nodes increased, demonstrating its adaptability to complex scenarios and large-scale data.

  abstract     = {In the context of transportation cyber-physical systems (T-CPS), backdoor attacks leveraging traffic images have emerged as a significant security threat. As T-CPS increasingly relies on visual information, such as real-time images captured by traffic cameras, for tasks like traffic sign recognition and autonomous driving, the risk of image-based backdoor attacks has grown substantially. Although various detection-based defense techniques have shown some success in identifying backdoored models, they often fail to fully eliminate backdoor effects, leaving residual security risks. To address this challenge, we propose a Frequency-Domain Hybrid Distillation (FDHD) method for backdoor defense, which effectively weakens the association between backdoor triggers and target labels by combining distillation mechanisms in both the frequency and pixel domains. Furthermore, we design a loss function that integrates feature reconstruction with adaptive alignment, enhancing the student network’s ability to mimic the teacher network and thereby bolstering the backdoor defense capability. Extensive experiments conducted by FDHD on multiple benchmark datasets against the five latest attacks demonstrate that our proposed defense method effectively reduces backdoor threats while maintaining high accuracy in predicting clean samples. This approach will protect against image-based backdoor attacks in T-CPS and lay the foundation for enhancing future traffic safety.},

However, transportation cyber-physical systems often employ a highly centralized architecture, which inherently exposes them to the risk of single point failures. Moreover, the advent of quantum computing presents a formidable challenge, as quantum computers can exploit the parallelism of quantum bits and quantum entanglement to swiftly decrypt conventional encryption algorithms, thereby jeopardizing system security. Blockchain technology, distinguished by its decentralized and immutable nature, offers a robust foundation of trust for transportation cyber-physical systems. It mitigates the risks associated with centralized systems and quantum computing threats. In this paper, we introduce a supervised blockchain system tailored for transportation cyber-physical systems. Our proposed system harnesses the power of group signature techniques to leverage blockchain’s supervisory capabilities. To surpass the limitations of traditional signature schemes, particularly in the face of quantum computing, we present a novel post-quantum group signature scheme. Building on this post-quantum signature scheme, we unveil a controllable anonymous blockchain model equipped with a supervision mechanism. This model strikes a delicate balance between anonymity and control, making it an ideal solution for the unique challenges faced by transportation cyber-physical systems. The resulting blockchain system is not only secure and reliable but also adaptable and anonymous, ensuring its suitability for the intricate demands of transportation cyber-physical systems.},

The aim of this work is to develop a secure and efficient control method for EMS in transportation CPS (T-CPS) that can maintain optimal performance while defending against sophisticated, stealthy cyber-attacks. We propose a novel secure output-feedback control method for EMS (SOFC-EMS) in T-CPS that leverages the Kullback-Leibler divergence to characterize attack stealthiness and employs dynamic output-feedback control to maintain system stability and performance. Our approach utilizes ellipsoidal invariant reachable sets to analyze system behavior under various attack scenarios and optimizes controller parameters through convex optimization techniques. Simulation results show that the proposed SOFC-EMS method significantly reduces the reachable set volume, indicating improved system security. The method also performs better in practical EMS scenarios, reducing average ambulance response time and maintaining higher system safety scores under increasing attack frequencies. We demonstrate the method’s adaptability to different urban traffic patterns and attack intensities through consistent performance across various system parameters.

CPS integrates computational algorithms with physical components, offering advantages over traditional manual inspections, which are slow and prone to false positives, especially in complex environments. To address these challenges, this paper presents the LEE-YOLO model, a novel and lightweight solution that leverages drones within a CPS framework to enable efficient road crack detection. The model incorporates a streamlined network built upon the YOLOv8n model and introduces an innovative lightweight fusion structure, SGC2f, which uses grouped convolutions and linear operations to reduce model weight and complexity markedly.

Furthermore, the Efficient Multi-Scale Attention (EMA) module in the model’s backbone layer is designed to reduce redundant data and improve the extraction of relevant features. Experimental results demonstrate that the LEE-YOLO model outperforms YOLOv8n, achieving a 4.3% higher precision and a 4.0% improvement in mean average precision (mAP). Importantly, it achieves a 43.5% reduction in weight and a 39.5% decrease in computational demand, effectively balancing performance and efficiency.

  abstract     = {In the context of rapidly growing city road networks, understanding complex traffic patterns and implementing effective safety monitoring through advanced Transportation Cyber-Physical Systems (T-CPS) has become increasingly challenging. This involves understanding spatial relationships and non-linear temporal associations. Accurately predicting traffic in such scenarios, particularly for long-term sequences, is challenging due to the complexity of the data. Traditional ways of predicting traffic flow use a single fixed graph structure based on location. This structure does not consider possible correlations and cannot fully capture long-term temporal relationships among traffic flow data, thereby limiting the system ability to ensure safety and reliability. To address this challenge, we propose a novel traffic prediction framework called Attention-based Spatio-temporal Multi-scale Graph Convolutional Recurrent Network (ASTMGCNet). This study introduces a novel framework designed to improve prediction accuracy in dynamic urban traffic systems by effectively capturing complex spatio-temporal correlations through multi-scale feature extraction and attention mechanisms. ASTMGCNet records changing features of space and time by combining Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) and Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN). Its design incorporates multi-scale feature extraction and dual attention mechanisms, effectively capturing informative patterns at different levels of detail. This strategic design allows ASTMGCNet to effectively capture complex spatio-temporal correlations within traffic sequences, enhancing prediction accuracy. We have tested this method on two different real-world datasets and found that ASTMGCNet predicts significantly better than other methods, demonstrating its potential to advance traffic flow prediction and improve safety and reliability in T-CPS applications.},

Previous attempts to enhance security, such as dynamic anonymization and trusted key management, have introduced new challenges, including complex authentication processes, high resource demands, and inadequate privacy protection. To overcome these issues, we propose a lightweight and efficient authentication scheme that enhances vehicle privacy and security through a combination of signatures, pseudonyms, batch verification, and flexible certificate management. Our approach also employs Bloom filters to improve authentication efficiency, addressing the limitations of traditional certificate management systems that suffer from large lists and slow query times. The evaluation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme ensures comprehensive security by providing two-way authentication and guaranteeing anonymity.

  abstract     = {The rapid evolution of transportation cyber-physical systems (T-CPS) has led to unprecedented advancements in mobility and efficiency. However, ensuring the safety and reliability of these complex systems remains a critical challenge, particularly in verifying and refining their temporal behaviors. This paper presents a novel compositional approach for temporal behavior analysis and synthesis in safety-critical T-CPS, the safety-critical temporal analysis, and refinement for the T-CPS (STAR-TCPS) framework, which combines iterative compositional verification with L*-based learning techniques to analyze and refine timing behaviors efficiently. The method leverages the clock constraint specification language for high-level timing specifications and introduces a systematic refinement process to transform abstract requirements into implementable task models. The framework incorporates innovative constraint handling mechanisms tailored for T-CPS, addressing unique challenges such as vehicle-to-infrastructure communication delays and adaptive traffic management timing. Experimental evaluations, including a case study on an intelligent vehicle system, demonstrate STAR-TCPS’s superiority over existing methods. Results show significant improvements in verification time (up to 63% reduction), memory usage (44% decrease), and task generation efficiency (18-25% fewer tasks) compared to state-of-the-art approaches. The STAR-TCPS framework enhances T-CPS’s safety and reliability by enabling more efficient verification and refinement of critical timing properties, paving the way for safer and more robust transportation systems.},

  abstract     = {Ensuring the smooth operation of road traffic is a momentous target in Intelligent Transportation Systems, which can be expedited by a secure and reliable Internet of Vehicles (IoV). As prominent carriers of the IoV, intelligent vehicles (IVs), that bear the promising potential for alleviating traffic congestion, have become the core road traffic participants. However, the mixed-traffic environment escalates the risk of IVs, as the discretionary lane change behaviors of nearby human-driven vehicles may result in collisions with IVs, compromising the robust performance of the IoV. Recent studies have utilized advanced deep learning techniques to achieve proactive lane change intention prediction, including Recurrent Neural Networks and Transformer. Although attaining reasonable prediction performance, they adopt the data-driven paradigm, which excessively focuses on learning from data while neglecting the domain knowledge. Against this background, we propose to employ the knowledge-driven paradigm and design KLEP, a knowledge-driven lane change prediction framework. KLEP incorporates driving knowledge into lane change modeling, presenting the top-down hierarchical cognitive process of drivers when performing lane change maneuvers. Extensive experiments conducted on two real-world natural driving datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of KLEP. Compared to state-of-the-art lane change prediction baselines, KLEP consistently outperforms them and achieves average improvements of 6.2-7.1% and 53.0-67.2% on intention classification and intention forecast tasks across different datasets, respectively. We also validate that KLEP has strong interpretability that aligns with real-world physical laws in lane change scenarios and is lightweight enough to fulfill online prediction.},

  abstract     = {Interest in Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) has increased significantly with the development of 6G. Owning an extremely high transmission speed, 6G is able to support low-latency service for edge-intelligence applications by Machine Learning(ML) techniques. However, traditional centralized learning is not suitable for this scenario due to the requirement for users to upload local data to the server, which can compromise data privacy. To overcome this challenge, Federated Learning (FL) and Split Learning (SL), as progressive distributed learning techniques, have been proposed as a solution. They enable the training of ML models while preserving data privacy. However, conventional FL has poor convergence when data heterogeneity occurs, also fails to meet personalized demands. To address these issues, We propose a novel personalized Federated Learning(pFL) framework, which trains models in SL and collaborates in FL. It offers a personalized solution for each client while retaining a global solution for newcomers. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms other advanced baselines on benchmark datasets.},

This method is particularly suitable for adaptive cruise control (ACC) systems in cyber-physical system (CPS) environments, as it can effectively handle the dynamic uncertainty and external disturbances of the system. Thus, this paper develops a novel online adaptive $H_{\infty }$ control scheme for ACC systems. The main contribution of our study lies in achieving model-free learning by using the homotopy strategy, removing the necessity of prior model knowledge of initial stabilizing control policies, which has been a significant challenge in existing policy learning and ACC studies. This resolves a long-standing issue and enhances the applicability of our findings. For this purpose, a continuous time ACC system is first constructed with unknown system dynamics. Then, based a designed offline policy learning algorithm, a novel online policy algorithm based on system input-output data is introduced to solve the Riccati equation without any model information. Finally, experimental results demonstrate that the proposed control method significantly improves system performance, especially in terms of computational speed, it has improved by about 45% compared to classical reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm.},

T-CPS covers land, air, and underwater domains involving vehicles, drones, and autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), facilitating our lives and creating productivity. However, underwater T-CPS faces greater difficulties and challenges than the first two areas. On the one side, underwater equipment is generally expensive and thus requires a high level of safety. On the other side, the complexity of the marine environment causes uncertainty in the control. To address these challenges, this paper proposes an expert experience-enhanced control approach designed to enhance AUV reliability and safety. Firstly, we model AUV cluster control, including the complex underwater environment and cooperative control strategy, and refine this problem into a Markov decision problem (MDP) model based on the leader-follower strategy. Subsequently, a multi-agent reinforcement learning cluster control algorithm is developed on the framework of Centralized Training Distributed Execution (CTDE) to improve the learning and exploration capabilities of AUVs. Finally, we propose an expert experience-enhanced strategy that reduces the impact of non-smooth environments and also ameliorates the limitation of relying exclusively on rule-based experience. Experiments compare the linear and triangular AUV formation control tasks, and the proposed approach shows promising superiority and possesses sound stability in dynamically changing environments.},

This paper proposes a novel giant armadillo optimized model predictive controller (GAO-MPC) method for dynamically controlling the phases and cycles of traffic lights in a remote intersection. The GAO strategy is applied to enhance the parameters of the MPC. The goal of the effort is to create an enhanced, adaptable technology that could be acquired off-the-shelf, eschewing intricate and costly computational techniques that would make it more difficult to use in real-world situations. An IEEE 802.15.4-based WSN (Wireless Sensor Network) during actual traffic surveillance is combined into several MPCs, one for every stage, that operate simultaneously to create the suggested traffic light adaptive management system. Every MPC controls the turning motion of automobiles and continually alters the traffic light’s phase and green period. The suggested system integrates the pros associated with employing simultaneous MPCs enhanced effectiveness, tolerance for faults, and assistance for phase-specific management with the advantages of the WSN, including ease of installation and management, inexpensiveness, and adaptability. The GAO-MPC approach improves traffic flow, decreases vehicle paths, and adjusts dynamically to different traffic situations, making it superior to conventional fuzzy logic controller (FLC) and programmable logic controller (PLC) systems. The suggested technique outperforms the current alternatives in published research and opens the door for increased adoption because it drastically cuts down on car queues.},

Due to its open-access environment, vehicular networking presents significant security problems in assuring message reliability and vehicle trustworthiness. To overcome this problem, this study proposes a framework for managing trust in cars for safe transportation in cyber-physical systems (T-CPS). This framework builds on existing blockchain-based trust management systems to address issues with scalability and ineffective consensus approaches. The framework is divided into three modules: message trust evaluation, vehicle trust update, and trust block generation and agreement. The message trust evaluation module evaluates message reliability by taking into account both direct and indirect vehicle trust over T-CPS. This assessment leads to the identification of misleading messages originating from malicious nodes. Within the T-CPS trust update module, the aim is to mitigate any malicious actions vehicles perform successfully by adjusting the level of trust assigned to each vehicle in T-CPS, which is determined by evaluating the messages received and considering the vehicle’s past behaviour. Ultimately, the effectiveness of the framework is confirmed through simulation studies. The experimental results show clear enhancements in scalability and resilience using the proposed algorithm.},

  abstract     = {Safety is of vital importance to transportation cyber-physical systems (T-CPS). With the deeper integration of automated vehicles (AVs) in road traffic, safe control algorithms for AVs have become a crucial demand for maintaining the overall safety of T-CPS. One of the major concerns with respect to the DRL-based cyber systems of AVs is the lack of safety guarantees, which may cause physical collisions. Safe reinforcement learning (SRL) is a promising way to enhance the safety performance of traditional DRL. However, current SRL methods are designed in a time-triggered (TT) paradigm, where the controller is uniformly triggered in the time domain. Despite the safety enhancement, this TT-SRL paradigm lacks data efficiency in safety-critical scenarios, and most importantly, still cannot guarantee safety during the intervals between time steps. The main objective of this paper is to address the safety issue of the existing TT-SRL methods while improving the data efficiency by proposing an event-triggered SRL (ET-SRL) framework. In the proposed method, safety is guaranteed by designing an additional safe controller to correct the unsafe actions generated by DRL. Event-triggered control barrier functions (CBFs) are used to provide safety constraints in a discrete manner. A state and dynamics synchronization module is also designed to estimate model uncertainties considering both the state dynamics and the input dynamics. The proposed method is trained and applied in simulated car-following experiments. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated by comparison to both DRL-based and model-based baselines in both artificial safety-critical scenarios and a real trajectory dataset.},

  abstract     = {Planning safe and efficient trajectories through signal-free intersections presents significant challenges for autonomous vehicles (AVs), particularly in dynamic, multi-task environments with unpredictable interactions and an increased possibility of conflicts. This study aims to address these challenges by developing a unified, robust, adaptive framework to ensure safety and efficiency across three distinct intersection movements: left-turn, right-turn, and straight-ahead. Existing methods often struggle to reliably ensure safety and effectively learn multi-task behaviors from demonstrations in such environments. This study proposes a safety-critical planning method that integrates Dynamic High-Order Control Barrier Functions (DHOCBF) with a diffusion-based model, called Dynamic Safety-Critical Diffuser (DSC-Diffuser), offering a robust solution for adaptive, safe, and multi-task driving in signal-free intersections. The DSC-Diffuser leverages task-guided planning to enhance efficiency, allowing the simultaneous learning of multiple driving tasks from real-world expert demonstrations. Moreover, the incorporation of goal-oriented constraints significantly reduces displacement errors, ensuring precise trajectory execution. To further ensure driving safety in dynamic environments, the proposed DHOCBF framework dynamically adjusts to account for the movements of surrounding vehicles, offering enhanced adaptability and reduce the conservatism compared to traditional control barrier functions. Validity evaluations of DHOCBF, conducted through numerical simulations, demonstrate its robustness in adapting to variations in obstacle velocities, sizes, uncertainties, and locations, effectively maintaining driving safety across a wide range of complex and uncertain scenarios.

  abstract     = {Formation control of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) has been regarded as the basis of many sophisticated marine missions. However, the complex marine environment and the weak acoustic communication on AUVs make it hard to achieve the formation task. This paper attempts to overcome the above challenge from graph theory and intelligent learning perspectives. A local topology estimator is first designed by observing the coupled state evolution of AUVs, such that the unknown interaction relationship of AUVs can be inferred on the basic of local sensing. Based on this, we adopt the graph direction and contraction to generate an optimally persistent topology for AUVs, whose aim is to reduce the communication redundancy and guarantee the topology connectivity. With the optimized network topology, a model-free inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) formation controller is developed for AUVs to keep the desired formation shape. The innovations can be summarized as follows: 1) the local topology estimator can reveal the interaction topology relationship of AUVs with multiple degrees of freedom (DOF); 2) the optimally persistent topology can balance energy efficiency and topology connectivity as compared to the neighboring rule-based solutions; 3) the IRL-based formation controller has better adaptability to the underwater unknown environment as compared to the traditional reinforcement learning solutions. Finally, simulation and experimental results are both conducted to verify the effectiveness of our solution.},

  abstract     = {This paper addresses the challenges of Last Mile Delivery (LMD) in crowdsourced platforms under time and budget constraints. LMD service providers face a continuous increase in demand with limited resources, such as workers and budgets. With tasks that vary in urgency, limited resources often lead to task failures. Furthermore, the increasing number of requesters and workers complicates the governance of the LMD platform, making it difficult to maintain credibility, integrity, and transparency. Current LMD solutions generally focus on route optimization and service acceleration, overlooking the challenge of combined time-critical and budget-constrained tasks. This creates the need for an agile, accelerated, and decentralized LMD framework that can 1) handle tasks instantly upon submission, 2) motivate successful completion based on urgency, and 3) compensate for tasks with deficient budgets to fortify long-term success and avoid failure due to constrained resources. For this purpose, this paper introduces the first Blockchain Hybrid Crowdsourced Auction-based LMD framework (BHCA-LMD), which is designed to effectively manage time and budget constraints. Built on-chain for transparency and decentralization, the framework uses drones and ground vehicles as a hybrid delivery mode for their capabilities in speeding up deliveries. BHCA-LMD incorporates an auctioning system to alleviate failures due to limited budgets, with a feedback mechanism to prevent entities from abusing the platform’s profit for their benefit, ensuring the credibility and reliability of the framework. The evaluation shows an on-time task completion rate of up to 74% with the presence of malicious behavior and a 15% lower gas consumption compared to the closest benchmark.},

  abstract     = {Lane detection is a critical and challenging task in autonomous driving, particularly in real-world scenarios where traffic lanes can be slender, lengthy, and often obscured by other vehicles, complicating detection efforts. Existing anchor-based methods typically rely on prior lane anchors to extract features and subsequently refine the location and shape of lanes. While these methods achieve high performance, manually setting prior anchors is cumbersome, and ensuring sufficient coverage across diverse datasets often requires a large amount of dense anchors. Furthermore, the use of Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) to eliminate redundant predictions complicates real-world deployment and may under-perform in complex scenarios. In this paper, we propose Polar R-CNN, an end-to-end anchor-based method for lane detection. By incorporating both local and global polar coordinate systems, Polar R-CNN facilitates flexible anchor proposals and significantly reduces the number of anchors required without compromising performance. Additionally, we introduce a triplet head with heuristic structure that supports NMS-free paradigm, enhancing deployment efficiency and performance in scenarios with dense lanes. Our method achieves competitive results on five popular lane detection benchmarks—Tusimple, CULane, LLAMAS, CurveLanes, and DL-Rail—while maintaining a lightweight design and straightforward structure.

  abstract     = {Recent years have witnessed the growing popularity of e-bike sharing systems (EBSS) due to their enhanced riding comfort and suitability for longer rides, compared to conventional bike sharing systems (BSS). However, similar to BSS, EBSS also suffer from the spatiotemporal supply-demand imbalance. Additionally, the demand loss in EBSS could be caused by not only the shortage of e-bikes but also the insufficiency of battery power. Currently, operators address this imbalance by employing staff-driven trucks to relocate e-bikes and replace batteries, which is costly and environmentally unfriendly. This paper proposes a user-based relocation policy as a complement to the staff-based relocation, aiming to effectively mitigate current challenges. This policy incentivizes users to select e-bikes with more systematically favored battery power levels, taking both the future system states and user preferences into account. This approach aims to achieve better e-bike distribution and utilization across different power levels within the system. Specifically, a multi-battery-state Markov model is developed to estimate the utilities of incentivized relocations, utilizing an approximate state reduction method to simplify high-dimensional calculations. Additionally, an optimization model considering user choice patterns is formulated to determine incentives and e-bike recommendations for concurrent orders, solved by a variable neighborhood search algorithm. Numerical experiments conducted on a real-world EBSS demonstrate that the proposed policy can increase profits by around 10% when implemented independently or integrated with existing staff operations, with only 1% of the revenue used as incentive costs.},

  abstract     = {Demand variations throughout the day and area popularity differences across the city result in spatiotemporal changes in traffic flow. One of the well-known phenomena arising from these changes is tidal traffic, characterized by an imbalance between inbound and outbound traffic on a given road. It reflects the fluctuation in the alignment between transportation system supply and demand. Lane reversal control has been a common supply-side measure for dealing with this urban traffic “sickness” by adapting road capacity allocation to the demand imbalance between two directions of a road. This study investigates the dynamic network capacity allocation control problem in the era of connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs), which integrates dynamic traffic signal splits and lane reversal controls. Considering the high dimensionality and non-linearity of urban transportation systems, we apply the sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) technique to construct a sparse yet sufficiently accurate surrogate model. This model estimates the forthcoming network traffic state based on the current state and implemented control decisions. The surrogate model is integrated into a model predictive control (MPC) method, forming a SINDy-MPC framework to assist in optimal decision-making in real time. The experiments show that the system identified by SINDy exhibits stability in the presence of Gaussian noise disturbances. The proposed dynamic network allocation control scheme can effectively reduce traffic imbalance, improve traffic efficiency, and enhance traffic resilience against cyberattacks.},

Subsequently, the obstacle area of each threatening ice floe is programmed considering the underwater portion. Then the ice floes avoidance guidance with auto-select mechanism for ice-zone traversal mission is constructed by setting the hazard threshold and target point. For the latter, a robust adaptive iterative learning control (ILC) system is designed for the path-following mission, where the control accuracy increases with the number of iterations. The stability of the closed-loop control system is proved with utilization of the Lyapunov theorem.

  abstract     = {Long-tail scenarios are of great significance in improving the testing efficacy of autonomous vehicles, but they are difficult to collect due to their inherent randomness and high risk. The low-cost, high-value videos of vehicle-perspective accidents stored in tachographs provide a potentially important source for long-tail data collection. However, the lack of multisource synchronization information and the unknown, diverse camera parameters in tachograph videos make it difficult for the existing methods to accurately extract key information. In response to these issues, this work proposes a vehicle-perspective accident scenario restoration framework based on tachograph videos. First, using preprocessed accident videos as the input, a scenario semantic understanding module was constructed to help extract the pixel trajectories, conduct parameter calibration, and obtain pixel road boundaries. Then, robust detection and tracking algorithms were used to extract the pixel trajectories. Furthermore, a high-precision calibration algorithm was proposed based on the Geometrically Salient Feature Bundle Adjustment (GSFBA). Finally, the camera parameters were used to perform an inverse perspective transformation on the pixel coordinates, the actual road boundaries were extracted based on the mapping strength of the pixel road boundaries, and the trajectory information was optimized using a systematic trajectory processing module. The proposed method was verified at multiple levels based on both two simulation scenarios and two real-world scenarios. The results show that the proposed framework in this work can obtain the key information of the scenario with a high degree of restoration accuracy. It was effectively applied to the restoration process of accident scenarios.},

Although most existing methods concentrate on learning continuous representations to gain valuable experience, they often suffer from computational inefficiencies and struggle with unfamiliar situations. To address this issue, we propose the Fragmented-Memory-based Trajectory Prediction model (FMTP) inspired by the remarkable learning capabilities of humans, particularly their ability to leverage accumulated experience and recall relevant memories in unfamiliar situations. The FMTP model employs discrete representations to enhance computational efficiency by reducing information redundancy while maintaining the flexibility to utilize past experiences. Specifically, a learnable memory array is designed by consolidating continuous trajectory representations from the training set using vector quantization operations during the training phase. The array further eliminates redundant information while preserving essential features in discrete form. Additionally, an advanced reasoning engine based on language models is developed to deeply learn the associative rules among these discrete representations. Our method has been evaluated on various public datasets, including ETH-UCY, inD, SDD, nuScenes, Waymo, and VTL-TP. The extensive experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves significant performance and extracts more valuable experience from past trajectories to inform the current state.},

First, the vehicle dynamics, which incorporate steering characteristics, are built to quantify human driver’s steering behavior. Additionally, the scenario-oriented driving constraints (SODCs) are established to demonstrate driving constraints from traffic participants, roadside obstacles, and traffic signs. Second, to enhance the rationality and reliability of steering behaviors, the human driver’s steering behavior is evaluated using a fuzzy logic strategy, and HSRL is proposed to simultaneously determine steering actions and allocate driving authority between the human driver and machine. The main advantage of HSRL is its ability to perform both continuous domain learning (CDL) and discrete domain learning (DDL) simultaneously. Finally, the proposed method is validated using a human and hardware-in-the-loop (HHiL) experimental platform. The comparison results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the comparison methods in terms of driving safety, comfort and experience.},

However, the widespread implementation of multi-CAV cooperative lane-change is hindered by the lack of efficient verification strategies. This issue is exacerbated by the “curse of dimensionality,” stemming from numerous scenario variables and complex algorithms. To overcome this, we propose an efficient verification strategy that accelerates the process through optimal feature selection. By eliminating variables that have minimal impact on evaluation outcomes yet significantly increase testing complexity, our approach streamlines the verification process, minimizing information loss while maintaining high efficiency. We validated this strategy in various urban and highway scenarios involving multiple CAVs. During the verification process, the dimensionality of scenario variables was reduced, resulting in an exponential decrease in the number of testing scenarios, with information loss limited to no more than 6%. The results demonstrate that our proposed strategy significantly improves the efficiency of verifying cooperative lane-change algorithms in high-dimensional scenario variables, with minimal loss of essential information.},

  abstract     = {Cooperative positioning (CP) is able to improve the vehicular positioning performance by introducing the data of multiple vehicles into the position estimation. However, CP methods are vulnerable to measurement outliers in dense urban areas. The existing outlier-resistant CP methods are easy to trap in local optimum and may wrongly reject the outliers when the ratio of outliers to inliers is relatively high. To deal with this problem, a factor graph optimization (FGO) based CP method using Graduated Non-Convexity (GNC) Welsch cost is proposed in this paper. The state-of-art FGO algorithm is used to integrate multi-node and multi-epoch measurements including the Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) pseudoranges, inter-epoch baselines estimated by GNSS time-differenced carrier phase (TDCP), and inter-vehicle ranging measurements in a centralized framework. The least-square cost in traditional FGO is replaced with the GNC-based Welsch cost so as to enhance the robustness of the proposed method to any kind of outliers in our CP system. The use of GNC can reduce the risk of local optimum by gradually increasing the non-convexity of the Welsch cost. The proposed method can de-weight the outliers correctly even if a large number of outliers exist. The experimental results show the superiority of the proposed method over the existing CP methods in resisting multiple outliers.},

  abstract     = {Appropriate interaction with human-driven vehicles is crucial for advancing autonomous vehicles from demonstrations in controlled environments to applications in open-road scenarios. Accurately recognizing and quantifying driver interaction behaviors is essential for understanding their interaction intentions and subsequently formulating suitable responses. Previous studies have primarily focused on the generation of interaction behaviors. However, insufficient attention has been paid to the recognition and quantification of driver interaction behaviors. We establish a higher-order traffic flow network and present mathematical definitions for driver interaction behaviors and their strengths based on this framework. Furthermore, we find that humans identify interaction behaviors during driving by perceiving conflicts between different drivers’ intentions. Therefore, we propose a driver resistance field model (DRFM) to characterize driving intentions and describe these conflicts through operations within the resistance fields, enabling the recognition of interactions. Through computational social experiments and real-world experiments, the DRFM is demonstrated to accurately quantify the strength of driver-driver interactions. The analysis of extensive cases indicates that the quantification from the DRFM effectively capture the dynamics of interaction behaviors, aligning with human cognition of driver interactions, with remarkably higher correlation coefficients compared to baseline methods.},

  abstract     = {While several methods for short-term traffic prediction have been proposed in the literature, modeling the interaction between short-term and long-term traffic dynamics remains a major challenge. To address this problem, we propose a deep learning architecture named High and Low Frequency Attention Network (HLFNet) with the capability to capture multi-scale spatio-temporal dynamics. HLFNet takes inspiration from the frequency domain analysis in signal processing, where short-term (fast) and long-term (slow) dynamics are characterized in terms of high and low frequency, respectively. Specifically, we design a multi-scale attention block considering multi-grained feature information at different frequencies. The attention block comprises: a high-frequency attention operation for extracting fine-grained information within a local window; a low-frequency attention operation for extracting coarse-grained information within average pooled features. To capture the spatial interactions within the traffic network, HLFNet further considers three spatial embeddings: distance-based, attribute-based and potential-based. Experimental results with real-world traffic datasets using different prediction horizons and granularities show that, no matter how state-of-the-art methods are good at predicting in the short term, they fail to capture long-term trends. On the other hand, HLFNet retains a consistent prediction performance in both the short and the long term, outperforming all tested state-of-the-art methods in long-term traffic prediction.},

  abstract     = {Route planning for a fleet of vehicles is an important task in applications such as package delivery, surveillance, or transportation, often integrated within larger Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). This problem is commonly formulated as a Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) known as the Team Orienteering Problem (TOP). Existing solvers for this problem primarily rely on either linear programming, which provides accurate solutions but requires computation times that grow with the size of the problem, or heuristic methods, which typically find suboptimal solutions in a shorter time. In this paper, we introduce TOP-Former, a multi-agent route planning neural network designed to efficiently and accurately solve the Team Orienteering Problem. The proposed algorithm is based on a centralized Transformer neural network capable of learning to encode the scenario (modeled as a graph) and analyze the complete context of all agents to deliver fast, precise, and collaborative solutions. Unlike other neural network-based approaches that adopt a more local perspective, TOP-Former is trained to understand the global situation of the vehicle fleet and generate solutions that maximize long-term expected returns. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the presented system outperforms most state-of-the-art methods in terms of both accuracy and computation speed.},

  abstract     = {Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs)-assisted Internet of Vehicles (IoV) utilizes flexible mobility of UAVs to improve communication issues in traditional IoV model. In UAV-assisted IoV, UAVs expand the communication coverage of roadside units (RSUs) and support the tasks of RSUs. Therefore, UAV-assisted IoV can contribute to the development of Intelligent Transportation System (ITS). However, an adversary can still attempt various attacks because UAV-assisted IoV networks perform wireless communication over open channels. In 2024, Miao et al. proposed an elliptic curve cryptography (ECC)-based authentication scheme for UAV-assisted IoV. Unfortunately, we discover that their scheme cannot prevent man-in-the-middle (MITM) and ephemeral secret leakage (ESL) attacks. Furthermore, Miao et al.’s scheme incurs high computational costs using ECC which is unfavorable for UAVs considering their computational restrictions. In this article, we propose a secure and lightweight authentication scheme for UAV-assisted IoV, considering the computational limitations of UAVs. We apply physical unclonable function (PUF) and fuzzy extractor to mutual authentication, developing the security level. Moreover, the proposed scheme uses only one-way hash functions and exclusive-or (XOR) operations which are compatible with UAVs. To prove the robustness of the proposed scheme, we perform “Burrows-Abadi-Needham (BAN) logic”, “Real-or-Random (RoR) model”, and “Automated Verification of Internet Security Protocols and Applications (AVISPA)” based formal security analysis, and informal analysis. Furthermore, we estimate the performance of the proposed scheme and compare with other relevant works, including computational costs, communication costs, energy consumption, security properties, and storage costs. Consequently, we establish that the proposed scheme is appropriate and efficient for UAV-assisted IoV.},

  abstract     = {In a capacitated vehicle routing problem (CVRP), multiple vehicles are planned to travel for serving customers so as to reduce transportation costs in logistics. Taking each CVRP as a task, multiple CVRPs can form a multi-task optimization problem. Based on the similarity between tasks, knowledge transfer methods are developed to improve optimization performance by utilizing the search experience of related tasks. However, existing methods tend to use one task only for knowledge transfer. Indeed, in a target task, the different parts of customer distributions are similar to that of multiple related tasks. The information of multiple source tasks can be fused to assist the optimization of target tasks. Thus, this paper proposes a genetic algorithm with fragment-based knowledge transfer (FKT-GA), which fuses route fragments from multiple related tasks to assist the optimization of target tasks. In FKT-GA, multiple source tasks are selected for each target task based on distribution features that are invariant to rotation, shift, and scaling. Solutions of source tasks are aligned to target spaces for sampling route fragments, which are integrated to construct high-quality solutions for target tasks. In addition, mutation and crossover operators are developed to enhance solution diversity. Experimental results on fifteen 6-task instances show that FKT-GA outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of solution optimality. The proposed FKT can improve algorithm performance.},

  abstract     = {Efficiency is critical for autonomous vehicles (AVs), especially emergency AVs. However, most existing methods focus on regular vehicles, overlooking the different strategies required by emergency vehicles to address the challenge of maximizing efficiency while ensuring safety. In this paper, we propose an Integrated Agile Decision-Making with Active and Safety-Critical Motion Planning System (IDEAM). IDEAM focuses on enabling emergency AVs, such as ambulances, to actively achieve efficiency in dense traffic scenarios with safety in mind. Firstly, the speed-centric decision-making algorithm named the long short-term spatio-temporal graph-centric decision-making (LSGM) is given. LSGM comprises conditional depth-first search (C-DFS) for multiple path generation as well as methods for speed gains and risk evaluation for path selection, which presents a robust algorithm for high efficiency and safety consideration. Secondly, with an output path from LSGM, the motion planner reconsiders environmental conditions to decide constraint states for the final planning stage, among which the lane-probing state is designed for actively attaining spatial and speed advantage. Thirdly, under the Frenet-based model predictive control (MPC) framework with final constraints state and selected path, the safety-critical motion planner employs decoupled discrete control barrier functions (DCBFs) and linearized discrete-time high-order control barrier functions (DHOCBFs) to model the constraints associated with different driving behaviors, making the optimization problem convex. Finally, we extensively validate our system using scenarios from a randomly synthetic dataset, which reveal that IDEAM improves average route progress by approximately 5.25% to 12.93% and increases average speed by about 4.5% to 9.8% compared to the benchmark method, demonstrating its capability to achieve speed benefits and assure safety simultaneously.

Recently, the task of text-based vehicle retrieval has garnered increasing attention, which is more applicable compared to image-based vehicle retrieval, i.e., vehicle re-identification. However, the text-based vehicle retrieval is also facing great challenges due to the huge semantic gap between images and texts. In this paper, we propose a novel method, called multi-level alignment over aggregation semantic graph with attribute enhancement (MAGAE), for text-based vehicle retrieval task. Specifically, we employ large language models (LLMs) and pretrained visual models to extract global vision and text feature embeddings, respectively. Then, an F-Encoder architecture is developed to dynamically integrate local and global features of vehicles. Furthermore, we design a co-attention learning mechanism to extract and enhance the robustness of vehicle attribute embeddings. Additionally, a multi-level semantic graph alignment module is introduced to effectively bridge the significant gap between vision and text through attribute aggregation and interaction. Finally, to improve the learning capacity of the network, we employ the merits of multi-task learning by incorporating four learning loss functions. Experimental results on the CityFlow-NL benchmarks validate the effectiveness of the proposed model. Findings of this study may assist urban traffic management, particular in providing guidance in capturing hit-and-run vehicles.},

The presence of time-varying traffic conditions and redundant traffic information may impede the efficiency and effectiveness of the vehicle-infrastructure system.

  abstract     = {Uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly employed for data collection in wireless sensor networks (WSNs) owing to their flexibility and real-time operational capabilities. However, effective UAV path planning remains a critical research challenge, requiring the design of optimal routes to efficiently complete data collection in WSNs. This paper introduces a novel constrained UAV data collection model tailored to address real-world challenges in this domain. Traditional mathematical optimization methods often face significant difficulties in derivation and computational complexity. Similarly, classical evolutionary computation (EC) algorithms are limited by their dependence on serial computations, resulting in substantial time costs. To address these issues, we propose a matrix-based differential evolution algorithm (MDE), leveraging matrix index operations to facilitate parallel computation and solve the problem efficiently. Given that existing matrix-based evolutionary computation (MEC) algorithms have limited applications in constrained optimization problems, we further introduce a constraint-guided optimization (CGO) method, enabling the MDE algorithm to inherently support constrained optimization. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed MDE-CGO outperforms other representative EC methods in optimizing the model of constrained UAV data collection from WSNs. Only our proposed approach successfully optimizes the model to generate feasible UAV paths in all the experiments. Moreover, a computational speed comparison highlights that the MDE-CGO not only delivers superior optimization performance but also achieves high computational efficiency.},

First, the design process of the quadrotor’s position and attitude controller based on the VP-DIMND method is presented. Second, theoretical analysis demonstrates that the VP-DIMND controller ensures rapid convergence and robust performance against various noise conditions, including bounded and unbounded noises. This is achieved through the use of variant-parameter multi-layer zeroing neural dynamics and double integral design mode. Finally, simulation experiments show that the VP-DIMND controller effectively enables the quadrotor track the given time-varying tasks in various noisy environments. Moreover, compared with similar methods, the proposed VP-DIMND method improves the convergence speed by about 40%, and the tracking results under the VP-DIMND controller outperforms the existing controllers, including convergence and robustness. These results also highlight the potential of the VP-DIMND controller for enhancing the stability and reliability of quadrotor in noisy environments.},

  abstract     = {The winter season worldwide causes serious driving issues due to heavy fog on the roads. In situations like these, having an intelligent transportation system is crucial for safe driving. Therefore, to ensure safe and stable driving in such a natural weather situation, this paper proposes a machine learning-based software-defined vehicular network (SDVN). The SDN main controller (MC) is responsible for selecting the optimal controller (OC) from among several local controllers (LCs). The OC is accountable for sharing the load with the MC and regulating vehicular speed by disseminating alarming messages (AMs) in the form of a speed reduction, lane change, and low visibility alerts. It is also responsible for providing optimal paths from source to destination, thereby ensuring the exchange of data between vehicles in such foggy weather conditions. OC and LCs assist vehicles in calculating link visibility time (LVT) to ensure stable links in the network. To guarantee safety, the paper considers two types of vehicles: normal and stubborn (who do not follow OC’s instructions). The objective is to enable all types of vehicles to travel safely in foggy weather. To achieve this goal and evaluate its validity, the scheme considers different cases following the selection of an OC and the optimal path. Considering different cases in foggy weather, our findings indicate that vehicles can demonstrate safety and stability in low visibility conditions.},

And comprehensive consideration of driving heterogeneity, decision synergy, and game interaction is also the cornerstones. Accordingly, this paper constructs a cooperative decision-making framework for autonomous vehicles (AVs) that integrates driving styles within a hierarchical architecture based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL). The upper layer adopts the action shielding mechanism-based dueling-double deep Q-network (D3QN) algorithm incorporating the lane advantages into shared state space to complete the prompt lane-changing (LC) decision, the lower layer applies the soft actor-3-critic (SA3C) algorithm based on the clipped triple Q-learning to provide the continuous speed adaptive control. Three personalized collaborative decision strategies are formulated for particular driving styles in multi-objective optimization preference combined with style-incentive prioritized experience replay (SIPER). The experimental results confirm that the proposed framework can satisfy the personalized driving demands in complex traffic scenarios, effectively explore the prospective LC opportunities, and enhance the driving efficiency by 35.40% with aggressive strategy and the comfort by 56.46% with defensive strategy compared with normal strategy, while maintaining the safety.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, deep learning has increasingly gained attention in the field of traffic prediction. Existing traffic prediction models often rely on GCNs or attention mechanisms with $O(N^{2})$ complexity to dynamically extract traffic node features, which lack efficiency and are not lightweight. Additionally, these models typically only utilize historical data for prediction, without considering the impact of the target information on the prediction. To address these issues, we propose a Pattern-Matching Dynamic Memory Network (PM-DMNet). Unlike traditional attention and graph convolution-based approaches, PM-DMNet employs a novel dynamic memory network that stores the most representative traffic patterns from historical data in a memory matrix through training. It captures traffic pattern features by comparing the similarity between the memory matrix and the current traffic state. This method not only achieves excellent predictive performance but also significantly reduces computational complexity to $O(N)$ . The PM-DMNet also introduces two prediction methods: Recursive Multi-step Prediction (RMP) and Parallel Multi-step Prediction (PMP), which leverage the time features of the prediction targets to assist in the prediction process. Furthermore, a transfer attention mechanism is integrated into PMP, transforming historical data features to better align with the predicted target states, thereby capturing trend changes more accurately and reducing errors. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed model over existing benchmarks. The source codes are available at: https://github.com/wengwenchao123/PM-DMNet},

  abstract     = {Vehicle trajectories from different directions within intersections intersect and create conflicts on a two-dimensional plane. Compared to highways, the lateral movement of vehicles within intersections is irregular and difficult to predict. This risk from lateral trajectories extends to the surrounding areas, impacting other vehicles within the intersection and subsequently reducing both safety and efficiency. To address this issue, a framework for identifying the conflict risk of vehicle trajectory based on lateral movement at intersections is proposed in this paper. Firstly, the concept of virtual lanes is employed to extract abnormal trajectories of lateral vehicle movement within intersections. Subsequently, a spatio-temporal hexahedral conflict detection algorithm, based on the vehicle border, is developed. Finally, the causes of abnormal lateral trajectories within intersections and their relationship with conflict events are discussed in detail, and hotspot areas of vehicle safety risks within intersections are identified. To validate the proposed model, typical intersection vehicle trajectory data captured by uncrewed aerial vehicles is utilized. The research results indicate that abnormal lateral movements of vehicles within intersections are common and pose significant risks to neighboring vehicles. The data reveal a specific pattern in the abnormal trajectory and trajectory density at intersections, with abnormal lateral trajectories of left-turning vehicles accounting for as much as 95.02% of cases. Furthermore, abnormal lateral movement in risky trajectories accounted for up to 86.6%. The proposed method in this paper provides support for intersection safety assessments, abnormal lateral trajectory warning systems, and real-time risk calculations for connected autonomous vehicles and Car2Car communication.},

  abstract     = {The increasing severity of traffic congestion has driven the application of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) in traffic signal control. It utilizes spatial states to interact with environments and develop control policy, which has been extensively studied and demonstrated to be efficient. However, the periodic fluctuations in traffic flow may produce states with the same spatial state but different trends. Relying solely on spatial states for interactions will mix up interactive experiences of these states, and bring instability to control policy learning for dynamic traffic flows. Moreover, many studies concentrate on vehicles as the main focus of traffic signal control, overlooking the demands of pedestrians, who are also vital participants in traffic. Therefore, this study proposes a distributed DRL traffic signal control method Graph Forecast-Vector Dueling Deep Q Network (GF-VDDQN) based on state vector. This method combines graph neural networks prediction and deep reinforcement learning, with the key idea being construction of state vector for agents to understand environments and learn policy accurately. Considering the principle of ‘people-oriented’, a comprehensive reward with green duration loss and vehicle waiting time is designed. A continuous duration control action set is introduced to enhance intersection utilization. Additionally, the distributed GF-VDDQN allows agents to collaborate with each other. To evaluate performances of GF-VDDQN, we conduct experiments in the SUMO traffic simulator, comparing it with advanced and traditional traffic signal control methods. Results show that state vector can assist agents in accurately understanding environments and avoiding experience mixture problem. GF-VDDQN performs superior than other methods.},

  abstract     = {With the rise of autonomous driving, LiDAR-based object detection using deep neural networks (DNNs) has shown exceptional performance. However, DNNs are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, especially on LiDAR sensors. Existing attacks face challenges in terms of (i) effective - they’re generally effective in white-box scenarios, but suffer significant performance degradation in black-box scenarios; (ii) robustness - they’re much less effective when exposed to the diverse changes in the real world (i.e., angle and distance changes); (iii) concealing - most attacks overlook the crucial stealth aspect, making them susceptible to detection and defense. To address these issues, LiDAttack is introduced as a robust black-box attack that leverages genetic algorithms with simulated annealing to precisely control perturbation points, ensuring both stealth and efficacy. Extensive experiments on KITTI, nuScenes, and a custom dataset demonstrate LiDAttack’s high attack success rate (ASR) of up to 90% across diverse detection models (PointRCNN, PointPillar, PV-RCNN++). Practical robustness is validated in real world tests, both indoors and outdoors. For concealment, the generated adversarial object volume is restricted to under 0.1% of the target object’s volume, achieving ASR up to 90%.

How to identify vehicle signals, classify vehicle types, and estimate vehicle speeds from DAS signals has significant potential for the development of intelligent urban transportation. Addressing the challenges of high-noise environments and dense traffic, we develop an end-to-end two-stage deep learning process to identify and classify various vehicle signals in urban traffic rapidly.

Then, the YOLOv8 segmentation model is employed to segment and classify the vehicle signal. Finally, the vehicle speeds are estimated using the segmented vehicle trajectory time and location information. We use the urban DAS field data recorded in the downtown area of Changchun to test the proposed workflow. The test result has good generalization and over 90% accuracy in identifying different vehicle types and speeds in high-density traffic environments. Moreover, transfer learning successfully applies the model to other datasets, proving its excellent generalization ability.

  abstract     = {Object detection is a critical component of autonomous vehicle perception systems. However, domain shifts between training environments and real-world scenarios often degrade detector performance. Cross-domain object detection aims to adapt detectors to unlabeled target domains utilizing only labeled source data. Recent popular cross-domain object detection methods employ the mean teacher framework, which uses pseudo-labels generated by the teacher model to guide training on unlabeled real-world data. Despite its effectiveness, continuous training with noisy pseudo-labels leads to abnormal performance degradation in the later stages of training. To address this issue, we propose a novel Hybrid Matching Teacher (HMT) framework for cross-domain visual detection transformers, which enhances cross-domain knowledge transfer across pseudo-label generation, filtering, and training processes. Specifically, we design a Feature Sparse Alignment (FSA) module to adapt DETR tokens and queries, generate domain-adaptive weights to initialize the teacher-student models, and mitigate the inherent initial source bias in the teacher model. Next, a Localization-aware Pseudo-label Filtering (LPF) module ensures high-quality pseudo-labels by considering the consistency between localization and classification tasks. Furthermore, to improve the efficiency of pseudo-label training, the Cross-view Hybrid Matching (CHM) module introduces an auxiliary matching branch to increase the number of positive queries that match with pseudo-labels. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming previous benchmarks by 3.1%, 8.5%, and 4.4% in adverse weather, diverse scenes, and synthetic-to-real, respectively.},

Most existing DRF models are established from the so-called birds-eye-view (BEV), which limits their accuracy for distributed vehicle-level tasks such as trajectory planning since the interactions between ego vehicle (EV) and its surrounding traffic environment have not been fully considered. To fill this research gap, we establish a novel DRF model from ego-vehicle-view (EVV) and apply it in trajectory planning in this paper. Firstly, the collision boundary between EV and its surrounding obstacles is defined by introducing the elliptical model to fully consider the geometry characteristics of vehicles. Secondly, the relative motion influence coefficient is designed to accurately characterize the relative motion between EV and obstacles, instead of using only basic driving state information such as location and velocity. On this basis, the unified DRF is established from EVV for driving safety assessment, which contains vehicle risk field (VRF) and lane marking risk field (LMRF). Based on the established DRF model, we then design a rolling trajectory planning method (RTPM) with a rolling horizon strategy, which not only ensures a long prediction horizon but also effectively reduces the computational complexity. Multiple simulation results under different traffic scenarios jointly verify the accuracy and applicability of the proposed RTPM and DRF model established from this new perspective.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a method for the joint detection and tracking of weak targets in automotive radars using the multi-frame track-before-detect (MF-TBD) procedure. Generally, target tracking in automotive radars is challenging due to radar field of view (FOV) misalignment, nonlinear coordinate conversion, and self-positioning errors of the ego-vehicle, which are caused by platform motion. These issues significantly hinder the implementation of MF-TBD in automotive radars. To address these challenges, a new MF-TBD detection architecture is first proposed. It can adaptively adjust the detection threshold value based on the existence of moving targets within the radar FOV. Since the implementation of MF-TBD necessitates the inclusion of position, velocity, and yaw angle information of the ego-vehicle, each with varying degrees of measurement error, we further propose a multi-frame energy integration strategy for moving-platform radar and accurately derive the target energy integration path functions. The self-positioning errors of the ego-vehicle, which are usually not considered in some previous target tracking approaches, are well addressed. Numerical simulations and experimental results with real radar data demonstrate large detection and tracking gains over standard automotive radar processing in weak target environments.},

  abstract     = {This paper studies the joint optimization of multi-objective dependent task scheduling, resource allocation, and service caching in an aerial-ground integrated mobile edge computing system that includes multiple uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs). These UAVs, in coordination with a high-altitude platform, work together to process numerous dependent tasks collected by the UAVs. The optimization problem involves two conflicting objectives that need to be minimized simultaneously: the average execution delay of all dependent tasks and the average energy consumption of all UAVs. The conflict between the two objectives makes the problem quite challenging. Recently, some multi-objective approaches, such as multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs), have been introduced to address dependent task scheduling. However, these approaches often suffer from premature convergence and tend to fall into local optima. To address these issues, we propose a modified MOEA based on decomposition that incorporates two performance-improving strategies. The first one is a probability-based neighborhood search strategy that selects two individuals to update neighborhood individuals based on the neighborhoods and external population, thereby improving population updating efficiency. The second one is a dynamic voltage and frequency scaling-based energy reduction strategy that further enhances the quality of solutions by adjusting the computing frequencies. Experimental results verify that the proposed algorithm obtains a number of outstanding nondominated solutions and achieves a better balance between objectives compared with several algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Accurately predicting whether pedestrians will cross in front of an autonomous vehicle is essential for ensuring safe and comfortable maneuvers. However, developing models for this task remains challenging due to the limited availability of diverse datasets containing both crossing (C) and non-crossing (NC) scenarios. Therefore, we propose a procedure that leverages synthetic videos with C/NC labels and an untrained model whose architecture is designed for C/NC prediction to automatically produce C/NC labels for a set of real-world videos. Thus, this procedure performs a synth-to-real unsupervised domain adaptation for C/NC prediction, so we term it S2R-UDA-CP. To assess the effectiveness of S2R-UDA-CP in self-labeling, we utilize two state-of-the-art models, PedGNN and ST-CrossingPose, and we rely on the publicly-available PedSynth dataset, which consists of synthetic videos with C/NC labels. Notably, once the real-world videos are self-labeled, they can be used to train models different from those used in S2R-UDA-CP. These models are designed to operate onboard a vehicle, whereas S2R-UDA-CP is an offline procedure. To evaluate the quality of the C/NC labels generated by S2R-UDA-CP, we also employ PedGraph+ (another literature referent) as it is not used in S2R-UDA-CP. Overall, the results show that training models to predict C/NC using videos labeled by S2R-UDA-CP achieves performance even better than models trained on human-labeled data. Our study also highlights different discrepancies between automatic and human labeling. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to evaluate synth-to-real self-labeling for C/NC prediction.},

  abstract     = {BEV-based 3D perception with multi-frame images input is crucial for autonomous driving. However, current methods for temporal BEV perception fail to fully utilize long sequence features because of local fusion or high complexity. Recently, Mamba, a powerful temporal modeling network with linear complexity, has shown exceptional performance in various 2D vision tasks, but its application to 3D perception tasks remains unexplored. Therefore, this paper proposes a general BEV perception backbone named BEVMamba, which is the first work to leverage State Space Model for 3D perception. Built upon the BEVFormer, to adapt Mamba for 3D perception we first add Hybrid Positional Encoding to the BEV features, enabling the networks to be aware of their spatial-temporal position. In the Temporal SSM block, the proposed 3D Factorized Scan ensures that historical BEV features are enriched with global temporal-spatial information. Subsequently, the Spatial-Temporal Corridor Fusion aggregates all BEV features in a physically meaningful manner, achieving precise feature fusion. The reliable BEV features obtained by BEVMamba are used for various perception tasks, including 3D object detection and 3D occupancy prediction. Results on the nuScenes and Occ-3D nuScenes datasets show that BEVMamba outperforms its baseline BEVFormer in both dense and sparse perception tasks and demonstrates competitive performance compared to other methods, highlighting the potential of Mamba in 3D perception tasks.

In view of the absence of exact model based information in real time, this study harnesses the inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) procedure to establish the reward function for the automation model using expert data. In contrast to existing shared control studies that focus on automation counteracting driver behavior uncertainties, the novelty of the proposed study lies in developing human-like behavior within the shared control environment. Additionally, to achieve the overall objective of human like driving, RL based approach is employed to generate the automation road steer angle and driver automation (DA) relative weights, ensuring fulfillment of lane-keeping, vehicle lateral stability, and driver comfort objectives simultaneously. The reward function formulated for generating the DA relative weights and the automation model is integrated with the human arm muscular characteristics of the driver behavior model in the RL framework to develop the optimal shared steer angle. Comprehensive evaluations were performed to compare the driving performance of the suggested RL-based shared control system with existing adaptive shared control methods. Simulation outcomes indicate that the proposed control technique outperforms others by closely replicating human driving behavior. Additionally, a hardware-in-loop (HIL) setup was employed to validate the proposed shared control scheme under varying longitudinal speeds.},

However, existing methods often struggle to simultaneously satisfy these two critical requirements. To address this issue, this paper proposes a sampling-based trajectory planning method with a hierarchical structure for formation flight in dense obstacle environments. To ensure reliable sharing of local sensing information among UAVs, each UAV generates a safe flight corridor (SFC), which is transmitted to the leader UAV. Subsequently, a sampling-based formation guidance path generation method is designed as the front-end strategy, steering the formation to fly in the desired shape safely with the formation connectivity provided by the SFCs. Furthermore, a model predictive path integral (MPPI) based distributed trajectory optimization method is developed as the back-end part, which ensures the smoothness, safety and dynamics feasibility of the executable trajectory. To validate the efficiency of the developed algorithm, comprehensive simulation comparisons are conducted.

  abstract     = {The integration of battery swapping station (BSS) with renewable energy further promotes the electric vehicle (EV) industry in urban governance. However, the complex uncertainty of the environment and limited information hinders the optimization of multi-action battery charging management in BSS. The current research also lacks consideration for renewable energy procurement actions. To address this problem, a dynamic simulation environment incorporating battery charging characteristics and transportation processes for BSS multi-action charging management is introduced. On this basis, a multi-step dynamic battery charging management model based on Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) is proposed. The goal includes cost reduction considering both price and carbon emissions, minimizing queue lengths and avoiding wastage of charging bays. First, a prediction module estimates the real-time energy price. Then, two decision modules sequentially determine the optimal reservation number of charging bays and the procurement of renewable energy. Unlike traditional methods, the model optimizes the charging management process across multiple actions, particularly in analyzing the impact of renewable energy. Additionally, equivalent energy price coefficients are proposed as a straightforward measure to assess cost disparities between renewable energy and grid energy. The proposed model enhances decision-making efficiency compared to classical methods and demonstrates stability and performance across various scales in experiments.

  abstract     = {Bus platooning on urban bus corridors can improve the efficiency of dedicated bus lanes and reduce energy consumption. However, due to the multiple routes operating on the bus corridor, bus platooning may induce congestion at the bus stops and disturb regular headway. To address these bus operational issues, this paper proposes a two-stage dynamic bus platooning model considering bus routes and provides safe and efficient trajectory planning for buses in each platoon. To solve the proposed model, a Particle Swarm Optimization embedded Dynamic Programming algorithm is customized to find the time of leaving and joining the platoon, and Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno Sequential Quadratic Programming method is used to control the trajectories of bus platooning in real time. Using the SUMO simulator, a real-world case study is conducted to show the effectiveness of the proposed method over traditional methods. The results show that the fuel consumption is reduced by 18.23%, operational efficiency is improved by 8.15%, and the average passenger waiting time is decreased by 5.73%. Sensitivity analysis reveals the impact of the number of routes, fleet size and stop spacing on system performance. The proposed dynamic platooning method outperforms the CACC method across different fleet sizes. Results show that the desired fleet size is greater than 60 buses, the stop spacing is greater than 500 m, especially in large cities or long-distance bus systems.},

The surrounding environment of the remote vehicle needs to be recreated for the teleoperator using video images received over wireless channels. To handle the significant time delays in receiving remote video data, this paper develops a predictive display system that uses deep learning to estimate the current video display for the teleoperator from old (delayed) camera images. First, old camera and Lidar data are fused to create a 3D reconstruction of the remote vehicle environment using conventional and deep-learning-based algorithms. Then the ego-vehicle’s real-time position and orientation variables are estimated using an extended Kalman filter. Predictive modification of the reconstructed old 3D scene is performed using the ego-vehicle’s estimated new trajectory variables. Deep-learning based image in-painting is used to improve image quality. Furthermore, this paper also introduces a new image comparison metric for evaluating the accuracy of the object detection and localization performance in the predictive display image. Real-world experimental data from the nuScenes and Kitti datasets are used for evaluation of the proposed system. The predictive display images are compared with ground truth images using various image comparison metrics and shown to provide significantly superior performance compared to the actual delayed images received over wireless channels.},

However, existing studies have not considered longitudinal-lateral slip dynamics, which affect yaw angle measurements due to general disturbances rather than Gaussian noise. This paper, therefore, aims to design an $\boldsymbol {\mathcal {H}}_{\boldsymbol {\infty } }$ optimal tracking formation control scheme resisting the unfavorable factors. Firstly, the event-triggered (ET) observers are proposed to estimate unavailable states and measurement disturbances, simultaneously such that the parameters are adjusted only when a triggering condition is violated. Secondly, a robust optimal control algorithm is built based on the development of a three-player zero-sum game theory and the integral reinforcement learning principle, where the control input player cooperates with the dead-zone compensation player to minimize a $\boldsymbol {\mathcal {L}_{2}}$ -gain consensus cost function while the external disturbance player tries to maximize it. The algorithm guarantees that the compensation laws of the dead-zone disturbance are approximated, and the largest unknown upper bounds to reject external disturbances are determined. In addition, the Zeno phenomenon and the persistence of excitation are excluded, and errors are uniformly ultimately bounded. Finally, the utilities of the observers and controllers are comparatively validated by the numerical simulation results of a networked ITS group.},

  abstract     = {In Part I of this study, we proposed a TSAGE-based horizontal federated learning (HFL) paradigm tailored for ride-hailing demand forecasting. While HFL allows ride-hailing platforms to collaborate on demand prediction without sharing data, it only expands the sample space and does not utilize complementary features from different providers. To address this limitation, in Part II, we propose vertical federated learning (VFL), which enables multiple platforms to share different feature sets for one client while preserving data privacy by homomorphic encryption. Furthermore, to guarantee data integrity and trustworthiness, we integrate a consortium blockchain framework that records data transactions and model updates, ensuring transparency and preventing malicious data manipulation. Through a case study, in addition to the two insights obtained in Part I, namely that the prediction accuracy is positively correlated with the ride-hailing demand volume and negatively correlated with the demand volatility, we have also discovered two new insights: compared to scenarios where each platform individually predicts ride-hailing demand, both HFL and VFL showed significant performance enhancements. Notably, HFL is slightly faster than VFL in training and inference, whereas VFL slightly outperforms HFL in the metrics considered in the case study. Interestingly, VFL provides more substantial benefits for ride-hailing platforms with lower demand levels (i.e., Lyft), demonstrating VFL’s capability to offer more equitable benefits across stakeholders, even under asymmetric data distributions. This underscores the enhanced accuracy and fairness properties of VFL compared to HFL.},

  abstract     = {The burgeoning demand for ride-hailing services, coupled with the complexity of traffic patterns, underscores the need for advanced demand prediction models. Traditional approaches often suffer from data silos, which prevent the effective utilization of big data separately owned by multiple ride-hailing platforms. In this study, we propose TSAGE, a novel spatiotemporal deep learning model that combines GraphSAGE for spatial feature extraction and Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) for capturing temporal dependencies. To enable privacy-preserving collaborative learning, horizontal federated learning (HFL) is integrated into TSAGE, so that multiple ride-hailing platforms are allowed to jointly train models without sharing raw data. Moreover, we implement HFL using differential privacy technique to protect data privacy by adding noise to the locally trained model parameters before sharing them with the central server. Through a detailed case study in New York City for Uber and Lyft, we found that prediction accuracy for each ride-hailing platform correlates positively with the volume of ride-hailing demand and negatively with the volatility in demand. Consequently, areas with high demand demonstrate superior performance, and larger platforms with less demand volatility also exhibit better performance. Moreover, compared to scenarios where each platform individually predicts ride-hailing demand, HFL showed significant performance enhancements. Additionally, compared with other HFL methods, the HFL applied with TSAGE can effectively address the challenges posed by the non-independent and identically distributed data across different platforms.},

  abstract     = {The integrated Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS)/Inertial Navigation System (INS) system has been widely used in vehicular positioning and navigation. However, the complex unstructured environments would lead to positioning degradation due to the GNSS outage. This paper proposed a Convolutional Neural Network-Long Short Term Memory (CNN-LSTM) assisted 21-dimensional GNSS/INS integrated navigation system using a Recomputed Method based on the Bias and Scale factor (BS-RM) error of the Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU). When GNSS is available, the obtained accurate GNSS/INS integrated navigation information is used as the input of the proposed BS-RM model to calculate the precise theoretical bias and scale factor error, which are trained as the target values of CNN-LSTM. When GNSS is unavailable, the trained CNN-LSTM is utilized to predict the accurate bias and scale factor. The consistent system positioning could be obtained with the suppressed INS error divergence by applying the IMU dead reckoning. To verify the performance of the proposed BS-RM model, three GNSS signal failure segments at different periods were randomly selected to evaluate the system. In addition, two GNSS failure segments were selected in the straight and curved roads respectively to further evaluate the performance of the CNN-LSTM assisted 21-dimensional GNSS/INS navigation system based on BS-RM. Compared with the traditional model of predicting position and velocity, the horizontal Distance Root Mean Square Error (DRMS) of BS-RM in the straight and curve tracks is improved by 83.85% and 88.06%, respectively, which confirms the improvement and consistent accuracy capability of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {The primary goal of an autonomous driving system is to achieve full autonomy by integrating the capability of adaptive decision-making across a wide range of driving scenarios. Despite recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) enabling the development of policies for adaptive behaviors, current solutions are typically tailored for specific driving scenarios (e.g., highway, tollgate) rather than providing a scenario-free solution. To address this limitation, this study focuses on developing an autonomous driving policy that can operate across diverse driving scenarios through a generalized decision-making model. Specifically, an autonomous vehicle learns a unified multi-task policy by utilizing a shared replay buffer across all scenarios, thereby enhancing sample and learning efficiencies. Furthermore, we adopt an offline-to-online RL approach to leverage both the sample efficiency of offline RL and the performance improvements of online RL. The proposed solution involves an algorithmic shift aimed at maximizing the objectives of each RL method, incorporating three key techniques: Q re-initialization, Q adaptation, and policy variance re-initialization. To validate our solution, we compare its performance with existing RL methods and analyze driving behavior using objective-aware and safety-aware metrics. Our findings demonstrate that the proposed solution achieves superior performance across most metrics, irrespective of dataset quality.},

  abstract     = {Urban rail trains frequently encounter various unexpected situations during operation, rendering the original speed trajectory inapplicable to the current scenario. In response to this challenge, this paper proposes a real-time optimization approach which adaptively adjusts train trajectories according to environmental changes. The approach, named Environment-Adaptive Double-Dueling-Deep Q-Network (EA-D3QN), consists of three parts: intelligent train operation (ITO) model, environment interaction, and value learning. First, the ITO model is established based on the Markov decision process. Its state encompasses external environmental information and train operation information to address various unexpected situations. Then, the environment interaction process is designed, proposing an adjustment policy for optimizing control commands to generate high-quality experience data that adapts to environmental changes. Finally, by constructing double-dueling-deep Q-networks to learn the value function, real-time generation of optimized speed trajectories is achieved. The effectiveness and environmental adaptability of the proposed approach are verified via simulations with the actual data from a Beijing Subway operating line. An optimal combination of hyperparameters is determined via sensitivity analysis.},

  abstract     = {Vehicular Ad hoc NETwork (VANET) refers to an arbitrarily distributed network that is an integral subset of an Intelligent Transport System (ITS) and plays a vital role in providing convenient transportation, improving traffic safety, etc. VANET realizes interactive communication through wireless medium among Vehicle to Vehicle (V2V) and Vehicle to Infrastructure (V2I). But, owing to the open/public communication nature of the wireless medium, it is often prone to different security threats. On the other hand, security is a significant aspect of the VANET framework. Thus, to address the security concerns, it is a common practice to establish an authentication and key agreement protocol among the communicating entities that ensures to provide the essential security requirements. However, after extensive literature survey, it is identified that all the existing authentication protocols are prone to different security threats. Moreover, the implementation of these protocols in real-world scenarios becomes impractical as it bears higher computation and/or communication overheads. Therefore, in this paper, we have proposed a trust-extended mutual authentication protocol for the VANET framework using a Puncturable Pseudorandom Function (PPRF). The informal and formal security verification of our protocol proves that it provides comparably higher security than the existing schemes. Further, our protocol is simulated using a well-known AVISPA simulation tool and the results show that our protocol is SAFE against replay and man-in-the-middle attacks. Additionally, in comparison to the existing literature our protocol provides higher computation and communication efficiency. Therefore, our protocol is reliable and secure for real-world implementation in the VANET framework.},

  abstract     = {Accurately interpreting regional traffic situations plays a pivotal role in emerging intelligent transportation systems, particularly in the evaluation of traffic states to realize the implementation of rational interventions. Nonetheless, existing studies face challenges when it comes to unveiling the complex nested interactions among multiple ships while simultaneously factoring in various influential elements for precise collision risk evaluation. This paper aims to develop a comprehensive methodology for collectively modeling, evaluating, and mitigating maritime traffic complexity, to enhance the comprehension of traffic patterns and guide anti-collision management in complex waters. First, a novel ship domain-based approach is proposed, incorporating individual ship attributes, relative bearing, ship motion dynamics, and restricted water geography to realize the accurate evaluation of ship-pair conflict risk. Subsequently, advanced motif structure-based indicators and a network disintegration model are merged to provide a thorough and nuanced characterization of the topological dependencies among multiple conflicts within a specified maritime region. Simultaneously, a comprehensive complexity evaluation approach, combining Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and a Fuzzy Clustering Iterative (FCI) method, is employed to achieve dependable parameterization and classification of traffic complexity levels. Finally, the collective impact of multiple interdependent conflicts on overall traffic complexity mitigation is investigated to support the identification of key influential conflicts that should take precedence in joint resolution efforts. Extensive experimental analyses based on Automatic Identification System (AIS) data are carried out to validate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology. These analyses demonstrate its applicability in accurately assessing conflict risk, hierarchically categorizing traffic complexity levels, and providing guidance for joint conflict resolution endeavors. Consequently, this methodology holds significant promise for bolstering the growth of intelligent transportation service systems and facilitating the automation of maritime traffic management.},

First, using the predicted trajectories at previous instants, the real-time states of VCTS are estimated from delayed states obtained through communication. Then, compatibility constraints are designed to regulate predicted control inputs, such that the error between the predicted and actual trajectories in the prediction horizon can be confined in a sequence of sets. Next, linear matrix inequalities are derived to tune cost functions, terminal sets and terminal controllers, which guarantee the stability and recursive feasibility of DMPC. Finally, experimental results demonstrate the performance of our approach in both cruising and speed-varying operations.

However, many studies overlook the significance of topological communications caused by the rapid movement of vehicles, privacy, and communication intentions. To achieve efficient task offloading when facing various topological link structures, we first propose a novel topological link-aware task co-offloading (TLCO) method designed for partially offloading in the joint V2V and V2I system.

Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed TLCO-DDQN algorithm in comparison to other Deep Reiforcement Learning (DRL)-based and Greedy-based approaches.

Although UAVs can significantly achieve enhanced flexibility and extensibility for large-scale intelligent systems, they result in a serious path planning problem. Especially in complex environments with a large number of irregular obstacles, UAVs have to efficiently find near-optimization flight paths and automatically move to target positions to finish the group task while avoiding collisions and satisfying various constraints. In this work, we focus on the cooperative path planning problem of homogeneous UAVs and present a multi-agent reinforcement learning-based approach to solve the problem. First, with the UAV and obstacle models, we analyse the collision avoidance, motion continuity, and energy consumption constraints in UAV flying, and formulate the cooperative path planning problem as a multi-constraint combinatorial optimization one with a high computational complexity. Then, inspired by the twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm where clipped dual Q-networks are used to decrease the overestimation error of critic networks, we propose a multi-agent reinforcement learning-based approach with a dual-centralized Q-network mechanism to automatically produce feasible and collision-free flight path for each UAV. Finally, simulation experiments are conducted in a multi-agent particle environment to evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approach.},

Differently, we propose a novel multi-view hypergraph OD demand prediction framework, which utilizes hypergraphs to associate multiple OD pairs from static and dynamic views simultaneously. In the static hypergraph view, we explore spatial-temporal correlations from three perspectives: points of interest, time series, and motifs. Among them, motifs can capture local higher-order network structures in the OD network. In the dynamic view, we utilize real-time OD demand as prior information to learn representations of multiple OD pairs directly and capture evolving spatial-temporal dependencies. Moreover, a gate mechanism and probability constraints are designed to enhance accuracy and reliability. Finally, experimental results on two large-scale ride-sourcing datasets from Hangzhou and Ningbo verify the superiority of our proposed model over seven baseline models.

  abstract     = {Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms have been proven to be effective in traffic signal timing scheme optimization and helpful for urban traffic congestion alleviation. Recently, the centralized control strategy has attracted great attention for coordinated signal control of multiple intersections overpassing the decentralized methods. However, this strategy has the problems of state space dimension disaster and credit assignment. Namely, the dimension of the global action space increases exponentially with an increase in the number of agents, and individual traffic signals cannot realize their contributions to the optimization of regional traffic. To solve the two aforementioned problems, this study proposes a centralized DRL algorithm for multiple signals using the sequential decision named the Sequential Light (SeqLight). First, a centralized DRL framework with a sequential-decision logic is constructed to decouple the joint actions of multiple agents, reducing the complexity of the action space to a polynomial level. Second, the multi-agent advantage value is decomposed into sequential advantage evaluations of every local agent, thus alleviating the credit assignment problem and improving the monotonic performance. Third, an adaptive optimization model for decision order is developed for traffic signal control, which coordinates the signal actions of local agents to learn the globally optimal policy. Finally, the proposed algorithm is verified by simulations using an actual road network. The simulation results show that compared to the other centralized RL method, the proposed method can reduce the average vehicle queue length by 12.64% and 14.20% under medium and high traffic demand conditions, respectively.},

The dominant USV chooses a motion control policy based on the responses of all following USVs, and then each following USV takes corresponding optimal responses to the dominant USV’s policy. This paper converts the ETRHS control problem to an event-triggered optimal synchronization control problem by designing novel value functions for the dominant and following USVs. Subsequently, critic-only structures are established and the ETRHS control laws of all USVs are obtained to form the Stackelberg equilibrium. In order to reduce the computing and communication burden, a novel event-triggering condition is designed for each USV, and the corresponding control law is updated when the condition is triggered. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that the developed reinforcement learning-based ETRHS controllers guarantee all following USVs synchronize with the dominant USV even when dynamic uncertainties exist.

  abstract     = {Understanding pedestrian behavior and predicting their intentions near roads are crucial for enhancing road safety and traffic efficiency. In intelligent transportation systems, especially where computational and energy resources are limited, real-time inference is vital. To address this, our study focuses on pedestrian skeletal information, which offers lower dimensionality and reduces computational demands. We introduce EffIntentGCN, a lightweight graph convolutional network designed to analyze pedestrian poses using a part-based graph and an adaptive graph, emphasizing features crucial for intention prediction and enhancing the learning of local and global interactions. An expansion layer added before each convolution block increases feature dimensionality for a broader representation, without excessive parameter increase. We further incorporate spatial-temporal joint attention, focusing on crucial joints in dynamic skeletal sequences. The model also integrates second-order information, representing joint connections, to provide complementary information. To balance model complexity with computational efficiency, essential for applications in resource-constrained environments like autonomous vehicles, we employ depthwise separable convolution and low-rank approximation techniques, aimed to reduce parameter count and maintain computational efficiency. The model is evaluated on the JAAD dataset, demonstrating its effectiveness in accurately predicting pedestrian crossing intentions while optimizing computational resources.},

  abstract     = {In the face of a sudden public health emergency caused by a new infectious disease, it is necessary to establish a multi-level emergency medical facility (including primary and superior facilities) to address the surge in medical needs. In this context, traditional hospitals are responsible for patient screening, primary emergency medical facilities are responsible for treating mild cases, and superior emergency medical facilities are responsible for treating severe cases. Against the backdrop of uncertainties such as patient self-referral and the autonomous progression of the disease, we address an important problem of integrated emergency medical facility location and patient dispatching under uncertainty and propose a multi-stage stochastic programming model to formulate the problem. For a deterministic model under a given set of scenarios, a Decomposition-based Dual-level Heuristic (DDH) algorithm is proposed to efficiently solve the problem, where the upper level employs tabu search to optimize the location scheme, and the lower level utilizes a patient allocation heuristic to provide an optimized patient dispatching solution. Numerical experiments are conducted using Wuhan, China, the epicenter of the COVID-19 outbreak, as an example. The results show that the DDH algorithm achieves high quality solutions close to those obtained by state-of-the-art solver CPLEX but with significantly reduced computational overload. The DDH algorithm is also compared with the progressive hedging algorithm and genetic algorithm, showing its superior performance in terms of solution quality and computational efficiency. Through extensive data analysis, valuable conclusions and managerial insights are obtained, providing useful references for emergency response in similar public health emergencies in the future.},

  abstract     = {Traffic flow forecasting is a strongly supportive component of intelligent transportation services. While in light of the expanding road networks or city grids, there is a critical concern to enhance both the accuracy and efficiency of prediction models. Despite the remarkable improvements in prediction accuracy, existing research continues to face three limitations in practical engineering scenarios. Firstly, current research often overlooks the time delay characteristics when capturing spatial relationships between global nodes. Secondly, most approaches have a quadratic computational complexity with respect to the number of nodes, resulting in significant training overhead and poor scalability. Furthermore, studies that do consider dynamic spatial relationships typically require complex model structures, resulting in higher computational costs. To address these issues, we propose a Time-Lag Aware Spatial-temporal Transformer (TLAST), a lightweight yet effective traffic flow forecasting model. TLAST introduces a cross-time strategy into the embedding stage and the attention extraction to capture the time-lag aware spatial-temporal features. Furthermore, we propose a Spatial Proxy Attention (SPA) module. It utilizes proxy representations to efficiently capture time-varying spatial dependencies with linear complexity, significantly reducing computational overhead. Extensive experiments on seven real-world traffic datasets demonstrate that TLAST consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving up to 7.84% improvement in prediction accuracy (MAE) while reducing memory usage and time cost by 85.21% and 75.14%, respectively. Results from the empirical analysis not only demonstrate the model’s efficiency and scalability but also highlight its practical usability in real-world traffic forecasting scenarios.},

  abstract     = {Connected Automated Vehicles (CAVs) have the potential to improve traffic performance on urban roads, especially at signalized intersections. Several studies have developed signal control strategies for isolated intersections considering CAVs’ capabilities. However, few studies have been conducted on complex applications such as arterials. Therefore, there are still several questions that need to be addressed. To our knowledge, existing strategies reported in the literature require long computational times which are not feasible for field implementation. This study proposes a novel computation-efficient joint optimization algorithm for signalized arterials to facilitate deployment. This algorithm enables both trajectory and Signals Phasing and Timing (SPaT) optimization in a fully automated environment. In the first level of optimization (trajectory optimization), the vehicles’ optimal trajectories are determined to form platoons with vehicles following the pre-determined saturation headway. The trajectories are built in a piecewise fashion respecting safety and comfort-related parameters. In the second level of optimization, the SPaT is adjusted according to a novel heuristic that weighs the deviation between the ideal and actual travel time for all vehicles. Comparing the trajectory optimization and joint optimization methods, both perform similarly in low-demand scenarios. However, for moderate-to-high-demand scenarios, the joint optimization method outperforms, reducing average travel times by 3 to 16%, and improving the green interval utilization. Generally, both the trajectory and the joint optimization methodologies achieve higher performance than the baseline scenario with conventional vehicles and a semi-actuated SPaT control.},

  abstract     = {When Automated Vehicles (AVs) navigate dynamic, interactive driving scenarios, they must consider the spatio-temporal layout of surrounding traffic, including social interactions among agents, to accurately predict their trajectories. Existing approaches often fail to handle complex inter-agent interactions with the necessary adaptive attention to dynamic contexts. This paper introduces a multi-agent trajectory prediction algorithm that leverages attentive spatio-temporal modelling to capture interactions among agents. Our approach integrates weighted Distance Graph Attention Networks (wDGAT) with dynamic attention assignment and Multi-Head Attention (MHA)-based Transformers to learn multi-headed social interaction patterns, preserving this critical information throughout the learning pipeline. This enables efficient aggregation of information from any number of neighbouring agents, allowing for robust processing of complex, time-dependent data and consistent retrieval of spatio-temporal knowledge across extended prediction horizons. We validate our model through extensive experiments on the NGSIM (US-101 and I-80) highway datasets. The results demonstrate that our approach consistently achieves the lowest prediction error over a 5-second horizon, producing diverse outcomes for different agents and outperforming state-of-the-art methods. Numerical results demonstrate that, compared with state-of-the-art models, the proposed model reduces the average prediction root-mean-square error over a five-second time horizon by 40% and achieves a median performance gain of 20% on large-scale public datasets. Ablation studies further confirm the effectiveness of our algorithm.},

  abstract     = {The assessment of road conditions is important in ensuring the safety and efficiency of transportation infrastructure. However, current methods of evaluation suffer from subjectivity, delayed response, and high costs. To address these limitations, this study proposes the development of an autonomous system that utilizes crowdsourcing RGB-D data to comprehensively and efficiently assess road conditions. The system includes an affordable vehicle-based data acquisition system, allowing for the collection of 3D pavement surface data while driving. By utilizing RGB-D sensors, the system captures both 2D color and 3D depth information of the entire lane width, with precise frame registration facilitated by a high-precision global positioning system (GPS) sensor. To evaluate the pavement conditions, the Pavement Surface Evaluation Rating (PASER) for asphalt pavement is used as a case study in this study. The establishment of an expert system for pavement condition evaluation involves the classification and quantification of pavement data using deep learning and computer vision approaches. The pavement surface data is classified into eight classes, including healthy surface, open joint, manhole, crack sealant, transverse crack, longitudinal crack, alligator cracking, and pothole. Moreover, the quantification results provide detailed information on distress and offer a more accurate understanding of pavement conditions. The system also facilitates the tracking of identified defects and repair work, providing up-to-date information on pavement deterioration and maintenance. It can be used for quality control of the pavement rehabilitation processes where the road authorities can evaluate the quality of the work that is done by the contractors.},

  abstract     = {Planning paths for Frenet-based autonomous vehicles (AVs) at roundabouts is difficult without complete and smooth reference paths. In such situations, the interpolating curve planner is often used to create segmented reference paths from simplified geometric roundabout data. While this method ensures curvature continuity within each curve segment, the continuity at the junctions of these segments is poor. Additionally, the determination of merging and diverging point positions at roundabouts has not been thoroughly explored. This paper introduces a novel approach using 5th-order Bézier curves to plan piecewise reference paths for AVs at roundabouts. The proposed method enhances endpoint curvature continuity of the Bézier curves and improves adaptability to non-standard roundabouts. A well-designed objective function is created to optimize both the geometric continuity parameters of the Bézier curves and the positions of merging and diverging points in the circulatory roadway. This function takes into account key factors, including path length and smoothness. Case studies validate the feasibility of maintaining curvature continuity at the endpoints and the method’s ability to generalize across various scenarios, proving its effectiveness for different roundabout structures. The results also confirm the method’s efficacy in generating paths from original geometric roundabout data. Lastly, the acceptable transverse deviations between real-world trajectories and reference paths demonstrate the rationality and practical applicability of this method.},

  abstract     = {Generalizable semantic segmentation, aims to excel on unseen target domains, as a critical focus due to the widespread practical applications requiring high generalizability. Class-wise prototypes, which depict class-wise centroids, as a type of domain-invariant information are key to improving the model generalizability due to its stability and representativeness. However, this manner faces some challenges. First, the existing methods adopt a coarse prototypical alignment form, potentially compromising performance. Second, the naive prototype generally serves as the class centroid generated by an average operation from source data batches, risks source domain overfitting, and may be detrimentally impacted by unrelated source data. Third, from a broader perspective, rather than just from a prototypical alignment perspective, the existing methods treat all samples equally, which is against the conclusion that different source features have different adaptation difficulties. To tackle these issues, we propose a novel method for generalizable semantic segmentation called Prototypical Progressive Alignment and Reweighting (PPAR) depending on the strong generalized representation of the Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) model. In particular, we first define the Original Text Prototype (OTP) and Visual Text Prototype (VTP) generated by the CLIP model, laying the foundation for the subsequent effective alignment strategy. Then, we propose a prototypical progressive alignment strategy by an easy-to-difficult alignment form to reduce domain-variant information progressively instead of directly. Finally, we propose a prototypical reweighting learning strategy that estimates the importance of the source data and corrects its learning weight to alleviate the influence of unrelated source features, i.e. alleviate negative transfer. Moreover, we also offer a theoretical insight into our method and it shows that our method compiles well on the domain generalization theory. Extensive experiments on several popular datasets demonstrate that our PPAR method achieves superior performance, proving the effectiveness of our method.

WSNs deployed in the intelligent tunnel are often affected by environmental interference or malicious intrusions, which lead to untrusted paths and affect the reliability of transmission. A trusted path ensures that the collected information can be successfully and reliably transmitted to the sink node. To solve the transmission reliability problem of wireless sensor networks, a trusted multi-source shortest path-based transmission reliability (TMSPR) algorithm is proposed in this paper. A lightweight trust management model with a node relation matrix (RM) is applied to identify and exclude untrusted nodes, thereby establishing secure transmission links. Meanwhile, the shortest transmission path is selected based on the minimum path to save the energy of the nodes. The information transmitted through trusted multi-source shortest paths (TMSPs) can successfully reach the sink node, which significantly improves the transmission reliability of the network. Furthermore, a transmission reliability index TRel is defined as a probabilistic measure to assess reliability. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm exponentially reduces both computation time and memory usage, while enhancing transmission reliability by approximately 5%.},

  abstract     = {Several studies have been conducted to investigate the security and reliability of object detection systems in Autonomous Vehicles (AVs), which rely on sensors such as cameras and Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR). These studies demonstrate the low hurdle for adversaries to execute spoof attacks on LiDAR signals, deceiving non-existing objects (ghosts) as real objects in the surroundings. However, existing approaches to detect such attacks primarily depend on 3D point clouds to analyze LiDAR signals and decide whether an object is real or spoofed, thereby requiring additional processed data. Since decisions in AVs must be made in real-time to ensure safe driving and minimize the risk of exposing road users to danger, reducing the processed data without negatively impacting the reliability and precision of object detection is a significant factor in meeting real-time requirements. Furthermore, reducing the required data to achieve reliable and accurate detection enables efficient edge data processing, thus optimally utilizing available computing power in proximity. To this end, this paper introduces Shadow-Analyzer, a technique that leverages a reduced 2D dataset derived from the 3D point cloud to detect ghost object attacks. The results obtained indicate that the Shadow-Analyzer effectively identifies ghost objects with an accuracy of up to 99.17%, achieving this within an average processing time of 5.9 milliseconds. These findings suggest that our solution fulfills the criteria for real-time detection and significantly improves the standard performance of AVs.},

It aims to detect the temporal activity of sound events in road traffic auditory scenes and classify their occurrences. Current state-of-the-art algorithms have limitations in capturing long-range dependencies between different audio features to achieve robust performance. Additionally, these models suffer from external noise and variation in audio intensities. Therefore, this study proposes a spectrogram-specific transformer model employing a multi-head attention mechanism using the scaled product attention technique based on softmax in combination with Temporal Convolutional Networks to overcome these difficulties with increased accuracy and robustness. It also proposes a unique preprocessing step and a Deep Linear Projection method to reduce the dimensions of the features before passing them to the learnable Positional Encoding layer. Rather than monophonic audio data samples, stereophonic Mel-spectrogram features are fed into the model, improving the model’s robustness to noise. State-of-the-art One-dimensional Convolutional Neural Networks and Long Short-term Memory models were used to compare the proposed model’s performance on two well-known datasets. The results demonstrated its superior performance by achieving an improvement in accuracy of 1.51 to 3.55% compared to the studied baselines.},

  abstract     = {Point cloud completion concerns the inference of the completed geometries for real-scanned point clouds that are sparse and incomplete due to occlusion, noise, and viewpoint. Previous methods usually learn a one-shot partial-to-complete mapping, which is incapable of generating fine structure details for the complex point cloud distributions. In this paper, a Hierarchical Geometry Generation point completion Network (HGG-Net) is proposed to hierarchically generate the fine-grained completed point cloud with a skeleton-to-details strategy, which consists of three fundamental modules, namely Transformer-enhanced Feature Encoder (TFE), Multi-level Geometry Representation Decoder (MGRD), and Hierarchical Dynamic Geometry Generator (HDG). Specifically, TFE first extracts geometry features of the incomplete input and obtains a coarse prediction via self-attention mechanism and edge convolution. Second, MGRD obtains the multi-level decoded geometry representations by Geometric Interactive Transformer (GIT) and Channel-Attention-based Geometry Features Fusion (CAGF), where GIT is proposed to decode the complete prompt by capturing the semantic relationship between geometry features of the incomplete and the decoded complete objects, and CAGF aims to fuse them for the high-quality representation. Third, HDG generates the complete points hierarchically from skeleton to details based on the Dynamic Graph Attention mechanism. Qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that the proposed HGG-Net outperforms state-of-the-art methods on several point cloud completion datasets.

  abstract     = {A bike-sharing system (BSS) is easily unbalanced due to the uncertainty of user demand at each bike station during the day, which appeals for an effective bike reposition solution based on the accurate prediction of user demand. However, there is a discrepancy between the bike pickup/drop-off record (satisfied demand) and the user’s first choice of origin/destination stations (i.e., true user demand) since the BSS cannot capture the unsatisfied user demand (i.e., abandoned rentals and transferred rentals/returns) that occurs at either empty stations (failed rentals) or full stations (failed returns). To efficiently rebalance the BSS, this paper focuses on accurately forecasting the true user demand of the BSS. First, we extract the spatial-temporal features of bike usage and establish a spatio-temporal model for true user demand prediction. Then, an XGBoost-based three-stage prediction approach is proposed to accurately predict the true user demand including the station clustering, the system record rectification, and the true user demand prediction. The real data from the Citi Bike in New York is applied to verify the proposed method and the experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms the existing methods.},

  abstract     = {3D lane detection provides richer spatial information than 2D lane detection planar position results. It improves vehicle perception in complex scenes, which is becoming increasingly important in intelligent driving. However, existing frameworks mainly focus on mapping front-view (FV) and bird’s-eye view (BEV) features and ignore the intrinsic correlations between different perspectives and scales. It can lead to incomplete feature extraction, affecting the perception accuracy of lane detection and adaptation ability to complex scenes. To alleviate these problems, we present a novel Freq-3DLane framework, an efficient end-to-end 3D lane detector. Instead of directly superimposing deeper and lower-level features, we propose a strategy for multi-scale information integration that exploits the frequency characteristics of features for image feature extraction. To enhance perception, we fuse image features at each scale through frequency processing to ensure that detailed information and global structure are fully utilized. Next, spatial transformation fusion captures the association between the FV and the BEV feature at any two-pixel position of both, thus enabling view feature transformation. In addition, attentional guidance enhances the lane semantic information to ensure recovery of the lane geometry for accurate 3D lane detection. Extensive results on two challenging benchmarks (Apollo 3D Lane Synthetic, and OpenLane) show that our model performs favorably against the state of the arts.},

However, accurately predicting pedestrian crossing intention is non-trivial due to the interweaving of pedestrian personalities and traffic scene elements. Despite the significant achievement of previous studies, challenges remain in effectively extracting and integrating diverse features from different modalities of observation data. In response, this paper proposes a novel model leveraging pedestrian bounding boxes, poses, and ego-vehicle speed to predict crossing intention. We introduce mixture expert feature embedding (MEFE) to project raw data into high-dimensional space based on different types of inputs. A multi-branch spatial and temporal graph convolutional network (MB-STGCN) is applied to capture multi-scale spatial and temporal features of pedestrian pose skeleton joints. A multi-token temporal aggregation (MTTA) method is devised to preserve abundant temporal information of observation data. Additionally, a progressive multimodal feature fusion (PMFF) method based on symmetric channel split attention (SCSA) is employed to enhance the interaction between different modalities when integrating different features. Extensive comparison experiments and ablation studies on public benchmark datasets substantiate the effectiveness of our approach, showing significant improvements over existing models.},

  abstract     = {3D lane detection based on multi-frame point clouds is a critical task for autonomous driving. The challenge lies in efficiently performing temporal fusion using multiple data frames with incomplete yet complementary contexts. Existing methods either directly concatenate consecutive frames, avoiding intrinsic limitations of the raw data, or fuse entire feature maps, without distinguishing lane-related features from backgrounds. These solutions exhibit room for improvement in both precision and efficiency. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end lane detection network with hierarchical queries, which decodes lane features at different levels in a top-down manner for high-precision localization. This framework can be deployed on multi-frame inputs, as it efficiently achieves lane-related sequence fusion with reduced computational costs and improved inference speed. Specifically, we design semi-parametric lane geometry representations to model lanes as parametric curves and discrete points. Accordingly, hierarchical queries are proposed to focus on two-level lane geometries, including curve queries and point queries. Curve queries capture global structures of lanes projected onto the bird’s-eye-view (BEV) flat ground, while point queries aggregate multi-frame sequences obtained through curve-guided sampling, acquiring comprehensive and reliable point-level features. In the training stage, our proposed curve matching and point localization loss optimizes the detected lane geometries at both levels. Experiments conducted on the self-collected MultiBEV dataset validate that our method outperforms previously published single-frame and multi-frame methods.

  abstract     = {3D object detection is an essential scene perception capability for autonomous vehicles. In intelligent transportation systems, autonomous vehicles require minimal inference latency to sense their surroundings in real-time. However, advanced 3D detection methods often suffer from high inference latency. This limits the real-time deployment of 3D detection models in the real world. To address this problem, this paper proposes a fast and deployable 3D object detection method from the LiDAR point cloud for autonomous driving, named Fade3D. Firstly, we propose a Lightweight Input Encoder (LIE) to extract the most critical features from point clouds. Then, we develop a Spatial Feature Enhancement BEV backbone (SFENet) that efficiently encodes geometry features into compact representations. Additionally, we design an IoU-aware Loss Re-weighting (ILR) that enhances performance by shifting more attention to hard samples. Leveraging LIE and SFENet, our approach is independent of point cloud density and number, achieving significant speed advantages in processing large-scale point clouds and being deployment-friendly. Extensive experiments on KITTI and Waymo Open Dataset (WOD) datasets comparing various baseline detectors demonstrate its universality and superiority. Specifically, our method demonstrates impressive real-time inference capabilities, achieving 51.5 Hz on an RTX3090 GPU and 12.4 Hz on a Jetson Orin embedded development board.

  abstract     = {The accurate prediction of traffic flows, defined as the aggregate forecasting of combined departure and arrival volumes across multiple airports within a designated air traffic control zone during the pre-tactical phase, is crucial for effective air traffic flow management, particularly given the rapid growth of aviation transportation. However, existing methods face significant challenges in modeling the complex spatial-temporal dependencies due to difficulties in constructing appropriate graph structures, as well as limitations inherent in the algorithms and periodic trend-based prediction mechanisms. To address these challenges, a novel framework termed Transformation into Image (TiI) is proposed in this study. Initially, data from multiple airports are transformed into images, effectively compressing spatial-temporal features into grid-based distribution representations. Subsequently, the proposed multi-kernel convolution module and parallel patch-transformer module are integrated into each resolution stream of the U-Net architecture to accurately capture spatial-temporal dependencies at both coarse-grained and fine-grained levels. Finally, the predicted images are converted and partitioned into traffic flow data for individual airports, yielding the desired results. To the best of our knowledge, TiI represents the first approach to synchronously extract both spatial and temporal dynamics by encoding traffic flow data into image representation. Extensive experiments validate the feasibility of TiI, demonstrating that it significantly outperforms comparative methods. Furthermore, an ablation study confirms the effectiveness of the two core components within the TiI regression model.},

By integrating both current and predicted target states, a dynamic attractive potential field is established to guide hunting vehicles toward favorable hunting positions. To ensure navigation safety, a repulsive potential field is designed in compliance with the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea (COLREGs). An obstacle speed-regulated mechanism is proposed to dynamically adjust the repulsive influence region. Moreover, a global prescribed-time control algorithm is proposed based on the hybrid mapping scheme to achieve strong convergence. A finite and continuous gain function prevents the typical singularity problem. Furthermore, a prescribed-time disturbance observer is constructed to compensate for model uncertainties and disturbances, improving system robustness in dynamic ocean environments. Through Lyapunov theory, all signals of the closed-loop system are guaranteed to be globally uniformly bounded at the prescribed time.

  abstract     = {The traditional operational maintenance (O&M) tasks for marine equipment involve the continuous collection of operational status data and full data transmission between the ship and shore. While this method provides comprehensive monitoring information, it often incurs significant data monitoring, storage, and transmission costs. These issues are particularly pronounced in marine environments where bandwidth is limited or the power supply for monitoring devices is constrained. This study proposes a Deep Learning-based method for Dynamic Collection of operational maintenance data and Transmission of data features between the Ship and Shore, termed the DLDCTSS. By employing a deep learning anomaly detection model, DLDCTSS establishes a closed-loop feedback mechanism for dynamic sampling. Specifically, vibration sensors are activated for data collection only when abnormalities are detected, and critical state feature data are selectively transmitted based on O&M requirements. A theoretical analysis demonstrates that the DLDCTSS approach effectively reduces onboard storage overhead, lowers communication energy consumption between ship and shore, and improves data transmission efficiency, cutting overall system expenses. This study first assesses various anomaly detection models on open-source datasets, evaluating their suitability in maritime contexts. Subsequently, tests on a custom water-lubricated stern bearing platform validate both the anomaly detection model and the DLDCTSS approach. This dynamic sampling strategy not only diminishes redundant data collection but also ensures vital information is captured at critical moments, maximizing monitoring quality while enhancing operational efficiency. Meanwhile, transmitting only essential feature data markedly lowers bandwidth usage, and onboard feature extraction safeguards data privacy and security, meeting shipowners’ requirements.},

This paper comprehensively reviews traditional and emerging tire-road adhesion coefficient (TRAC) estimation methods for intelligent vehicles. We initially categorize traditional methods into cause-based and effect-based approaches, which are founded on vehicle responses and road surface characteristics, respectively. Then, we classify emerging methods into learning-based approaches and hybrid models combining physical principles with data-driven strategies. We eventually point out areas for improvement and future research directions.

It comprehensively introduces the current missing value treatments as well as the data amputation method from previous studies. Furthermore, this survey simulates the incomplete environments for VANETs datasets and conducts experiments over simulated incomplete datasets with various performance metrics.

  abstract     = {Accurate detection of 3D objects is vital to the perception of the railway environments for the safe operation autonomous trains, particularly given the complexity of railway environments and the challenges in detecting objects of variable sizes and of distant objects. This study introduces RailFusion, a LiDAR-Camera fusion network for integrating multi-modal features. RailFusion consists of two main modules: Cross-Domain Feature Extraction (CDFE) and Multi-Modal Fusion (MMF). Specifically, the CDFE module is designed with a novel feature extraction method to enhance cross-domain features interaction by utilizing LiDAR spatial depth and image semantic information. The MMF module uses deformable attention for aligning and fusing multi-modal features. Further to this, the channel normalization fusion is proposed to assign channel weights. Experimental results show that the mean average-precision (mAP) of our proposed RailFusion is 57.2%, which is 8.4% higher than the baseline 3D object detection network BEVFusion. Moreover, the results show that RailFusion is applicable to long-range detection as well as for detecting varying sized and short-range objects. All these indicate that RailFusion has the potential to be readily applicable in 3D object detection in railway environments.},

  abstract     = {Nowadays, rolling stock can be equipped with high-frequency vibration sensors to continuously monitor rail infrastructures and detect defects. These moving sensors measure at high speeds and sampling frequencies, generating a massive amount of data that covers each track position with very short signal durations. These data contain a variety of dynamic and transient responses that vary significantly along the track and are affected by noise. This leads to a large amount of unlabeled and noisy data, complicating the extraction of dynamic responses for effective anomaly detection. To address these challenges, this paper proposes an unsupervised representation learning methodology to automatically capture and extract characteristic features of dynamic responses that reflect the conditions of rail infrastructures. The unsupervised nature allows exploratory analysis of high-frequency vibration signals when prior knowledge or reference information about infrastructure conditions is unavailable or very limited. A collaborative optimization process that synchronizes empirical mode decomposition (EMD) with a convolutional autoencoder (CAE) is presented. The EMD level is tuned to remove noise while preserving effective vibration responses. The CAE is trained using demodulated signals that are considered normal to generate representations that ensure reconstruction quality and differentiate between normal and abnormal conditions. Furthermore, a Gaussian mixture model is used to showcase the effectiveness of the learned representations for rail infrastructures. Applied to validated axle box acceleration data for rail defect detection and train-borne laser Doppler vibrometer data for rail fastener monitoring, our method outperforms other variants of autoencoder-based models and the wavelet-based CAE in accurately identifying the conditions. It achieves an average improvement of 16% with the axle box acceleration data and 21% with the laser Doppler vibrometer data.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, the concept of “digital twins” (DTs) has gained increasing attention in the railroad industry. This complex concept allows the creation of digital representations of physical assets or processes and can support a railroad’s transportation system throughout its lifecycle. For decades, MxV Rail has used the Facility for Accelerated Service Testing (FAST (Registered trademark.) to enable research and testing designed to improve the safety, reliability, and efficiency of North American railroads. At FAST, data streams generated by 1) operations, 2) maintenance, 3) wayside and onboard detector technologies, and 4) individual testing are employed to better understand the effects of heavy axle loads (HAL) as high tonnage accumulates on track components at various stages of wear. The development and implementation of DTs have strong potential to support decision-making for infrastructure and mechanical systems with regard to monitoring, predictive maintenance, and knowledge transfer to conditions where data is unavailable. This paper seeks to open the conversation by reviewing the concept of DTs in the North American railroad industry and showing the vision of the implementation layers for making a DT for FAST and the current efforts to achieve this vision.},

Based on historical URT accident data, this study develops a hybrid ensemble learning model based on a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) for predicting accident consequences in URT. The CNN is employed to capture spatial patterns from the diverse accident data, while the BERT is applied to learn complex relations in accident text descriptions. The results of the two models are combined for classifying accident consequences. The proposed hybrid ensemble learning model was applied to predict accident consequences in Chongqing’s URT using historical accident records. It achieved a prediction accuracy of 0.805 on testing data set, which is at least 20% higher than that of commonly used machine learning models, including multilayer perceptrons, support vector machines, and Bayesian networks. Furthermore, the reapplication of the proposed model to historical accident records of the URT in Chengdu demonstrates the generalizability and reusability of the model. This study forecasts the consequences of URT accidents with high accuracy using limited historical data, which supports operators in identifying high-frequency and high-impact accidents. Consequently, targeted maintenance and timely emergency response strategies can be developed to decrease accident rates and mitigate the impacts.},

Previous works construct recognizers with complicated training procedures and additional corpora to boost performance, limiting their efficiency in practical application scenarios. This paper proposes a novel ship license plate recognizer by combining autoregressive (AR) and non-autoregressive (NAR) decoding mechanisms. By adaptively incorporating the dual-branch character representations, our method explicitly sidesteps the dependence on an external language model and is adapted to the weak semantic correlation characteristics of ship name text images. Furthermore, we introduce a confidence-based dynamic reweighting strategy that includes character- and instance-level granularities. This encourages the model to learn more from hard or challenging samples. Experimental results conducted on two SLPR benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, showing that it is competitive and outperforms previous approaches. Our study comprehensively explores the relative importance of linguistic and visual cues in SLPR and demonstrates the advantages of the dynamically fused model with dual-branch autoregressive and non-autoregressive over single-branch recognition.},

By considering practical aspects, such as the movement characteristics of each vehicle and the avoidance of no-fly zones for the UAV, we aim to optimize the three-dimensional trajectories and pickup strategies of the two vehicles to identify the shortest route to minimize pickup completion time. To deal with the nonconvex optimization problem, we employ a successive convex approximation to convert the original problem into a convex form for optimization variables, and we also use a penalty convex-concave procedure to retain the binary natures of the control parameters that are required to design the pickup strategy. We also propose a two-stage iterative algorithm based on interior-point methods to solve the relaxed convex problem to find suboptimal solutions. The simulation results confirm that the proposed scheme can successfully allow the UAV and UGV to follow the shortest effective path and thus improve pickup completion time through load balancing, while outperforming the baseline schemes under various scenarios.},

In pursuit of this goal, we first establish a safety boundary that offers early warnings for fluctuations in hypersonic tracking errors and serves as a crucial mechanism for envelope adjustment. Building on this groundwork, we further develop a universal sensing-adjustment system with dynamically activated states triggered by the defined safety boundary, enabling active readjustment of the prescribed envelope boundaries. This results in a new PPC scheme capable of promptly detecting error fluctuations and smoothly readjusting prescribed envelopes, effectively addressing the fragility defect associated with existing protocols while ensuring hypersonic flight safety. Moreover, our proposed hypersonic controller does not necessitate approximators or learning parameters required for current fuzzy/neural control approaches, showcasing a low-computational design framework.

  abstract     = {To enhance the trajectory tracking capability of steer-by-wire (SBW) vehicles while reducing driver’s workload, a human-machine shared control (HMSC) strategy using improved reinforcement learning-based model predictive control (RL-MPC) is proposed. In this paper, two main contributions have been made: 1) for driver loop, a variable steering ratio (VSR) strategy applied to SBW system is designed based on an improved fuzzy controller, whose parameters are optimized through simulated annealing (SA) algorithm; 2) for intelligent control system loop, an improved RL-MPC method is proposed to realize the high precision steering tracking control for autonomous vehicles (AVs), in which MPC and deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) are deeply integrated to combine their short-term optimization ability and long-term value estimation capability. Moreover, to shorten the time of overall training and ensure that the optimal control strategy can be explored, the DDPG agent is pretrained before the parallel training of RL-MPC. CarSim-MATLAB/Simulink co-simulation results show that in the whole tracking process, the lateral position error and yaw angle error of the vehicle are significantly reduced, indicating that the tracking accuracy is greatly improved. Meanwhile, the steering wheel angle and speed are also reduced, which means that the driver will spend less energy during the steering process.},

  abstract     = {Autonomous driving has become an inevitable trend in automotive development. Reinforcement Learning (RL) is extensively used in autonomous vehicle motion planning, demonstrating good generalization but facing challenges of long training times and lack of consideration of uncertainty. To address these challenges, an Adaptive Heuristic Reinforcement Learning (AHRL) approach is proposed. First, this study improves upon the Dueling Double Deep Q Network (D3QN) algorithm by proposing the Adaptive Heuristic Dueling Double Deep Q Network (Adapt-HD3QN) algorithm. Specifically, heuristic functions from search-based planning algorithms are incorporated into the RL reward terms to guide heuristic learning and enhance learning efficiency. Additionally, considering the uncertainties in real-world driving environments, such as the movement of other traffic participants and building occlusions, a Mixed Artificial Potential Field (Mix-APF) is implemented to address static and dynamic obstacle avoidance. Furthermore, potential collisions between the autonomous vehicle and other vehicles in occluded areas are modeled as a zero-sum game, with a Dynamic Bayesian Network (DBN) used for prior modeling of potential vehicles, aiding in constructing the potential vehicle’s forward hidden set. Finally, a signal-free intersection scenario, a typical crash-prone road type, is constructed on CARLA, incorporating static obstacles and other traffic participants. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed Adapt-HD3QN algorithm exhibits superior safety, training efficiency, and traffic efficiency in scenarios with road environment perception uncertainties caused by occlusion.},

  abstract     = {Online map matching (MM) aligns real-time GPS trajectories with digital road networks, playing a vital role in vehicle navigation, route planning, and traffic analysis. Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) are widely used for their interpretability and ability to handle low GPS sampling rates. However, in urban scenarios characterized by complex road networks, significant GPS localization error, and dynamic traffic conditions, existing HMM-based methods face challenges such as large road search spaces due to uniform GPS localization error distributions (GLED) and inaccurate route accessibility estimates stemming from inadequate consideration of real-time traffic conditions. This paper proposes an improved HMM-based MM method, recognizing that urban vehicle trajectories can be categorized into two types: path-free (e.g., taxis, private cars) and path-constrained (e.g., buses). Analyzing path-constrained trajectories helps estimate fine-grained GLED and real-time traffic states of path-free vehicles more precisely. The novelty of our approach lies in two aspects: i) Using a hierarchical spectral clustering algorithm based on GPS localization errors of path-constrained bus trajectories, a city is divided into fine-grained sub-regions with consistent GLED. This enables the HMM an adaptive road search scopes, improving online MM efficiency. ii) Gradient boosting trees, known for their interpretability, estimate free-flow speeds by integrating path-constrained trajectories with the factors like road attributes and time, optimizing HMM state transition probabilities for path-free trajectory MM. Experiments on real-world data demonstrate that the optimized HMM methods, leveraging different trajectory types, significantly enhance MM efficiency and accuracy compared to baseline models.The codebase of our methods and datasets are available at https://github.com/jacklee018/onlineMM-IPCT.},

  abstract     = {Effective traffic prediction is a critical component of traffic management, especially long-term traffic prediction, as it holds significance for urban traffic planning, traffic warning, people’s travel planning, etc. Traffic flow data usually include natural spatio-temporal characteristics, which means the spatial and temporal dependencies are both to be considered for building traffic prediction model. Hence, a triple dynamic graph convolutional recurrent network (TDGCRN) is proposed in this paper, in which a temporal segmentation-based triple spatio-temporal encoder-decoder module is used to capture correlation features of different periods contained in traffic dataset, such as hourly, daily, and weekly cycles; and then a dynamic fusion module is introduced to adaptively learn the weights of different periods to effectively fuse these different cycle features; finally a congestion index-based adjacency matrix update module is utilized to model the topology of graphs to capture the dynamic topology characteristics of the road network. In addition, the congestion index is presented to detect the topology changes caused by traffic congestion to reduce the number of dynamic graphs so as to save computational cost in the training process on our self-collected dataset WH-CN. Experiments on the public dataset (PEMS-BAY and METR-LA datasets) and WH-CN dataset show that our model achieved average improvements of 0.98%, 1.19%, and 1.17% in MAE, RMSE, and MAPE metrics by comparison with the suboptimal baseline, respectively. And on the WH-CN dataset, it also reduced the average training time per epoch by reducing the frequency of dynamic graph generation, thereby reducing the computational cost.},

  abstract     = {Specific Emitter Identification (SEI) is a non-encrypted authentication technology that adds a layer of security to wireless communications in intelligent transportation systems. However, most existing SEI methods are constrained to identify fixed classes and cannot learn incrementally. In practical applications, the constant emergence of new classes or tasks necessitates the capacity to continuously learn new classes from streaming data. In this paper, combining momentum-based prototype correction and hierarchical regularization, a simple and effective non-example class-incremental method for SEI is proposed, named MoPC-HR. The momentum-based prototype correction dynamically adjusts old class prototypes (i.e., old class centers), strengthening the separation between old and new classes and enabling smoother integration of new classes. Hierarchical regularization is applied at multiple levels to control feature differences between old and new classes, preventing the model from favoring new classes and reducing catastrophic forgetting. Experiments on real-world AIS-100 and ADS-B datasets show that MoPC-HR outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Specifically, in the incremental phase 20, MoPC-HR achieves an average accuracy of 97.04%, average forgetting of 2.95%, and average intransigence of 2.85% on the AIS-100 dataset; and an average accuracy of 95.99%, average forgetting of 3.66%, and average intransigence of 3.60% on the ADS-B dataset.

Previous research has demonstrated that effective feature representation enhances model performance, yet few methods thoroughly explore the complementary relationships between features at different scales in complex wild environments. In this paper, we propose a Progressive Terrain Segmentation Network (PTSNet) for the segmentation of navigable areas, which introduces global contextual information as prior knowledge for fusion and delivers robust feature representation by progressively exploring the complementary relationships between multi-scale features from both spatial and channel perspectives. PTSNet consists of two main components: the Global Sparsity-Entropy Module (GSEM) and the Fusion-Awareness Module (FAM). The GSEM, based on self-attention, employs Top-K sparsity and entropy refinement to effectively capture global semantic information with long-range dependencies, and the information derived from GSEM act as prior knowledge to guide feature fusion. Additionally, we propose the FAM, which consists of the Attention Aggregation Unit (AAU) and the Contribution-aware Unit (CAU), to explore complementary relationships in multi-scale feature interactions and obtain sufficient scene information. Extensive experiments conducted on various wild datasets demonstrate that PTSNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods in accurately segmenting navigable areas, offering a new solution for the safe operation of self-driving systems in wild environments.

  abstract     = {The increasing depletion of fossil fuels and growing environmental concerns are increasing the need for energy efficient and sustainable solutions, particularly in transport. At this point, especially in public transport, electric vehicles (EVs) offer a promising alternative; however, issues such as range anxiety and energy efficiency require comprehensive solutions. This study introduces the Gauss-based Trolleybus Energy Consumption Model (GTECM) for electric buses, harnessing real-time big data to mitigate range anxiety and enhance energy efficiency. This model employs Gaussian Process Regression to a large-scale dataset including 100,000 entries collected over six months in Türkiye. With an overall Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 0.013905, GTECM substantially outperforms linear approaches across Türkiye’s primary routes, exhibiting route-specific RMSE values between 0.28117 and 0.30540. Empirical findings suggest potential energy savings of up to 50%, alongside a 10% extension in driving range, thereby mitigating an estimated 4,220 tons of CO2 and 129.88 tons of NO2 emissions annually. Moreover, the projected amortization period for diesel-to-electric bus conversion stands at 6.83 years, underscoring GTECM’s pragmatic utility for sustainable urban transit optimization. The findings of the study can form the basis for future research and guide policy makers and urban planners in the development of more efficient and sustainable transport networks.},

To address this issue, this study constructs an optimization model for cooperative robot operations, aiming to minimize total energy consumption and the completion time of most time-consuming robot. These objectives contain conflicts, thus requiring a multi-objective optimization approach to resolve them. We propose a reinforced neighborhood search method combined with genetic algorithm (RNSGA), which combines single solution search ideas and population-based techniques. RNSGA consists of two crucial steps: route construction to determine the composition and visiting sequence of task points within each route, as well as route allocation to assign routes to individual robots. The route construction phase incorporates several key components, including solution initialization, route balance mechanism, proximity-based optimization mechanism, and intro-route sequence adjustment method. For the route allocation phase, a population-based allocation mechanism is employed to determine the optimal assignment of routes. Comprehensive experiments on 24 classic transportation test instances demonstrate that RNSGA significantly outperforms six state-of-the-art algorithms.},

Current HDV intention prediction models often misclassify these intentions, leading to unsafe navigation decisions. This study introduces a three-stage Bayesian sequential game-based decision making architecture designed for AV operation. In the first stage, the AV utilizes a temporal neural network to classify vehicle intentions. In the second stage, a sequential game is solved to determine optimal actions by predicting future HDV states. The final stage, serving as a validation stage, identifies and corrects misclassifications from the first stage by predicting HDV future positions, incorporating models that account for potential deviations from the ground truth. Simulation results indicate a $93.5\pm 0.5$ % accuracy in initial intention predictions, facilitating swift and effective decision making. The validation stage further enhances safety by promptly correcting errors, ensuring reliable navigation for AVs in HDV environments.},

We introduce a novel Internet of Autonomous Vehicles (IoAV) architecture integrating an AI-driven intrusion detection system with a Chaotic Map-Based Authenticated Key Agreement protocol to address these security concerns.

Rigorous evaluation using the Real-or-Random (ROR) model demonstrates the protocol’s resilience against diverse attack vectors, including man-in-the-middle, replay, and adversarial attacks. Experimental validation confirms the framework’s effectiveness (97.8% detection accuracy, AUC-ROC: 0.976), computational efficiency (31.25% reduction in overhead, 4.2ms inference latency), and operational resilience (99.3% authentication integrity under $10^{3}$ requests/second DDoS simulation).

Furthermore, an event-triggered trajectory deconflict strategy for trajectory replanning is considered to resolve multiple trajectory conflicts. Comparative experiments with baseline methods have confirmed that the proposed planner can generate faster and safer trajectories than conventional methods.},

  abstract     = {Sensors are widely deployed on high-speed trains for real-time operational status monitoring. The integrity of multi-sensor signals over time is critical for the train’s Prognostics and Health Management (PHM) system. However, data missing during multi-sensor signal acquisition and transmission can severely limit the performance of PHM systems. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel Conditional Time Series Diffusion (CTSDiff) model designed for efficient and accurate imputation of missing values in high-speed trains’ multi-sensor time series signals. Firstly, CTSDiff utilizes the non-missing sensor signals collected as conditional information to guide missing data generation, thereby achieving data imputation. Secondly, CTSDiff employs one-dimensional convolutional residual blocks with dilation parameters to capture complex temporal dependencies and adopts a skip-step non-Markovian sampling process to accelerate the imputation procedure. Finally, experimental results demonstrate that CTSDiff can generate high-quality and diverse imputations across various missing data scenarios. The imputation data provided by CTSDiff ensures consistency with actual data distribution and obtains confidence information of the imputed data, significantly enhancing the integrity of multi-sensor signals in high-speed trains and the accuracy of intelligent analysis within PHM systems. Notably, this study opens new avenues for addressing missing data issues in high-speed train multi-sensor datasets and showcases the great potential of diffusion models in generating sensor signals.},

However, the current DRT dispatching hardly achieves a balance between the operating costs and service flexibility, leading to a high failure rate of DRT operation. To address this issue, this research proposes a dispatching method for DRT with passengers’ hidden preference exploitation capability. The proposed DRT dispatching method overcomes the imbalance shortcomings of conventional method and bears the following features: 1) With the capability of exploiting the passengers’ hidden preference; 2) With the capability of making the most of the passengers’ room for compromise. To evaluate the proposed dispatching method, a numerical experiment compared with conventional DRT dispatching model is conducted, and sensitivity analysis is performed for passenger satisfaction level threshold. The evaluation results show that with the capability of exploiting the passengers’ hidden preference, the proposed DRT dispatching method is able to improve the average travel time by 27.8%~47.5% and reduce the average waiting time by 26.4%~47.4%; via making the most of the passengers’ room for compromise, the proposed DRT dispatching method is able to enhance the passenger average satisfaction by 65.3%~85.7%. The benefit range is caused by different values of passenger satisfaction level threshold.},

This paper proposes a novel framework to identify driving heterogeneity from the underlying characteristics of driving behaviour. The framework includes three processes: Action phase extraction, Action pattern calibration, and Action pattern classification. The concepts of Action phase and Action patterns are proposed to decipher and interpret driving behaviours. Action phases are extracted by rule-based segmentation methods and Action patterns are calibrated based on an unsupervised learning approach. The extraction and calibration processes provide a rigorous labelling approach for the attention-based LSTM Action pattern classification process. Evaluation of the framework on a large-scale naturalistic driving dataset reveals six distinct Action patterns. The implementation of the attention mechanism to LSTM models significantly enhanced both the accuracy and time efficiency of Action pattern identification. The proposed framework offers benefits in detecting and reducing variability in driving behaviour through ITS applications such as user-based traffic management, personalised Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS), and advanced autonomous vehicles (AV) design, thereby enhancing road safety and traffic efficiency.},

However, the research encounters two main challenges: 1) scarcity of training samples under snowy conditions and 2) challenge in applying the model in practice. To address the first challenge, we proposed a publicly accessible RGB-T semantic segmentation dataset in snowy urban scenes (SUS dataset). The SUS dataset comprises 1035 pairs of precisely registered RGB-T images, and provides pixel-level semantic annotations for five categories for all images. To tackle the second challenge, we introduced MCNet-S ${}^{\ast }$ , a novel semantic segmentation model that leverages knowledge distillation (KD). The KD structure consists of an RGB-T teacher model, named MCNet-T, and an RGB student model, named MCNet-S. Within MCNet-T, we proposed a cross-modal dual association (CDA) module to enhance utilization of RGB-T information in snowy urban scenes. Within MCNet-S, a depth-wise separable pyramid (DSP) module was proposed to improve the efficiency of RGB information utilization and align the feature dimensions with those of MCNet-T. Between MCNet-S and MCNet-T, memory-based contrastive learning distillation (MCLD) was proposed to transfer the prior thermal knowledge, improving the segmentation accuracy of MCNet-S and obtaining optimized MCNet-S $\ast $ . Extensive experiments on the SUS and MFNet datasets show that the proposed models outperform state-of-the-art models.

  abstract     = {Transportation infrastructure significantly influences the development of sustainable transportation systems and the effective management of road networks. Accurate segmentation of road infrastructure provides valuable data and a structured approach for the effective management of road deterioration. However, existing methods are limited in segmenting road deterioration data due to the lack of probabilistic assessment and the inability to effectively handle outliers. To address this gap, the Gaussian mixture segmentation (GMS) model is introduced, applying a Gaussian mixture distribution to model the variability in road deterioration. Our approach utilizes spatial line segmentation to effectively segment large-scale road networks into meaningful segments. The GMS model was applied to road deterioration data from the South West region of Western Australia, identifying and segmenting roads based on their distribution characteristics using the Jensen-Shannon (JS) divergence. To assess the performance of the GMS model, metrics such as the number of segments, coefficient of variation (CV), Caliński-Harabasz Index, and Davies-Bouldin Index were evaluated. The results demonstrate that the GMS model outperformed existing segmentation methods, achieving an increase in the average percentage of segments with a CV lower than 0.25 by 23.5% to 98.8%, along with a reduction in the average Davies-Bouldin Index by 25.2% to 64.4% and improvements in the average Caliński-Harabasz Index, which increased by 23.0% to 131.1%. This approach enhances the understanding of the spatial distribution of road deterioration, informing maintenance strategies for large-scale road networks and addressing the complexities of road infrastructure management, including traffic dynamics and environmental impacts.},

  abstract     = {Testing asphalt binder’s viscoelastic properties is complex and resource-consuming, contrasting with readily available composition data. Establishing a connection between these two aspects is vital, but limited high-quality data poses challenges. Data augmentation through virtual data generation can address this issue. Traditional Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) struggle with the intricacy of asphalt binder data, so we propose a hybrid VAE-GAN model, combining a Variational Autoencoders (VAE) with GAN, specifically designed for this data type. We evaluated eight machine learning algorithms to determine the best one for linking asphalt binder composition and viscoelastic properties. Next, we constructed a progressive data augmentation framework to efficiently integrate the generated data. Our findings confirm that the VAE-GAN effectively creates realistic virtual data, with support vector regression (SVR) emerging as the top choice for building the relationship model. Integrating the augmented data improved prediction accuracy by around 30% compared to using only real data, verifying the efficiency of our virtual data generation approach. To enhance the practicality of the relationship model, we created a user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI). This study streamlines asphalt performance evaluation and adaptable design, addressing data limitations in materials research, thus supporting sustainable and low-carbon development goals. By simplifying complex processes and improving data utilization, our work paves the way for smarter material designs in various industries.},

  abstract     = {Blockchain serves as a trust layer for data exchange in Vehicular Ad-hoc Networks (VANETs) due to its immutability and transparency. However, it can also be abused to spread false and inaccurate information. Additionally, the explosive growth of data in VANETs and the limited storage capacity of edge nodes make it challenging to maintain the entire blockchain. To address these challenges, we propose an anonymous vehicle announcement scheme based on redactable blockchain. Specifically, we propose a novel ephemeral trapdoor revocable chameleon hash scheme (ETRCH) that enables decentralized management and enforced revocation of redaction privileges. ETRCH deploys multiple regulators, each capable of creating multiple ephemeral trapdoors. These regulators enable $\boldsymbol {k}$ -out-of- $\boldsymbol {n}$ edge nodes associated with the same ephemeral trapdoor to collaboratively rewrite blockchain data, thereby addressing storage limitations. In addition, $\boldsymbol {k}$ -out-of- $\boldsymbol {n}$ regulators can cooperate to update the ephemeral trapdoor and revoke the redaction privileges of any malicious regulator discovered to be abusing their privileges. To facilitate the threshold authentication of announcement messages, we construct a redactable threshold ring signature scheme (RTRS) based on ETRCH, enabling anonymous signing of announcements in VANETs. Additionally, if a regulator detects a false or misleading message, the content can be promptly rewritten. Finally, we conducted rigorous security analysis and comprehensive experiments to evaluate the performance of the proposed scheme. The results demonstrate that compared to VANETs systems based on immutable blockchains, our scheme is both secure and efficient.},

Besides, existing research primarily focuses on the countermeasures for detecting but lacks the strategies to be taken after a cyberattack has occurred.

The results indicate the proposed system successfully issues the warning actions to the specific drivers and prevented 100% of red-light running behaviors and also significantly enhanced the safety.

  abstract     = {Accurate pedestrian trajectory prediction is critical for ensuring the safety of autonomous vehicles and advancing higher levels of driving automation. However, the complex interpersonal interactions and highly dynamic trajectory patterns in real-world scenarios pose significant challenges to achieving precise predictions. Recently, Transformers have shown remarkable success in pedestrian trajectory prediction, primarily due to their effective modeling of temporal and spatial dependencies via Multi-Head Self-Attention (MHA) mechanisms. Despite these advancements, existing self-attention methods often rely on Euclidean distance-based metrics and dot-product operations, which are inadequate for capturing interaction-induced trajectory curvatures. To address this limitation, we propose a novel hybrid Transformer architecture, FuseFormer, that incorporates Geodesic Self-Attention (GSA) mechanisms. GSA utilizes geodesic distances to characterize interaction features effectively, complementing MHA, which excels in capturing local features and maintaining temporal correlations. FuseFormer employs a gating network to adaptively combine GSA and MHA embeddings, leveraging their complementary strengths. Additionally, FuseFormer integrates a Transformer-based Neural Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) decoder to model trajectory temporal dynamics. This design enables the generation of future trajectories that align closely with motion trends while adapting the network depth to input sequence lengths. Experimental results demonstrate that FuseFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance across widely used pedestrian trajectory prediction datasets, including ETH/UCY, SDD, and NBA. These results underscore the model’s effectiveness and generalization capability in capturing complex interaction patterns and handling diverse scenarios.},

In this article, we propose an end-to-end learning approach that synthesizes imitation learning with DRL for AAV navigation and obstacle avoidance. Specifically, we formulate this problem as a partially observable Markov decision process with sparse rewards and learn an end-to-end policy that maps imperfect sensor data to control signals. To efficiently optimize the policy under the sparse reward setting, we propose the selective behavior cloning enhanced actor-critic (SBCAC) algorithm. By integrating an experience filter and a Q-value based action selector to selectively mimic an artificial potential field based non-expert policy, our approach significantly improves the learning performance and sample efficiency. Extensive simulations with fixed-wing and multi-rotor AAVs in different scenarios demonstrate that SBCAC achieves an average improvement of up to 16.07% in success rate, a 72.46% reduction in crash rate, and a 94.62% reduction in stray rate compared to the state-of-the-art selective imitation baseline. Furthermore, hardware-in-the-loop and physical experiments validate the effectiveness of our approach, showing its potential for practical applications in complex environments.},

  abstract     = {Ensuring the safety of autonomous vehicles (AVs) is paramount before they can be introduced to the market. More specifically, securing the Safety of the Intended Functionality (SOTIF) poses a notable challenge; while ISO 21448 outlines numerous activities to refine the performance of AVs, it offers minimal quantitative guidance. This paper endeavors to decompose the acceptance criterion into quantitative perception requirements, aiming to furnish developers with requirements that are not only understandable but also actionable. This paper introduces a risk decomposition methodology to derive SOTIF requirements for perception. More explicitly, for subsystem-level safety requirements, we define a collision severity model to establish requirements for state uncertainty and present a Bayesian model to discern requirements for existence uncertainty. For component-level safety requirements, we proposed a decomposition method based on the Shapley value. Our findings indicate that these methods can effectively decompose the system-level safety requirements into quantitative perception requirements, potentially facilitating the safety verification of various AV components.},

Though “large-scale datasets (COME15K and ReDweb-S)” have been released, they only partially address the domain shift problem. From the perspective of data augmentation, this paper presents a novel solution, which follows a weakly-supervised way to adapt generic RGB-D SOD models for specific scenarios, with a focus on traffic scene imagery. Our key idea is to equip plain videos (specific scenarios, i.e., traffic scenes) with newly estimated saliency informative depth maps and pseudo-SOD GTs, enabling them to support the retraining of existing RGB-D SOD models for meeting the requirements of these specific scenes. To achieve this, we offer a fresh perspective on how depth information can be leveraged in the SOD task and introduce a new paradigm for extracting intrinsic information from optical flows derived from videos to refine RGB-D SOD models. Our method achieves a 1.2% improvement in F-measure on RGB-D datasets and a 27% enhancement on real-world street view datasets compared to baseline models. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in enhancing model adaptability for traffic scene imagery, even with limited target domain data.

However, current research on these tasks is conducted independently, neglecting the interconnections between the driver, traffic environment, and vehicle. In this paper, we propose a Unified Multi-task Assistive Driving Network Based on Multimodal Fusion (UMD-Net), the first unified model capable of recognizing four tasks simultaneously by utilizing multimodal data: driver behavior recognition, driver emotion recognition, traffic context recognition, and vehicle behavior recognition. In order to better enhance the synergistic effects between multiple tasks, we designed the position-sensitive multi-directional attention feature extraction subnetwork and recursive dynamic feature fusion module. The former captures the key features of multi-view images by different directions of attention mechanism to improve the generalization of the model across multiple tasks. The latter dynamically adjusts the fusion weight according to the multimodal features to enhance the representation ability of important features in multi-task learning. Our model was evaluated on the public dataset AIDE, achieving the best performance across all four tasks and a high accuracy of 95.31% in the traffic context recognition task, demonstrating the superiority of our approach.

  abstract     = {Demand prediction is essential for enhancing the service quality of ride-hailing platforms. However, the imbalanced and highly skewed nature of ride-hailing demand poses challenges in achieving accurate predictions, especially at major transport hubs. Existing studies have predominantly focused on enhancing prediction models or algorithms, while the lack of attention given to understanding the underlying data characteristics inevitably leads to a mediocre prediction performance. To address this issue, this paper presents a practical approach-referred to Pattern Recognition and Prediction-that makes the trade-off between data intricacy and model flexibility. Firstly, the feature-weighted fuzzy c-means clustering algorithm is employed to assign appropriate pattern labels to daily demand order sequences. Subsequently, reinforcement learning assists ensemble learning to recognize the service pattern for new instance and predict the recognized patterns based on the multi-layer stacking model. In particular, the reinforcement learning dynamically identifies the most suitable combination of predictors, which are then efficiently stacked using a multi-layer stacking model. To quantify the uncertainty in predictions, an improved kernel density estimation is additionally developed for interval predictions. Extensive experiments on a real-world ride-hailing dataset from Beijing West Railway Station, China, demonstrate improvements in both point and interval prediction accuracy, with the former exhibiting a minimum increase of 3.37% compared to benchmark models without pattern recognition, and the latter achieving a more balanced interval width and coverage compared to traditional parametric methods.},

First, a multiple point-mass model of the HST system, which reflects in-train coupling force between adjacent cars, is derived. It is assumed that the first car of the HST is a motor car, i.e. the car is capable of traction and braking. Next, under the conditions that the bias faults and the disturbances are norm-bounded, a computationally inexpensive decentralized adaptive control method with backstepping technique is developed. Utilizing the information garnered from the adaptive mechanism, the detrimental effects stemming from the aerodynamic resistance and the motor faults can be comprehensively eradicated in the motor cars. Furthermore, a linear matrix inequality technique is introduced to address the in-train coupling forces for ensuring the tracking stability of the trailer cars. It is shown that the resulting closed-loop system is not only stable, but also that the position tracking error and velocity tracking error of the motor cars can asymptotically converge to zero. Compared with the existing results, a computationally inexpensive decentralized adaptive asymptotic tracking control approach is proposed, which requires only one parameter to be updated online adaptively per motor car. Finally, simulation on a HST with 2 motor cars and 6 trailer cars is provided for verifying the theoretical results.},

Compared to existing studies on the MEE problem, the vehicle model employed more accurately reflects real-world traffic, and the limitation of undirected communication topologies is overcome. In this paper, an analytical method is proposed to search for the MEE, particularly for vehicle platoons equipped with adaptive cruise control (ACC) and cooperative adaptive cruise control (CACC) systems. This method derives analytical results regarding the MEE by examining the monotonicity relationship between the EDM and the eigenvalues of the Laplacian matrix. In particular, we examine the coupled effects of the moduli and phases of the eigenvalues on searching for the MEE. Finally, simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method reduces the computation time required to calculate the EDM by three orders of magnitude compared to the traditional method.},

Radar sensors are known for their robustness in adverse weather conditions compared to other perception sensors such as LiDAR and cameras. However, their application in autonomous vehicles (AVs) is often limited due to the low-resolution data they produce. The primary aim of this study is to enhance radar images captured by AVs, enabling these vehicles to rely on radar sensors for object identification and semantic segmentation in all weather conditions. The training of the GAN was performed using ground truth images derived from high-resolution LiDAR point cloud maps and radar images collected in good weather conditions. These ground truth images were generated through a customized LiDAR scan accumulation method, followed by a two-dimensional (2D) projection and cropping process. Additionally, a customized data augmentation method was employed during the training process to improve the performance of the proposed method in adverse weather conditions. During the inference phase, our approach exclusively uses radar images to produce enhanced and semantically segmented versions of the input radar images. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated through both qualitative and quantitative results, demonstrating its capability to generate enhanced and semantically segmented images from radar images in all weather conditions.

However, current visual localization methods generally have some shortcomings: on one hand, they are limited by the camera’s field of view, on the other hand, their robustness is often inadequate under challenging conditions such as lighting changes, long-term scene changes, or occlusions. To address these issues, we formulate a general spherical camera model for both fisheye and panoramic cameras and propose a minimal solution for pose estimation using this model based on vehicle motion characteristic. The minimal solution cannot filter outliers, so a robust estimation framework is necessary. For outlier-rejection, we introduce two frameworks: a probabilistic optimal RANSAC and a globally optimal graph-based framework. We conduct a probabilistic analysis of the RANSAC to demonstrate its enhanced robustness given by the proposed minimal solution. To achieve robustness to extreme outliers (higher than 90%), we decouple the rotation and translation space through the minimal solution to construct maximum consensus graph for the two sub-problems. We then employs a maximum clique search algorithm to find the optimal solutions, achieving deterministic convergence while maintaining real-time performance. Extensive experiments with synthetic data, real-world fisheye images, and 360° panoramic images validate the robustness and efficiency of our proposed algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Pedestrian crossing intention prediction is crucial for autonomous vehicles due to their inherent inertia, yet challenging. The prevailing practice is to leverage multi-modal data that correlate with pedestrian crossing intention as input to infer it, with ego-vehicle speed being a commonly used modality. However, from a causal perspective, we identify two critical issues overlooked by existing methods: 1) The causal relationship between ego-vehicle speed and pedestrian crossing intention is inconsistent across the training and testing phases, leading to a distribution shift in the data; 2) There exists a bidirectional causality between ego-vehicle speed and pedestrian crossing intention, comprising forward causality and anti-causality. The imbalanced distribution of these two causal directions in natural datasets results in causal confusion, further exacerbating the distribution shift. These issues lead to a counter-intuitive hypothesis: removing ego-vehicle speed as input can actually benefit prediction performance. Therefore, we propose LIM (Less Is More), a uni-modal model that utilizes only skeleton sequences as input. LIM features specially designed modules for efficient skeleton sequence processing, eliminating the reliance on unstable ego-vehicle speed. Moreover, LIM employs adversarial training to identify and remove any latent ego-vehicle speed information embedded within the skeleton sequences. LIM achieves competitive prediction performance compared to state-of-the-art multi-modal models while offering superior real-time capabilities and lower computational costs. By revealing critical issues overlooked by most existing work and providing a more robust crossing intention prediction model, our work contributes to the development of safer autonomous vehicles.},

  abstract     = {Bird’s-eye-view (BEV) semantic segmentation is becoming crucial in autonomous driving systems. It realizes ego-vehicle surrounding environment perception by projecting 2D multi-view images into 3D world space. Recently, BEV segmentation has made notable progress, attributed to better view transformation modules, larger image encoders, or more temporal information. However, there are still two issues: 1) a lack of effective understanding and enhancement of BEV space features, particularly in accurately capturing long-distance environmental features and 2) recognizing fine details of target objects. To address these issues, we propose OE-BevSeg, an end-to-end multimodal framework that enhances BEV segmentation performance through global environment-aware perception and local target object enhancement. OE-BevSeg employs an environment-aware BEV compressor. Based on prior knowledge about the main composition of the BEV surrounding environment varying with the increase of distance intervals, long-sequence global modeling is utilized to improve the model’s understanding and perception of the environment. From the perspective of enriching target object information in segmentation results, we introduce the center-informed object enhancement module, using centerness information to supervise and guide the segmentation head, thereby enhancing segmentation performance from a local enhancement perspective. Additionally, we designed a multimodal fusion branch that integrates multi-view RGB image features with radar/LiDAR features, achieving significant performance improvements. Extensive experiments show that, whether in camera-only or multimodal fusion BEV segmentation tasks, our approach achieves state-of-the-art results by a large margin on the nuScenes dataset for vehicle segmentation, demonstrating superior applicability in the field of autonomous driving.

  abstract     = {The polarization-based attitude and heading reference system (PAHRS) consisting of inertial navigation system (INS) and polarization sensor (PS) offers an effective solution for attitude and heading determination in the case of global navigation satellite system (GNSS) signal degradation. Its performance depends largely on the state estimation accuracy. In the existing work, the Kalman filtering (KF), as a low complexity scheme, is employed to achieve the state estimation of PAHRS. However, in practice, the performance of PAHRS could be affected by weather conditions and the maneuvering state of the vehicle. The accurate noise statistics of INS and PS is often encountered, which leads to a degradation of PAHRS. To improve the adaptability and accuracy of the system, in this article, we conduct a KF flow-based deep neural networks (KFDNNs), a real-time state estimator that learns from PS and INS data to carry out Kalman filter. In the constructed KFDNNs, deep neural networks (DNNs) are inserted into the flow of the KF to learn the optimal Kalman gain from PAHRS data, which we can retain data efficiency and interpretability of the classic algorithm while circumvents the dependency of the KF on knowledge of the noise statistics. Moreover, a two-stage training strategy consisting of warm-up training stage and task-oriented training stage is presented for the KFDNNs, which mitigate the gradient explosion caused by the unstable random initialization of KFDNNs while improve the flexibility of sequence length selection. Finally, the simulation and vehicle test are carried to verify the performance of PAHRS. The experimental results confirm the KFDNNs outperforms KF-based INS/PS method especially in complex weather and maneuvering scenarios.},

  abstract     = {Adaptive Traffic Signal Control (ATSC) has become a popular research topic in intelligent transportation systems. Regional Traffic Signal Control (RTSC) using the Multi-agent Deep Reinforcement Learning (MADRL) technique has become a promising approach for ATSC due to its ability to achieve the optimum trade-off between scalability and optimality. Most existing RTSC approaches partition a traffic network into several disjoint regions, followed by applying centralized reinforcement learning techniques to each region. However, the pursuit of cooperation among RTSC agents still remains an open issue and no communication strategy for RTSC agents has been investigated. In this paper, we propose communication strategies to capture the correlation of micro-traffic states among lanes and the correlation of macro-traffic states among intersections. We first justify that the evolution equation of the RTSC process is Markovian via a system of store-and-forward queues. Next, based on the evolution equation, we propose two GAT-Aggregated (GA2) communication modules—GA2-Naive and GA2-Aug to extract both intra-region and inter-region correlations between macro and micro traffic states. While GA2-Naive only considers the movements at each intersection, GA2-Aug also considers the lane-changing behavior of vehicles. Two proposed communication modules are then aggregated into two existing novel RTSC frameworks—RegionLight and Regional-DRL. Experimental results demonstrate that both GA2-Naive and GA2-Aug effectively improve the performance of existing RTSC frameworks under both real and synthetic scenarios. Hyperparameter testing also reveals the robustness and potential of our communication modules in large-scale traffic networks.},

  abstract     = {Effective delay management is essential for enhancing high-speed railway (HSR) operational efficiency. Clustering methods, a core technique for identifying delay patterns, categorize trains with similar operational characteristics. However, existing studies rarely consider anomalies, which are significant deviations from typical train operational characteristics and often indicate faults or infrastructure weaknesses. Detecting and analyzing these anomalous delays is therefore crucial. As delay data continuously accumulate, traditional clustering methods require repeated re-clustering of dynamically changing datasets, making them time-consuming and labor-intensive. To efficiently cluster and detect anomalies in train delay data, this paper proposes an Incremental Dirichlet Process Mixture Model (IDPMM)-based anomaly detection method. This approach integrates posterior probability-based anomaly detection with density-based checks to achieve real-time identification of anomalous delays. Subsequently, adaptive clustering is performed on each batch of non-anomalous data, merging similar clusters to incrementally refine the clustering model. Meanwhile, the clustering structure is dynamically adjusted to enhance model robustness. Experimental validation on multiple public datasets and real-world train operation data demonstrates that, compared to the traditional Dirichlet Process Mixture Model (DPMM), the proposed IDPMM method reduces processing time by 65.3%-87.7% and memory consumption by 80%-95%. Moreover, among evaluated incremental clustering methods, IDPMM achieves the highest anomaly detection performance. In real-world applications, IDPMM facilitates real-time anomaly detection, enabling early identification of anomalous trains at the onset of delay propagation. This capability supports timely dispatch interventions, mitigating cascading delays and improving train operation stability and scheduling efficiency.},

  abstract     = {Advancements in Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) have led to innovative solutions for planning optimization, efficiency enhancement, and resource allocation in transportation networks, which are demonstrated in applications such as smart parking lot management and electric vehicle (EV) charging station allocation, where improved decision-making and system-wide optimization have been achieved. However, as these systems evolve, the demand for better adaptability and coordination continues to grow to maximize their overall effectiveness and efficiency. To achieve this, we propose the Multi-Personality Multi-Agent Meta-Reinforcement Learning (MPMA-MRL) framework. This approach incorporates multiple meta-trained, meta-tested explainable personality policies, which are deployed to each agent. A personality selector is trained and deployed on each agent to optimize the overall performance. MPMA-MRL is superior than traditional methods in terms of the adaptability and coordination in ITS by leveraging improved information from the environment, more practical coordination among agents, faster adaptation speed to intermediate tasks, and more appropriate allocation and planning. The proposed framework is evaluated in the applications of parking lot optimization and EV charging station allocation. Its broader impact on multi-agent smart systems is analyzed to demonstrate its generalizability. The results demonstrate that in parking lot optimization, MPMA-MRL significantly reduces the time required to direct all vehicles to available parking spots. In EV charging station allocation, MPMA-MRL effectively minimizes waiting times at charging stations. Moreover, in both applications, MPMA-MRL exhibits enhanced adaptability to previously unseen scenarios, improving its applicability.},

However, as the number of vehicles and application diversity increase, significant security concerns have emerged, including message authentication and vehicle privacy protection. Consequently, researchers have devised several identity authentication protocols to ensure legitimate communication between parties. Nevertheless, existing schemes fail to address real-time response identity authentication due to high-speed vehicle movement and the need for traversing multiple domains. This limitation poses challenges in traffic management and even threatens human life. To overcome these issues, we propose a novel identity authentication method called broadcast authentication and design a new protocol incorporating this approach. The confidentiality and unforgeability of our proposal are proven based on classic hardness assumptions. Our protocol enables vehicles to authenticate with multiple roadside units through a single request communication process, thereby avoiding delays in authentication while saving costs associated with communication and computation.

  abstract     = {The booming usage of Electric Vehicles (EV) led to the augmentation of Lithium-Ion batteries. This is due to its charging speed, ease of maintenance, lower operational cost, and high specific energy. Yet, these batteries are under scrutiny due to the significant amount of fire accidents in recent years. These accidents result from thermal runaway, a chain reaction that may lead to a catastrophic explosion. Approximately 60% of EV battery fire incidents stem from internal thermal runaway while charging accidents account for 30%. This paper envisages an ensemble machine learning (ML) approach for early prediction of fire in Li-ion batteries by quantitatively analyzing the volume of gases released during venting. The methodology is based upon previous research conducted and employs a dataset curated from previous studies to serve as a benchmark. Generative AI (Conditional Generative Adversarial Network) is used to generate synthetic data samples. The validity of the dataset has been rigorously verified using Kernal Density plots, ensuring its reliability for predictive modeling. The random forest algorithm proves its efficacy and can predict the time before the thermal runaway to alert the user. Performance evaluation metrics, including 97.83% accuracy, 96.97% precision, 98.63% recall, and a 97.8% F1 score, highlight its robustness.

Despite the potential of utilizing the advanced communication technology to enhance driving reliability, conficts between high-quality sensing needs of CAVs and insufficient sensing sharing wellness present significant challenges. To bridge the gaps, this paper proposes a novel cooperative sensing sharing framework that utilizes vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication to extend the effective sensory range of CAVs, thereby reducing perception gaps and enhancing driving efficiency in complex driving environments. Aiming at incentivizing cooperative sensing sharing ecosystem within this decentralized framework, we first introduce a multi-tier blockchain architecture that ensures secure and transparent data sharing among CAVs. Concurrently, a custom-designed efficient consensus algorithm is proposed to minimize the overhead while guaranteeing transaction throughput. To tackle issues related to trust and motivate long-term cooperative behavior, we introduce a supervision-oriented model that utilizes evolutionary game to formulate incentive mechanisms discouraging malicious participation and promoting honest, active engagement. Finally, theoretical analysis and extensive simulations demonstrate that our system not only ensures healthy sensing sharing performance but also maintains system security.},

Such interruptions pose significant challenges to maintaining platoon formation and achieving effective tracking performance. The proposed approach integrates network performance and state estimation within a nonlinear distributed model predictive control (DMPC) framework. A V2V communication model for platooning on straight roads is developed using stochastic geometry theory, and a unidirectional connectivity determination method assesses platoon topology connectivity. Missing information due to communication degradation is estimated using the probabilities of successful V2X information reception and connectivity results. This estimation provides reference trajectories for disconnected vehicles, ensuring platoon safety and stability. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated through simulations of a heterogeneous platoon with 15 vehicles under nine network topologies, considering both fixed-time and random intermittent network interruptions. Results demonstrate that under random network interruptions, the proposed method improves tracking performance by 87.1%, driving comfort by 72.5%, and energy efficiency by 23.2% compared to a baseline control method. Preliminary real-world testing further validates the feasibility of the approach. These findings underscore the effectiveness of the proposed method in maintaining platoon stability and safety, even during complete V2X communication loss.},

  abstract     = {To enhance the reliability and long-term stability of track structures, it is essential to intelligently upgrade maintenance methods. Track geometry irregularity (TGI) plays a critical role in line maintenance, as its acquisition and control efficiency directly impact maintenance effectiveness. The Chord-reference system (CR-system) is widely used for measuring TGI data, but these measurements often exhibit amplification or reduction at different wavelengths, making them unsuitable for precise track fine-tuning maintenance. In addition, traditional maintenance scheme design algorithm suffers from low solution efficiency when faced with large-scale decision variables. Therefore, we propose a two-stage physical-informed neural network (TS-PINN) approach for high-speed railway TGI Maintenance. In the first stage, we systematically introduce a PINN for TGI measurement (PINN-M) based on the classic CR-system principle, which can effectively rectify the measured TGI data into the real TGI data within a specific wavelength range. In the second stage, we propose a PINN for track fine-tuning (PINN-F) maintenance scheme design, which rectifies the real TGI data into maintenance scheme that meets specific track parameter constraints. By incorporating early stopping (ES) mechanism and shared network, we realize the automated design of maintenance schemes with specified Track Quality Index (TQI) targets using rapid measured TGI data. Case results show that the proposed approach has good robustness, can significantly reduce maintenance costs, and improve the efficiency of TGI maintenance.},

The key challenges are how to predict and quantify the trajectory uncertainty of other traffic participants, and perform high-quality real-time trajectory planning in dynamic and complex environments. To address these challenges, this paper presents an uncertainty-aware safe trajectory planner based on model predictive control, which considers the uncertain trajectory of the target vehicle and enhances the system safety. To predict the trajectory uncertainty of the target vehicle, a trajectory prediction method combining kinematics and reachable set is proposed, which can reduce the conservatism compared to robust invariant set. To ensure vehicle safety in uncertain environments, an uncertainty-aware safe trajectory planner is established, which extend the control barrier function to uncertain system, and the control barrier function safety constraints are constructed based on the probabilistic n-step reachable set of the target vehicle trajectory. In addition, safety constraints including safe distance from the target vehicle, vehicle handling stability, road boundary, actuator saturation constraints are taken into account. Finally, simulation results show that the proposed planner can improve the system safety and feasibility in uncertain environments compared with other baseline methods. Additionally, its robustness is validated by analyzing the impact of different levels of uncertainty in complex scenarios. Moreover, the real-time performance is verified by the hardware-in-the-loop experiment, which proves that the planner can be applied in real-world autonomous vehicle systems.},

  abstract     = {Marine transportation constitutes a vital segment of international trade logistics. Recognizing marine carrier ship types is essential for the governance and efficiency of the marine transportation sector. Recognizing ship types by analyzing Automatic Identification System (AIS) trajectory data represents a fundamental aspect of trajectory classification within Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). Due to their data representation limitations, traditional CNNs and RNNs struggle to simultaneously process the topological relationships and the attributes of trajectory points. This restriction significantly hinders the learning of micro-activity behaviors of ships. To overcome this, we introduce Graph Isomorphic Network (GIN), a new variant of graphical neural networks with enhanced representation capabilities. Therefore, this study develops a GIN-based framework for graph representation learning. Initially, ship trajectories are represented as vector graph structures, with both original and derived features incorporated into the node embeddings. Subsequently, a GIN-based model for graph representation learning is employed to extract features necessary for ship type recognition. The model’s performance is evaluated through experiments on ground truth data from the Gulf of Mexico and the New Jersey Bight, achieving recognition accuracies of 93.95% and 92.33%, respectively. The high accuracy and robustness of the model substantiate the effectiveness of the proposed method in ship type recognition. This research illustrates that GIN-based graph representation learning can efficiently capture trajectory features, offering a valuable reference for motion trajectory representation extraction and pattern recognition in diverse geographical contexts.},

In this paper, we introduce a non-cooperative game that extends a closed queueing model into a competitive environment, in which players decide the number of jobs that they wish to submit. This can be used to model vehicle sharing systems with multiple providers, in which they receive fares from trips but are responsible for the costs of their own fleet. The core technical results of this paper include conditions that guarantee the existence of a pure Nash equilibrium, and an efficient equilibrium-finding algorithm. We then present a case study, using our model, of a vehicle sharing system in Oslo with multiple providers. In this case study, we find that adding an additional competitor can increase the number of trips by up to 18.9%, and a highly competitive market can increase this by up to 30%.},

Nevertheless, these methods often yield numerous redundant interactions, potentially resulting in unstable predictions and diffuse interactions. Consequently, there is a pressing need to enhance the application of these methods in trajectory prediction within IoV contexts. Motivated by these challenges, our work introduces a sparse spatial-temporal Transformer (SSTT) to predict vehicle trajectories. SSTT consists of two main Transformer modules: the sparse spatial Transformer and the local-global temporal Transformer. We integrate a learnable sparse plugin into the former to minimize extraneous information in spatial interactions. This plugin enables SSTT to focus more effectively on critical interactive neighbor vehicles by optimizing attention weight distribution, thereby enhancing optimization convergence and prediction accuracy. For the latter, local time windows are employed to capture temporal local correlations and extend the attentional receptive field. Experimental results conducted on three real-world datasets demonstrate that SSTT achieves state-of-the-art performance, and even when only 15% of the training data is used, it can still outperform SOAT baselines. This study presents novel ideas and methodologies for advancing trajectory prediction techniques within the IoV paradigm. The code and our model will be available at GitHub.},

  abstract     = {This paper studies the Lyapunov-based adaptive neural network optimized tracking control problem for a class of unmanned fire fighting robots. Firstly, by reasonably simplifying the unmanned fire fighting robot (UFFR) and combining it with its actual working scene, a novel system model is created that takes into consideration both system uncertainties and external disturbances, including unknown friction factors and drag force. Then, the optimized tracking control scheme for the UFFR is devised by integrating both adaptive neural networks and the backstepping technique. The objective of introducing adaptive neural network technique is to overcome the challenge posed by solving the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation. Based on Lyapunov stability theory, it is demonstrated that all signals in the closed-loop system are semi-globally ultimately bounded and the output variables follow the reference signals to the desired accuracy. In the end, to validate the effectiveness of our designed control scheme, numerical simulations and practical platform experiments have been conducted.

The efficiency of these terminals is vital as it determines the throughput rate and operational cost-effectiveness, thereby affecting the logistical efficiency of supply chains and the economic performance of interconnected markets. This paper discusses how efficiency can be increased with respect to container transfer within a terminal. Therefore, two mathematical models of the terminal operations are derived, which represent the transshipment and movement of containers within the terminal as well as between different modes of transport. For both models, finite-dimensional optimization problems are formulated and solved numerically using the optimization software WORHP for different scenarios. Results indicate that the proposed optimal control strategy is capable of effectively utilizing resources in the maritime container terminal where as the amounts of containers in the yard in for unoptimised case reach 35000 containers and for the optimised case it is varied between 4850 and 5100 containers.},

  abstract     = {Cracks are the most common disease in road maintenance work. They will accelerate the aging and damage of the pavement and bring potential risks to driving safety. Automatic detection of pavement cracks ensures infrastructure road safety. However, automatic detection of pavement cracks has always faced many challenges, such as irregular crack shapes and background noise interference. The existing methods ignore the correlation between cracked pixels, and there are some problems such as loss of detail information, lack of feature fusion and semantic gap. A Multi-Attention Fusion Dual-Branch Network(MFDB-Net) is proposed to accurately detect complete cracks. In this network, a dual-branch network is used as the backbone. A deeper branch extracts the semantic information of cracks, and a shallower branch retains more crack detail information. In addition, multiscale features are extracted by connecting multiple dilated convolutions in series with different convolution kernel sizes, which establishes global context connections. The attention mechanism is introduced to extract high-level network features and low-level network features respectively. Fusing features brings into play the characteristics of different network layers. Five publicly available crack datasets are used in our experiments, and the assessment is performed based on six evaluation metrics. We achieve F1-score of 0.879 and MIoU of 0.886 on the DeepCrack, F1-score of 0.737 and MIoU of 0.775 on the Crack500, F1-score of 0.571 and MIoU of 0.698 on the CrackTree200, and F1-score of 0.602 and MIoU of 0.712 on the EdmCrack600.

  abstract     = {Haze deteriorates the quality of captured images, which severely limits the accuracy of clean image-trained object detectors in hazy conditions. Source-free domain adaptation (SFDA) aims to adapt a clean source image-trained detector to the unlabeled hazy target domain without access to the clean source domain data. However, existing source-free object detection (SFOD) methods encounter two issues when leveraging pseudo labeling paradigm: 1) the large domain shift between clear and hazy images may introduce noises in pseudo labels, 2) the single confidence threshold-based methods may ignore valuable information of the low-confidence samples. To address these issues, we propose a multi-level guided discrepancy learning-based approach for SFOD in hazy conditions, named MGDL. Specifically, we first propose a differentiated enhancement module (DEM) to intentionally augment the diversity of data styles. It uses dehazing and random perturbation to generate reliable high-quality labels and strengthen the tolerance to haze-related factors. To enhance the consistency constraints for discrepancy learning, we propose a multi-level guiding strategy (MLGS) which consists of a dual label-level and an instance-level guidance. Considering that false negatives may dominate in noisy labels, we propose a dual label-level guiding (DLG) strategy to excavate comprehensive useful information from high- and low-confidence samples. Besides, an instance-level contrastive learning (ICL) approach is proposed to guide the model to focus on objects and make the model insensitive to style at the same time. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple datasets have demonstrated that our method achieves superior performance over the state-of-the-art SFOD methods.},

However, as smart sensing technologies become more widely used with the advent of the Internet of Things (IoT), intruders have found vehicular sensor networks to be a soft target. In this article, an optimized Attention Induced Multi Head Convolutional Neural Network for Intrusion Detection System in VANETs (AIMHCNN-IDS-VANET) is proposed. The data is collected from the CAN_HCRL_OTIDS dataset. This data is fed to a pre-processing segment where Tanh-based normalization (ThN) is used to normalize the data. Then, the pre-processed data serves as input to AIMHCNN which classifies the data into denial of service (DoS) attack, fuzzy attack, impersonation attack, and normal (attack-free). In general, AIMHCNN doesn’t express some adaption of optimization approaches to determine optimal parameters to assure accurate classification of attack detection. Hence, the Capuchin search optimization algorithm is proposed to enhance the weight parameter of the AIMHCNN classifier, which precisely classifies the IDS. The proposed method is implemented and its efficacy is analyzed on several performance parameters. The method is observed to attain higher accuracy, higher precision, and higher specificity when compared with existing methods.},

  abstract     = {Lane detection is a challenging task due to the inherently sparse nature of lanes, which are characterized by their thin and long structures. However, existing lane detection methods often rely on dense anchors or interactions and may not well handle the sparse characteristics of lanes. Dense anchor-based methods are not fully end-to-end, necessitating non-maximum suppression to eliminate near-duplicate detection results. Recently, DETR-like methods have emerged, aiming to achieve end-to-end lane detection with sparse queries. Nevertheless, these methods establish dense interactions among all image tokens, which not only leads to substantial computational redundancy, but also complicates the extraction of sparse lane features from global feature maps. To tackle these issues, we propose a novel end-to-end lane detection framework called Sparse LaneFormer, which leverages both sparse proposals and interactions. Specifically, we introduce a Lane Aware Query (LAQ) as sparse lane proposals, which can predict learnable and explicit lane positions. Additionally, we introduce a Lane Token Selector (LTS) and a Linear Deformable Sampler (LDS) to establish sparse interactions among lane tokens. LTS selectively updates sparse lane tokens in the encoder, while LDS, in the decoder, extracts discriminative lane representations from global feature maps by sampling lane features along LAQ. By concentrating on the most informative tokens, Sparse LaneFormer can achieves state-of-the-art performance with only 10% of encoder tokens, resulting in an 80% reduction in overall computational cost compared to its dense counterpart. Our Sparse LaneFormer represents a pioneering effort in exploring a fully sparse design for lane detection, setting a new benchmark for efficiency and accuracy in this field.},

  abstract     = {The CAN bus is the most widely used bus for intra-vehicle communication due to its high transmission stability, excellent real-time communication capability, and relatively low cost. As the number of ECUs grows, the CAN bus load increases and thus raises the possibility of data transmission delays and errors. Message compression based on the differential algorithm has been proposed to reduce the CAN bus load. However, current works do not consider the security problems of the CAN bus. Attackers can manage to acquire the original messages before compression and disturb the message statistics to decrease compression rate by injecting malicious frames. In this paper, we propose a secure compression mechanism for the intra-vehicle network, including an improved compression algorithm, a stream key distribution scheme, and a hierarchical encryption scheme. Formal verification results show that the proposed scheme can achieve mutual authentication, message confidentiality and integrity, resist replay attacks, and support secure compression. Evaluations using real vehicle data on 16 MHz boards show the average communication overhead can be reduced by 46.38% compared to the original messages. Performance analysis results show our scheme can reduce computational overhead on compression by 31.82% and 19.43% on decompression compared to related schemes.},

However, a noticeable gap exists in the availability of Eco-driving methodologies tailored to mitigate conflicts between pedestrians and vehicles. In response, this study proposes a Vehicle-to-Pedestrian communication Eco-driving (V2P Eco-driving) strategy that operates without traffic lights and incorporates collaborative pedestrian trajectory prediction. Its performance is evaluated through a comparative study with the Ecological Intelligent Traffic Lights System (Eco-ITLS) strategy, which adjusts traffic light phases based on pedestrian and vehicle flow detection. To enhance the generalization of the prediction model, pedestrian social interactions are modeled using relative displacement and velocity metrics, while Kalman filtering mitigates systemic discrepancies in vehicular and infrastructural components. A modified distance-discrete dynamic programming (D-DDP) algorithm, accounting for remaining travel time, is introduced to optimize eco-friendly vehicle actions. The algorithm is benchmarked against other Eco-driving algorithms in terms of solution quality, memory consumption, and computational efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model achieves a balance between computational efficiency and solution quality. Real-world data validation and parameter calibration confirm its practicality. Simulations further highlight the V2P Eco-driving strategy’s significant potential for reducing energy consumption and emissions compared to conventional traffic light-based Eco-driving strategies.},

The HTLVDM in-corporates locomotive and wagon components, along with nonlinear hysteresis characteristics of the coupler draft gear. Thus, the air braking system, which delivers pressure signals from the brake pipe to the brake cylinder via a control valve, is coupled to the locomotive and wagon dynamics system through a brake shoe. This model facilitates studying the dynamic performance of the entire system under varied train formations and braking strategies. Using this model, we compare and analyze the impacts of the fluid dynamics model (FDM) and empirical model (EM) of the air braking system on train dynamics behavior. Results reveal significant differences in train dynamic behavior between FDM and EM simulations, highlighting the necessity of employing the FDM for evaluating train operation safety.},

  abstract     = {Connected Automated Vehicles (CAVs) represent a transformative shift in transportation, offering enhanced safety, and efficiency. However, achieving full automation at levels four and five of the Society of Automotive Engineering (SAE) scale poses significant cybersecurity and privacy risks. To address these risks, United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) regulations and ISO/SAE 21434 mandate Threat Analysis and Risk Assessment (TARA) as a core methodology for cyber risk management. Existing TARA frameworks, designed for conventional vehicles, fall short for higher automation levels, neglecting complexities such as the absence of human control and data-driven decision making concerns. This work, conducted within ULTIMO, a project tackling the CAVs deployment challenges, introduces TARA 2.0, an enhanced framework addressing cybersecurity, privacy, and expert subjectivity in risk assessment. A step-by-step experimental implementation demonstrates its feasibility, compliance with standards, and potential to secure the deployment of fully automated vehicles.},

  abstract     = {Due to the input of high-dimensional data in end-to-end autonomous driving, if the feature extraction network is trained online from scratch, it will lead to difficulties in learning and decision-making. To solve this challenging problem, this paper proposes a predefined multi-modal image method to improve decision-making accuracy and a shared framework to quickly train all networks. The inputs are composed of various observations including bird’s-eye view, state, and front view, rather than traditional sensor raw data. They can be filtered out ineffectual features based on human prior knowledge to avoid over-exploration with invalid changes, such as light, trees, mountains, etc. Combined with the processed representations, predefined images are formed by embedding the trajectory, forbidden line, etc. The method can assist agents to capture the coupling relationship between the actions and states, allowing networks to positively adjust weights to quickly obtain expected rewards. Considering that embedding a feature extraction network into reinforcement learning networks will lead to repeated cumulative calculations, a shared framework is proposed to independently compress features while jointly participates in online training to reduce computing costs. This module dynamically combines the policy and critic to update its weights, which overcomes decision-making problems caused by inaccurate the latent feature sequence during pre-training and fine-tuning methods. Finally, the interactive environment is constructed on a realistic driving simulator CARLA, and the fusion of different modal states is explored. The results showed that the multi-modal fusion can explore to earn maximum rewards, and the proposed methods are effective for the training.},

The separating boundary represents a locus of stationary traffic states, i.e., the fundamental diagram. To fit fundamental diagrams, we develop an enhanced cross entropy minimization method that honors equilibrium traffic physics. We illustrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach by comparing it with the traditional approach that uses local speed-density states and least squares estimation. Our experiments show that the separating boundary in our approach is invariant to varying trajectory samples within the same spatio-temporal region, providing further evidence that the separating boundary is indeed a locus of stationary traffic states.},

  abstract     = {Accurate localization of autonomous vehicles is crucial for autonomous driving and safety, especially in complex urban environments where high-precision GPS is not available. Visual place recognition (VPR) uses visual cues to identify the current location from a known database, serving as an auxiliary means for precise localization in autonomous driving. In real-world applications, variations in scene appearance due to changes in illumination and seasons present significant challenges for VPR. Current VPR methods often fail in adverse visual environments due to their inability to provide robust scene descriptions. Therefore, the extraction of stable and effective information from images is relatively important. In this paper, we propose a novel feature extraction network, termed SBCNet. This network is designed to capture semantic boundaries and texture details within images by training an auxiliary semantic boundary detection task. By focusing on these fundamental elements, the model’s perceptual capacity for structural features can be enhanced. Moreover, we introduce a semantic edge attention module that generates spatial attention maps based on semantic edges and texture details, allowing for the comprehensive utilization of pivotal structural cues. With this explicit guide, the network prioritizes local regions with appearance invariance during the feature extraction process. Experimental results demonstrate that our method maintains robust performance under various adverse visual conditions. Even in low-light environments, such as those encountered at night, our method exhibits commendable performance.},

Automated vehicles continue to encounter significant challenges in perception, prediction, and decision-making, while their low-level modules are relatively mature and robust. Conversely, humans surpass machines in terms of high-level intelligence but may suffer from control performance degradation. To coalesce the strength of the human and machine, a novel collaboration scheme is proposed to compensate for the prediction-decision uncertainty via human guidance while providing low-level control feedback to the driver. This approach generates multiple decision candidates and corresponding predictions for other road users using a transformer-based socially compliant generative adversarial network (SCGAN). The driver can assist in choosing the appropriate candidate using the context-understanding capability, while concurrently, the control projection of this chosen decision guides the driver to achieve the desired objective via haptic steering feedback. The haptic feedback can reflect the decision uncertainties enabled by the decision-control projection of the intention estimation of the ego vehicle. A Type-II fuzzy controller is utilized to determine the control authority to account for the complexity of the future movement. We verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm through a real-time human-in-the-loop experiment, including an ablation study and comparisons with other human-machine collaboration schemes. The results demonstrate that the proposed scheme can minimize human-machine conflicts while increasing system safety.},

  abstract     = {Intelligent transportation systems (ITS) are transforming modern mobility, with vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication emerging as a critical technology for enhancing transportation safety and efficiency. However, the dynamic nature of vehicular networks presents significant challenges, including unreliable channel state information and limited spectrum resources. These limitations can compromise the reliable and low-latency transmission of safety-critical data. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a robust approach for device-to-device (D2D)-based V2X communication networks, focusing on jointly optimizing channel reuse and power allocation to maximize information transmission success rate (SR) and average energy efficiency (AE). A two-step strategy is developed: Firstly, a long-timescale Kuhn-Munkres (LTKM) algorithm is devised to improve channel efficiency through intelligent channel reuse decisions. Secondly, the power allocation problem is modeled as a Markov decision process (MDP) and resolved using a proximal policy optimization (PPO)-based algorithm, enhancing the network’s robustness to time-varying vehicular network scenario. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method. Compared to the original Kuhn-Munkres algorithm, the signaling overhead of our approach is reduced by approximately 82%. Furthermore, compared to three benchmark schemes, our approach improves overall performance by approximately 11%, 20%, 33%, and 61%, respectively. Moreover, our approach exhibits more stable performance under different vehicle speeds, which further highlights the robustness of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {Roadside perception can significantly enhance the safety of autonomous vehicles by extending their perceptual capabilities beyond the visual range and addressing occluded regions. However, current state-of-the-art vision-based roadside detection methods exhibit high accuracy on labeled scenes but perform poorly on new scenes. This limitation arises because roadside cameras remain stationary after installation and can only gather data from a single scene, leading the algorithm to overfit these roadside backgrounds and camera positions. To tackle this issue, we propose an innovative Scenario Generalization Framework for Vision-based Roadside 3D Object Detection, called SGV3D. Specifically, we utilize a Background-suppressed Module (BSM) to reduce background overfitting in vision-centric pipelines by diminishing background features during the 2D to bird’s-eye-view projection. Furthermore, by introducing the Semi-supervised Data Generation Pipeline (SSDG) that employs unlabeled images from new scenes, we generate diverse foreground instances with varying camera poses, mitigating the risk of overfitting to specific camera positions. Experiments conducted on two large-scale roadside benchmarks demonstrate that SGV3D, with only a minimal increase in latency, effectively improves the scenario generalization capabilities of vision-based roadside 3D object detectors. The code is available here (https://github.com/yanglei18/SGV3D).},

Freeways, where reliable perception is crucial for safe navigation, present higher safety risks. Lidar’s ability to provide precise depth information and function effectively in challenging scenarios becomes essential. However, fewer studies have explored roadway readiness for lidar-based performance. This study identified the effects of freeway design and condition on lane-detection performance of lidar-based AVs through a field test on two typical freeways in Shanghai, China, and the freeway readiness was evaluated. The Tongji University Road and Traffic Data Acquisition System was used for data collection. The lane-detection failure was treated as the label. Ten variables of five feature types were considered as the parameters, including road geometry, road segment, road marking, vehicle operation, and environment. The XGBoost ensemble machine learning algorithm and the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) were used for modeling and interpretation, respectively. Results show: 1) all features except for light condition were strongly correlated to lidar-based lane-detection failures; 2) higher failure probability was observed under circumstances like the presence of larger change rate of vertical curves, right-most lane with entrance or exit, taper extensions, special markings like words, worn-out markings, higher speed, and closer leading large-vehicle distance; and 3) several interaction effects were discovered. Results provide three contributions to AV safety: 1) make freeway design better accommodate to AVs; 2) provide ODD management references; and 3) offer technical improvement focuses to manufacturers.},

Finally, the efficacy of the proposed N-IDA-PBC is evaluated through Monte Carlo simulations, where the neural networks training of N-IDA-PBC uses $3,000$ randomly generated data points and $20,000$ samples of Monte-Carlo simulation are performed, taking into account uncertainties in the systems’ parameters, including initial states, physical damping, and payload masses.

It has become a trend to fuse multi-sensor information to achieve 3D MOT, since it can leverage the advantages of different sensors to enhance tracking performance. However, it is a challenging work due to the necessity of fusing features with diverse attributes and wrong association caused by significant noise. In this paper, we propose adaptive weight parameter-based multi-feature fusion to create affinity function, alongside adaptive setting of data association searching range, aiming to augment camera-Lidar information fusion-based MOT framework. First, detected results from these two sensors are divided into three categories. Then, to fully utilize both motion and appearance information, adaptive weight parameter setting is proposed to embed appearance information into motion information, forming the basis for creating an affinity function for data association. Furthermore, to mitigate wrong association caused by object temporary occlusion or out-of-view, a method for adaptively adjusting the association searching area is introduced based on the number of frames in which tracking trajectories disappear. Finally, to prevent appearance information pollution caused by significant noise, a confidence score-based tracking trajectory appearance feature updating strategy is explored. The experiment results on KITTI and nuScenes MOT benchmark show remarkable performance improvement over other state-of-the-art MOT methods and demonstrate the effect of our designed modules.},

To fill this gap, the variance inference ensemble network is proposed to enhance environmental perception and quantify uncertainty for 3-D object detection in point cloud. Specifically, the method is divided into three parts. Several variance inference neural networks that adopt multivariate Gaussian distribution for direct modeling are first constructed through a two-stage training strategy, extracting both the object details and variances from point cloud data in parallel. Following this, an uncertainty-aware fusion strategy is designed to integrate and filter the multiple results above based on the associated uncertainty and yield reliable and comprehensive results. Furthermore, a novel metric, uncertainty index, is coined to estimate the uncertainty of detected objects for the single deterministic network and ensemble network in a unified and quantitative manner. Finally, we validate our method on the KITTI dataset. The experiment demonstrates that our method outperforms the original baseline and recent uncertainty quantification methods across different scenarios.},

Note that the existing related works mainly focus on providing trajectory planning methods for overtaking vehicle. However, to achieve overtaking along the trajectory, what initial conditions does the vehicle need to satisfy has not been fully investigated. The challenge is that the initial conditions for the vehicle depend on multiple physical constraints in the trajectory planning, which are often difficult to be analytically solved. To overcome this difficulty, the proposed overtaking trajectory is decomposed into several cubic Bézier spiral segments firstly. Then, according to the decomposition, the multiple constraints with respect to the overtaking trajectory are simplified, based on which the solvability of the constraints is analyzed. Specifically, from the analysis, it is shown that if the initial linear velocity of the vehicle is less than $5/6$ times of the maximum linear velocity, then the multiple constraints can be solved, which implies that the vehicle can achieve overtaking along the proposed trajectory. Moreover, to avoid collision of two vehicles, a safety initial distance between two vehicles is determined. In addition, a control algorithm for the overtaking vehicle is given, which enables the overtaking vehicle to drive along the proposed overtaking trajectory. Finally, the theoretical results are verified through the simulations and experiments.},

  abstract     = {Difficulty in parking leads to many issues, such as traffic congestion, and hinders the development of intelligent transportation systems. One significant reason is that the cruise parking does not fully utilize real-time information about the parking lot (e.g., availability status of the parking spaces), resulting in low parking efficiency and high parking costs. Even though reservation parking improves parking efficiency, its reservation service is coarse (e.g., could not reserve a specific parking space). Therefore, to achieve more efficient parking and optimize existing reservation services, we propose a real-time parking space view (PSV) framework (called PRPSV). PSV can reflect the position distribution and availability status of each parking space in a parking lot, which enables drivers to quickly and efficiently obtain real-time parking information and complete parking decisions. However, there have been fewer studies on PSV in recent years, and these methods are high-cost, limited scalability, and do not use PSV to optimize parking efficiency and services. Therefore, we propose a method to construct and update PSV accurately. Further, we model cruise and reservation modes in non-PSV and PSV-based scenarios to compare and analyze the impact of PSV on parking efficiency. Finally, the comprehensive qualitative comparison with related work demonstrates the innovativeness of PRPSV and the sufficient experimental results and a case study in an actual parking lot show that PRPSV can efficiently and accurately construct and update PSV, and the introduction of PSV can effectively improve parking efficiency and optimize reservation services.},

  abstract     = {Platooning is a main connected and automated vehicle (CAV) application that can significantly enhance traffic efficiency and decrease ecological impacts. In the merging scenario, the advantages of platooning are generally impaired by the lane-changing behaviors of the on-ramp vehicles. This paper proposes a platoon-based cooperative ecological merging control framework, utilizing centralized decision-making and distributed control. More specifically, this framework includes a strategy layer and a control layer. The strategy layer aims to predict the future status of both mainline and on-ramp platoons and develops a sequencing game to determine an optimal merging sequence and speed-adaption time instant to minimize the total carbon emission and delay. The control layer designs a platoon controller based on Distributed Model Predictive Control, which solves the local optimization problem of each vehicle in the platoon. Thus, the framework is not limited to the number of vehicles in the scenario and achieves a system-optimal objective while being optimal for a single vehicle. The proposed control framework is compared against the existing first-in-first-out rule, cooperative three-player game, and search tree. Our numerical experiments demonstrate a better performance of the proposed framework.},

  abstract     = {Traffic capacity is an important indicator of traffic supply capability. An accurate portrayal of intersection capacity serves as a foundation for various intersection management studies, supporting the optimization of traffic operational efficiency and resource allocation. However, existing research on autonomous intersections primarily estimates intersection capacity through simulation experiments, which often suffer from low efficiency. Consequently, the challenge lies in developing more convenient methods for capacity analysis in such environments. To address this gap, this paper proposes analytical models for the traffic capacity of autonomous intersections based on queuing theory. Firstly, the analytical model of the traffic capacity in the conflict zones is derived. Based on that, the capacity model for the autonomous intersection is developed by incorporating vehicle interaction modes, varying arrival rates, and distinct turning ratios for each approach. Depending on the settings of safety time headways, two models, referred to as the specific and uniform cases, are considered. Further, the capacity range, queuing length, and queuing time of the two scenarios are derived. Finally, the rationality and accuracy of the proposed models are verified based on numerical simulations. The results show that the proposed models can better estimate the actual operating conditions of autonomous intersections. The average errors of the autonomous intersection model in the one-lane intersection scenario are less than 2%, with a 22% error reduction from the baseline model. Besides, the average errors of the multi-lane autonomous intersection model are less than 4%. The average relative and absolute errors between the model predictions and simulation results for queuing length and queuing time are negligible. The proposed models offer valuable insights for intersection design, level of service determination, and management control strategy selection.},

Instead of assuming a constant coefficient for each variable in the conventional multinomial logit model, the proposed mixed c-logit model assumes a certain probability distribution for each coefficient, in an attempt to better reflect the drivers’ preference heterogeneity. A commonality factor is introduced in the model to address roadway travel time correlations due to route overlaps. Three Bayesian models with different hierarchy levels are introduced and are solved using mean-field variational inference with the block coordinate algorithm. In the reduced subnetwork of the examined area, the drivers are assumed to make their route choices in three groups of routes, referred to as choice groups. Attributes that would affect the truck driver’s route choice decisions are different among choice groups. With this setting, the proposed Bayesian models are then tested with the three truck route choice groups respectively. Generally, the study finds that the factors considered in truckers’ route choice vary with context.},

Syst., vol. 24, no. 12, pp. 14506-14519, Dec. 2023). In this paper, we demonstrate that their signcryption protocol lacks robustness against public key replacement attacks, and then introduce an enhanced signcryption protocol secure in the random oracles. Our certificate-based and identity-based heterogeneous signcryption protocol enables communication between entities in different cryptosystems, while ensuring pseudonym-based conditional privacy for vehicles. Additionally, it supports public verification for tracing malicious behavior from anonymous vehicles. Unlike other protocols, our protocol avoids costly pairings or map-to-point hashes, and incorporates online/offline construction and batch verification, significantly reducing communication delays and computational overhead. Performance analysis shows that our protocol outperforms existing approaches in VANETs.},

  abstract     = {Scenario-based testing offers a robust method for evaluating the safety of Autonomous Vehicles (AVs). In this study, we introduce LSTM-CGAN to generate scenarios for assessing AV safety performance. First, we extract static, environmental, and dynamic elements from the China In-depth Mobility Safety Study-Traffic Accident (CIMSS-TA) dataset and reconstruct 630 real-world crashes to obtain pre-crash trajectories of the ego and objective vehicles. The proposed model then synthesizes samples by utilizing high-risk trajectories extracted from pre-crash trajectories, resulting in the generation of 6,300 trajectories, ten times the original dataset. The synthesized samples closely resemble real-world trajectories while enhancing diversity, with 61.9% of road segment and 55.5% of intersection trajectories scenes being classified as challenging. By integrating static and dynamic elements with the synthesized trajectories, critical scenarios for counterfactual simulations are generated. Finally, the Baidu Apollo, a well-known Autonomous Driving System (ADS), is tested in simulations using both generated and original scenarios. It is evidenced that the proposed method is effective in generating more safety-critical scenarios and that static and environmental factors have different impacts on AV performance. This study provides valuable insights into the unknown safety-critical scenario construction of AV safety testing, thereby facilitating the commercialization of AVs.},

  abstract     = {The increasing use of virtual reality (VR) in public transportation enables travelers to engage in immersive entertainment or productive tasks, thereby enhancing the overall travel experience. However, mismatched VR visual motion and physical car motion can cause motion sickness (MS), leading to nausea, postural instability and reduced time for enjoyment or productive tasks. Thus, the benefits of using VR in transportation systems are currently limited to individuals who do not experience MS. Thus, effective MS mitigation is essential for improving travel safety, maximizing travel time, and expanding VR accessibility. Neuromodulation targeting the vestibular apparatus, such as bone-conducted vibration (BCV), has shown promise in reducing MS. However, it remains unclear whether neuromodulation directly targeting vestibular cortical regions, such as transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS), is superior. This paper focuses on the design and validation of a novel vestibular cortical neuromodulation approach using tACS in mitigating MS in a novel simulated in-car VR environment. Eighty participants were recruited to evaluate the tACS approach. The results demonstrate that the proposed tACS approach effectively reduces nausea, enhances postural stability, and extends survival time in MS. Compared to BCV, tACS demonstrates a faster onset of action and longer mitigation effects. However, from an applied perspective, the effects of our tACS approach were relatively short-lived and accompanied by side effects such as tingling and itching.},

Current deep models are restricted to small road networks and cannot adapt to or learn large-scale, variable, and noisy trajectories. From a data-driven perspective, we effectively applied and developed a transformer function and proposed a transformer-based map matching (MMformer) for large-scale road networks. This model does not require maps and trajectories to be gridded, and directly runs on the vectors of trajectory points. The decoder module can learn, gather, and store the connections of road segments; therefore, the outputs of the decoder have a graph-like inductive bias. Trajectory point vector, including coming direction, enhances encoder and decoder performance. After experimenting with different embedding modules, the trajectory point vectors were embedded using a single linear layer. Extensive experiments demonstrated that MMformer can perform the map-matching task for large-scale road networks, and its map-matching accuracy on large-scale road networks is 10% higher than that of existing models on small road networks.},

This proliferation can be accredited to various advances such as low-latency connectivity, fast execution of control commands, high reliability and more importantly their potential for autonomous operations. Consequently, this allowed the information fusion community to develop various methods of fusion of different types of data. However, these methods in general do not thoroughly consider the proliferation of cyber attacks targeting UAS vehicles especially for civilian and military missions. In this paper, we propose a novel approach leveraging information fusion to secure autonomous drone operations entitled Information Fusion for Secure Drone Operations (IFSDO). Our solution allows the distribution and enforcement of security policies and dynamic spectrum allocation policies to drones during all mission phases depending on the user role. IFSDO works by orchestrating different techniques including cryptography, attribute-based access control and ontological rules to allow the drone to autonomously and securely manage various types of access requests to ensure the mission can be conducted safely. We validate our findings with a case study illustrating the initial exchange of critical data between the security manager and the drone as part of a civilian package delivery mission involving several stakeholders interacting with the drones.

Due to the openness of wireless communication in IIoV, a secure authentication protocol is needed to protect vehicle anonymity and communication privacy. However, existing protocols do not address inter-domain Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) communication and suffer from security risks such as key escrow issue, message leakage, and high overhead performance issues. Therefore, we propose a provable privacy-preserving authentication protocol for V2V communication that can guarantee the anonymity security of vehicle identities and the integrity confidentiality of communication messages in V2V communication (including intra-RSU domain V2V communication and inter-RSU domain V2V communication). For privacy-sensitive IIoV scenarios, the proposed protocol supports batch signature authentication of messages and shared responsibility revocation of malicious vehicle identities, which can solve the problems of limited system resources and security risks. The proposed protocol is robust. It is shown to be resistant to multiple malicious attacks through a formal security analysis under the Real-or-Random (ROR) model. In addition, We have simulated the proposed protocol using SUMO, OMNET++. Compared with the existing protocols, we find that the proposed protocol satisfies more security properties and has an excellent performance with low computation cost, communication cost, storage cost, packet loss rate and delay.},

In this study, to address these issues, a vehicle violation reporting service is proposed using reputation systems and a physically unclonable function. The proposed scheme ensures secure authentication between vehicles and RSUs, facilitates an efficient search for invalid signatures, and overcomes the limitations present in ID-based conditional privacy-preserving authentication schemes. Moreover, considering the dynamic VANET environment, the distribution of invalid signatures may vary across multiple scenarios. Therefore, a fault-tolerant mechanism is proposed to ensure the robustness of this approach. Security proof with the random oracle model and detailed security analysis proved that the scheme could satisfy the security requirements of VANETs. Our scheme outperforms related approaches in terms of authentication overhead and the identification of invalid signatures, achieving superior performance in both aspects.},

  abstract     = {Cooperative multi-robot task allocation is a fundamental aspect of autonomous intelligent systems that has garnered considerable research interest. Nevertheless, given that environments are dynamic and uncertain, resilience mechanisms must be studied further. In this paper, we propose a novel mechanism based on the variable fractional network evolutionary game (FNEG), which provides a new paradigm for heterogeneous multi-robot task allocation. Specifically, given communication and timeliness constraints, the problem of task allocation is formulated as an evolutionary network game model. In particular, a kernel of the integral operator based on the variable function is intended to enhance the nearsightedness and memorylessness of traditional replicator dynamics. Next, long-term payoffs are introduced to analyze the evolutionary process of task allocation. Furthermore, the stability of the evolutionary equilibrium strategy is demonstrated. Experiments and comparisons on different scenarios demonstrate that the proposed model is effective for enhancing load balancing and completion rate. The model is scalable in terms of computation time reduction and is resilient in its ability to adapt to system perturbations.},

  abstract     = {Container detection and localization are crucial for the automated loading and unloading of containers. In automating rubber-tired gantry cranes (RTGs) for container handling, small- and medium-sized terminals are increasingly favoring for vision-based solutions over expensive LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) systems. However, conventional image processing-based methods fail to meet robustness and real-time requirements in practical settings. Meanwhile, deep learning-based object detection approaches offer greater adaptability to complex environments but are limited by their dependence on large-scale datasets and insufficient localization accuracy. To address these challenges, this paper presents a three-stage container detection and localization method for RTGs, exploiting a Segment Anything Model and image processing. First, an Auto-Prompting Segment Anything Model (AP-SAM) is proposed for the first time. It strengthens the similarity between reference and target features by training a feature adaptor module that uses only a single reference image with segmentation labels. Next, local peak points of the similarity map are selected as prompts, guiding the SAM to achieve initial container segmentation. Subsequently, we design an image processing method considering a container’s structural and geometric characteristics to detect its top surface, castings, and lock holes. Furthermore, we propose a novel estimation strategy to infer the positions of unknown lock holes on the detected ones, significantly improving the location accuracy. Extensive experiments show that our proposed method achieves a container detection precision of 93.3% and an average location error of just 5.55 pixels, surpassing existing methods.},

  abstract     = {Driving through traffic scenes with occlusions safely, efficiently and comfortably remains a huge challenge for autonomous vehicles (AVs). The omnipresence of blind spots, where emergencies may arise unexpectedly, requires AVs to drive with adequate precautions. However, existing planning algorithms often resort to excessive conservatism that leads to navigation-disrupting deadlocks. To address these challenges, we adopt the concept of phantom obstacles, imparting them with uncertainties. At that point, we propose an integrated lateral and longitudinal trajectory planning method to emulate human-like precautionary driving styles, and adopt stochastic model predictive control (SMPC) to model various uncertainties of obstacles. Furthermore, we analyze deadlock causation mechanisms and present a novel quantified risk assessment method featuring an innovative adaptation of ST projection for occlusion-aware planning. This approach formulates a driving strategy that significantly reduces the likelihood of deadlock, enhancing the AV’s ability to navigate effectively in occluded scenarios. Case analysis and statistical research across diverse scenarios, featuring different objects in various typical settings, validate the safety, efficiency and comfort of the proposed planning results. These findings underscore the potential of our approach to advance the capabilities of autonomous vehicles in navigating complex and occluded driving environments.},

The effectiveness of the device was demonstrated through subjective and objective experimental data, including significantly increased endurance time with an average level of 40%, improved tolerance of MSI over 42%, no reduction of pupil diameter and less gaze dispersion. In summary, both positive physiological indicators and subjective ratings all suggested remarkable advantages of the device in enhancing participants’ MS tolerance level.

However, reinforcement learning suffers from safety issues and low learning efficiency, especially in the continuous action space. Therefore, the motivation of this paper is to address the above problem by proposing a hybrid Mechanism-Experience-Learning augmented approach. Specifically, to realize the efficient self-evolution, the driving tendency by analogy with human driving experience is proposed to reduce the search space of the autonomous driving problem, while the constrained optimization problem based on a mechanistic model is designed to ensure safety during the self-evolving process. Experimental results show that the proposed method is capable of generating safe and reasonable actions in various complex scenarios, improving the performance of the autonomous driving system. Compared to conventional reinforcement learning, the safety and efficiency of the proposed algorithm are greatly improved.

However, taking as input a front-view image from a single camera, most existing methods can only provide V-shaped semantic BEV maps, which limits the field-of-view for the BEV maps. To provide a solution to this problem, we propose a novel end-to-end network to generate semantic BEV maps in full view by taking as input the equidistant sequential images. Specifically, we design a self-adapted sequence fusion module to fuse the features from different images in a distance sequence. In addition, a road-aware view transformation module is introduced to wrap the front-view feature map into BEV based on an attention mechanism. We also create a dataset with semantic labels in full BEV from the public nuScenes data.

An ITS utilizes predictive models to identify potential problems and improves system operation reliability by analyzing real-time data streams from millions of sensors, actuators, and other recording devices. However, the collected data typically contain anomalies that can lead to inaccurate traffic system estimates. To evaluate the effectiveness of anomaly detection algorithms on ITS data, comparative analyses of different algorithms are conducted using both labeled and unlabeled data collected from the California Department of Transportation Performance Measurement System. The results highlight the robustness of certain algorithms, such as CBLOF (Cluster-Based Local Outlier Factor), in detecting both point and collective anomalies. Additionally, this study introduces an enhanced dynamic CBLOF algorithm that integrates adaptive windowing and incremental learning, enabling real-time updates and enhanced responsiveness to evolve traffic conditions. Experimental findings demonstrate that this enhancement significantly boosts anomaly detection accuracy while maintaining computational efficiency, making it well-suited for dynamic traffic scenarios. Furthermore, we explored the fusion of traffic domain knowledge with data features in anomaly detection. Our findings emphasize the importance of selecting appropriate algorithms that consider specific problems, evaluation indicators, and data characteristics. This research provides valuable insights for transportation authorities seeking to improve their ability to detect anomalous traffic events, ultimately leading to more effective traffic management and congestion reduction strategies.},

  abstract     = {Train platoons are a really innovative application for future railways, in which trains are virtually-coupled via Train-Train communication, so drastically reducing their headways and increasing line capacity. However, as the spacing between trains becomes closer, the influence of disturbances from preceding trains becomes more significant and cannot be ignored. This influence can have a substantial impact on the operational behavior of the following trains, leading to fluctuating spacing within the platoon and potentially compromising the safety and stability of the train spacing. This paper introduces a formalized modeling framework and a controller synthesis method for train platoons, aiming to achieve absolute safety and stable operation in train platoon operations. The framework utilizes Hybrid Priced Two-player Timed Game Automaton (HPTTGA) to describe train platoon dynamics and synthesizes controllers that satisfy safety requirements using an On-the-fly Controller Synthesis (OCS) algorithm, where the effectiveness of the algorithm is demonstrated through a two-train tracking example, and Q-learning is applied to select controller which satisfy local and string stability. Owing to model-based feature, the proposed method is compared to classical Model Predictive Control (MPC) in terms of safety, local stability, and string stability. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method consistently ensures train platoon safety and achieves similar control performance to MPC in extreme operating scenarios. Moreover, under velocity limit scenarios, the proposed method successfully achieves the desired following behavior of the trailing train according to the control objectives.},

  abstract     = {Safety driver vigilance is a prerequisite for the safe operation of autonomous vehicles. In contrast to vehicle behavioral trajectory detection, which suffers from high latency and low accuracy, vigilance detection based on physiological signals is currently the most reliable and accurate method. While vigilance monitoring methods using electroencephalograms (EEG) have made considerable progress in experimental scenarios, they remain a challenging problem in scenario-constrained conditions, such as high-speed moving autonomous vehicles. This is due to the low signal-to-noise ratio in EEG signal acquisition and the difficulty of real-time processing. Moreover, cumbersome data acquisition processes and the challenges of labeling have hindered progress in this area. Given the successful use of EEG for monitoring in experimental settings, we believe that the transfer of knowledge learned from these scenarios to new contexts is reasonably feasible. Thus, this work aims to bridge the domain gap between experimental and real-world scenarios while balancing the number of channels and accuracy. Specifically, we propose a framework for EEG vigilance detection capable of Cross-scenario, Cross-subject, and Cross-device, called CCC. The proposed framework leverages the standard montage structure of EEG channels, reducing the number of channels by considering the common regions of EEG channels across different scenarios. The results show that our proposed model achieves an average accuracy of 86.20% on the SEED-VIG dataset with 12 subjects, which is higher than the 82.21% achieved by state-of-the-art deep learning approaches. Finally, we investigate the role of the attention mechanism and transfer learning, and further attempt to explain the advantages of our proposed approach from a visualization perspective.},

  abstract     = {The adoption of autonomous vessels has been accelerated by the flourishing maritime economy and more stringent shipping regulations. Accurate sea state estimation (SSE) is of paramount importance for their safe operation. Traditional SSE methods face several limitations, including subjectivity in manual observation, high radar costs, and the insufficient timeliness of satellite data. In contrast, SSE methods based on ship motion data, particularly deep learning models, offer advantages in capturing complex nonlinear relationships. However, challenges persist, such as imbalanced sea state data, suboptimal performance under extreme conditions, and the complexity of ship motion data, which hampers effective feature extraction. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel deep learning model that integrates a dynamic attention mechanism with adaptive selective kernel modules and multi-scale feature fusion to capture spatiotemporal dependencies. Additionally, an enhanced prototype classifier, utilizing cosine similarity and dynamic prototype updating, is introduced to mitigate data imbalance and improve model robustness in extreme conditions. To evaluate the performance of the proposed model, we conducted experiments on 30 benchmark datasets for multivariate time series classification, as well as two sea state datasets. The comparison results demonstrate that our model outperforms most baseline methods in general multivariate time series classification tasks and also surpasses state-of-the-art methods for SSE and class imbalance learning. Furthermore, the experimental results show that the proposed model is robust to data noise and missing values.},

First, a six-objective Ma-IAO model is built considering three kinds of objective factors in railway design, namely economic, geologic and ecologic factors. Then, a Particle Swarm Optimization with Strengthened Pareto Dominance Analysis (SPDA-PSO) is developed to solve the model. Two types of external archives are primarily designed to store and update nondominated solutions during optimization with a specifically-proposed strengthened pareto dominance criterion (known as LC-dominance). Afterward, two elite selection operators are devised to search for Pareto corner and knee points within external archives as the best particle individuals for guiding SPDA-PSO evolution. Lastly, the proposed method has been applied to a complex real-world railway example. Through comparisons with a contemporary M-IAO method and the manual work of human designers, its effectiveness is confirmed via detailed data analyses.},

  abstract     = {Vehicle platooning has emerged as a promising solution for efficient traffic management. Multiple platoons traveling in a cooperative way can alleviate congestion and enhance driving safety by information sharing and consensus. To address the data security and privacy concerns, blockchain could be applied to enable secure data sharing and consensus across multiple platoons. However, existing performance of blockchain is insufficient to ensure reliable and efficient data consensus among multiple platoons. First, the hierarchical structure of platoons with different roles of vehicles complicates the trust establishment between platoons, making it challenging to evaluate their trustworthiness and ensure consensus reliability. Additionally, data sharing in vehicle platooning networks demands timely information and efficient consensus-building. To tackle above challenges, we design a role-adaptive trust model for trust evaluation of platoons in consideration of different roles of vehicles within a platoon. Based on the proposed model, we formulate a blockchain consensus optimization problem to facilitate both reliability and efficiency of data consensus among multiple platoons. Leveraging Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) techniques, we then propose the Diffusion Enhanced Soft Actor-Critic (DESAC) by integrating the diffusion model and SAC, to further improve the performance of blockchain consensus. Experiment results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed consensus optimization approach.},

  abstract     = {Pavement construction worldwide has expanded significantly, making maintenance of pavement infrastructure a highly challenging task. Traditional manual inspection methods are inefficient and costly, while deep learning-based object detection algorithms often underperform in complex scenarios such as shadowed pavement surfaces. To address these issues, by combining a shadow removal model (Residual Attention Cycle GAN, RACycle-GAN) and Damage Detection Enhanced YOLOv8 (DDE-YOLOv8), this paper proposes a shadow-robust pavement damage detection framework. By integrating the Residual Encoder-Decoder Block, two-branch spatial attention, and cycle consistency into the original DCGAN architecture, the proposed RACycle-GAN significantly enhances shadow removal performance, fundamentally solving the issue of detection under shadow interference. Additionally, DDE-YOLOv8 is introduced to further enhance the damage detection performance. Experimental results demonstrate that RACycle-GAN greatly improves detection performance, and DDE-YOLOv8 outperforms the original version. The combination of RACycle-GAN and DDE-YOLOv8 achieves a leading performance in pavement damage detection, demonstrating the effectiveness of the shadow-robust damage detection method in this paper.},

In this paper, we introduce a lightweight anonymous attribute-based signature of knowledge (Lw-AABSoK) scheme built on Curve25519 to defend against key-leakage attacks. This scheme enables attribute revocation and online credential updating, serving as a fine-grained pre-authentication cryptographic module for V2X secure communication. Leveraging the proposed Lw-AABSoK, we design an end-to-end fine-grained pre-authenticated key agreement protocol (E2E-FGpAKA). The E2E-FGpAKA is UDP-compatible; all interactive messages are self-validated by the Lw-AABSoK, and their sizes are strictly below the 5G NR MAC Transport Block Size (TBS). Through rigorous comparative analysis, scientific experimental verification, and comprehensive evaluation, it is evident that the proposed scheme holds significant practical value for 5G NR V2X.},

Pedestrians without prior negotiation experience with eHMI may misinterpret the driving intentions of the AV, leading to confusion and unpredictable behavior. To address this issue, this study suggests providing pre-instruction on eHMI to enhance comprehension. To compare pedestrians’ subjective feelings and walking behavior changes with and without the use of eHMI, as well as before and after receiving pre-instructions, a road crossing experiment using a within-subject design was conducted. In the experiment, the participants were challenged to recognize situations and experienced uncertainty when encountering AVs lacking eHMI, in contrast to manual driving vehicles. After the pre-instruction, participants could understand the driving intention of an AV with eHMI and predict its driving behavior more easily. Furthermore, participants’ subjective feelings and hesitation to make decisions improved to align with the same criteria as encountered with a manual driving vehicle. Additionally, this study found that the information guidance effect of using eHMI made participants’ walking speeds more consistent over multiple trials, as they gain a comprehensive understanding of eHMI principles through the pre-instruction.},

  abstract     = {Deep learning is well used in the field of autonomous driving, but systems often encounter scenarios that are significantly different from their training data, known as out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. In the realm of autonomous driving safety, perception is the most crucial and complex component, with existing perception network frameworks still suffering from inadequate accuracy, compounded by the plethora of uncertain factors and OOD scenarios in real road environments. However, previous research mainly focused on uncertainty methods and OOD detection techniques, lacking comprehensive reviews that cover their origins in the context of perception safety, theoretical analyses, evaluation metrics, and their applicability in ensuring autonomous driving safety. This review analyzes the OOD and uncertainty issues faced in the autonomous driving perception domain, including some cause analyses and solution s to these issues. Additionally, the review discusses OOD detection evaluation metrics that meet the safety requirements of autonomous driving. Thirdly, it summarizes existing OOD detection methods and explores their strengths and weaknesses under autonomous driving safety with evaluation metrics. Lastly, the article analyzes the application of uncertainty techniques in OOD detection, including the shortcomings and categorization of uncertainty methods, spatial feature utilization, semantic information, and performance optimization techniques. The review also highlights the shortcomings and improvement directions of uncertainty quantification techniques in OOD detection, along with the potential for further integration with autonomous driving scenarios. This study aims to promote the research and application of uncertainty quantification and OOD detection technologies in the context of autonomous driving safety.

The traffic speed deflection devices (TSDD) can continuously collect pavement deflection data at normal driving speeds and have the advantages of minimal traffic disruption and realistic loading modes. In terms of motivation, the TSDD aligns with the development trends of the highway industry and data intelligence era. In terms of reliability, data comparisons between TSDD and falling weight deflectometer (FWD) show similar trends. However, the actual detection process is more complex, requiring analysis and adjustment of factors such as vehicle speed, pavement roughness, environment temperature, and reported data range. When the TSDD is running on the road, it requires a complete data analysis system, including powerful noise reduction algorithms, accurate deflection algorithms, reasonable deflection index models, and effective modulus inversion models. Finally, consideration should be given to integrating TSDD assessment into the pavement management system, focusing on the relationship between pavement structural and functional conditions, as well as balancing economic considerations and decision-making effectiveness. Given the complex issues, various aspects of TSDD research are systematically investigated in this review. The survey research aims to summarize the development process and current applications of TSDD, investigate the technical challenges and phased solutions in its applications, and evaluate its capability and practices in improving PMS. These analyses are expected to help relevant personnel deepen the understanding of this emerging technology and jointly promote its rapid development.},

  abstract     = {The security of Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) networks is fundamental to the realization of next-generation intelligent transportation systems. However, the dynamic nature of V2X environments introduces critical challenges in ensuring robust Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS), particularly concerning false alarm rates, adversarial attacks, computational complexity, and real-world deployment constraints. Traditional centralized machine learning-based IDS suffer from high computation costs, privacy risks, bandwidth constraints, and scalability limitations, making them impractical for real-time, distributed vehicular networks. To address these gaps, this paper provides a comprehensive and structured survey of IDS methodologies in V2X security, focusing on Federated Learning (FL) and Edge AI for privacy-preserving and scalable IDS solutions. Unlike prior works, we systematically analyze and benchmark intrusion detection datasets, highlighting limitations in detecting zero-day attacks and exploring the need for hybrid datasets that integrate real-world vehicular data with adversarial attack scenarios. Furthermore, we investigate the adversarial robustness of ML-based IDS, analyzing AI-based evasion techniques, data poisoning threats, and misbehavior detection challenges. A key novelty of this work lies in the detailed examination of computational complexities in IDS deployment, including sensor fusion methods, noise reduction techniques, and false alarm mitigation strategies, which are often overlooked in previous surveys. We also explore deep learning-based IDS, providing a comparative evaluation of simulated versus real-world performance. Additionally, we present an in-depth discussion on post-quantum cryptographic techniques and blockchain integration for enhancing security in Federated Learning-based IDS. This survey bridges the gap between theoretical IDS models and real-world V2X deployment, addressing key constraints such as energy efficiency, communication overhead, and scalability in resource-constrained vehicular networks. By studying the state-of-the-art methodologies, identifying critical research gaps, and proposing practical advancements, this paper serves as a definitive resource for researchers,and industry professionals, guiding the development of robust, adaptive, and privacy-preserving IDS solutions for next-generation autonomous and connected vehicles (CAVs).},

  abstract     = {Modern railways continue to strive for remote and automated methods to improve the visual inspection procedures for their assets. In some cases, these inspections provide new information that could not previously be collected, while in other cases they help them improve upon the quality control, safety, time and costs associated with manual inspection. As such, computer vision continues to find applications for visually inspecting the track, earthworks, tunnels, overhead line equipment and rolling stock. Considering the recent pace of computer vision related developments, this paper seeks to review the state of the art of the field for railways. First, the hardware and data requirements are discussed, focusing on the unique challenges associated with operating optical equipment in a railway environment, such as contamination, power sources and lighting. This also discusses the most common mounting arrangements for camera hardware, including rolling-stock, satellites and way-side cameras. Next, image processing algorithms are discussed, comparing classical approaches and more modern artificial intelligence approaches, for example You Only Look Once (YOLO) and Region-Based Convolutional Neural Network (R-CNN). Then the most common applications for computer vision in the rail industry are analysed. First the track is studied considering computer vision analysis for the detection of different types of rail surface defects on plain line and turnouts, fastener defects, concrete track slab cracking and ballast particle characterisation. Next, the overhead line equipment is considered with applications related to detecting contact loss between pantograph and contact wire, stagger behaviour and defective catenary components. This is followed by discussion of other applications such as rail tunnelling subsidence, tunnel inspection, level crossings, trespass and on-track safety hazards. Finally, opportunities for future research are discussed such as hyperspectral imaging and generative AI, along with possible frontier technologies such as quantum computing.},

  abstract     = {The progress of automotive technologies has made cybersecurity a crucial focus, leading to various cyber attacks. These attacks primarily target the Controller Area Network (CAN) and specialized Electronic Control Units (ECUs). In order to mitigate these attacks and bolster the security of vehicular systems, numerous defense solutions have been proposed. These solutions aim to detect diverse forms of vehicular attacks. However, the practical implementation of these solutions still presents certain limitations and challenges. In light of these circumstances, this paper undertakes a thorough examination of existing vehicular attacks and defense strategies employed against the CAN and ECUs. The objective is to provide valuable insights and inform the future design of Vehicular Intrusion Detection Systems (VIDS). The findings of our investigation reveal that the examined VIDS primarily concentrate on particular categories of attacks, neglecting the broader spectrum of potential threats. Moreover, we provide a comprehensive overview of the significant challenges encountered in implementing a robust and feasible VIDS. Additionally, we put forth several defense recommendations based on our study findings, aiming to inform and guide the future design of VIDS in the context of vehicular security.},

  abstract     = {The Weibit choice model has gained increasing attention in transportation studies. Compared with the commonly used Logit model, the Weibit model inherently captures the heterogeneous travel perceptions by allowing non-identical variances for different alternatives. Nevertheless, how travelers’ heterogeneous perception errors may influence day-to-day (DTD) network dynamics, in which route choice decisions are made on each day, remains underexplored. In this study, we present several deterministic discrete DTD dynamic traffic models with Weibit-based network loading function, termed Weibit-based DTD dynamic models. We provide the asymptotic stability conditions of the Weibit stochastic equilibrium states based on the Jacobian matrices of the dynamical systems. We demonstrate how the features of non-identical perception variances and asymmetric response curve of the Weibit model can influence the evolution of network states and eventually the equilibrium points of the dynamical systems compared to the Logit case. Under fair comparison, the equilibrium states of Weibit DTD models are shown to have larger stable regions of adjustment rates than those of Logit DTD models. This research contributes to understanding the significance of considering travelers’ non-identical perception errors in DTD dynamics.},

  abstract     = {In order to maximize the braking energy recovery of dual motor-driven electric vehicles to guarantee braking safety and comfort, this paper proposes a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) braking energy recovery strategy with an improved prioritized experience replay and exploration mechanism. Firstly, the energy recovery process of the electric vehicle is analyzed, and a mathematical model reflecting the dual-motor braking energy conversion and constraint characteristics is established. Secondly, an energy recovery decision-making framework is established based on the twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient (TD3) algorithm, and an improved prioritized experience replay policy is designed to address the problem of inefficient empirical sampling in the traditional TD3. Finally, in order to change the imbalance between exploration and utilization that exists in the deterministic policy approach, an exploration policy that is automatically adjusted with the training process is introduced to enhance the algorithm’s decision-making ability in complex environments. The effectiveness of the proposed strategy was verified using a Matlab/Simulink simulation model under China Light Vehicle Test Cycle (CLTC) and World Light Vehicle Test Cycle (WLTC) operating conditions. The results showed that the proposed method exhibits higher efficiency in braking energy recovery when compared to other algorithms, with energy recovery efficiencies of 35.18% and 25.79% under two operating conditions, which both met the braking comfort and safety targets.},

The problem is formulated as a multi-capacity and multi-mode facility location-allocation problem with stochastic demand and delivery time which is modeled as a distributionally robust optimization problem. The objective is to minimize the total cost, which includes facility construction, transportation, and time delay costs. Given the stochastic nature of destination demand and transportation time, historical data is utilized to construct the ambiguity set of these stochastic parameters. Then, the proposed distributionally robust optimization problem is transformed into a two-stage deterministic optimization problem using probability and duality theory. An enhanced Benders decomposition algorithm is developed to solve the transformed problem that integrates several valid inequalities, multi-cut subproblem reformulation, and Pareto-optimal cuts to improve the performance of the algorithm. The computational experiments demonstrate that this improved Benders decomposition algorithm significantly outperforms the widely-used Gurobi solver in terms of solving speed. Finally, consolidation centers with different capacity levels are established in Xi’an, Urumqi, Chongqing, Shenyang, and Hohhot, and the corresponding transportation routes are given.},

Conversely, quick and safe vehicle authentication still poses a significant issue, especially at the handover time when switching between roadside units (RSUs), where network efficacy is influenced by computational overhead and re-authentication delays. To overcome these issues, this paper proposes DYNAMIC-TRUST. This blockchain-based authentication framework relies on the Proof of Trust (PoT) consensus mechanism to avoid redundant re-authentication, minimizing computation and communication costs. Compared to conventional authentication approaches, our method decentralizes vehicle revocation, allowing RSUs to revoke compromised vehicles autonomously without relying on a trusted authority, providing resilience regardless of adversarial conditions. The proposed framework’s resistance to identity theft, replay, and Sybil attacks has been proven by formal security analysis using Scyther and the Real-Or-Random (ROR) oracle model. Also, the Simulation of Urban Mobility (SUMO) is used to evaluate real-world practicality, proving improved scalability, lowered authentication latency, and greater network efficiency over various vehicular circumstances. Blockchain’s potential for enhancing vehicular network performance, trust, and security is highlighted in this study, which helps to develop smart cities and 6G-enabled Internet of Vehicles (IoV) infrastructures.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, vision-based roadside 3D object detection has received a great deal of attention, which is an important part of the Intelligent Transportation System (ITS). It extends the perception range beyond the limitations of Autonomous Vehicle (AV) and enhances road safety. While previous work mainly focuses on height prediction in image 2D space, which is limited by the perspective property of near-large and far-small on images, making it difficult for network to understand real dimension of targets in the 3D world. Inspired by this insight, a roadside visual framework Height3D based on height prediction in real 3D space, is proposed. Height Prediction Block (HPB) with explicit height supervision is proposed in real 3D space instead of in image 2D space to predict the height distribution of targets for roadside view transform. Also, Spatial Aware Block (SAB) is used to further extracts spatial context information in BEV space and enhances fine-grained BEV features. The proposed method is applied to two large-scale roadside benchmarks, DAIR-V2X-I and Rope3D. Extensive experiments are performed to verify its effectiveness. The proposed Height3D outperforms the state-of-the-art methods of (1.15, 7.37, 4.03) Average Precision (AP) for Vehicle, Pedestrian and Cyclist categories in 3D object detection task, respectively. Meanwhile, the proposed method achieves 31.55 FPS without using any CUDA or TensorRT acceleration. The code is available at https://github.com/zhangzhang2024/Height3D},

  abstract     = {The development of autonomous driving has created new demands for real-time road surveillance. Portable, high-precision, low-power road infrastructure is needed to enable real-time communication of collected vehicle data with passing vehicles. Vehicle recognition and speed estimation are key challenges in this context. We propose a traffic detection device using dual-axis magneto-impedance (MI) sensors installed roadside to detect vehicles in adjacent lanes. Experiments were conducted by driving various vehicle types under a variety of complex road and traffic conditions, analyzing how different measurement conditions and driving patterns affect magnetic signatures. We identified the magnetic signatures most strongly correlated with vehicle recognition and speed estimation. We developed corresponding solutions to address issues as repeated misrecognition and the influence of non-adjacent lanes, which are frequently highlighted in related works. Ultimately, we achieved an overall recognition accuracy of 96.66% in random measurements on complex traffic conditions, reducing recognition errors related to these issues to 3.22%. Additionally, we proposed two speed estimation methods: the time-domain magnetic signature differential method and the dominant frequency method, utilizing multiple sensor nodes and a single node, respectively. Both speed estimation methods were analyzed and compared through controlled experiments, and their performance was evaluated in random measurement experiments. Both methods showed similar estimation accuracy on straight roads, with 100% and 98.8% of results falling within a ±5 km/h error range, respectively. In low-speed curved sections where multiple sensor nodes could not be deployed, we achieved speed estimation using a single sensor by analyzing frequency-domain signals. Finally, under complex traffic conditions, the device demonstrated a minimum Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of only 2.09 km/h for speed estimation.},

The traditional data-driven vehicle speed prediction based on the vehicle speed sequence lacks consideration of the influence of the power sequence of the power source on the prediction accuracy in fuel cell vehicle. Most data-driven vehicle speed prediction is based on deep learning methods, which have poor generalization capabilities when predicting across working conditions. Based on this, this paper proposes a transfer learning method for vehicle speed prediction that improves across working conditions adaptability.

Secondly, a vehicle speed prediction model based on hybrid deep learning is established. And the impact of dual power source power sequence on vehicle speed prediction performance is analyzed under urban conditions. Finally, a vehicle speed transfer prediction method that integrates hybrid deep learning and transfer learning is proposed. And the prediction results of vehicle speed transfer from urban conditions to congestion, suburban and expressway conditions are analyzed. The results show that compared without transfer learning. The vehicle speed transfer prediction method proposed reduces mean absolute error by 21.3%, 24.8%, and 24.9%, respectively, and mean square error by 35.3%, 44.6%, and 37.2% respectively when the prediction time domain is 5 seconds.

The experts’ experience introduced in decision-making model could improve the engineering application ability of decisions. The research uses a pavement performance prediction model as the environment and applies reinforcement learning to optimize strategies in the decision model.

  abstract     = {Traffic perception is essential for intelligent transportation systems (ITS) to improve road safety and facilitate traffic management. High-altitude video surveillance systems, known for their wide coverage, provide an effective solution for continuous traffic monitoring and are increasingly deployed worldwide. However, the application of high-altitude video surveillance faces significant challenges, such as the small size and high density of vehicles, and low ambient brightness at night or low-light conditions. In this study, we propose a novel lightweight model specifically for reliable traffic perception in low-light conditions, utilizing an encoder-decoder architecture. The proposed framework begins with an advanced image enhancement algorithm designed to amplify the semantic content of low-brightness nighttime images. Subsequently, we employ a lightweight, deep two-channel neural network to extract image features both pre- and post-enhancement. To effectively manage the noise introduced during image enhancement, we introduce a feature fusion module based on an attention mechanism, which adaptively merges the features extracted by the two-channel network. The final step involves a lightweight decoder that synergizes high-level semantic information with low-level features. Extensive evaluation on our nighttime dataset shows that the proposed method can reduce error by 40% compared to the methods without image enhancement and by 28% compared to those relying solely on enhancement, outperforming all baseline methods. Notably, the lightweight module embedded in our model empowers the framework to perform real-time traffic perception at night, providing an efficient solution for traffic monitoring.},

However, this approach faces two limitations when applied to planning for autonomous vehicles: chaotic branch expansion in the belief tree reduces computational efficiency, and particle deprivation hinders the accurate estimation of the dynamic intentions of surrounding vehicles. To this end, an intention-guided Partially Observable Monte Carlo Planning with a Heuristic-based Double Progressive Widening (POMCP-HDPW) approach is proposed to facilitate efficient decision-making for autonomous vehicles. We propose an enhance resampling method of PF that accounts for the driving intentions of surrounding vehicles, maintaining particle diversity and thereby improving estimation accuracy. Additionally, we prune the action and observation spaces by leveraging human driving experience and collision risk assessment, enabling the expansion and exploration of high-value belief nodes and preventing chaotic expansion. Three different methods are employed to drive the motion of surrounding vehicles, validating the robustness of the proposed model: intelligent driving model control, offline driving using the exiD trajectories, and driver-in-the-loop validation. Notably, experimental results on the exiD dataset demonstrate a success rate of 96.88% in off-ramp scenarios.},

  abstract     = {Human-involved interactive environments pose significant challenges for autonomous vehicle decision-making processes due to the complexity and uncertainty of human behavior. It is crucial to develop an explainable and trustworthy decision-making system for autonomous vehicles interacting with pedestrians. Previous studies often used traditional game theory to describe interactions for its interpretability. However, it assumes complete human rationality and unlimited reasoning abilities, which is unrealistic. To solve this limitation and improve model accuracy, this paper proposes a novel framework that integrates the partially observable markov decision process with behavioral game theory to dynamically model AV-pedestrian interactions at the unsignalized intersection. Both the AV and the pedestrian are modeled as dynamic-belief-induced quantal cognitive hierarchy (DB-QCH) models, considering human reasoning limitations and bounded rationality in the decision-making process. In addition, a dynamic belief updating mechanism allows the AV to update its understanding of the opponent’s rationality degree in real-time based on observed behaviors and adapt its strategies accordingly. The analysis results indicate that our models effectively simulate vehicle-pedestrian interactions and our proposed AV decision-making approach performs well in safety, efficiency, and smoothness. It captures key patterns of the driving behavior operated by real human drivers in virtual reality(VR) experiments and even achieves more comfortable navigation compared to our previous VR experimental data.},

  abstract     = {Accurate localization and mapping play a critical role in intelligent vehicles for advanced driver assistance systems and autonomous driving. For the rapidly developing field of autonomy, autonomous systems require an accurate LiDAR SLAM system to adapt to different specifications of LiDARs in various complex scenarios. Therefore, this paper proposes a highly accurate and universal LiDAR SLAM method, which is innovative in the design of LiDAR odometry (LO) and loop detection descriptors. The odometry is designed in two key ways. Firstly, this paper focuses on the 3D spatial information of the point cloud and unifies its representation through voxel gridding, enhancing adaptability to different LiDARs and reducing computation time for feature extraction. Secondly, leveraging the “near dense, far sparse” characteristic of LiDAR, a dynamic registration function is designed to improve the stability and accuracy of the odometry. In addressing loop detection, we have designed a novel dual-channel correlation global descriptor, integrating point cloud height and height difference characteristics. This innovative descriptor reduces the sensitivity to translation and improves the precision and recall of loop detection. We have thoroughly tested our method using various public datasets with different LiDARs in a variety of scenarios and compared it with other well-known methods. Experimental results show that our SLAM technology improves stability and accuracy while maintaining universal compatibility. On the KITTI benchmark, our method ranks among the highest in terms of accuracy and real-time performance, achieving a relative average translation error (RATE) of 0.59 and an average time of 40 ms per scan.},

The lack of signal control at intersections and the unpredictable routes taken by HDVs make the efficient transport of containers within a terminal quite challenging. To tackle this issue, we present an integrated traffic control policy aimed at enhancing transportation efficiency. For each unsignalized intersection, a virtual token ring system is introduced to manage the passage of vehicles, using a back pressure-based algorithm and specific token delivery rules to determine phase sequence and duration. Furthermore, we introduce an improved back pressure-based dynamic routing method for CAVs, which allows for the selection of roads with shorter travel time while adhering to a travel distance constraint when crossing an intersection. This approach aims to minimize disruptions from HDVs, reduce travel time, and prevent excessively long travel distances. Multiple experiments are conducted to verify the proposed method’s effectiveness.},

  abstract     = {The graph-based traffic forecasting is generally realized on the assumption of sufficient data, which could be impractical in the regions without well-deployed mobile sensors or data-processing facilities. Recent studies have developed a solution with the cross-region transfer learning, i.e. transferring traffic knowledge from the source regions to target ones, whose traffic data and computing resources are limited. Nevertheless, relevant issues, including initialization selection and domain adaptation, have not been effectively tackled in the cross-region graph-based traffic forecasting. This paper proposes the cluster-granularity spatiotemporal transfer (CGSTT), which transfers the cluster-granularity knowledge from the source region to target one for the cross-region graph-based traffic forecasting, as not all source knowledge is positive to the target region. Additionally, the domain adaptation is achieved by the dual alignment consisting of the covariate alignment and label alignment of the source/target data, making the proposed CGSTT adapt to the target region efficiently. The superiority of the proposed method over ten compared baseline methods for both short-term and long-term predictions is demonstrated by the conducted experiments on four tasks, which show that it outperforms the state-of-the-art method by achieving an 8.89% average improvement in forecasting accuracy. The PyTorch implementation of the CGSTT is available at https://github.com/canyangguo/CGSTT.},

  abstract     = {Pavement distress, manifested as cracks, potholes, and rutting, significantly compromises road integrity and poses risks to drivers. Accurate prediction of pavement distress deterioration is essential for effective road management, cost reduction in maintenance, and improvement of traffic safety. However, real-world data on pavement distress is usually collected irregularly, resulting in uneven, asynchronous, and sparse spatial-temporal datasets. This hinders the application of existing spatial-temporal models, such as DCRNN, since they are only applicable to regularly and synchronously collected data. To overcome these challenges, we propose the Spatial-Temporal Graph Autoregression Network (STGAN), a novel graph neural network (GNN) model designed for accurately predicting irregular pavement distress deterioration using complex spatial-temporal data. Specifically, STGAN integrates the temporal domain into the spatial domain, creating a larger graph where nodes are represented by spatial-temporal tuples and edges are formed based on a similarity-based connection mechanism. Furthermore, based on the constructed spatiotemporal graph, we formulate pavement distress deterioration prediction as a graph autoregression task, i.e., the graph size increases incrementally and the prediction is performed sequentially. This is accomplished by a novel spatial-temporal attention mechanism deployed by the proposed STGAN model. Utilizing the ConTrack dataset, which contains pavement distress records collected from different locations in Shanghai, we demonstrate the superior performance of STGAN in capturing spatial-temporal correlations and addressing the aforementioned challenges. Experimental results further show that STGAN outperforms baseline models, and ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of its novel modules. Our findings contribute to promoting proactive road maintenance decision-making and ultimately enhancing road safety and resilience.},

  abstract     = {Vehicle trajectory prediction, as a key enabler of the intelligent transportation system, has attracted considerable attention from academia and industry in recent years. However, the variability and dynamism of traffic conditions pose significant challenges to current vehicle trajectory prediction methods, particularly in the form of domain bias. Domain bias occurs when a model trained on one traffic domain, such as one segment of a highway, underperforms when applied to another segment with different traffic patterns. To address this challenge and advance the field, we propose a new transfer learning-based collaborative vehicle trajectory prediction framework called TRACER, designed to provide reliable and accurate traffic predictions with high adaptability for cross-domain highway traffic scenarios. The core of our framework lies in an adaptive interactive extraction module and a trajectory generation module based on Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM), further strengthened by a pre-task of intention recognition for vehicle operation types. To improve model robustness, consistency regularization is applied by injecting disturbances into the target data, and a one-dimensional Convolution (Conv1D)-based intention extraction module is integrated into the BiLSTM-based trajectory generation process, leading to notable improvements in prediction accuracy. Our framework is first trained on source domain data, followed by the transfer of a small amount of labeled data from the target domain, and the overall model is further refined using unlabeled data. By effectively mitigating domain bias, TRACER significantly enhances trajectory prediction accuracy while maintaining high adaptability. The results underscore the importance of addressing domain shift challenges in trajectory prediction tasks and demonstrate the potential of domain adaptation techniques to improve the prediction accuracy of vehicle trajectories across different domains in highway scenarios.},

Initially, a generic performance constraint strategy is proposed by integrating an improved global performance function, which eliminates the subpar reconfigurability present in the specific performance function-based global constraint schemes. By embedding the saturation compensation function, a feedback mechanism between the saturation constraint and performance constraint is established, instead of cutting off the analysis separately, by giving the constraint boundaries the flexibility to expand and contract. Subsequently, the inherently unmodeled dynamics and uncertainties of the controlled vehicle are reconstructed online by interval type-2 fuzzy logic systems. By integrating the predefined-time differentiator into the recursive design framework, an adaptive fuzzy predefined-time formation protocol is developed to provide a streamlined solution for adjusting the settling time and facilitates engineering implementation. The stability analysis rigorously proves that all the variables are practical predefined-time bounded.

However, different drivers’ personalized driving preferences will bring uncertainties for long-term TP in the mixed traffic environment. To this end, this paper proposes a TP model with interaction awareness and driving style awareness for long-term TP of heterogeneous SVs. Firstly, the driving conditions in the highD dataset are distinguished, and three different driving styles of the vehicle in the car-following condition are obtained based on an unsupervised clustering algorithm. Then, an encoder-decoder architecture based on novel lane attention and multi-head attention mechanisms is proposed, where the encoder analyzes historical trajectory patterns and the decoder generates future trajectory sequences. The lane attention mechanism enhances the spatial perception capability of vehicles towards the target lane, and the multi-head attention mechanism extracts high-dimensional global interaction information about the heterogeneous vehicle group (HVG) surrounding the target vehicle (TV). Experimental results show that the proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art models in root-mean-square-error (RMSE) for long-term TP and exhibits excellent adaptability to diverse driving tasks. Moreover, this paper verifies that the driving style topology within the HVG has multiple impacts on the TP accuracy of the TV.},

In this paper, we develop a two-dimensional indicator based on field theory to evaluate lane change risks on the highway. The driving risk field is constructed by integrating the individual and interaction features of the source vehicle and the interacting vehicle. Parameter calibration with highD trajectory data allows the risk field forces to objectively reflect the risk perception. An adaptive optimization algorithm with cumulative gradient bias correction is introduced for parameter calibration. The enhanced first-order and second-order momentum, along with the long-term memory, are developed to adaptively adjust the learning rate and prune abnormal gradients. A Gaussian mixture model is applied to cluster the calibrated two-dimensional risk indicators, generating the F-F diagram. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed driving risk field model and the gradient-based algorithm. Confidence region estimation of the lane change risk distribution further validate the objectivity and interpretability of the F-F diagram. The 95% confidence level offers valuable insights for proactive traffic safety management, and lays a foundation for developing personalized lane change strategies.

  abstract     = {In current Intelligent Transportation Systems, 4-dimensional (4D) millimeter-wave radar is gradually conquering more important roles. However, the rich multipath phenomena of radar waves can cause virtual images to be mistaken for actual targets. Most existing solutions aim to identify distinguishable features within a single signal frame to differentiate virtual targets from actual ones, but they fail to fully leverage temporal evolution information. Moreover, they are often limited to simple scenarios with low-order bounces and cannot handle extreme high-order bounce cases. To address this gap, in this paper we establish a research methodology based on topology and propagation graph theory, and propose a time-varying 4D trajectory-based physical target discrimination (TPTD) method. This method can handle multipath virtual images formed by arbitrary-order bounces. Its effectiveness and superiority over advanced methods have been qualitatively and quantitatively validated through traceable simulated and measured data. We also discuss in detail the scalability of the algorithm and its potential bottlenecks. The proposed method can be applied to fields such as precise radar sensing and channel modeling, laying the foundation for integrated sensing and communication and autonomous driving.},

However, in the dynamic vehicular network environment, where vehicles are constantly moving, effective VEC demands a sophisticated approach to managing computing, caching, and communication resources. This involves coordinating resource allocation and data caching across multiple vehicles and RSUs while making complex decisions about task placement. In this paper, we present VECO, a Vehicular Edge Caching and Offloading framework powered by digital twins (DTs). VECO leverages DTs for real-time monitoring of network conditions and resource states, enabling predictive analysis and intelligent decision-making. The framework incorporates a Dynamic Task Caching and Computation Offloading (DT2C) mechanism to optimize data caching and adapt task offloading based on task characteristics and dynamic resource availability. Specifically, we develop a utility-based caching algorithm for RSUs and a novel task offloading strategy using a Proximal Policy Optimization-based deep reinforcement learning algorithm. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VECO, augmented by the DT2C mechanism, significantly outperforms baseline approaches, achieving faster learning convergence and a 21% reduction in total costs, including system latency and energy consumption.},

  abstract     = {Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) are crucial for intelligent transportation systems (ITS), providing essential positioning capabilities globally. However, in urban canyons, the GNSS performance could significantly degraded due to the blockage of direct GNSS signals. The pseudorange measurements are largely affected and the conventional model of weighting observations is not suitable in urban canyons. This paper addresses these challenges by integrating Artificial Intelligence (AI), specifically deep learning, into GNSS positioning process to enhance positioning accuracy. Traditional methods have primarily focused on pseudorange correction due to the absence of ground truth for weight estimation. In response, we propose an innovative indirect training approach using deep learning to optimize both pseudorange bias and weight estimation, aiming to minimize the positioning errors. To support this integration, we developed pyrtklib, a Python binding for the open-source RTKLIB tool, bridging the gap between traditional GNSS algorithms, typically developed in Fortran or C, and modern Python-based AI frameworks. Comparative analyses demonstrate that our method surpasses established tools like goGPS and RTKLIB in positioning accuracy, marking a significant advancement in the field. The source code of tightly coupled deep learning and GNSS integration, along with pyrtklib, is available on GitHub at https://github.com/ebhrz/TDL-GNSS and https://github.com/IPNL-POLYU/pyrtklib.},

Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) are capable of improving the spectral efficiency and conserving energy of the wireless communications, due to the planar array architecture of which is superior beamforming gain and energy-efficient. In this paper, we study a novel design scheme where a double-RIS-enabled integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system in vehicular network performs both a single target sensing and multi-user communications synchronously. Specifically, two transmit power budget minimization problems are formulated based on Cramér-Rao bound (CRB)-based framework under the known target location model, and radar signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)-related framework under the uncertain target location model, respectively. For the former, we propose an efficient solver based on alternative direction method of multipliers (ADMM) technique to obtain high-quality solutions for transmit beamforming and phase shifts. For the latter, an efficient algorithm based on penalty-dual-decomposition (PDD) and second order cone programming (SOCP) approaches is proposed. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of two proposed algorithms and also show the superiority of our developed schemes over state-of-the-art benchmark ISAC schemes.},

Current works predominantly focus on enhancing model accuracy, often overlooking the influence of input sample and label uncertainty. In this paper, we propose a framework for uncertainty modeling in driver gaze estimation via feature disentanglement, referred to as UnMoDE. Our approach begins by extracting facial information into distinct feature spaces using an asymmetric dual-branch encoder to obtain gaze features. Subsequently, a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) is employed to project gaze features and labels into an embedding space, representing them as Gaussian distributions. The uncertainty is described using a covariance matrix. Random sampling is applied to derive samples from the gaze embedding distribution to estimate the most probable embedding representation. This estimated representation is then used to regress the gaze direction and is projected back into the gaze feature space, along with identity information, to facilitate facial reconstruction. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that UnMoDE significantly outperforms baseline and state-of-the-art methods on the latest benchmark datasets collected for drivers, particularly in reducing the number of samples with significant errors.},

  abstract     = {Rainy weather presents significant challenges for applications relying on visual perception in intelligent transportation systems. The scarcity of real paired training data complicates single-image rain removal tasks, prompting an increasing interest in unsupervised methods capable of handling real-world rainy images without paired data. At present, most unsupervised rain removal methods are based on the CycleGAN framework; however, the combination of this framework and transformer is not satisfactory owing to most Transformers’ insufficient ability to model real rain features with global inhomogeneous distributions, which prevents them from being fully applicable to unsupervised tasks. This study devised an unsupervised rain removal network based on CycleGAN and the DerainFormer transformer. First, a deformable sparse attention mechanism was developed to improve the Transformer’s suitability for unsupervised tasks in CycleGAN architectures. Subsequently, a two-stage alternating transformer structure was designed to enhance its global non-uniform modeling capabilities for real rain images, In addition, a dual-channel parallel feed-forward network was used to establish the correlation between multiscale rain stripes. Finally, since rain removal is considered a decomposition task, a rain layer unsupervised training method for joint positional contrastive learning was proposed to separate the rain streaks effectively. We conducted several experiments on different real and synthetic rain datasets and the results confirmed that our unsupervised rain removal method performed well. The source code will be released at https://github.com/derainsipl/CycFormer.},

  abstract     = {Vehicle association is a vital yet complex task to retrieve specific vehicles across various camera angles, time frames, and geographical locations. In environments supported by autonomous driving and 6G networks, this task plays a vital role in urban surveillance and traffic management by enabling the real-time sharing of vehicle location and status information through ultra-high-speed, low-latency 6G communication. The success of a retrieval model largely depends on the quality of the extracted representations, which can be influenced by factors such as background diversity and occlusions. This study proposes a method to extract representations that remain consistent across different domains while retaining the discriminative power necessary to determine a vehicle’s spatial location, regardless of background or environmental variations. To achieve this, we introduce a framework called Generic Representation Learning (GRL). Within GRL, we leverage large-scale pre-trained foundational models to provide spatial priors of vehicles, specifically the Grounding DINO model for object detection and the SAM model for object segmentation. These modules collaborate to help the network understand the spatial context of the object, enabling the feature extractor to focus on discriminative areas while minimizing interference. Additionally, we introduce a complementary feature alignment mechanism based on a memory bank to explore globally applicable knowledge within the learned representation of the object. These constituent elements collectively form SRP, to enhance its capability for outstanding performance in vehicle retrieval. Extensive experimentation demonstrates that SRP significantly outperforms existing models on widely recognized benchmarks.},

Due to the lack of channel characteristics for all-metal immersed tunnel environments, this paper conducts an in-depth study on channel measurement, channel modeling, and optimization of ETC systems within all-metal immersed tunnels. Using a channel measurement system based on the universal software radio peripheral (USRP), this study extracts multidimensional channel characteristic parameters from the measured data, such as path loss (PL), shadow fading (SF), K-factor (KF), root mean square delay spread (RMS DS), power angular spectrum (PAS), and azimuth angle spread (ASA). The unique characteristics of the all-metal tunnel are analyzed in comparison to tunnels made of other materials. To develop a comprehensive all-metal immersed tunnel channel model meeting the quasi-deterministic radio channel generator (QuaDRiGa) requirements, we employed ray tracing (RT) methods to supplement angle domain parameters. Subsequently, we used this channel model to aid in the design and optimization of ETC systems, addressing transaction failures and erroneous transactions within all-metal immersed tunnels by establishing optimization targets and constraints, resulting in optimal height, tilt angle, transmission power, and beamforming. The findings of this research not only enrich the channel scenarios in QuaDRiGa but also provide practical guidance for improving the performance of ETC systems.},

In order to improve both planning and control efficiency while ensuring the validity of the planned trajectories for autonomous vehicles, a reinforcement learning and optimal control integrated method (RL-OCIM) for planning and control is proposed. The proposed method ensures the obstacle avoidance through incorporating lane change based on proximal policy optimization (PPO) with the optimal control method (OCM). The trained PPO agent takes the structured information of the ego vehicle and the surrounding obstacles as input, and generates the trajectory terminal state for the ego vehicle. Subsequently, the continuous trajectory solving problem is transformed into an optimal control problem (OCP), resulting in the generation of a feasible trajectory that includes vehicle steering and longitudinal acceleration based on the vehicle kinematics model. In addition, to improve the efficiency of agent training, a pre-trained neural network is employed to generate trajectory feature points by taking the trajectory terminal states as input. During the agent training process, the trajectory feature points are obtained directly from the neural network after selecting an action. Experiments are conducted on a hybrid Lincoln MKZ vehicle to demonstrate and validate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed RL-OCIM, which includes various driving scenarios such as static obstacle avoidance and dynamic obstacle avoidance.},

However, there is currently no effective non-nominal troposphere monitoring method at both GBAS stations and aircrafts, which increases the integrity risk. This study proposes a novel approach for simultaneously modelling and monitoring ground station and aircraft non-nominal troposphere using precision point positioning (PPP) technology based on a regional reference network. The global navigation satellite system (GNSS) and meteorological data from the Hong Kong satellite positioning reference station network and numerical weather models from the European centre for medium-range weather forecasts are processed in all the year of 2017. A tropospheric correction (TC) model is used to correct station height-induced biases in zenith total delay (ZTD) obtained from PPP. By comparing the performance of 6 typical spatial interpolation algorithms in tropospheric delay interpolating, the universal Kriging algorithm is found to be the most suitable one which achieves a minimum mean absolute error (MAE) of 8.24 mm. The non-nominal troposphere is monitored using the constructed corrected ZTD map using universal Kriging method. A non-nominal troposphere up to 50 mm is observed, which can affect the integrity of the air navigation. Furthermore, the relationship between non-nominal troposphere and the rainfall is investigated. The study integrates widely distributed GNSS and meteorological data into a seamless non-nominal tropospheric monitoring service, enhancing the integrity of GBAS in air transportation.},

  abstract     = {Aviation accidents are frequently related to pilots’ operations, especially during a landing phase. Therefore, accurately evaluating a pilot’s performance during this phase is crucial for minimizing landing risks. Traditional assessment methods, however, primarily focus on discrete monitoring points, failing to capture the continuous and dynamic nature of a pilot’s performance throughout the entire landing phase. To address this issue, we propose a Flight Process Importance (FPI) assessment framework that precisely determines accurate landing timing and captures the diverse operational characteristics of pilots. It consists of two components: Time-varying Importance Coefficient (TIC) and Pilot Characteristics Matrix (PCM). TIC develops a Spatio-Temporally Consistent Attention Network (STCAN) to classify Quick Access Recorder (QAR) data for anomalous event detection. It then determines the importance of different periods during the landing process by analyzing the STCAN model’s response to the data in an interpretable manner. PCM generates a parameter matrix for each flight by deriving the ideal intervals of various parameters through the interquartile range. This matrix is used to identify the duration and intensity of anomalies in operations across different pilots. By integrating TIC and PCM, our framework computes an evaluation matrix for each flight, quantifying the operational risk factors associated with pilots. Experimental results indicate that STCAN significantly surpasses other algorithms on QAR data. FPI provides a more precise and comprehensive assessment of a pilot’s performance. In particular, our findings highlight that the 10 seconds before landing to the touchdown are the most critical period of airplane landing.},

In this study, A lightweight road surface defect real-time intelligent detection system based on cloud-edge collaboration is proposed. The system comprises a lightweight feature-enhanced YOLO network (YOLO-LFE), a multi-object tracking network called ByteTrack, and is deployed on intelligent edge devices, enabling real-time defect detection and storage of uploaded defect information through edge computing modules and cloud systems. Built upon the latest YOLOv8 architecture, a lightweight MobileNetV3 network is first introduced as the backbone feature extraction component, resulting in a noteworthy decrease in parameters and computational intricacy. Subsequently, the Enhanced Spatial Pyramid Pooling (ESPP) method built upon the human visual perception system is applied to swap out the Spatial Pyramid Pooling Fusion (SPPF) method, thereby enhancing the model’s capability to capture features from tiny entities. Finally, an enhanced progressive feature fusion network is designed to further address the semantic gap issue during subsequent fusion of primary features. Experimental results on a self-made dataset and the public RDD2022 dataset show that the proposed detection model maintains high accuracy while requiring fewer parameters and less computational resources. Compared to YOLOv8, the model reduces the number of parameters by 32.5% and decreases computational requirements by 37%. This makes it more suitable for deployment on embedded devices. Additionally, the system has been field-tested on vehicles, thereby validating the effectiveness of the entire system.},

  abstract     = {Street Scene Semantic Understanding (denoted as TriSU) is a complex task for autonomous driving (AD). However, inference model trained from data in a particular geographical region faces poor generalization when applied in other regions due to inter-city data domain-shift. Hierarchical Federated Learning (HFL) offers a potential solution for improving TriSU model generalization by collaborative privacy-preserving training over distributed datasets from different cities. Unfortunately, it suffers from slow convergence because the data from different cities are with disparate statistical properties. Going beyond existing HFL methods, we propose a Gaussian heterogeneous HFL algorithm (FedGau) to address inter-city data heterogeneity so that convergence can be accelerated. In the proposed FedGau algorithm, both single RGB image and RGB dataset are modelled as Gaussian distributions for aggregation weight design. This approach not only differentiates each RGB image by respective statistical distribution, but also exploits the statistics of dataset from each city in addition to the conventionally considered data volume. With the proposed approach, the convergence is accelerated by 35.5%-40.6% compared to existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) HFL methods. On the other hand, to reduce the involved communication resource, we further introduce a novel performance-aware adaptive resource scheduling (AdapRS) policy. Unlike the traditional static resource scheduling policy that exchanges a fixed number of models between two adjacent aggregations, AdapRS adjusts the number of model aggregation at different levels of HFL so that unnecessary communications are minimized. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AdapRS saves 29.65% communication overhead compared to conventional static resource scheduling policy while maintaining almost the same performance.},

  abstract     = {Inertial measurement unit (IMU) fingerprinting is a promising physical authentication technique based on hardware imperfections produced during sensor manufacturing. This paper presents a two-stage feature extraction process that combines feature selection and mapping; the proposed approach is tailored for the lightweight vehicle-to-everything (V2X) application scenario. Specifically, the selected features are transformed into images via Gramian angular difference field (GADF), Gramian angular summation field (GASF), and Markov transition field (MTF) mappings, as well as feature extraction implemented via a convolutional neural network (CNN). Owing to the advances provided by the proposed scheme, a lightweight feature extraction system achieves satisfactory accuracy levels above 99.10% with fewer sample data and a short training time. The effectiveness and robustness of the developed approach were validated under various driving conditions via 20 IMU sensors, Arduino, and a Raspberry Pi across 20 vehicles. Additionally, tests conducted across different deep learning models demonstrated the generalizability of the proposed preprocessing and mapping methods.},

Secondly, a parameter-adjustable cubic function negative-determination condition is proposed, generalizing the existing condition in the literature as a special case and reducing its conservatism. Then, by combining the proposed negative-determination condition with the suitable LKF, new stability conditions are derived, enabling a more accurate determination of the allowable delay upper bound (ADUB). Furthermore, to improve computational efficiency in determining the ADUB, the suitable LKF not only provides stability conditions with lower complexity, reducing time per iteration, but also incorporates a binary search algorithm, significantly minimizing the total number of iterations required.

  abstract     = {Highway on-ramps are typical bottlenecks for the deployment of connected and automated vehicles (CAVs). However, few studies have considered time-varying traffic volume and dynamic uncertainties in real-world scenarios. This paper proposes an adaptive robust formation control strategy (ARFC) for CAVs to address these challenges. The ARFC consists of two stages: 1) In the tactical stage, the constraint-oriented platoon formation algorithm classifies approaching CAVs into multiple local virtual platoons (LVP), assigns the collision-free merging sequences and driving modes, thereby enabling the strategy to adapt to time-varying traffic volume. Unified spatial-dependent constraints are formulated to construct this geometry topology, where the spatial dependence ensures collision avoidance in the merging conflict zone. 2) In the operational stage, an adaptive robust control scheme is designed based on the Lyapunov min-max approach, rendering uniform boundedness, uniform ultimate boundedness performance of tracking errors, and string stability of LVP, regardless of time-varying uncertainties. Comprehensive validations demonstrate that the proposed strategy performs effectively under different traffic demands, and improves ride comfort and fuel economy compared to baseline methods.},

Recent studies on mitigating bus bunching have turned to model-free reinforcement learning (RL)-based methods for developing holding control strategies, demonstrating superior performance over traditional model-based approaches. However, a systematic evaluation of how different learning configurations affect the overall performance of these methods remains unexplored. To this end, this study develops an open-source framework to systematically examine the control performance of various RL approaches, including both value-based and policy-based algorithms, under different configurations using real-world bus data. Our findings reveal that: 1) simpler state representations (e.g., considering only forward and backward spacings between adjacent buses) may outperform more complex ones that additionally incorporate stop-specific information; 2) adopting actions with discrete holding time achieve comparable results to their continuous counterparts, offering practical advantages for implementation; 3) while multi-agent methods can slightly improve performance, their computational costs can outweigh benefits in certain scenarios; and 4) RL approaches demonstrate strong generalizability across diverse routes and fleet sizes, suggesting potential for widespread application with minimal retraining. These insights could guide the selection and implementation of practical RL deployment for public transit agencies.},

  abstract     = {This paper proposes a novel sub-polytope integrated approach (sPIA) that features an intrinsic bump-free transition, aiming to reduce conservatism in the design of path tracking control for autonomous vehicles with large range time-varying longitudinal velocity. The approach encapsulates the interdependent time-varying parameters associated with longitudinal velocity as a set of finite-vertex sub-polytopes interconnected via junction points, thereby reducing the conservatism induced by modeling overbounding. The integration of junction points and the formulation of sub-region activation rules provide a theoretical foundation for avoiding abrupt changes in feedback gains, ensuring a bump-free transition between sub-regions. A gain-scheduling state feedback controller is designed, employing parameter-dependent Lyapunov functions to further attenuate design conservatism. The effectiveness of the proposed method in reducing design conservatism is demonstrated by a comparative analysis of the optimal ${\mathcal {H}}_{\infty }$ performance indices across various sub-polytope integration schemes. Furthermore, the superiority of the method is exemplified via simulations within real-world driving scenarios, utilizing the high-fidelity CarSim-Simulink platform. The results indicate that the proposed sPIA outperforms traditional polytopic methods in path tracking performance. This improvement, together with the effective avoidance of bumps during sub-regional transitions, confirms the efficacy of the proposed approach. Moreover, the real-time performance of the method is verified by hardware-in-the-loop experiments.},

  abstract     = {The development of electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircrafts promotes the prosperity of Urban Air Mobility (UAM). While numerous efforts have been made on UAM, little was focusing on the integrated operation of UAM and ground transportation system. This paper thus investigated how to alleviate traffic congestion on an arterial road with a bottleneck via using eVTOL aircrafts to transfer passengers upstream the bottleneck to downstream. The location, opening and closing time of the vertiports and the transfer ratio of the passengers are optimized with the objective of minimizing the average monetary cost, which is an integrated evaluation value converted by the electricity consumption, travel time and vertiport operating cost. Based on this, an optimization model is constructed and Dividing RECTangles algorithm is adopted to solve it using the simulation module as a subroutine. Simulation results show that the proposed method is capable of reducing average monetary cost and average travel time. Moreover, due to the differences in salaries and electricity prices, the departure vertiport in U.S. case should be positioned as close to the upstream as possible, while in China it is the opposite. More importantly, we found that the successful implementation of the proposed method requires the ride-sharing service provider to arrange the travel plan in a unified manner because of the higher cost of transferred passengers. This research pioneers a novel UAM-based method to alleviate traffic congestion on an arterial road, setting the stage for the full exploitation of UAM capabilities to reduce ground traffic congestion.},

Specifically, our framework consists of a simple yet effective daytime-mixed supervised learning phase and a Retinex-based reconstruction phase. In the first phase, we employ a multi-instance with adaptive information fusion (AIF) module integrated within a UNet enhancement network called MIFUNet, which is trained via a daytime-mixed supervised loss. In the second phase, the Retinex-based reconstruction employs both a light-effect estimation network and an illumination adjustment network to restore the nighttime image, guided by physical principles. To evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, we collect a real non-aligned day-night dataset named the NANE dataset, which contains 748 non-aligned image pairs and 100 nighttime images solely for testing. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art image enhancement methods.},

  abstract     = {With the advancement of self-driving vehicles, autonomous driving systems depend on multimodal data to achieve a dynamic perception of the surrounding environment. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) techniques can enhance azimuth resolution by utilizing the relative motion between the vehicle and targets, requiring a precise trajectory of the vehicle, normally without the assistance of automotive-grade navigation systems. In this case, data-driven autofocus-based algorithms are typically used to implement compensation for non-systematic motion errors. Despite demonstrating robust autofocus capabilities in numerous scenarios, their potential for application in automotive scenarios still needs to be exploited. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive automotive SAR imaging with autofocus workflow and to analyze the performance of autofocus algorithms based on phase gradient autofocus (PGA) in typical automotive scenarios. We rigorously derive the Omega- $\boldsymbol {K}$ algorithm based on the system-grade waveform of frequency modulated continuous wave (FMCW) signals. Based on the analysis of motion error and phase error characteristics, a sub-aperture contrast-based weighted PGA (SAC-WPGA) method, a contrast-based selection strategy (CBSS), and a contrast-based WPGA kernel are proposed to improve the robustness of autofocus for automotive scenarios. In addition, we theoretically discuss the impact of the selection strategy, the PGA kernel, and the selection threshold in detail, highlighting the validity of the proposed method. Finally, we showcase the superiority of the proposed technique by employing experimental data in two typical automotive scenarios, i.e., a simple scenario with isolated dominant points and a complex scenario with strong clutter.},

However, computer vision techniques, especially convolutional neural networks (CNNs), offer promising solutions for automated detection. Driven by this trend, this study proposes CrackVisionX, a state-of-the-art deep learning framework for classifying binary concrete cracks. CrackVisionX lies in its integration of advanced CNN architectures, ResNet50, MobileNet_v3_large, DenseNet121, and EfficientNetB0, with extensive hyper-parameter tuning. This integration optimizes crack detection accuracy while maintaining low model complexity and reducing bias, making it suitable for real-time applications. Furthermore, the framework introduces a robust data augmentation strategy that effectively addresses dataset imbalances, enhancing model generalization across diverse domains. Additionally, CrackVisionX employs comprehensive preprocessing on the METU and SDNET2018 datasets to create six domains: Bridge Deck, Wall, Pavement, SDNET2018, METU, and METU & SDNET2018. The framework’s performance is thoroughly evaluated and benchmarked against state-of-the-art methods, utilizing diverse metrics to improve the detection of cracks in concrete structures. EfficientNetB0, a core component of the framework, demonstrated superior performance with exceptional test accuracies of up to 99.71%, 99.78%, 99.55%, 99.89%, 99.98%, and 99.92% for Bridge Deck, Wall, Pavement, SDNET2018, METU, and METU & SDNET2018, respectively. Moreover, we evaluated the robustness of CrackVisionX using images contaminated with different types and intensities of noise, demonstrating its reliability and effectiveness. This balance between high accuracy and computational efficiency confirms the framework’s potential for practical deployment.

  abstract     = {Several studies have analyzed traffic patterns using Vehicle Detector (VD) and Global Positioning System (GPS) data. VD records the speed of vehicles passing through detectors, GPS data captures traffic speed on the roads. However, unobserved data gaps may arise due to physical malfunctions of sensors in VD data or interruptions in satellite signal reception for GPS data. Unobserved data adds complexity to the analysis and prediction of urban traffic networks. To tackle this challenge, researchers have attempted to estimate unobserved data using spatiotemporal patterns, but approaches that rely solely on past time points are inherently less reliable. In this study, we propose a Virtual network-based Diffusion Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network (V-DCRNN) for estimating unobserved speed data in urban traffic networks using a virtual network. The virtual network is created by adding nodes and edges in virtual directions based on observed nodes at intersections, thereby enhancing the traffic network. The V-DCRNN, which utilizes the diffusion convolution process in the virtual network, uses the augmented traffic network as input to predict traffic speed. Unobserved speed data is estimated based on the values of virtual nodes predicted by V-DCRNN. We evaluate the proposed V-DCRNN model through unobserved speed data estimation experiments in the urban traffic network, where we randomly mask individual nodes and entire intersections. The main contributions of this work are as follows: 1) the design of a virtual network to model additional traffic dynamics at intersections, facilitating the estimation of unobserved speed data; 2) the development of the V-DCRNN model, which leverages a self-attention mechanism to capture spatiotemporal dependencies in urban traffic networks by incorporating the virtual network as input; and 3) an evaluation of the V-DCRNN’s ability to estimate unobserved speed data in urban traffic networks with up to 20% unobserved nodes, demonstrating robust and reliable performance.},

  abstract     = {Cellular-connected uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) have gained increasing attention due to the potential to leverage existing cellular infrastructure for reliable communications between UAVs and base stations. They have been used for various applications, including weather forecasting and search and rescue operations. However, under extreme weather conditions such as rainfall, the trajectory design of cellular UAVs is quite challenging due to weak coverage regions in the sky, limitations of UAV flying time, and signal attenuation caused by raindrops. To this end, this paper proposes a physics-based trajectory design approach for cellular-connected UAVs in rainy environments. A physics-based electromagnetic simulator is utilized to take into account detailed environment information and the impact of rain on radio wave propagation. The trajectory optimization problem is formulated to jointly consider UAV flying time and signal-to-interference ratio, and is solved through a Markov decision process using deep reinforcement learning algorithms based on multi-step learning and double Q-learning. Optimal UAV trajectories are compared in examples with homogeneous atmosphere medium and rain medium. Additionally, a thorough study of varying weather conditions on trajectory design is provided, and the impact of weight coefficients in the UAV trajectory design is discussed. The proposed approach has demonstrated great potential for UAV trajectory design under rainy weather conditions.},

However, they may suffer from inevitable sensor and actuator faults which degenerate the setpoint tracking performance. Within this context, this paper focuses on the issues of deploying event-triggered fault-tolerant controller based on reduced-order descriptor observer. First, allowing for the AGV kinematics and the setpoint tracking objective, we design a reduced-order descriptor sliding mode observer to synchronously reconstruct the tracking error states as well as physical faults. Then, we develop an event-triggered communication scheme in the control center side, leading to the tolerant controller by virtue of reconstructed tracking error dynamics with an improved transmission efficiency. In addition, we perform the strict theoretical guarantee of both estimation stability and tracking stability, based on which, the estimator and controller gains in conjunction with event trigger parameters are codesigned. Finally, the correctness and effectiveness of theoretical derivation are examined by the experimental study of setpoint tracking of AGV.},

  abstract     = {Driver fatigue poses a serious threat to road safety. Although most vehicles are equipped with driver fatigue monitoring models, the performance of existing models is not satisfactory due to the complexity and unclear reliability of fatigue features. To address these issues, this study proposed a multi-layer adaptive driver fatigue monitoring (MADFM) model, based on the steering wheel signals obtained from 25 participants in a driving simulator. The steering wheel signals were sequentially processed through an adaptive window partitioning algorithm based on sample entropy, feature extraction, and an adaptive outlier point removal algorithm based on local outlier factor. Finally, a multi-scale adaptive feature selection (AFS) algorithm based on global-local correlation was applied to obtain the optimal feature set ${D} _{o}$ . AFS algorithm was then validated using a random forest model and compared with existing feature selection algorithms. The results showed that after adopting the AFS algorithm, the model’s fatigue monitoring accuracy reached 93.71%, which was 10.21% higher than the algorithm without using feature selection. Compared to four common feature selection algorithms, AFS algorithm demonstrated superior performance in terms of monitoring accuracy, precision, recall and interpretability. The interpretability analysis results revealed that steering wheel angle and lateral acceleration features were the most sensitive features affecting the accuracy of the fatigue monitoring model. This model could improve the monitoring performance of driver fatigue, prompting safer driving behaviors, and reducing traffic accidents risk.},

  abstract     = {In this work, we address the problem of charging coordination between electric trucks and charging stations. The problem arises from the tension between the trucks’ nontrivial charging times and the stations’ limited charging facilities. Our goal is to reduce the trucks’ waiting times at the stations while minimizing individual trucks’ operational costs. We propose a distributed coordination framework that relies on computation and communication between the stations and the trucks, and handles uncertainties in travel times and energy consumption. Within the framework, the stations assign a limited number of charging ports to trucks according to the first-come, first-served rule. In addition, each station constructs a waiting time forecast model based on its historical data and provides its estimated waiting times to trucks upon request. When approaching a station, a truck sends its arrival time and estimated arrival-time windows to the nearby station and the distant stations, respectively. The truck then receives the estimated waiting times from these stations in response, and updates its charging plan accordingly while accounting for travel uncertainties. We performed simulation studies for $1,000$ trucks traversing the Swedish road network for 40 days, using realistic traffic data with travel uncertainties. The results show that our method reduces the average waiting time of the trucks by 46.1% compared to offline charging plans computed by the trucks without coordination and update, and by 33.8% compared to the coordination scheme assuming zero waiting times at distant stations.},

  abstract     = {Pedestrian trajectory reconstruction is crucial for understanding urban activity patterns, particularly in crime prevention and investigation. Advances in re-identification technology enable the association of pedestrians across extensive video, making video trajectories a vital data source for trajectory mining. Our objective is to develop an effective method for reconstructing pedestrian paths from video trajectories. Existing methods face three main issues: 1) they fail to account for data scale inconsistencies between trajectories and road networks, limiting candidate path diversity; 2) they do not fully integrate distance, direction, and surveillance coverage, leading to inferred paths that do not accurately represent movement characteristics; 3) they do not effectively constrain uncertainty within trajectory data, causing it to propagate during reconstruction. To address these issues, we propose a method based on conditional random field with spatio-temporal feature embedding under entropy constraints (CRF-STEEC). This method standardizes both trajectory and road network data to a uniform scale using adaptive gridding and generates various likely paths. It then infers paths by evaluating their similarity to the target’s spatiotemporal movement characteristics, involving the extraction and embedding of spatiotemporal state features. Finally, to control uncertainty, it analyzes transition features based on trajectory entropy constraints to prevent the accumulation of uncertainty. Experimental results show that CRF-STEEC significantly improves the robustness and accuracy of trajectory reconstruction. Our source code is available at: https://github.com/lee1906068/CRF_STEEC.},

Data quality is crucial to intention prediction under a cooperative vehicle-infrastructure system, whereas the data collection of HDVs relies on the vehicle-infrastructure cooperative perception, which is inevitably exposed to perception errors. In this paper, a robust driving intention prediction framework based on multi-stage learning is proposed in mixed traffic under the vehicle-infrastructure cooperative perception situation. To address this issue, different information sources from vehicles and traffic are considered to derive the implied vehicle dynamic interaction relation and traffic flow context. A feature extraction module is developed to respectively capture the local and global features based on convolutional neural network (CNN) for reducing the impact of noise, which ensures the prominent detailed and overall descriptions of driving intention can be comprehensively acquired. Then, the deep multi-scale technique and multi-layer perceptron network are introduced to further extract deep features, and improve the model adaptability by complementary feature learning mechanism and nonlinear mapping ability. Experiment results on a real-world dataset confirm the effectiveness of our proposal in reducing the impact of poor data quality and accurately predicting driving intention.},

  abstract     = {Automatic road extraction from high-resolution remote sensing images has greatly facilitated the applications of high-precision road mapping in autonomous driving and intelligent transportation. However, challenges such as occlusions from buildings, trees, and complex road shapes bring great difficulties to precise road extraction. Also, existing methods often overlook the integrity of road direction and edge, leading to unsatisfactory extraction results. To alleviate the issue, this paper has presented a direction and edge co-awareness network (DENet). Firstly, the road edge detector (RED) is introduced to extract coarse road edges with abundant directional information. By leveraging the edge enhancement blocks, the edge structures of road can be efficiently refined, achieving the extraction of intricate narrow and elongated road shapes. Secondly, we incorporate the directional spatial attention (DSA) mechanism within the dual encoders and decoders to promote the extraction and fusion of road directional information and elongated features from different orientations, thus greatly mitigating the road occlusion issue. Finally, to fully interlace potential road information, a grouped local-global feature fusion (GLFF) is specifically designed to exchange multi-scale semantic information across different channels, simultaneously emphasizing road features and suppressing irrelevant background features. Numerous experimental results on three public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed DENet for road extraction, achieving F1 scores of 78.51% on the CHN6-CUG dataset, 79.35% on the Massachusetts road dataset, and 77.90% on the GF2-FC dataset, outperforming several existing state-of-the-art methods.

  abstract     = {Coordination at unsignalized intersections has attracted increasing attention in recent years, which aims at improving the efficiency of intersection operations, while eliminating conflicts and deadlocks for Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAVs). This paper addresses the challenging issue of systematically optimizing CAV trajectories, tackling the high computational cost for finding a good solution, especially as the number of lanes and CAVs increases. To do so, a novel systematic optimal trajectory planning model is designed to efficiently guide CAVs through intersections without conflicts and deadlocks. To tackle the computational hurdles and enable real-time applications, based on the model, we develop a Petri net-aided Iterative Trajectory Optimization (P-ITO) solution algorithm. Leveraging the unique characteristics of the problem, this algorithm first designs a Petri net-based controller for conflict and deadlock avoidance so that initial feasible solutions are generated. Then, refinement is made on the initial feasible solutions to obtain an optimal or near optimal solution by designing an iterative process. This algorithm effectively ensures solution feasibility and enhances computing efficiency by searching for an optimal solution in the feasible region. Numerical experiments for intersections with bidirectional six-lane configurations illustrate the efficacy of our model in facilitating the safe and efficient passage of all CAVs while mitigating the risk of deadlocks. The P-ITO algorithm significantly outperforms the commercial solvers in both solution quality and computational time. Furthermore, our method is versatile, applicable to diverse intersection scenarios, and capable of maintaining high computational efficiency.},

However, the presence of information asymmetry and the inherent selfish behavior of vehicles pose significant challenges to task offloading in IoV. Thus, to improve the reliability and efficiency of offloading in scenarios with information asymmetry, an innovative two-stage offloading strategy that employs reinforcement learning to optimize task allocation and scheduling is introduced in this paper. To be specific, the first stage in the proposed offloading strategy involves an initial task allocation strategy based on task attributes, the state of the intermediate buffer queue, and the maximum task reception capacity of Roadside Units (RSUs). The second stage explores partial offloading strategies, investigating the impact of intermediate incentives on offloading decisions. By focusing on maximizing social utility, the destinations, offloading rates, and advantageous portions of intermediate incentives for partial offloading tasks are determined in this paper as well. Moreover, the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithms are used to solve the optimization problem efficiently. Finally, simulation results demonstrate that the proposed innovative strategy significantly outperforms traditional approaches in terms of task completion reliability and efficiency, providing a robust solution for IoV scenarios with information asymmetry.},

  abstract     = {The visibility of images plays a crucial role in Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). However, images captured under hazy environments can degrade visual quality, significantly reducing the working performance of ITS. Although existing dehazing methods have achieved remarkable performance for daytime hazy images, they struggle to overcome the unique degradations under nighttime haze conditions such as glows, weak illumination, hidden noise, and color distortions. To simultaneously address these degradations, we propose VNDHR, a novel Variational Nighttime Dehazing framework using Hybrid Regularization focusing on enhancing the perceptual visibility of nighttime hazy scenarios. Specifically, a new physical model that accounts for multiple degradations under nighttime haze conditions is first constructed. Then, a novel hybrid variational model comprising an $\ell _{p}$ norm, a weighted $\ell _{2}$ norm, and a total variation regularization is developed to obtain a structure-aware illumination and a noise-free reflectance, simultaneously. To remove the nonhomogeneous haze in the illumination, we employ the dark channel prior to estimate parameters in each grid patch. Furthermore, a simple but effective nonlinear stretching function is designed to enhance the texture in the decomposed reflectance component. Finally, the dehazed illumination and the stretched reflectance are combined to generate a haze-free result. Experiments performed on synthetic and real-world nighttime hazy images prove that our VNDHR framework achieves state-of-the-art dehazing performance, providing results with clear details and less noise. Besides, our VNDHR can also handle various types of degraded images well, such as low-light images, daytime hazy images, sandstorm images, and underwater images.},

This paper investigates asynchronous data fusion for lane-level vehicle tracking with randomly delayed measurements and inaccurate detections from millimeter wave (MMW) radars and magnetic sensors in tunnels, where vehicle tracking with single type of sensors can not meet the requirements of reliable and accurate lane-level tracking due to inaccurate radar detections at far distances, noisy radar detections in tunnel environment, and missed or false vehicle detections by magnetic sensors. A multisensor data association algorithm is first designed to assign the measurements of MMW radar and magnetic sensors to a particular vehicle. A multi-lane estimation model is then developed, which employs Bayesian weight mixture filtering to fuse MMW radar and magnetic sensor measurements and to estimate the lane in which a vehicle is located. Finally, the proposed algorithm is implemented in a real environment - the Xianfengding Tunnel located in Jiangxi Province, China. Experiments are conducted to validate the accuracy of the proposed method using real data. The proposed method and the collected data are further integrated to establish a real-time digital twin system aimed at supporting advanced traffic management.

  abstract     = {Object-based visual-inertial odometry (VIO) is applied broadly in location service for ground vehicles and robotics, but tends to be limited to research of pure-vision navigation due to huge object proposal error in dynamic scene. To make up for this limitation, this paper proposes an object-based visual-inertial odometry for ground vehicles in dynamic scene with the aid of LiDAR, which carries out an object detection refinement using bounding box height adjustment on the basis of a coarse frustum-based joint object detection of vision and LiDAR. In addition, we model Euclidean distance of anchored point between consecutive states and encode it as anchored residuals for final sliding window based optimization. Both ablation study and comparison against the state-of-the-art visual-inertial algorithms are implemented in UrbanNav dataset, Loco sequences and self-made data. The experimental results demonstrate that in dynamic scenes with multiple objects, our proposed odometry achieves a 20.7% improvement in localization accuracy, along with more intuitive object proposals and enhanced robustness.},

  abstract     = {In autonomous driving (AD) tasks, data-driven deep reinforcement learning (DRL) outperforms rule-based methods in terms of continuous decision-making and adaptability. However, traditional DRL relies on hand-crafted reward functions, which introduce objective alignment challenges and reward loopholes. Moreover, the black-box structure makes it difficult to explain the decision-making process, which has a direct impact on DRL performance in complex driving situations. To address these shortcomings, a preference-based decomposable proximal policy optimization algorithm (PDPPO) is proposed for reliable interactive urban AD. The framework deconstructs the federated reinforcement learning (FRL) algorithm from various perspectives using a rule-based preference model, resulting in high-availability algorithmic performance for AD. PDPPO employs a data-rule fusion-driven hybrid vision transformer to overcome the objective alignment and high-dimensional state-space representation challenges of traditional DRL in complex urban traffic environments. Furthermore, to address the issue of algorithmic trustworthiness, PDPPO models the multi-agent FRL co-optimization process as an interpretable self-organized group collaboration process. This approach enables the algorithm to strike a balance between model robustness and sample efficiency using preference-heuristic parameter aggregation. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed PDPPO algorithmic framework can implement interpretable single-agent decision control and multi-agent co-optimization processes. Furthermore, it exhibits competitive performance on various benchmark tests.},

However, accurate prediction remains a significant challenge due to the vast array of influencing factors. Many existing approaches often overlook the comprehensive impact of diverse factors on prediction accuracy by considering only a subset of data features. To address this critical issue, a Dynamic Routing Spatial-Temporal Transformer (DRSTT) model specifically tailored for traffic flow prediction is proposed. The DRSTT model captures data features through the design of specialized modules that effectively handle short-term variations, long-term trends, static spatial information of road networks, and dynamically evolving spatial patterns. The proposed approach combines dynamic routing techniques with the transformer model to intelligently adjust information transmission paths within the network according to the distinct features of real-time input data. Utilizing its robust self-attention mechanism, the transformer model effectively captures and analyzes the spatial-temporal dependencies present in data, thereby improving the accuracy of traffic flow predictions. Furthermore, distinct position embeddings are incorporated for different modules to further enhance the model’s capability to recognize and utilize various feature types. The DRSTT model has been thoroughly tested on three traffic flow datasets, consistently surpassing leading techniques and demonstrating its reliability and efficiency in traffic flow prediction.},

  abstract     = {Given the complexity and nonlinearity inherent in traffic dynamics within vehicular platoons, there exists a critical need for a modeling methodology with high accuracy while concurrently achieving physical analyzability. Currently, there are two predominant approaches: the physics model-based approach and the Artificial Intelligence (AI)–based approach. Knowing the facts that the physical-based model usually lacks sufficient modeling accuracy and potential function mismatches and the pure-AI-based method lacks analyzability, this paper innovatively proposes an AI-based Koopman approach to model the unknown nonlinear platoon dynamics harnessing the power of AI and simultaneously maintaining physical analyzability, with a particular focus on periods of traffic oscillation. Specifically, this research first employs a deep learning framework to generate the embedding function that lifts the original space into the embedding space. Given the embedding space descriptiveness, the platoon dynamics can be expressed as a linear dynamical system founded by the Koopman theory. Based on that, the routine of linear dynamical system analysis can be conducted on the learned traffic linear dynamics in the embedding space. By that, the physical interpretability and analyzability of model-based methods with the heightened precision inherent in data-driven approaches can be synergized. Comparative experiments have been conducted with existing modeling approaches, which suggest our method’s superiority in accuracy. Additionally, a phase plane analysis is performed, further evidencing our approach’s effectiveness in replicating the complex dynamic patterns. Moreover, the proposed methodology is proven to feature the capability of analyzing the stability, attesting to the physical analyzability.},

Accurate and reliable detection of smart road studs and its further integration into the perception and control modules of connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) undoubtedly benefit road boundary detection, localization of CAVs and augument the safety of CAVs’ driving. This work investigates real-time, accurate and reliable detection of smart road studs, which is a challenging task for CAVs because existing methods fail to achieve accurate and real-time smart road stud detection, especially in harsh road environment. To address these challenges, we first build a real-world smart road stud dataset, and then propose and validate a lightweight and efficient smart road stud detection model based on the you only look once 8th version (YOLOv8), called SRS-YOLO. First, a Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) attention module is used to improve the coarse-to-fine (C2F) module to differentiate the channel importance of feature maps and improve the detection accuracy of smart road studs. Second, a novel downsampling module (DownS) that integrates the average pooling and the max pooling is designed to reduce the number of parameters and minimize information loss during the downsampling process. Third, the loss function is replaced with the Normalized Wasserstein Distance (NWD) loss to alleviate the sensitivity to location deviations when computing the loss for small targets. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed SRS-YOLO outperforms other state-of-the-art methods, and achieves a 87.92% mean average precision at a real-time speed of 78 frames/s.

  abstract     = {Vehicular intrusion detection systems (VIDSs) play a crucial role in protecting the security of vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs). Recently, numerous researchers have proposed effective vehicular intrusion detection systems to protect the security of VANETs. However, some existing vehicle intrusion systems are susceptible to catastrophic forgetfulness in the process of implementing incremental updates to target novel attacks. Other solutions lack consideration for the continuous updating capabilities of vehicle intrusion detection systems. It is worth mentioning that in the real world, the network attacks suffered by vehicles are not constant, and fixed intrusion detection systems may struggle to detect new network attacks effectively. To address these challenges, we propose an incremental learning-based vehicular intrusion detection scheme that supports continuous updating of the intrusion detection system. Specifically, we design a sample gradient optimization algorithm to enhance the data quality of training samples. Additionally, we utilize locally stored historical data to balance the number of old attack classes for model distillation, thus mitigating the problem of forgetting the old classes as the model learns new classes. The comprehensive experimental results on the CICIDS2017, TON_IOT, and Veremi datasets demonstrate that the proposed vehicular intrusion detection system maintains superior detection accuracy during continuous updating and surpasses the state-of-the-art solution.},

Additionally, it integrates a Bidirectional Cross-scale Feature-Fusion Module (BCFM) and a decoder.

A Gating Mechanism (GM) within the EAR connections selectively filters and enhances relevant features based on the ongoing feature process. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

  abstract     = {The high risks in tunnel construction underscore the critical necessity for intelligent tunnel construction. Unmanned tunnel data collection is vital for intelligent construction; additionally, semantic segmentation aids in understanding the environment. However, complex tunnel terrains are challenging for three-dimensional (3D) laser scanning, and diverse interior structures and nontunnel elements complicate accurate segmentation by subsequent networks. Therefore, this paper proposed a tunnel mobile 3D mapping system (TMMS) for complex terrain in construction tunnels using a quadruped robot and simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). Additionally, a deep learning-based semantic segmentation network (TUC-Net) is proposed for analysing 3D point clouds in tunnels under construction. The research presented the neighbourhood feature perception enhancement (NFPE) module to enhance the representation of local features, introduce a self-attention (SA) module and improve the loss function to improve network accuracy. The NFPE module enhances feature aggregation for unstructured objects, and the SA module improves the learning of global features, critical for tunnel point cloud segmentation. The TMMS is used to collect point cloud data from tunnels under construction, leading to the creation of the tunnels under construction point clouds (TUCPC) dataset for training and evaluating the TUC-Net network. Compared to other 3D point cloud semantic segmentation methods, the proposed method demonstrated superior performance, achieving an overall accuracy (OA) of 99.45% and a mean intersection over union (mIoU) of 94.06%, surpassing that of other methods by at least 4.41%. In addition, ablation studies were also performed on the NFPE and SA modules to validate their efficacy.},

Observed from the operational practice of Tianjin port, a world-leading smart port, four critical facilities, namely quay cranes, lock stations, intersections, and yard cranes, are identified as bottlenecks that impact handling efficiency. Congestion at these facilities, in particular, pose significant challenges to terminal managers. To address these issues, we investigate an integrated terminal scheduling problem and formulate this novel problem as a mixed-integer linear program, from which we derive two efficient lower bounds. To tackle practical-sized problems, we propose a reinforcement learning (RL)-based algorithm with two modules. The offline module uses RL to learn from abundant historical data. When actual instance information is available, the online module enhances offline decisions using a rollout mechanism and mathematical programming. The proposed algorithm employs a pre-trained offline policy to handle extensive computations before actual decision-making and an online phase that provides a streamlined and stable method to enhance the solution. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, demonstrating an 18.22% reduction in makespan compared to the rule-based heuristic used in actual port operations.},

  abstract     = {The morphological diversity, referring to the variations in traffic network topologies defined in this paper, often emerges and brings difficulties in successfully transferring a pre-trained prediction model from one traffic network to another. Moreover, most existing research primarily assumes that traffic data in source and target networks follow independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) patterns, which is usually not consistent with real-world situations, particularly when considering morphological diversity. For this inconsistency, many efforts have been made, but they mainly concentrate on temporal aspects, which significantly differ from traffic prediction due to spatial and temporal correlations among road segments, influenced by variations in road topology and traffic behavior. This paper introduces a causality-based spatiotemporal out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization method, which is adaptable to most GNNs for diverse, large-scale, dynamic traffic systems with zero-shot. Furthermore, to enhance the generalization and adaptability of the proposed method, we introduce graph matching and equal-sized graph partitioning to alleviate spatial shift between the source and target traffic networks, reduce and align the scale of the networks. Experiments carried out on traffic flow datasets demonstrate that our method significantly improves the performance of various GNN-based traffic predictors in the situation of morphological diversity, achieving a maximum reduction in MAE of 33.08%. Compared to other OOD-driven baselines, our approach also shows a notable improvement, with up to a 40.58% decrease in MAE.},

  abstract     = {To effectively address the service gap in the first and last mile connections of metro systems, a two-stage model was developed for designing feeder bus services. The first-stage was the feeder bus stop selection model, which was used to select feeder bus stops from existing conventional bus stops. In this stage, we proposed a method to merge stops to prevent feeder bus stops from being too close to each other. The second-stage was the feeder bus route planning model, which was used to plan routes between the feeder bus stops selected in the first-stage. A two-stage heuristic algorithm was established to efficiently solve the two-stage model. The practicality of the proposed approach was verified in Harbin. The results showed that: 1) bus stop merging method could reduce the stop overlap rate by 59.32% while decreasing the stop coverage rate by only 4.07%; 2) stop selection impacts route planning, and their integration in the two-stage model could ensure optimized feeder bus services; 3) compared with the conventional model, the two-stage model could reduce the total travel time by 27.17%; and 4) appropriately increasing the number of routes could reduce the average route length. The proposed method provides a reference for designing feeder bus services.},

Additionally, most algorithms do not consider the impact of the applied torque of the driver on the steering wheel when determining the optimal return speed while the wheel is being held. This highlights an ongoing need to improve the return-to-center quality in vehicles. To address this challenge, this study proposes a steering motion quality control method based on a motion-closed loop. Here, we delineate the context wherein, by establishing a desired returnability, the return-to-center speed during release or holding phases is achieved via direct control through a motion closed-loop. This approach harmonizes the steering feel with the return-to-center performance, thereby enhancing the stability of the vehicle during straight-line driving. Subsequently, we validate the efficacy and robustness of the proposed steering motion quality-oriented vehicle return-to-center control strategy in managing returnability, as evidenced by low-speed and high-speed return-to-center simulation tests using a driving simulator.},

  abstract     = {Missing traffic data is a common phenomenon in practice, which has serious implications for the development of downstream data-driven traffic research. Although numerous methods have been proposed to impute missing values, two limitations still exist: lack of complete ground truth and reliance on carefully constructed model structures. In this paper, we propose a novel deep neural imputation network framework named STIseq2seq, based on self-supervised contrastive learning. It follows a sequence-to-sequence architecture with attention mechanism to address the traffic data imputation problem. Specifically, the model consists of two key components: encoder and decoder, both composed of ST-block. Initially, we utilize dynamic graph convolution (DGC) and gated recurrent unit (GRU) to construct the fundamental unit, ST-block, for learning spatiotemporal dependencies. Then, a bidirectional ST-block is employed to model incomplete input data in the encoder; while a forward ST-block combined with an attention mechanism is used to accurately impute missing data in the decoder. Lastly, we devise a training method based on self-supervised contrastive learning, achieved through randomly shuffling the masking matrix, to enhance training effectiveness. Extensive experiments conducted on two available real-world traffic datasets demonstrate that our proposed STIseq2seq has superior and stable performance compared to multiple baseline models under different missing data scenarios with missing rates ranging from 20% to 80%. Visualization analysis of the imputation results further provides insights into the advantages of STIseq2seq.},

  abstract     = {This study focuses on the anti-rollover control problem for autonomous semi-trailer tank trucks and proposes an anti-rollover path tracking control algorithm suitable for autonomous driving scenarios. A simplified semi-trailer tank truck model is established in the controller, modeling liquid as a single pendulum considering both lateral and roll inputs, and an anti-rollover path tracking algorithm that utilizes it is developed based on multi-constraint model predictive control (MPC). The equivalent lateral load transfer rate (LTR), liquid sloshing angle, and angular velocity are used as constraints to achieve multi-objective optimization for path tracking, sloshing suppression, and rollover prevention. A vehicle-fluid coupling co-simulation platform based on computational fluid dynamics (CFD) is built to verify the control performance under extreme scenarios of left turning, high-speed single-lane change (SLC), and short-distance double-lane change (DLC). Additionally, the similarity principle for experimental validation using a down-scale model tank truck is derived, and experiments are conducted on the model semi-trailer tank truck under the DLC scenario. Through simulation and experimental verification, the proposed anti-rollover path tracking algorithm demonstrates acceptable tracking performance while ensuring that no rollover is carried out under extreme conditions, limiting the angle of $|LTR|\lt 0.75$ and sloshing within $- 20\circ $ - $20\circ $ , reducing the angle of sloshing by a maximum of 42% in the experiment. Moreover, the real-time capability of the proposed algorithm meets the requirements for practical applications with a peak time consumption of one control step less than $20~ms$ in the controller tested.},

Some deep learning-based methods show potential but still have significant drawbacks. To address this problem, we propose a feature-based visual SLAM system based on the LightGlue deep learning network. It uses deep local feature descriptors to replace traditional hand-crafted features and a more efficient and accurate deep network to achieve fast and precise feature matching. Thus, we use the robustness of deep learning to improve the whole system. We have combined traditional geometry-based approaches to introduce a complete visual SLAM system for monocular, binocular, and RGB-D sensors. We thoroughly tested the proposed system on four public datasets: KITTI, EuRoC, TUM, and 4Season, as well as on actual campus scenes. The experimental results show that the proposed method exhibits better accuracy and robustness in adapting to low-light and strongly light-varying environments than traditional manual features and deep learning-based methods.

However, traditional approaches primarily rely on macroscopic traffic data from loop detectors, which often fail to capture the fine-grained interactions among vehicles and roadway features, leading to limited prediction accuracy. To address this gap, we propose a novel vehicle trajectory prediction method based on geometric deep learning (GNN-T), integrating a graph neural network with an attention mechanism. The graph neural network captures vehicle and lane features, and the attention mechanism models interactions between vehicles and between vehicles and lanes, significantly enhancing prediction performance. The evaluation results show that GNN-T outperforms conventional car-following models and other baseline methods, achieving improvements in trajectory prediction accuracy by 7.1% to 9.5%. Furthermore, a traffic flow shockwave prediction model, based on wavelet transform and predicted trajectories, is developed to predict shockwave occurrence, timing, propagation speed, and amplitude. Compared to the Intelligent Driver Model and traditional traffic flow detection methods, our approach demonstrates superior performance, with accuracy rates in shockwave prediction up to 93.5% in validation datasets.

However, UAM does not provide door-to-door service and often requires other transportation modes to travel from origin to destination. To address this problem, study proposes the Urban Surface and Air Mobility (USaAM) concept that enables door-to-door travel, utilizing the same fly-drive vehicle for both surface and airborne transportation. The proposed USaAM concept provides a traffic control system for surface and airborne traffic, allowing for the integration of fly-drive vehicles into the existing surface traffic. To simulate the proposed concept, a first-of-its-kind microsimulation platform is developed. Multiple traffic demand profiles were assessed on an urban corridor, revealing that USaAM has significant potential. However, our study also shows that as surface traffic demand increases, landing performance deteriorates, while increases in both surface and airborne traffic demands lead to declines in takeoff performance.

To hedge against the uncertainty of vehicle density, the problem is formulated as a stochastic mixed-integer nonlinear program with equilibrium constraints. This program aims to minimize the expectation of weighted sum of V2R communication delay, packet loss rate and packet collision rate and age of information in V2R communication over all scenarios given RSU location budget limit. Decision variables are RSU locations and the number of connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs) communicating with each located RSU. Equilibrium constraints in the program model V2R communication channel competition among CAVs and ensures the choice of CAVs on RSUs to satisfy user equilibrium principle. The V2R communication is calculated under 6G technology. The program is linearized by using piecewise linearization method. To enhance the solution efficiency, a progressive hedging algorithm is developed to decompose the relaxed linearized model into several subproblems. The optimal solution to the relaxed linearized model is found by iteratively formulating and the solving subproblems. A branch and bound algorithm is introduced to obtain the optimal integer solution to the linearized model. The numerical results show that the proposed model can achieve 20.55% lower total communication delay than the state-of-the-art model only optimizing total V2R information propagation delay, when CAVs choose RSUs for communication in a competitive manner.},

It optimizes traffic flow, facilitates human interaction, and ensures compliance with regulations. However, it faces the challenge of tracking pedestrians in the presence of occlusion. Existing methods overlook effects caused by abnormal detections during partial occlusion. Subsequently, these abnormal detections can lead to inaccurate motion estimation, unreliable appearance features, and unfair association. To address these issues, we propose an adaptive occlusion-aware multiple pedestrian tracker, OccluTrack, to mitigate the effects caused by partial occlusion. Specifically, we first introduce a plug-and-play abnormal motion suppression mechanism into the Kalman Filter to adaptively detect and suppress outlier motions caused by partial occlusion. Second, we develop a pose-guided re-identification (Re-ID) module to extract discriminative part features for partially occluded pedestrians. Last, we develop a new occlusion-aware association method towards fair Intersection over Union (IoU) and appearance embedding distance measurement for occluded pedestrians. Extensive evaluation results demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods on MOTChallenge and DanceTrack datasets. Particularly, the performance improvements on IDF1 and ID Switches, as well as visualized results, demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in multiple pedestrian tracking.},

  abstract     = {Accurate pedestrian intention prediction (PIP) by Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) is one of the current research challenges in this field. In this article, we introduce PIP-Net, a novel framework designed to predict pedestrian crossing intentions by AVs in real-world urban scenarios. We offer two variants of PIP-Net designed for different camera mounts and setups. Leveraging both kinematic data and spatial features from the driving scene, the proposed model employs a recurrent and temporal attention-based solution, outperforming state-of-the-art performance. To enhance the visual representation of road users and their proximity to the ego vehicle, we introduce a categorical depth feature map, combined with a local motion flow feature, providing rich insights into the scene dynamics. Additionally, we explore the impact of expanding the camera’s field of view, from one to three cameras surrounding the ego vehicle, leading to an enhancement in the model’s contextual perception. Depending on the traffic scenario and road environment, the model excels in predicting pedestrian crossing intentions up to 4 seconds in advance, which is a breakthrough in current research studies in pedestrian intention prediction. Finally, for the first time, we present the Urban-PIP dataset, a customised pedestrian intention prediction dataset, with multi-camera annotations in real-world automated driving scenarios.},

  abstract     = {Railway scene status perception is the foundation for ensuring the efficient and safe operation of trains. Achieving comprehensive railway scene perception requires not only detecting objects but also understanding the relationships between them. However, current railway scene perception technologies struggle with the latter, while general object and relationship perception methods perform poorly when facing railway scene with significant structural features and small object characteristics. Thus, this paper proposes Rail-former, the first status perception framework specifically designed for railway scene. Rail-former operates based on two key components: the Railway Feature Enhancement Module (RFEM) and the Cross-Coupled Transformer (CCTF). RFEM first leverages a cluster-based normalization evaluation method to condense railway scene structural features in spatial domain. It then applies high-dimensional information compensation to enhance small-object feature representation. The CCTF implements a cross-coupled structure between object decoder and triplet decoder based on a novel interactive attention mechanism, rather than conventional single-decoder or parallel dual-decoder structures, enabling guided enhancement of both object features and relationship features in railway scene. Additionally, we introduce a multimodal matching loss function that incorporates masks, categories, and bounding boxes to mitigate overfitting to a single modality during training. To the best of our knowledge, Rail-former is the first work in the railway domain that leverages panoptic parsing results to reveal relationships. Extensive experiments conducted on both our self-constructed railway dataset and a public dataset demonstrate the superior performance of our approach, achieving accuracy rates of 49.9% and 37.4%, surpassing the best competing methods by 7.8% and 1.1%, respectively.},

  abstract     = {Existing multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) in adaptive traffic signal control (ATSC) typically models cooperative control of multiple intersections as a cooperative Markov game, optimizing the average traffic efficiency of intersections with the same emphasis. However, it is insufficient to meet the requirements in real ATSC scenarios when all intersections are treated equally. To this end, this work proposes the Captain-Member Markov Game (CM-MG) that considers the different priorities between intersections. CM-MG categorizes intersections into special and ordinary intersections, controlled by captain agents and member agents to optimize the traffic efficiency of local and overall road networks, respectively. The cooperative requirements of CM-MG are achieved through a sequential decision-making principle. Captains have priority in choosing actions, and members make decisions sequentially, following the breadth-first traversal order in the road network after obtaining their precursors’ intentions. Then, a cooperative MARL algorithm, i.e., Sequential Decision Deep Graph Network (GNSD-Light), is proposed to learn the optimal joint policy that meets the learning goals of both captains and members. To be unrestricted by the scales of intersections, GNSD-Light adopts an autoregressive framework where all agents make decisions sequentially in a predetermined order by sharing the same decision model. In addition, to obtain sufficient state representation, two relative position encoding-based spatiotemporal representation modules are designed for GNSD-Light based on the characteristics of ATSC scenarios. Finally, through adequate experiments and qualitative analysis, we have confirmed that our method effectively balances traffic efficiency among both the overall road network and special intersections.},

  abstract     = {Traffic speed prediction is significant for intelligent navigation and congestion alleviation. However, making accurate predictions is challenging due to three factors: 1) traffic diffusion, i.e., the spatial and temporal causality existing between the traffic conditions of multiple neighboring roads, 2) the poor interpretability of traffic data with complicated spatio-temporal correlations, and 3) the latent pattern of traffic speed fluctuations over time, such as morning and evening rush. Jointly considering these factors, in this paper, we present a novel architecture for traffic speed prediction, called Interpretable Causal Spatio-Temporal Diffusion Network (ICST-DNET). Specifically, ICST-DNET consists of three parts, namely the Spatio-Temporal Causality Learning (STCL), Causal Graph Generation (CGG), and Speed Fluctuation Pattern Recognition (SFPR) modules. First, to model the traffic diffusion within road networks, an STCL module is proposed to capture both the temporal causality on each individual road and the spatial causality in each road pair. The CGG module is then developed based on STCL to enhance the interpretability of the traffic diffusion procedure from the temporal and spatial perspectives. Specifically, a time causality matrix is generated to explain the temporal causality between each road’s historical and future traffic conditions. For spatial causality, we utilize causal graphs to visualize the diffusion process in road pairs. Finally, to adapt to traffic speed fluctuations in different scenarios, we design a personalized SFPR module to select the historical timesteps with strong influences for learning the pattern of traffic speed fluctuations. Extensive experimental results on two real-world traffic datasets prove that ICST-DNET can outperform all existing baselines, as evidenced by the higher prediction accuracy, ability to explain causality, and adaptability to different scenarios.},

  abstract     = {Infrared and visible image fusion (IVF) plays an important role in intelligent transportation system (ITS). The early works predominantly focus on boosting visual appeal of the fused result, although several recent approaches have tried to combine high-level vision task with IVF, they prioritize the design of cascaded structure to seek unified suitable features and fit different tasks. Thus, they tend to bias toward reconstructing raw pixels without considering the significance of semantic features. Therefore, we propose a novel prior semantic guided image fusion method based on the dual-modality strategy, improving the performance of IVF in ITS. Specifically, to explore the independent significant semantic of each modality, we first design two parallel semantic segmentation branches with a refined feature adaptive-modulation (RFaM) mechanism. RFaM can perceive the features that are semantically distinct enough in each semantic segmentation branch. Then, two pilot experiments based on the two branches are conducted to capture the significant prior semantic of source images, which is then applied to guide the fusion task in the integration of semantic segmentation branches and fusion branch. In addition, to aggregate both high-level semantics and impressive visual effects, we further investigate the frequency response of the prior semantics, and propose a multi-level representation-adaptive fusion (MRaF) module to explicitly integrate low-frequency prior semantic with high-frequency details. Extensive experiments on two public datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method over state-of-the-art fusion approaches. Our method has better performance on four quantitative metrics in fusion task and achieves the highest mIoU in semantic segmentation task.},

Among these, car-following behavior modeling plays a pivotal role, forming the foundation for systems that ensure safe and efficient vehicle interactions. However, current approaches often rely on fixed parameters, failing to capture the diverse social preferences and driving styles of individuals. To overcome these limitations, we propose the Editable Behavior Generation (EBG) model, a data-driven car-following model that allows for adjusting driving discourtesy levels. The framework integrates diverse courtesy calculation methods into long short-term memory (LSTM) and Transformer architectures, offering a comprehensive approach to capture nuanced driving dynamics. By integrating various discourtesy values during the training process, our model generates realistic agent trajectories with different levels of courtesy in car-following behavior. Experimental results on the naturalistic datasets showcase a reduction in Mean Squared Error (MSE) of spacing and MSE of speed compared to baselines, establishing style controllability. To the best of our knowledge, this work represents the first data-driven car-following model capable of dynamically adjusting discourtesy levels. Our model provides valuable insights for the development of ADAS that take into account drivers’ social preferences.},

The integration of global navigation satellite systems (GNSS), inertial navigation system (INS), and ultra-wideband (UWB) technology holds significant promise for enhancing the continuity and reliability of vehicle cooperative positioning. In tightly coupled GNSS/INS/UWB integration, the tolerance against measurement outliers and state model perturbations is pivotal for fulfilling the specific requirements of critical ITS applications. To optimize the comprehensive performance of vehicle cooperative positioning under uncertain sensor observation environments, this paper proposes a robust multiple fading factors unscented Kalman filtering (RMFUKF) algorithm based on adaptive cost function. The proposed solution incorporates Huber M-estimation with an adaptive tuning strategy to perform measurement-specific outliers processing. Furthermore, the improved multiple fading factors based on an exponential weighting method are implemented to mitigate the effects of dynamic model mismatches. Experimental results from vehicular field experiments demonstrate that the proposed RMFUKF scheme significantly improves the robustness and adaptive performance of vehicle cooperative positioning under unpredictable, real-world operating conditions.},

This paper proposes a two-way ranging and timing (TRT) method that can provide high-precision inter-node relative ranging and timing results for relative navigation. Affected by the high-dynamics between nodes and nonuniform measuring interval caused by measurement instant jitter, the conventional TRT methods cannot achieve high-precision ranging and timing. To this end, we propose a TRT method using osculating polynomial timestamp unification. In this method, we first use the piecewise osculating function to construct the generalized-order timestamp unification model, and then use binomial theorem and boundary conditions to solve the unknown coefficients. Next, we implement time-varying interval processing and symmetry processing skills to reduce computational burden. Finally, we provide the estimator of the actual distance and clock offset (considering clock drift and initial clock offset) between two asynchronous nodes. Based on the proposed TRT method, we further propose a measuring precision improvement strategy based on the measurement interval adaptive optimization. This strategy can adaptively adjust the measurement interval according to the dynamics. The superiority of the proposed TRT method in terms of precision is verified by simulations under different measurement instant jitter, dynamics, and standard deviation of measurement noise.},

In this paper, we present an efficient MAUVs cooperative adaptive coverage path planning algorithm. Specifically, we introduce the neuronal activity reassigned (NAR) algorithm as the initial step to devise optimal navigation paths for a single AUV. Through the utilization of both the AUV steering number optimization strategy and the deadlock point escape algorithm based on the glasius bio-inspired neural network (GBNN), the path planning process is jointly optimized. Then, the adaptive balance evolution (ABE) algorithm is designed with the AUV energy constraints as a guide to match each AUV to a subtask sea area with task volume differentiation by dividing the task sea area in multiple iterations based on the residual capacity difference of individual AUVs. Finally, the simulation and experiment results demonstrate that the MAUVs cooperative adaptive coverage path planning algorithm proposed in this paper offers several advantages, including optimal task balance, extensive coverage, minimal path repetition rate, reduced occurrence of deadlock points, and decreased steering times. These benefits are instrumental in facilitating the MAUVs system’s efficient execution of refined search tasks.},

In this study, we propose to solve the vehicle routing problem using the Grover adaptive algorithm. Compared to classical algorithms and existing quantum methods, our innovative algorithm achieves a quadratic speedup, with a time complexity of $O\left ({{K\sqrt {\frac {N}{M}}}}\right)$ . Additionally, it is applicable to a broader range of real-world scenarios, as it can directly handle linear inequality constraints without introducing slack variables. Notably, the algorithm operates independently of classical optimizers and gradient-based methods, thereby circumventing potential challenges such as the “barren plateaus” phenomenon. Experimental results from four instances demonstrate the feasibility and correctness of the proposed approach, highlighting its capability to handle inequality constraints easily.},

  abstract     = {As autonomous driving technology advances, automated vehicles (AVs) will increasingly share road space with pedestrians, creating significant challenges for AV systems. Effective interaction between AVs and pedestrians is one of the key hurdles. Pedestrian simulation tools offer the potential to expedite the evaluation and refinement of these interactive capabilities. However, existing research lacks efforts to model pedestrian behavior in vehicle-yielding scenarios, resulting in distorted modeling results. This paper proposes a perceptually plausible road-crossing decision model that creates temporal-dynamic crossing decisions across a range of vehicle-yielding scenarios. Specifically, a proposed hybrid perception strategy explains how pedestrians may apply psychophysical cues to make crossing decisions. Discrete choice models based on the hybrid perception strategy combined with a crossing initiation model reproduce the details of crossing decisions: the decision and its timing. An empirical dataset collected in a pedestrian simulator is applied to validate the model. Additionally, the latest crossing decision models, i.e., the evidence accumulation model and the artificial neural networks approach, are employed as comparisons. The results show that the proposed model accurately reproduces crossing decision patterns affected by diverse vehicle kinematics in vehicle-yielding scenarios in a perceptually plausible manner. Our results strengthen the notion that there is a perceptual threshold for pedestrians to control their decision-making strategy. The proposed theory and approach bring insights into the computational pedestrian road-crossing behavior and have practical implications in traffic simulation and AV development.},

However, a challenging problem that remains is effectively segmenting environments that contain multiple adverse factors within the same scene. To tackle this issue, we present SCDF, an adaptive semantic segmentation approach. SCDF employs two separate image processing modules for denoising and enhancement of low-quality inputs. To enhance the denoising effect, we also optimized the loss function of its defogging module. Furthermore, we proposed a novel weight adaptation module, which enables SCDF to switch between different driving scenarios. To evaluate the effectiveness of SCDF, we conduct experiments on the ACDC and Rainy & Foggy cityscapes datasets, respectively achieving a higher mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) score of 61.4%(ACDC) and 79.1%(Rainy & Foggy Cityscapes). This promising results demonstrate the potential of SCDF in significantly improving the performance of autonomous driving systems in complex environments with multiple adverse factors.},

A novel practical performance-prescribed reinforcement learning-based distributed sliding mode (PRLDSM) control framework is constructed for the platoon to strengthen the robustness and possess the online self-learning capacity for optimizing and control. Specifically, a composite controller is proposed for the platoon which consists of an online optimal controller and a sliding mode controller. By the strong learning capacity provided by the PRLDSM controller, the optimal policy and cost function can be recursively approximated by online simultaneous tuning of both actor and critic neural networks. Moreover, it is proved that all the signals in the closed-loop platoon control system are uniformly ultimately bounded and approach zero by selecting appropriate parameters. Theoretical analysis eventually guarantees that the tracking errors can be stabilized to satisfy both the individual vehicle stability and disturbance string stability with the prescribed transient response and steady-state accuracy. The obvious feature of the proposed PRLDSM controller is that the requirement of the exact vehicle dynamics and topological matrix of the inter-vehicle communication topology can be avoided. Both numerical examples and experimental studies illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed control method.},

  abstract     = {Depth map estimation from images is a crucial task in self-driving applications. Existing methods can be categorized into two groups: multi-view stereo and monocular depth estimation. The former requires cameras to have large overlapping areas and a sufficient baseline between them, while the latter that processes each image independently can hardly guarantee the structure consistency between cameras. In this paper, we propose a novel self-supervised multi-camera collaborative depth prediction method with latent diffusion models, which does not require large overlapping areas while maintaining structure consistency between cameras. Specifically, we introduce MCDP, a new generative foundation model for estimating depth attributes for multi-cameras. We formulate the depth estimation as a weighted combination of depth bases, in which the weights are updated iteratively by the recurrent refinement strategy. During the iterative update, the results of depth estimation are compared across cameras, and the information of overlapping areas is propagated to the whole depth maps with the help of basis formulation in diffusion process. We integrate the GRU-based Weight Net into the diffusion process, allowing the refined hidden state to serve as a conditional input to accurately control the next iterative denoising step. Furthermore, by incorporating the proposed depth consistency loss, we ensure structural consistency across cameras, even in regions with minimal overlap. Experimental results on DDAD, NuScenes, Cityscapes, and Waymo Open Datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our method, and show great help for the downstream task.},

This results in a constrained application environment for current freespace detection methods. This paper proposes an adaptive environment scale freespace detection method in 2D image space. The method does not require data labeling and has better environmental adaptability. The core idea is to adaptively map a fixed point cloud scale in 3D space to a pixel scale in 2D space using the camera projection relation to obtain the fine environmental gradient. Then design search rule to label freespace in 2D space. Experiments on two public datasets, urban and field, achieved F1 scores of 92.50% and 89.09%, respectively.

  abstract     = {The cooperation in mixed cooperative-competitive tasks has drawn significant attention in multi-agent deep reinforcement learning. Agents need to cooperate with their teammates while competing against their opponents. However, most existing works treat the cooperative agents and competitive agents equally as they perform the same operation on all the agents. As a result, without distinguishing between cooperative and competitive agents, they may suffer from information disorder in learning an optimally cooperative policy and struggle to decide on the next step action. To address the above issues, we decompose the final Q-value into a weighted combination of three parts: the Q-values of the cooperative agents, the competitive group, and the current agent. A theoretical proof of the correctness of the decomposition is provided. With this decomposition, we are able to consider cooperative and competitive agents separately. Accordingly, we propose a multi-agent actor-critic algorithm called actor-double-attention-critic (ADAC) under centralized training and decentralized execution according to the decomposition. In ADAC, networks with group-specific attention and an attentional weighting network are specially designed. With the designed double-attention structure, ADAC can capture the distributions from different agents and improve cooperation performance. Extensive experiments are conducted in three scenarios with nine settings against six representative methods. The results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed ADAC model against state-of-the-art methods in various mixed cooperative-competitive tasks.

  abstract     = {The vehicle platoon control for highway traffic can help to improve traffic flow efficiency, enhance traffic safety, and reduce fuel consumption. In previous platoon control research, most of the driving behaviors are described using deterministic car-following models. Nevertheless, random factors that may come from the vehicle power train and additional stimuli, can have a greater impact on platoon control in highway traffic. In this paper, a novel stochastic control method is proposed based on a stochastic car-following model which considers microscopic driving behavior. Firstly, the stochastic car-following model is designed that fully accounts for the impact of random factors on platoon control. Secondly, an optimal objective function is constructed and the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation is used to solve this stochastic control problem, thereby completing the upper-level controller design and obtaining the optimal desired acceleration of the vehicle. Thirdly, the stochastic stability method is applied to analyze the proposed model and obtain the stochastic stability conditions satisfied by the model. Finally, tests are conducted for three different scenarios: stable speed, acceleration, and deceleration with additive and multiplicative noise, as well as the case where the lead vehicle’s speed is based on real vehicle trajectory data. These tests validate the stability and effectiveness of the stochastic car-following model predictive control method from the perspective of control strategy and model respectively. The experimental results show that under the stable parameter conditions of the model, the connected and automated vehicle platoon can achieve accurate speed tracking and maintain an appropriate safe distance in highway system.},

  abstract     = {Escaping the station during the golden time is the main reference for managers to develop optimization strategies under floods. However, regular evacuation drills often fail to incorporate the impact of flood evolution and involve ethical considerations. The evacuation time obtained from microscopic simulations makes it difficult to meet real-time requirements, which is time-consuming and labor-intensive. To address this issue, this paper proposes a flood-induced evacuation time prediction model for metro stations, with high accuracy and strong real-time performance. The hydrodynamic model and passenger dynamics model for the metro station are built based on the Fluent and the PathFinder software, to obtain the evacuation time corresponding to different scene parameters and evacuation scales. The flood invasion speed and gate availability parameters in the scene parameters, as well as the number of passengers and the proportion of passengers with different attributes, are used as inputs to the prediction model, and the evacuation time is used as the output. The accuracy of the constructed time prediction model is mainly concentrated between 0.85 and 1.00, with a high fit between the predicted values and the actual values. An evacuation path optimization strategy is further provided to reduce evacuation time and improve evacuation safety. Taking evacuation time, evacuation path length, and human stability risk as optimization objectives, the optimal path decision under a multi-objective game is obtained. Results show that adopting an optimization strategy significantly reduces evacuation time and increases the maximum passenger capacity threshold allowed by the platform during the golden evacuation time. The proposed method provides feasible suggestions for the rapid evaluation of station evacuation efficiency and improvement of escape strategies under flood conditions.},

  abstract     = {The reflections of multi-colored lights involved on rainy nights present strong uncertainties and abruptness, resulting in a high rate of false and missed detections in existing methods. To solve this issue, this paper proposes a lane detection method based on memory and discretization mechanisms. Firstly, a Memory Fruit-fly-optimizer with Individual Differences (MFID) is innovatively proposed to drive Multi-threshold Otsu (MOtsu)-based multi-class segmentation of lanes, which is a high-dimensional optimization task with real-time and local optimal challenges, for capturing lane clues obscured in multi-intensity reflections, consequently reducing missed detections. Specifically, to solve the challenges inherent in the task, the MFID incorporates a novel memory mechanism to establish fast-converging initial conditions for real-time detection, while creatively considering individual differences to motivate multi-swarm optimization that mitigates local optima risks. After integration, the MFID-MOtsu is constructed for lane segmentation. Subsequently, a dynamic discretization mechanism is proposed to efficiently separate lane edges from interference edges, mitigating accuracy degradation caused by their entanglement. Finally, the false detection issue is greatly reduced through the implementation of adaptive geometric filters. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves an average accuracy of 93.21% on rainy nights, indicating an average improvement of 12.7% over state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, without any parameter modifications, the proposed method is applicable to both normal and classic challenging scenes, such as nights, tunnels, rainy days, and shadows. The algorithm achieves an average accuracy of 96.2% and an average detection speed of 46 frames per second.},

Supervised learning for this incurs high annotation costs, and current semi-supervised methods struggle with viewpoint differences. In this paper, we introduce ground-to-aerial perception knowledge transfer and propose a progressive semi-supervised learning framework for drone perception using only labeled data from the ground viewpoint and unlabeled data from flying viewpoints. The framework hinges on four key components: 1) a dense viewpoint sampling strategy, segmenting the vertical flight height range into evenly distributed intervals; 2) nearest neighbor pseudo-labeling, inferring labels of the nearest neighbor viewpoint using a model learned on the preceding viewpoint; 3) MixView, generating augmented images among different viewpoints to mitigate viewpoint differences; and 4) a progressive distillation strategy, gradually learning until reaching the maximum flying height. To validate our approach, we create both synthesized and real-world datasets. Extensive experimental analyses reveal a remarkable relative accuracy improvement of 25.7% and 16.9% for the synthesized dataset and the real world, respectively.

Against this backdrop, this paper proposes a novel stochastic cooperative adaptive cruise control (CACC) strategy to realize the stable control of nonhomogeneous vehicle platoon system with simultaneously suffering from the on-board sensor data distortion, random wind disturbance, and communication delay. First, the dynamics model of the nonhomogeneous platoon with variant vehicle masses and lengths is built based on the predecessor-leader following (PLF) communication topology. Then, the simplified characteristic of sensor data distortion resulting from the limited sensing range is depicted in line with the variation of headway spacing. Thereafter, the random wind velocity is treated as the Gaussian white noise and incorporated into the platoon system via employing the Ito stochastic differential. The varying road slope and communication delay are also accommodated in unison. Next, the distributed robust $H\infty $ controller is generated via the stochastic Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional approach. Moreover, the condition for string stability is derived with the defined stochastic ${\mathcal { L}}_{2}$ stability criterion. Finally, numerical simulations and real-time hardware in loop (HiL) experiment demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed approach.},

Physiological measurement of driver monitoring (rather than just eye tracking) is a nascent approach gaining attention in the space of in-vehicle technologies; however, existing contact sensor-based approaches raise concerns regarding system usage, complexity and privacy. This paper presents research which developed a novel, contactless heartrate monitoring system for drivers using Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave (FMCW) short-range radars, which was validated in vehicular environments. A combination of signal processing and neural network methodologies, incorporating Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), was adopted to mitigate the effects of body motion and other motion artifacts that cause noisy radar data. The neural network was trained on ground truth data collected in parallel using a medical-grade BIOPAC ECG system. Similarly, the results were validated and compared against this ground truth. The experimental results evidence that FMCW radars are a promising methodology for in-vehicular cardio physiological applications, displaying an overall accuracy of 93% in detecting drivers’ heartrate (HR) and inter-beat-interval (IBI). Additionally, there was no significant difference observed in the RMSE results for driving and non-driving conditions, evidencing that the methodology performed efficiently in both the conditions. This paper demonstrates the benefits of FMCW radars for contactless physiological driver monitoring applications within automotive domains, and beyond.},

  abstract     = {In this paper we introduce a general estimation methodology for learning a model of human perception and control in a sensorimotor control task based upon a finite set of demonstrations. The model’s structure consists of (i) the agent’s internal representation of how the environment and associated observations evolve as a result of control actions and (ii) the agent’s preferences over observable outcomes. We consider a model’s structure specification consistent with active inference, a theory of human perception and behavior from cognitive science. According to active inference, the agent acts upon the world so as to minimize surprise defined as a measure of the extent to which an agent’s current sensory observations differ from its preferred sensory observations. We propose a bi-level optimization approach to estimation which relies on a structural assumption on prior distributions that parameterize the statistical accuracy of the human agent’s model of the environment. To illustrate the proposed methodology, we present the estimation of a model for car-following behavior based upon a naturalistic dataset. Overall, the results indicate that learning active inference models of human perception and control from data is a promising alternative to closed-box models of driving.},

  abstract     = {Due to certain technical limitations of autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV), they cannot completely perform complex tasks independently. When performing complex tasks, coordination between the remote operated vehicle (ROV) and AUV is required. Therefore, collision avoidance is a key technology to ensure vehicle safety. During collision avoidance, AUV need to understand human intentions, make decisions, and perform the corresponding actions. To solve the problems of human intention uncertainty and random noise interference, an AUV collision avoidance strategy based on a dynamic Bayesian network and stochastic model predictive control (SMPC) is proposed in this paper. First, a dynamic Bayesian network is used to assess the probability of AUV collisions in the system. Then, using the properties of Gaussian distribution and related theorems, the objective function is simplified and transformed into a deterministic model predictive control problem. Finally, the intention-exploration item is added to the objective function to better understand human intention. Through the simulations and experiments in specific scenarios, it is verified that the proposed collision avoidance control strategy can safely and effectively control a hybrid system with the coexistence of ROV and AUV.},

Stop plan plays a vital role in generating a train timetable with maximum railway capacity and ensuring high-quality service to transport passengers. Therefore, we are addressing the challenge of optimizing both the stop plan and timetable for a group of trains on a railway line, focusing on railway capacity estimation and passenger demand satisfaction. To provide realistic and precise passenger distribution, the preferences of different categories of passengers are given due regard. A classic time-space network describes the integrated problem, based on which a mathematical model is formulated to minimize train occupancy time on the high-speed railway line and maximize passenger kilometers at the same time. A decomposition approach based on Lagrangian relaxation (LR) is suggested to address the problem, which decomposes the integrated scheduling problem into two sub-problems: a train timetabling sub-problem, and a stop planning and passenger distributing sub-problem by dualizing constraints linking the two. A heuristic approach based on genetic algorithms is designed to obtain feasible solutions. The proposed model and approach are shown to generate good solutions efficiently. A series of real-world instances are conducted on the Beijing-Shanghai high-speed railway line in China, and the experimental outcomes show the benefits of optimizing the stop plan. Other related analyses are discussed by comparing results with different total number of stops, heterogeneous and homogeneous cases.},

BCD refers to the application of brain-machine interface (BMI) technology to driving, where control commands from the human brain are decoded by BMI technology and used to assist in the control of vehicles. However, existing BCD systems display inadequate performance in joint lateral and longitudinal control, and BCD systems in complex driving scenarios with other vehicles have not been studied. In this study, a nonlinear smooth controller is proposed, and a BCD system for complex driving scenarios is developed based on it. First, the BCD system is built from three modules, namely, the vehicle module, the BMI module and the controller module. Subsequently, the nonlinear smooth controller is developed based on the BMI controller, the proximal policy optimization (PPO) controller, and the self-adaptive collaborative (SAC) controller. The SAC controller is designed based on a sigmoid function to achieve nonlinear smoothness in the process of allocating control authority between the PPO controller and the BMI controller. The results of online driving experiments demonstrate that the proposed controller is better equipped to handle complex driving scenarios, exhibiting superior performance, heightened safety, and improved user experience compared to the PPO controller and BMI controller. This study holds significant value in advancing the practicality of BCD and providing a foundation for future research on BMI control.},

  abstract     = {Accurate real-time traffic prediction in intelligent transportation systems, remains a challenging task because of the frequently changing spatio-temporal dependencies, complex dynamics of the network and varying traffic density. While, existing methods have widely explored the hidden linkages for real-time traffic prediction, multi-faceted interactions between various traffic signals can play an important role in improving the accuracy rate of such systems. This work presents a novel method for analyzing the interrelated interactions between different features of traffic signals through a co-related channeled-spatio-temporal graph attention network. The proposed model is aimed to reflect the intricate channel, temporal and spatial connections between various traffic signal components. The model learns three different embeddings to describe the interactions between traffic signals using graph attention networks. These embeddings are in-line with the signals temporal dynamics, spatial interactions, and channel-based features. Correlation score is used to evaluate the degree of similarity between nodes in various time windows, which ultimately aids in the selection of the most important data. The proposed model is able to outperform various state-of-the-art methods in a series of trials on five real-world datasets. A comprehensive analysis of the results prove that the proposed model not only captures the spatio-temporal correlations in traffic patterns, but is also able to take into account the interactions between traffic signals and their impact on traffic flow changes over time, leading to a 9.7% improved error rate.},

  abstract     = {The increasing interest in Digital Twins (DT) for road infrastructure stems from their ability to seamlessly integrate data from various sources and facilitate interactions between physical entities and their virtual counterparts. The cornerstone for achieving a road digital twin is a high-quality road model. Despite the widespread application of Building Information Modeling (BIM) technology across various stages of road engineering, the modeling of existing roads within the BIM framework has faced challenges, including a lack of accurate design data and extensive manual work. This paper presents an innovative and cost-effective approach to model existing roads by combining Uncrewed Airborne Vehicles (UAVs) - LiDAR System (ULS) and BIM. It begins with the development of a low-cost UAV-LiDAR platform designed for efficient data collection in road environments, capturing essential geometric information. Subsequently, point cloud mapping techniques, including an intensity-based planar downsampling strategy and a hierarchical refinement method, are employed to create accurate point cloud maps using the cost-effective ULS. Further, an automated modeling pipeline is proposed with point cloud processing and Revit Dynamo. It comprises three main steps: cross-section model design, point cloud parameter extraction, and the design of an automated workflow in Dynamo. The proposed method is validated with both qualitative and quantitative experiments, and the results demonstrate that the generated model accurately represents the structural, alignment, and lateral gradient details of the experimental road. In summary, this study offers a cost-efficient yet highly effective means to construct realistic models of existing roads.},

Our approach employs a coarse-to-fine strategy for ground feature extraction and integrates wheel odometry to refine C2G calibration parameters through nonlinear optimization. To ensure accuracy despite nonrigid transformations during driving, we establish stop criteria to identify reliable calibration parameters and introduce quantitative metrics for performance evaluation.

  abstract     = {3D object detection based on multi-camera is essential for autonomous driving systems. The current popular multi-camera detectors can be decoupled into multiple feature extraction modules with different functions. Such network paradigms often lead to the pre-trained image backbone module only receiving implicit and sparse supervision signals, and the image depth estimation has inherent ambiguity, which collectively limits the performance of the detector. In this paper, we present DenseBEV, a robust solution to bird’s-eye-view (BEV) 3D object detection with densely aggregated multi-view camera features. Specifically, we propose a novel multiview multiscale cross-attention (MMCA) module in the BEV decoder, which makes the BEV object query interact with multi-camera features in a standard attention paradigm. The aim of the MMCA is to make the pre-trained image backbone more easily optimized for 3D scenes for autonomous driving. Furthermore, we introduce contrastive denoising in the decoder head to assist in training the BEV detection model, alleviating the chaotic prediction problem caused by indistinct image depth estimations. Our method achieves significant improvements (i.e., +2.3NDS and +2.8mAP) over previous state-of-the-art BEV-based methods on the challenging nuScenes validation set. DenseBEV also achieved competitive results of 63.1 NDS and 55.4 mAP on the nuScenes test set.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, visual tracking has witnessed remarkable advancements with the exploration of feature extraction and correlation modeling techniques. However, inadequate robustness of either the backbone network or the correlation operation continues to plague existing trackers, leading to frustrating drift when confronted with similar distractors or cluttered backgrounds. To address this problem, we propose a hierarchical attention-enhanced correlation refinement network (HarNet) for achieving robust visual tracking. Specifically, a gated dual-view attention (GDA) module is first designed to aggregate the intra-layer attention and the inter-layer self-attention based on a fusion gate, so as to enhance hierarchical feature representations of the template. Meanwhile, a target-aware attention (TA) module introduces the template information to the inter-layer self-attention, which can highlight the target information in the search region. Moreover, a graph guided correlation (GGC) module leverages the pixel-to-local and pixel-to-global correlations to fully exploit both local- and global-spatial information between the template and the search region, and then uses the graph convolutional network (GCN) to further learn the node relationships of the correlation map for more finegrained correlations. Thus, with the above three elaborately designed modules, the HarNet is beneficial for the enhancement of feature representation and the precise localization of the target. Extensive experiments on popular visual tracking datasets (including OTB100, VOT2016, VOT2018, VOT2019, UAV123, UAV20L, GOT-10k, and LaSOT) demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method against several state-of-the-art tracking methods.},

  abstract     = {A swarm of robots offers significant advantages over a single robot, enabling faster exploration of larger areas and enhanced robustness against single-point failures. Accurate relative positioning is critical for executing collaborative missions without collisions. When Visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (VSLAM) is employed to estimate each robot’s poses, the inter-agent loop closing method is commonly used to improve relative positioning accuracy by refining pose estimates and merging local maps based on shared feature points. However, this approach demands considerable computational and communication resources. In this paper, we introduce Collaborative SLAM using Visual Odometry and Ranges (CoVOR-SLAM) to address these challenges. CoVOR-SLAM significantly reduces both the amount of data transmitted between robots and their computational loads, as it requires only pose estimates, covariances, and range measurements instead of feature or map points for inter-agent loop detection. The necessary range measurements can be derived from pilot signals within the communication system, eliminating the need for complex additional infrastructure. We evaluated CoVOR-SLAM using real images and ultra-wideband range data collected from two rovers, as well as in a larger multi-agent setup utilizing public image datasets and realistic simulations. The results demonstrate that CoVOR-SLAM accurately estimates robot poses while requiring considerably less computational power and communication capacity than inter-agent loop closing techniques.},

Unlike the traditional ATM, the number of small UAVs in the airspace may be in the millions, making air traffic management challenging. In an ATM, airspace is composed of airways, intersections, and nodes. In this paper, a three-dimensional (3-D) roundabout model is utilized as an airspace structure for air traffic intersections of known traffic network models, which is decomposed into a central island, several ramps, and buffer zones. In this paper, for simplicity, the distributed coordination of the motions of Vertical TakeOff and Landing (VTOL) UAVs to pass through a 3-D roundabout is focused on, which is formulated as a 3-D roundabout passing-through problem. The corresponding control objectives include inter-agent conflict-free, keeping within the 3-D curved virtual tube, and avoiding local minima. Lyapunov-like functions are designed elaborately, and formal analysis is made to show that all UAVs can pass through the 3-D roundabout without getting trapped. Taking the kinematic model of VTOL UAVs into consideration, the horizontal control and attitude control channels are decoupled, which is more reasonable for practical applications.

  abstract     = {This study proposes a novel distributed model predictive control (DMPC) approach for mixed vehicle platoons (MVPs), which achieves driving safety, asymptotic stability, and traffic wave dissipation simultaneously. The longitudinal dynamics model and safety constraints are first established for each vehicle. The MVPs are divided into several sub-platoons according to the distribution of connected-and-automated vehicles (CAVs) and human-driven vehicles (HDVs). Then, a compound controller to ensure the head-to-tail string stability of MVPs is constructed as a reference controller for the subsequent design of the double-layer distributed model predictive controller (DL-DMPC). To describe the behavior of human drivers, a car-following model specific to HDVs is developed. On the basis of the designed compound controller and the description of HDVs, the DL-DMPC is proposed. The first layer improves tracking performance and satisfies the state constraints of each CAV under different communication topologies through an optimization problem. The second layer utilizes controller-matching technology to ensure the asymptotic stability of vehicle platoons and dissipate traffic waves. With the above double-layer structure, the DL-DMPC can simultaneously address multiple tasks and is applicable in various communication topologies. Simulations and analyses based on the NGSIM dataset are conducted in various scenarios to validate the effectiveness of the developed approach.},

  abstract     = {Whereas on many motorways, traffic operations are permanently monitored, and long historical logs of such data exist, they are not directly usable for lane change studies, as they only register local passages and speeds. This study proposes a novel method to transform discrete vehicle passage records of individual vehicle data (IVD) into approximations of vehicle trajectories and inference of lane change maneuvers (LCMs), such that large-scale LCM dataset can be retrieved from existing infrastructures where IVD is recorded at sufficiently close spacings (~600 meters). The method’s core is a probabilistic re-identification of individual vehicles in successive, lane-specific loop detectors. Dubbed Traffic Flow Crystallization (TFC), the methodology enhances traffic monitoring by providing vast and diverse LCM datasets. It consists of two key re-identification (ReID) modules: a lane-restricted module that matches vehicles strictly within the same lane and a non-lane-restricted module that recursively identifies lane-changing vehicles using boundary conditions imposed by previously matched vehicles. This recursive process resembles crystal growth, inspiring the method’s name. The ReID methodology is based on a weighted likelihood function consisting of Bayesian probability estimators that integrate three similarity measures: vehicle length, passage time, and passage speed. A lane-change feasibility filter ensures that re-identified vehicles satisfy plausible spatiotemporal constraints. The final module resolves inconsistencies and infers LCMs. The proposed method is trained and validated using CCTV footage, where visually-identified vehicles serve as ground truth. Validation results demonstrate a vehicle ReID success rate exceeding 96% and an inferred LCM rate with only a 2% underestimation compared to ground truth.},

V2V communication improves the safety of drivers and assists them in making the appropriate decision according to road conditions. Since V2V communication happens in open public channels, an adversary takes advantage of it and tries to launch several potential threats. This article designs a blockchain-assisted V2V communication and authentication scheme using Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) and a Physically Unclonable Function (PUF) called DBKE. In DBKE, vehicles perform their registration with their nearest Roadside Unit (RSU) without assisting the centralized cloud server. Then, one vehicle can communicate with another using the information stored in the blockchain. During the communication, both vehicles first perform the process of mutual authentication and then securely generate the session keys without sending the private parameters to the public channels. The formal analysis of DBKE is done with the Scyther and Real-or-Random (ROR) models, which confirm that the DBKE is robust and safe from attacks. Furthermore, the detailed comparative study of the security features reveals that the DBKE scheme provides superior security and low computation cost compared to the existing V2V authentication protocols.},

  abstract     = {Vision-based future vehicle localization provides intuitive trajectory prediction, serving as a critical foundation for Advanced Driving Assistance Systems (ADAS) to formulate collision avoidance decisions. Among existing approaches, ego-view trajectory prediction has proven effective for driver monitoring and intervention in vision-based localization. This method aligns closely with human perceptual processing, making it essential for the Driver-in-the-Loop (DIL) development stage in modern ADAS. However, most existing ego-view trajectory prediction approaches rely on two-dimensional image-based predictions, creating a gap with human three-dimensional perception. This disparity negatively impacts the accuracy and timeliness of driver decision-making and intervention. In this paper, we propose MFV3DL (Monocular Vision Method for Future Vehicle 3D Localization), a dual-stream framework integrating 2D image trajectory prediction and depth prediction to achieve future vehicle 3D localization. To enhance accuracy, we leverage Multi-Object Tracking and Segmentation (MOTS) results and depth estimation as inputs for the dual-stream architecture. Additionally, we introduce a Related Information Fusion (RIF) unit to enable cross-modal interaction between the two streams. For depth stream predictions, we propose a ConvLSTM-based depth prediction method. Experimental results on the KITTI dataset demonstrate that MFV3DL outperforms state-of-the-art methods. In diverse driving scenarios, MFV3DL achieves superior 3D visualization results compared to 2D trajectory-based predictions. Baseline comparisons and ablation studies further validate that the proposed ConvLSTM-based depth prediction enhances the dual-stream architecture and RIF unit for 3D localization tasks.},

The problem is formulated as a bi-level mixed-integer bilinear program to capture passengers’ realistic path choice behavior. The upper-level model aims to minimize the weighted sum of the cost of bus route construction, bus route operation, bus station construction, travel time of passengers, the delay caused by failures in aboarding to the bus trips at the origin, the delay caused by failures in transfer between the bus trips, and the overflow delay when the bus trip operates at capacity. The lower-level model aims to minimize the travel time of passengers. The travel time of passengers is formulated as the sum of the waiting time for boarding, the transfer time, and the in-vehicle travel time. The passenger transfer time and the delay caused by failures in transfer between the bus trips are formulated with exact modeling of passenger transfer behavior. This bi-level mixed-integer bilinear program is transformed into an equivalent mixed-integer bilinear program with equilibrium constraints using Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions. To seek a solution of good quality to the proposed model while not requiring a large amount of computer memory, a Benders decomposition algorithm integrated with piecewise linearization is developed. A numerical application demonstrates that the proposed model is able to achieve 3.49% lower total cost than the baseline model assuming passenger transfer time to be half of the headway.},

  abstract     = {Bird-eye-view (BEV) perception for autonomous driving has become popular in recent years. Among various BEV perception tasks, moving-obstacle segmentation is very important, since it can provide necessary information for downstream tasks, such as motion planning and decision making, in dynamic traffic environments. Many existing methods segment moving obstacles with LiDAR point clouds. The point-wise segmentation results can be easily projected into BEV since point clouds are 3-D data. However, these methods could not produce dense 2-D BEV segmentation maps, because LiDAR point clouds are usually sparse. Moreover, 3-D LiDARs are still expensive to vehicles. To provide a solution to these issues, this paper proposes a semantics-assisted moving-obstacle segmentation network using only low-cost visual cameras to produce segmentation results in dense 2-D BEV maps. Our network takes as input visual images from six surrounding cameras as well as the corresponding semantic segmentation maps at the current and previous moments, and directly outputs the BEV map for the current moment. We also propose a movable-obstacle segmentation auxiliary task to provide semantic information to further benefit moving-obstacle segmentation. Extensive experimental results on the public nuScenes and Lyft datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our network.},

Then, we present a probabilistic planning approach built on top of the Comprehensive Reactive Safety framework. This planner optimizes for driving utility in expectation, while ensuring collision constraints are satisfied for all potential prediction trajectories, regardless of their probabilities. Through a series of simulation experiments, the proposed planner is shown to be effective.

  abstract     = {Accurate and safety-quantifiable localization is of great significance for safety-critical autonomous systems, such as Autonomous ground vehicles (AGVs) and autonomous aerial vehicles (AAVs). The visual odometry-based method can provide accurate positioning in a short period but is subject to drift over time. Moreover, the quantification of the safety of the localization solution (the error is bounded by a certain value) is still a challenge. To fill the gaps, this paper proposes a safety-quantifiable line feature-based visual localization method with a prior map. The visual-inertial odometry provides a high-frequency local pose estimation, which serves as the initial guess for the visual localization. By obtaining a visual line feature pair association, a foot point-based constraint is proposed to construct the cost function between the 2D lines extracted from the real-time image and the 3D lines extracted from the high-precision prior 3D point cloud map. Moreover, a global navigation satellite system (GNSS) receiver autonomous integrity monitoring (RAIM) inspired method is employed to quantify the safety of the derived localization solution. Among that, an outlier rejection (also well-known as fault detection and exclusion) strategy is employed via the weighted sum of squares residual with a Chi-squared probability distribution. A protection level (PL) scheme considering multiple outliers is derived and utilized to quantify the potential error bound of the localization solution in both position and rotation domains. The effectiveness of the proposed safety-quantifiable localization system is verified using the datasets collected by AAV and AGV in indoor and outdoor environments, respectively.

  abstract     = {Periodic spatial-temporal safety messages play a significant role in supporting driving safety in Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). These messages include GPS coordination and are communicated between ITS nodes at small intervals to increase situational awareness and alleviate the risk of collision. However, even when pseudonyms are used rather than real IDs, an adversary can exploit the safety messages to deanonymize the trajectories of the ITS nodes. Specifically, the adversary can correlate collected pseudonyms to draw traces for node trajectory. This paper opts to tackle such vulnerability and proposes a novel certificate-less pseudonym scheme that withstands trajectory tracking attacks in ITS. Our scheme enables each node to autonomously generate a single-use pseudonym for every message while allowing a particular pseudonym to be generated by multiple nodes to increase false positive correlation of pseudonyms with nodes. Unlike competing approaches, we study the complete lifecycle of pseudonyms and show that our scheme is secure and lightweight. The simulation results demonstrate that our scheme considerably increases the anonymity of the ITS nodes and achieves a very low traceability rate.},

Specifically, we compare four NLP algorithms—Jaccard, TF-IDF, fastText, and BERT—with an LLM framework (GPT-3.5) to process violation descriptions. Following text conversion, we implement eight data-driven classification models, ranging from linear and tree-based to neural network approaches, to predict crash-prone violations. Our experimental results reveal that BERT and GPT-3.5 significantly improve classification accuracy and recall by extracting meaningful insights from text, whereas the other NLP methods may introduce noise.

  abstract     = {Microscopic traffic simulation provides a controllable, repeatable, and efficient testing environment for autonomous vehicles (AVs). To evaluate AVs’ safety performance unbiasedly, the probability distributions of environment statistics in the simulated naturalistic driving environment (NDE) need to be consistent with those from the real-world driving environment. However, although human driving behaviors have been extensively investigated in the transportation engineering field, most existing models were developed for traffic flow analysis without considering the distributional consistency of driving behaviors, which could cause significant evaluation biasedness for AV testing. To fill this research gap, a distributionally consistent NDE modeling framework is proposed in this paper. Using large-scale naturalistic driving data, empirical distributions are obtained to construct the stochastic human driving behavior models under different conditions. To address the error accumulation problem during the simulation, an optimization-based method is further designed to refine the empirical behavior models. Specifically, the vehicle state evolution is modeled as a Markov chain and its stationary distribution is twisted to match the distribution from the real-world driving environment. The framework is evaluated in the case study of a multi-lane highway driving simulation, where the distributional accuracy of the generated NDE is validated and the safety performance of an AV model is effectively evaluated.},

To address this challenge, we introduce a universally applicable representation of traffic scenes, forming the basis for our unified attribution method. Specifically, we leverage the first-order Taylor expansion at a specific hidden layer, i.e., the product of gradients and feature maps, to represent abstract traffic scene information. This representation guides both the optimization of attribution path generation and the attribution computation, enabling consistent and effective attributions for both lane-change prediction and vision-based control models. Experiments on two distinct autonomous driving models demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in explanation accuracy and robustness, advancing the interpretability of DNN-based autonomous driving models.},

  abstract     = {Pavement cracks have a highly complex spatial structure, a low contrasting background and a weak spatial continuity, posing a significant challenge to an effective crack detection method. To precisely localize crack from an image, it is critical to effectively extract and aggregate multi-granularity context, including the fine-grained local context around the cracks (in spatial-level) and the coarse-grained semantics (in semantic-level). In this paper, we apply the dilated convolution as the backbone feature extractor to model local context, then we build a context guidance module to leverage semantic context to guide local feature extraction at multiple stages. To handle label alignment between stages, we apply the Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) strategy to align the feature between two stages. In addition, to our best knowledge, we have released the largest, most complex and most challenging Bitumen Pavement Crack (BPC) dataset.

  abstract     = {Coplanar array capacitance imaging technology (CACT) is a non-destructive testing (NDT) method with rapid visual recognition. However, there is little research on its application for identifying internal distress in asphalt materials. This study proposes a CACT using a novel coplanar array capacitance sensor (CACS) to identify internal distress in asphalt materials. Firstly, the sensitivity field distributions of electrode pairs and CACS are established, and the optimal sensitivity layer is determined. In addition, the normalized capacitance of electrode pairs and the contribution rate required for distress imaging are analyzed. Finally, the distress images of asphalt materials are reconstructed. The relative depth, shape feature, and type of internal distress are determined. It is found that Layer 14 is the optimal sensitivity layer. Circular distress exhibits the highest normalized capacitance values, followed by square distress and triangle distress. The opposing electrode pairs demonstrate the greatest contribution to distress imaging. The redder the image, the deeper the distress, demonstrating that CACT can determine the relative depth of internal distress. The square distress image has the highest accuracy, followed by circular distress and triangle distress. The reconstructed images show that moisture distress in asphalt mixtures is reconstructed with the highest accuracy, followed by moisture distress in asphalt mastics, void distress in asphalt mastics, and void distress in asphalt mixtures.},

Nonetheless, it is still impeded by sparse bird’s-eye view (BEV) representation and unfavorable temporal context across frames, resulting in a sub-optimal solution to decision-making and vehicle navigation. In this work, we propose a novel Difference-guide Motion Prediction for vision-centric autonomous driving, that is DMP, where it integrates BEV map refinement with spatial-temporal relation modeling in a hierarchical manner. Specifically, a bidirectional view projection strategy is introduced for the complementary BEV feature generation via depth-consistency correction. To promote spatiotemporal context aggregation, we design a difference-guided motion approach by offset approximation to align motion-aware cues between adjacent frames, and a dual-stream pyramid module is further developed for historical information fusion and future instance segmentation during specific durations. Extensive experiments on the large-scale nuScenes dataset demonstrate that it outperforms the baselines by a remarkable margin and delivers competitive motion prediction across diverse scenarios and range settings, suggesting its effectiveness and superiority.

However, the insufficient defect samples and their diverse patterns make defect detection in complex environments highly challenging. This paper proposes a novel train surface defect detection model (ViLG) via visual-language knowledge guidance. By leveraging broad semantic knowledge of CLIP, the model compensates for the insufficient defect semantics in tiny datasets and enhances the ability to recognize unseen defects. First, we propose Visual Feature Guidance with CLIP, which enriches and enhances the global representation capabilities of backbone while preserving its self-learning ability for visual representations. This improves semantic understanding of complex scenarios and diverse defects. Second, we propose Defect Query Selector, which selects defect queries based on the semantic relevance between texts and global feature embeddings. This increases attention to potential defects and reduces missed detections. Finally, we propose Semantic Consistency Loss, which semantically aligns defect queries with defect prompts. With additional cross-modal supervision signals, it refines the semantics of defects. For real-world scenarios with normal reference images, we propose ViLG+, which effectively filters false positives using feature similarity. It further verifies that the global embeddings effectively represent the overall structure of visual scenes as well as subtle local features. Compared with other advanced methods on two train surface defect datasets and two public defect datasets, ViLG shows higher precision, recall, and average precision on unseen defects with relatively faster speed, with average improvements of 23.58, 3.23, and 6.05, and has a more balanced false positive rate and false negative rate.},

  abstract     = {The operation of urban rail transit is inevitably affected by disturbances in practice, causing the original train timetable and rolling stock circulation to be infeasible. This paper addresses the real-time train rescheduling problem through a novel two-step optimization framework. To realign train operations with the original plan, the first step manages traffic flow by optimizing dispatching measures, including retiming, cancellation, short-turning, and backup rolling stock utilization. To maintain the highest possible service quality during the transition period, the second step introduces stop-skipping and further fine-tunes the train timetable. Both steps are formulated as mixed-integer nonlinear programming models, and the second-step model is heuristically decomposed. For computational tractability, mathematical models are transformed using some linearization techniques and then solved according to the prescribed procedure. Numerical experiments based on a small-scale case and real-world data of the Beijing Yizhuang Metro Line show that the proposed two-step optimization framework can satisfy the real-time requirements and outperform the current rescheduling method employed in the automatic train supervision system. Furthermore, the framework is proven to be applicable to different disturbance durations and locations.},

We propose a Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithm based on Gated Recurrent Unit neural networks (GRU-SAC) to dynamically adjust the process noise covariance matrix online using sequential observation data to improve positioning accuracy. We model the decision-making process as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) and incorporate multiple information sources as the system state. The GRU network is used to extract temporal features from the navigation data and to address memory consumption issues commonly associated with POMDPs. And the SAC algorithm continuously adjusts the process noise covariance based on observations from the Kalman filter, allowing the algorithm to perform better in complex, dynamic, and changing navigation environments. Additionally, we provide detailed design and deployment strategies for both loosely-coupled and tightly-coupled systems. Extensive experiments have been conducted to validate the effectiveness of our method.

To cope with this challenge, we propose a novel map-free trajectory prediction method that leverages spatiotemporal attention mechanisms. The method consists of three key stages: 1) we first encode spatial and temporal features separately using spatial and temporal attention mechanisms, 2) we then model spatial and temporal interactions through Crystal Graph Convolutional Networks (CGCN) and Multi-Head Attention (MHA), 3) finally, an adaptive anchor generation technique is introduced to tackle the multimodal trajectory prediction challenge. This self-adaptive technique generates context-specific anchors, enabling accurate prediction of multiple possible future vehicle trajectories.

On the Argoverse1 dataset, our method outperforms CRAT-Pred by 5.8% in minADE and 6.25% in minFDE.

  abstract     = {Agent-controlled intelligent subnetworks are envisioned as an integral part of Beyond 5G (B5G) communications for automatically selecting distinct policies based on dynamic performance constraints. In the B5G era, energy efficiency will be a prominent feature of Radio Access Network (RAN) slicing for achieving sustainable networks and lowering operational costs while multiplexing users with heterogeneous Quality-of-Service (QoS) requirements. Considering the importance of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) within the realm of B5G applications, in this paper, we propose the LazyRAN framework as an energy-efficient Radio Resource Block (RRB) allocation approach for multi-policy RAN slicing in B5G ITS edge networks. Initially, we focus on resource utilization efficiency and define Lazy Skip Markov Decision Process (LS-MDP) formulation for spectrum agents to individually perform fine and coarse stochastic control depending on performance requirements incorporating varying levels of laziness. Followingly, we propose LazyRAN framework that uses Bayesian Optimization (BO) based Offline Policy Selection (OPS) for optimality calculations in case of multiple slicing policies. Our framework enables efficient multi-policy evaluation employing both exploration and exploitation in the agent policy space. The OPS method utilizes a Gaussian Process (GP) surrogate function combining logged data with online agent interactions before searching for the best slicing policy with BO. Using an energy-aware approach, hybrid QoS reward per energy consumption (HQEC), we compare the performance of LazyRAN framework in centralized and decentralized settings considering diverse agent policies. Our results show that the proposed scheme can significantly improve energy utilization with greater HQEC and higher throughput measurements while satisfying hybrid QoS demands.},

The ship trajectory is then obtained by predicting and matching the ship’s position in two adjacent frames, which provides the ship’s spatial-temporal dynamic information for collision risk assessment. The ship collision risk is quantified by integrating the Distance and Time at the Closest Point of Approach (DCPA/TCPA) indicators, and the safe and prohibited velocity space of every ship is presented to assist VTS operators in evaluating the traffic conditions and support their decisions for safe navigation.

Along these lines, an RGB-D image based visual SLAM (vSLAM) leveraging semantic Patch-NetVLAD loop closure detection for autonomous driving vehicles in semi-static scenes is proposed. First, the lightweight SeaFormer is utilized to perform semantic segmentation on the input RGB image, and an ORB feature point extraction method based on lighting invariance is designed to obtain a high-confidence static feature point set. Then, a “coarse-to-fine” high-quality keyframe selection strategy is developed, ensuring the efficiency and real-time performance of the system for long-term operation. Further, a high-performance screening strategy of closed-loop candidate keyframes is constructed by combining structural similarity (SSIM) and cosine similarity. On this basis, a high-precision loop closure detection strategy combining semantics and patch-based multi-scale fusion of vector of locally aggregated descriptors (Patch-NetVLAD) is constructed, which effectively eliminates the closed-loop mismatching due to dynamic and invalid matching. Finally, a global semantic octree map that can be used for navigation is generated using keyframes and semantic masks. A series of simulation studies and experimental tests demonstrate the performance superiority of the proposed algorithm.},

  abstract     = {Curb detection is a crucial function in intelligent driving, essential for determining drivable areas on the road. However, the complexity of road environments makes curb detection challenging. This paper introduces CurbNet, a novel framework for curb detection utilizing point cloud segmentation. To address the lack of comprehensive curb datasets with 3D annotations, we have developed the 3D-Curb dataset based on SemanticKITTI, currently the largest and most diverse collection of curb point clouds. Recognizing that the primary characteristic of curbs is height variation, our approach leverages spatially rich 3D point clouds for training. To tackle the challenges posed by the uneven distribution of curb features on the xy-plane and their dependence on high-frequency features along the z-axis, we introduce the Multi-Scale and Channel Attention (MSCA) module, a customized solution designed to optimize detection performance. Additionally, we propose an adaptive weighted loss function group specifically formulated to counteract the imbalance in the distribution of curb point clouds relative to other categories. Extensive experiments conducted on 2 major datasets demonstrate that our method surpasses existing benchmarks set by leading curb detection and point cloud segmentation models. Through the post-processing refinement of the detection results, we have significantly reduced noise in curb detection, thereby improving precision by 4.5 points. Similarly, our tolerance experiments also achieve state-of-the-art results. Furthermore, real-world experiments and dataset analyses mutually validate each other, reinforcing CurbNet’s superior detection capability and robust generalizability.

  abstract     = {Transportation mode-aware trajectory recovery is the fundamental for individual oriented downstream tasks in intelligent transportation systems. Different from vehicle based trajectory recovery, it suffers from the heterogeneity and sparsity issues arising from the insufficient data labelled for distinct transportation modes (e.g., obtaining limited individual trajectories from modes like walking or cycling due to privacy concerns while obtaining rich vehicle trajectories from the mode like driving). To alleviate this, we develop a novel Cross-trAnsportation-mode Knowledge transfEr method with meta learning, coined as Cake, to first learn generalized parameters from source modes (i.e., the relatively dense modes) and then share the meta knowledge with the targets (i.e., more sparse modes), which significantly improve the recovery performance for the sparse. To achieve this, we first develop an efficient fine-GRAined Personalized trajectory rEcovery model called Grape, to incorporate the cross-granularity features with coarse-centered and fine-centered subgraph learning and learn the intrinsic characteristics of transportation modes with auto-correlation efficiently. Then we design a personalized memory to store distinct parameters for diverse interests of individual groups and read the memory for predictor’s input features according to the previous learnt features. At last, we employ the feature reuse strategy based on meta learning to iteratively make adaptions from the source to the target. Extensive experimental results on real-world dataset demonstrate that our proposed method significantly outperforms the state-of-arts for the sparse modes.},

  abstract     = {Distributed Acoustic Sensing (DAS) instrument connected to dark fibers that widely deployed near roads can collect quasi-static strain signals generated by vehicles over a large range. This approach addresses the high deployment and maintenance costs and limited coverage of traditional roadside sensing technologies, making DAS a highly promising vehicle detection technology for intelligent transportation systems. However, using existing communication cables rather than specially laid sensing cables as the DAS sensing medium, while offering ultra-low deployment and maintenance cost advantages, poses significant challenges for detecting lightweight, low-speed vehicles that are far from the fiber cable. The quasi-static strain generated by such vehicles are low and easily overwhelmed by environmental noise and DAS fading noise. In this paper, we analyze the causes of weak vehicle quasi-static signals and propose a Unet image segmentation network, trained to recognize these weak signals using a large window with a small step size for data input. In a typical campus test scenario containing numerous lightweight low-speed vehicles, we tested various vehicle quasi-static signals using Unet. The results demonstrated that our method has high recognition accuracy and excellent resistance to DAS fading noise.},

It leverages the forward invariance of control barrier functions to design a safety controller that refines the output of MPC to maintain continuous driving safety.

  abstract     = {Efficient and reliable motion planning is essential for robots in transportation systems. Learning-based motion planners, especially those leveraging graph neural networks (GNNs), have emerged as promising approaches to accelerate motion planning. However, current GNN-based planners suffer from inevitable performance bottlenecks due to their insufficient exploitation of environmental information and the intrinsic connections within graph structures. In contrast, the human brain exhibits innate strengths in decision-making and reasoning, enabling complex inferences from sparse observations and rapid integration of new information to control behavior. Neuroscience evidence reveals the human brain translates decision-making problems into graph structures and sensory observations, leveraging spatial relational memory for sensory inference. To address these issues, this paper proposes a brain-inspired GNN-based motion planner, BrainyMP, which innovatively draws on the brain’s spatial relational memory mechanisms. Specifically, a selective sampling strategy is proposed to reduce unnecessary exploration during the construction of the random geometric graph (RGG). Additionally, a Brainy Edge Selector is designed to filter inappropriate edges, enhancing planning quality. Furthermore, the Memory-aware Predictor is proposed to improve graph pattern learning capabilities and planning efficiency by integrating subgraph structures. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly improves planning quality and efficiency in maze and robotic-arm manipulation tasks while maintaining high success rates. These results indicate that emulating human brain mechanisms holds promise for improving robotic performance.},

  abstract     = {Spatialtemporal traffic data are collected by a wide array of data collection devices deployed in intelligent transportation systems, which play crucial roles in data-driven intelligent transportation systems. However, hardware malfunctions or software system errors can lead to the inability to collect accurate data. Incomplete data in intelligent transportation systems can cause difficulties for subsequent applications, such as traffic flow anomaly detection and forecasting. Recently, low-rank tensor-based methods that characterize the global correlation of high-dimensional data have achieved superior performance. However, the majority of tensor-based approaches primarily account for the global correlation within the target traffic data, which is not sufficient to recover some challenging missing scenarios, such as fiber missing and slice missing that often occur in real situations. In this manuscript, we suggest a flexible method to explore the global correlation, local smoothness, and nonlocal self-similar redundancy in traffic data to improve recovery accuracy. Specifically, we utilize the multidimensional tensor nuclear norm to characterize the correlation structure, the multidimensional total variation to maintain smoothness detail, and the plug-and-play term to promote nonlocal self-similarity. The primary merits of this model lie in the fact that these priors characterize data features from different perspectives and complement each other. We develop an alternating direction method of multipliers to achieve efficient optimization for each variable. The proposed method is comprehensively evaluated through experiments across seven missing scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the suggested method with the aid of different priors outperforms many state-of-the-art approaches, especially structured missing scenarios.},

Second, to handle the unknown tire cornering stiffness in system matrices and control coefficients, an adaptive fixed-time path tracking control strategy with high-gain observer-based output feedback is developed. Different from the existing methods, the lower bounds of unknown control coefficients are incorporated into the Lyapunov function to effectively eliminate the requirement of tire cornering stiffness and their bounds information. Moreover, the full state constraints, formulated based on the vehicle stability margins, are taken into account to enhance the dynamic stability of the vehicle. Based on the barrier Lyapunov stability theory, it is proven that the designed adaptive backstepping controller guarantees the fixed-time stability of the closed-loop system, and that all vehicle states remain within the constraints of stability region. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme is demonstrated through simulation and comparison results.},

The impact of these factors is a huge challenge, especially for vision-based instance segmentation networks. To this end, this paper proposes an enhanced version of the RTMDet to promote the overall performance of instance segmentation in complex traffic scenarios. Firstly, an extended CSP-style backbone with large kernel convolutions of different kernel sizes is used to enhance the robustness of feature extraction capability, which contributes to obtaining more information about traffic objects of different scales. Secondly, a plugin pre-fusion module is designed to enhance the network’s robustness to multi-scale changes caused by distance changes. Additionally, instance kernel distinguish module is proposed to further highlight and distinguish different instance objects under poor lighting or weather and occlusion situations. Finally, the existing advanced image generation technology is used to expand the BDD100k dataset, enriching the dataset with severe scenarios. With an input resolution of $\mathbf {1280}\times \mathbf {720}$ on the expanded BDD100K dataset, the proposed RTMDet-R achieves an accuracy of 25.4% mAP on the instance mask and 27.8% mAP on the instance box. This surpasses other similar models in terms of accuracy. Additionally, it maintains a good inference speed of 23.1 FPS, achieving the trade-off between accuracy and speed.

To achieve this, an analytical solution is derived for the average achievable rate from the lead vehicle to follower vehicles over Rician fading channels. Leveraging this analytical solution, the Gauss-Chebyshev integration is employed to obtain the approximate solution. Then, we formulate a problem of maximizing the sum of secure rates by optimizing the trajectory and spectrum allocation. The formulated problem is constrained by the security requirement and imperfect channel state information. Addressing the NP-hard nature of this problem, an iterative optimization algorithm is developed, incorporating Q-learning and the graph theory to alternately adjust the trajectory and spectrum allocation. Finally, the simulation results show that the approximate solution matches well with the analytical solution, and the gap is less than 6%.

However, its performance in railway scenes is hindered by various challenges, including severe weather conditions, low-light situations, tunnel settings, and diverse and dynamic unstructured scenes. To address these challenges, this study proposes WaveCRNet, a novel architecture for real-time semantic segmentation in challenging conditions, simulating wavelet-constrained PID controller in feature and wavelet space. This study first designs an effective wavelet information enhancement algorithm using a differentiable wavelet transform to bridge the gap between the wavelet and feature information domains. Then, the wavelet-guided attention pag module (WAPM) is introduced to guide the learning and fusion of detailed features based on wavelet priors. Moreover, the traditional wavelet transforms are spectral aliasing and shift sensitivity. Inspired by dual-tree complex wavelet transform (DTCWT), the DTCWT-based channel reconstruction module (DCRM) is designed to assist the channel-based learning of boundary information from coarse to fine.

  abstract     = {This paper addresses the issue of cooperative control for heterogeneous marine vehicle systems (HMVSs) subjected to uncertain dynamics, multiple unfavorable communication factors, and velocity constraints. A state predictor is constructed to compensate for the missing information caused by communication delays, packet loss, replay attacks, and denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, thereby improving the convergence speed of the system. To address the impact of uncertain dynamics and deception signals on motion control and the resulting prediction errors, neural networks with identification capability are developed. Subsequently, a distributed cooperative controller comprising two parts is proposed for HMVSs, based on the prediction results and neural network outputs. The unknown compensation and cooperative control problems are then transformed into respective error stability problems, for which several sufficient conditions are derived to ensure finite-time boundedness of the errors. Finally, several numerical simulations are presented to validate the performance of the entire control architecture.},

By leveraging the underutilized computational resources of parked and moving vehicles commonly found in urban areas, a VEC system can enhance the performance of surrounding user devices and alleviate the loads on its edge servers. In this study, a resource orchestration scheme is introduced for a multi-device, multi-vehicle, and multi-edge scenario. Tasks from a device can be offloaded to its associated edge server, a neighboring edge server, a parked vehicle, or a moving vehicle. Our goal is to achieve the total task processing cost (comprising task processing latency and energy consumption) minimization across all devices through making strategies for task offloading and computational and communication resource allocation. We decompose the optimization problem and propose a Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3)-based Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithm. Furthermore, to accelerate the convergence speed of the algorithm, we optimize the uplink transmit power allocation sub-problem separately by designing a numerical algorithm. We analyze the complexity of the algorithm and assess its convergence. Through extensive simulations across 5 different scenarios, our proposed scheme outperforms 4 reference schemes, showcasing reductions in total task processing costs ranging from 15.13% to 38.59%.},

  abstract     = {As global economies continue to expand, maritime trade is projected to double by the year 2050. In this context, the development of a new generation of maritime intelligent supervision systems, which rely on precise information perception and machine learning-based technologies, is crucial for ensuring the safety of maritime navigation. Traditional methods for detecting abnormal ship behavior often suffer from inadequate feature extraction capabilities, leading to ineffective and inaccurate anomaly detection. To address this issue, this paper introduces a Transformer-GSA encoder detection model. This model enhances ship information data through BCE-GAN, extracts multi-layer convolutional features, and utilizes the Transformer-GSA module to capture the dependencies between trajectory features and time-series data, thereby effectively identifying abnormal ship behaviors. An evaluation conducted using AIS data from the Yantai-Qingdao route in January 2021 demonstrates that the model achieves an accuracy of 96.26%, with a reduced parameter count of 12.11M. These results confirm the model’s efficacy and superiority in detecting abnormal ship trajectories, contributing to the reduction of maritime accidents and illegal activities, alleviating the management burden on duty personnel, and enhancing the quality of intelligent ship traffic services and port operation efficiency under the maritime Internet of Things architecture.},

  abstract     = {RGB-Thermal semantic segmentation provides reliable support for intelligent traffic perception systems, such as road safety monitoring and autonomous driving perception, by fusing visible and thermal imaging modalities under adverse weather conditions and low-light environments at night. However, the scarcity of multimodal data and the high cost of annotations severely limit the generalization capability of traditional models. To address the core demands of urban scene segmentation, we propose a Hierarchical Matching Guided Feature Enhancement Network (HMFENet) tailored for few-shot learning. It tackles two major challenges: 1) scale diversity of traffic objects (e.g., vehicles and pedestrians) under limited labeled data, which significantly degrades segmentation accuracy; 2) information redundancy across multimodal features, which undermines the enhancement effect of the thermal modality on traffic object segmentation. HMFENet employs a hierarchical dense matching mechanism to establish multi-scale and multi-level feature alignment between query images and support samples. Additionally, it incorporates a mutual information minimization constraint to optimize cross-modal complementarity, thereby enhancing segmentation robustness in complex urban scenes. Experiments on the urban scene dataset, Tokyo Multi-Spectral- $4^{i}$ demonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art results: an improvement of 5.9% and 9.4% in mean mIoU for critical traffic objects under 1-shot and 5-shot settings, respectively, compared to baseline models. Furthermore, the complementary effect of the thermal modality contributes to a 2.5% improvement under the 1-shot setting. The proposed method provides a feasible solution for deploying multimodal traffic perception systems with low annotation costs. The source code is available at https://github.com/Zhou-xy99/HMFENet.},

This novel framework integrates bidirectional attention mechanisms to capture upstream and downstream dependencies, temporal convolutional networks for multiscale feature extraction, and graph attention networks for spatial information aggregation. BTC-GATs incorporates adaptive temporal modeling to capture nonlinear traffic dynamics, gradient-based variation analysis to quantify node influence, and a ranking mechanism that fuses attention coefficients with topological attributes to further enhance robustness and interoperability. In addition, a key node coverage study is conducted to examine the trade-off between accuracy and deployment efficiency. Extensive experiments on the California Highway PeMS04 dataset demonstrate that BTC-GATs outperforms benchmark methods in key node identification, offering superior accuracy and stability. Further analysis confirms its robustness under varying traffic conditions and initialization settings, highlighting its potential as a scalable, adaptive, and cost-effective solution for intelligent traffic monitoring. By facilitating efficient sensor placement, BTC-GATs contributes to improved data collection and congestion management in large-scale transportation networks.},

  abstract     = {In urban transportation systems, missing data and noise contamination are almost inevitable. To address the challenge of imputing traffic data corrupted by noise and outliers in real-world scenarios, this paper proposes a novel algorithm based on spatiotemporal tensor completion. The proposed method transforms observed data into three-dimensional spatiotemporal tensors and utilizes tensor ring decomposition for data completion. Furthermore, spatial and temporal information is incorporated into the model by utilizing the graph Laplacian matrix. To handle outliers, they are treated as unknown parameters, and the $\ell _{0}$ -norm is introduced to ensure their sparsity, thereby achieving the Spatio-Temporal Tensor Completion model with $\ell _{0}$ -norm term (STTC- $\ell _{0}$ ). The solution to the model is derived using the alternating optimization framework with the alternating direction method of multipliers. Then, we discuss the convergence of the solution method. To further enhance the efficiency of our proposed method, we combine the unrolling algorithm with our iterative optimization model, creating a lightweight and efficient neural network tailored for tensor completion, called STTC- $\ell _{0}$ -NN. Extensive experiments conducted on real datasets demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method over several state-of-the-art methods across various experimental scenarios. It is worth noting that STTC- $\ell _{0}$ -NN reduces computational time by one to two orders of magnitude compared to existing methods while maintaining or even improving imputation accuracy.

  abstract     = {The escalating challenges in urban traffic highlight the importance of accurate traffic forecasting for enhancing the Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), given its pivotal role in optimizing traffic management strategies. Due to the impressive performance of Graph Neural Networks in spatio-temporal data analysis, Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Networks (STGNNs) have emerged as a mainstream approach for traffic forecasting. However, many recent STGNN-based works often utilize redundant and intricate architectures, leading to increased computational costs with only minor improvements in performance. To solve this issue, we propose a concise but effective Lightweight Spatio-Temporal Neural Network architecture, LSTNN. Specifically, we design two sampling strategies, downsampling and patched sampling, to decompose the time series and separately fit the seasonal component and trend components. Based on sampling strategies, we introduce a spatio-temporal localization module based on the raw traffic data and learnable spatio-temporal indexing. In particular, this module models spatio-temporal correlations by appending the spatio-temporal indexing to the traffic sequences. We visualized the spatio-temporal indexing, confirming the effectiveness of the spatio-temporal localization module design. Extensive experiments are conducted on four widely utilized real-world traffic datasets, showing the significant improvement of LSTNN compared to baselines, including several state-of-the-art models. Furthermore, we conducted extensive experiments on four long-term time series datasets to validate the effectiveness of LSTNN in the Long-term Time Series Forecasting (LTSF) task. Our findings may inspire and encourage the design of more concise neural prediction architectures for real-world applications.

Accurate prediction of the state of power capacity (SOP) in lithium-ion batteries is fundamental for guaranteeing the safe, reliable, and efficient operation of these systems. However, most existing SOP prediction algorithms only account for the external measurable state constraints of the battery, ignoring the influence of the internal electrochemical states. Using electrochemical models to model batteries can introduce the electrochemical perspective, but many related methods ignore the impact of temperature variations on model parameters. Therefore, this paper proposes an SOP estimation framework based on a physics-informed data-driven approach, which fully integrates the electrochemical model and battery operation data to provide accurate power capacity estimation against temperature effects. First, the battery is modeled using an electrochemical model, and the battery operation data is used to identify the electrochemical temperature-sensitive parameters to enhance the accuracy of the model. Secondly, safety constraints for battery operations are introduced from the perspective of the battery mechanisms and the bisection method is employed to search for the maximum current. Compared with the SOP calibration results and the state-of-the-art method, the results highlight the accuracy of the proposed method. Finally, by referring to the characteristic maps-based method and employing Gaussian process regression, the search interval of SOP is significantly reduced based on historical data, reducing the search time by 80%.},

  abstract     = {As one of the automotive sensors that have emerged in recent years, 4D millimeter-wave radar has a higher resolution than conventional 3D radar and provides precise elevation measurements. But its point clouds are still sparse and noisy, making it challenging to meet the requirements of autonomous driving. Camera, as another commonly used sensor, can capture rich semantic information. As a result, the fusion of 4D radar and camera can provide an affordable and robust perception solution for autonomous driving systems. However, previous radar-camera fusion methods have not yet been thoroughly investigated, resulting in a large performance gap compared to LiDAR-based methods. Specifically, they ignore the feature-blurring problem and do not deeply interact with image semantic information. To this end, we present a simple but effective multi-stage sampling fusion (MSSF) network based on 4D radar and camera. On the one hand, we design a fusion block that can deeply interact point cloud features with image features, and can be applied to commonly used single-modal backbones in a plug-and-play manner. The fusion block encompasses two types, namely, simple feature fusion (SFF) and multi-scale deformable feature fusion (MSDFF). The SFF is easy to implement, while the MSDFF has stronger fusion abilities. On the other hand, we propose a semantic-guided head to perform foreground-background segmentation on voxels with voxel feature re-weighting, further alleviating the problem of feature blurring. Extensive experiments on the View-of-Delft (VoD) and TJ4DRadset datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our MSSF. Notably, compared to state-of-the-art methods, MSSF achieves a 7.0% and 4.0% improvement in 3D mean average precision on the VoD and TJ4DRadSet datasets, respectively. It even surpasses classical LiDAR-based methods on the VoD dataset.},

  abstract     = {Multi-objective multi-point shortest path planning problems are commonly encountered in real-world applications. Numerous path planning algorithms have been proposed to accommodate different model assumptions. However, most existing algorithms can only identify a subset of the Pareto optimal paths and overlook equivalent Pareto optimal paths. Relying solely on a subset of Pareto optimal solutions is insufficient to effectively respond to unforeseeable road eventualities in the real-world traffic environment. In this paper, multi-objective multi-point shortest path planning problem is modeled as a multimodal multi-objective optimization problem with necessary points constrains. A multimodal multi-objective evolutionary algorithm using constraint dominance principle-based path comparison strategy and path similarity-based multimodal solutions selection strategy is proposed to address this problem. The proposed constraint dominance principle-based path comparison strategy can effectively navigate through large infeasible regions by relaxing necessary point constraints, thereby obtaining a true constrained Pareto front. The proposed path similarity-based multimodal solutions selection strategy can effectively balance the distribution of solutions in the decision space, thereby preserving multiple equivalent optimal solutions. The proposed algorithm is compared with five state-of-the-art path planning algorithms from the benchmark test suite derived from the 2021 IEEE CEC path planning competition, where city maps are adapted from real transportation networks in Chinese cities, in our experiments. The exceptional performance is demonstrated through thirty independent runs, yielding experimental results that showcase the superiority of the proposed algorithm on the test problem set. This superior performance highlights the potential for designing more resilient path planners suitable for scenarios affected by unpredictable road eventualities.},

The problem of cooperative interception is formulated as a leader-follower optimal tracking control problem based on the differential graphical game subject to a nonautonomous leading vehicle with bounded control inputs. Utilizing the backstepping method, the guidance law is divided into a feedforward part for generating the desired state signals and compensates for the impact of input saturation, and a data-driven feedback part based on the differential graphical game that regulates tracking errors due to unknown target maneuvers while optimizing interactive performance indices. The uniform ultimate bounded property of the tracking errors in the closed-loop system can be guaranteed and the predefined interactive cost function can be optimized by the proposed guidance law. Simulation examples of cooperative interception are provided to validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

We address uncertainty from sensor noise and unknown preceding train behaviors, establishing a probabilistic decision-making model using a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP). Collision and risk envelopes are defined using the emergency and full-service braking distance of the following train, considering the “worst-case separation” scenarios, leading to a novel chance-constrained POMDP (CC-POMDP) for the virtually coupled trains. We propose an online planning algorithm, Partially Observable Monte Carlo Planning based on Double Shielding and Progressive Widening (POMCP-DS-PW).

In contrast, battery swapping stations have gained attention due to their efficiency and small footprint. However, there is a lack of extensive discussion on their layout, operation modes, and scheduling algorithms. This paper discusses the layout-dispatching-scheduling model of battery swapping stations and super battery swapping stations under centralized charging and unified dispatch. Considering battery swapping stations service time and electric vehicles queuing, a queuing-aware location-routing problem is proposed and solved using Gurobi. This study tackles the uncertainty in electric vehicle spatio-temporal dispatch by formulating the battery scheduling process between super battery swapping stations and battery swapping stations as a vehicle routing problem with time windows and uncertain demand. To address this challenge, the study proposes an adaptive routing optimization method based on an improved proximal policy optimization algorithm. Additionally, it investigates a flexible charging strategy for super battery swapping stations, where the battery charging and discharging process is modeled as a Markov decision process. To optimize operational revenue, meet demand, enable grid interactions, and contribute to peak shaving, the study employs a deep reinforcement learning approach that utilizes the twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm. The system design is proven to be feasible and capable of meeting operational requirements.},

A Chi-squared residual-based ARAIM significantly differing from the traditional solution separation (SS) based ARAIM in principle is proposed for air transportation in this work. The proposed ARAIM expresses the integrity risk of each hypothesis as the product of the cumulative distribution functions of two Chi-squared distributions and the hypothesis occurrence probability. Based on the equivalence between the normalized solution separation and the residual Chi-square separation, an upper bound in terms of the worst Chi-squared distribution noncentrality parameter induced by GNSS faults is established for the integrity risk of each hypothesis. The log-concavity of the cumulative distribution function of Chi-squared distribution ensures that the protection level computation of the proposed ARAIM is theoretically convergent and conservative. A comparative analysis of the proposed ARAIM and SS-based ARAIM in civil aviation scenarios indicates that the proposed ARAIM can offer a competitive protection level.},

  abstract     = {Mobile Phone Signaling (MPS) data record the daily traces of urban residents, offering a cost-effective means to obtain travel information for urban traffic management and planning at low cost. However, despite the vast amount of data available, there remains a lag in the development of techniques for identifying fine-grained information such as travel modes. On the one hand, the high positioning error and irregular collection frequency make the identification of fine-grained modes challenging. On the other hand, the difficulties in collecting real labeled data limit the training and evaluation of advanced models. In this paper, we present an advanced Travel Mode Identification (TMI) framework and collect real labeled MPS data for evaluation. Specifically, a fast smoothing method is proposed to enhance noise reduction in large-scale trajectories while effectively mitigating positioning errors. We propose novel point-level bus route alignment features for advanced deep-learning models to improve differentiation between motorized modes. Furthermore, a deep learning model with ensembled feature encoding modules is designed to overcome training instability due to limited data amount. Our proposed framework achieves an accuracy of 83.06% in identifying fine-grained travel modes, including walking, riding, bus, car, and metro, with recall rates exceeding 78% for all modes except walking. We analyze the relationship between accuracy and the spatiotemporal characteristics of trajectories, revealing a significant impact from the collection frequency, while showing insensitivity to distance gaps and positioning errors. This study demonstrates the potential of MPS for TMI and promotes its application in intelligent transportation systems.},

Thus, the indirect-effect-incorporated linguistic Z-number Petri nets (ILZPNs) are proposed in this paper.

The concepts of indirect effects and its aggression operators are designed to enhance the knowledge reasoning capability of ILZPN. Besides, the formal definition and the corresponding simulation algorithm of ILZPN are presented to conduct knowledge representation and reasoning. Subsequently, an empirical case, i.e., generalized eco-driving behavior evaluation, is applied to verify the proposed approach.

  abstract     = {Vehicular edge computing (VEC) is an efficient solution to alleviate the limitations of local computing resources in vehicular networks. However, the high mobility of vehicles and the dynamic variability of network topologies make it significantly challengeable. In this work, we make a fusion of model-driven and data-driven intelligence to design a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (DRL) solution for task offloading in urban VEC networks. First, computational models for task queue, transmission, computation, energy consumption, and expense are meticulously developed for the VEC network that integrates communication and computation. Vehicular tasks vary in type, urgency, size, and timeframe, leading to different latency requirements. Tasks may be executed locally within the vehicle, at a server after V2I offloading via cellular communications, or in a neighboring vehicle after V2V offloading via millimeter-wave (mmWave) communications. Each of these options incurs different levels of latency, energy consumption, and expense. Second, based on these models and the utility function that combines latency, energy consumption, and expense, an optimization problem for task offloading is formulated. This problem can be interpreted as a Markov decision process with a carefully designed reward function. Third, to address the offloading problem, we propose a multi-agent proximal policy optimization-based task and target selection algorithm (MAPPO-TTSA). This algorithm also utilizes convolutional neural networks to extract features from large-scale states, thereby enhancing their correlation. Fourth, comprehensive training is performed on the observational data to determine the optimal parameters for predicting task offloading. Finally, extensive experiments are conducted, and simulation results are provided to demonstrate that the proposed intelligent task offloading scheme offers significant advantages in terms of average task completion delay and utility level across various scenarios.},

This study introduces an integrated sensing, communication, and computation (ISCC)-based task offloading and resource allocation (ITORA) framework, which optimizes cooperative perception by determining what data to share, which vehicles to involve, and how to process the data effectively. We develop an information value function to evaluate the data quality for each vehicle. Subsequently, we design strategies for sensing task allocation, task offloading, and resource allocation to enable value-driven data selection at a subregion level, facilitating collaborative computing among edge servers and vehicles. Additionally, we formulate an optimization problem aimed at maximizing information value while minimizing delay and energy consumption, subject to constraints on a full region of interest (RoI) coverage, delay, wireless bandwidth, and computational resources. We decompose the mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem into two subproblems, devising a sensing task allocation algorithm and a proximal policy optimization (PPO)-based task offloading and resource allocation (PTORA) algorithm to address them. Comprehensive simulations validate the effectiveness of the proposed PTORA in optimizing information value, reducing task execution delay, and minimizing energy consumption.},

Then the follower vehicles only update their control inputs, prediction horizons and corresponding terminal sets when they receive new information from the leader, so as to reduce the computational burden. The proposed approach effectively compensates the information errors caused by the communication delays by utilizing the timestamp information. When the leader’s control plan changes during the delay period, the recursive feasibility of the local optimization problem and the uniform ultimate bound stability of the platoon system are guaranteed with the proposed controller.

A self-supervised task is proposed, which focuses on predicting past trajectory points using both true and noise-imputed trajectory encoded features. This approach highlights the important patterns or connections in the data that could go unnoticed if supervised tasks were the only one used. Further, in addition to the trajectory prediction task, a consistent loss function should be introduced to preserve spatial consistency with noise imputed trajectory points. Moreover, learnable query embeddings are added to the system to improve the diversity of multi-modal predictions. The SST model has been evaluated on the widely used and recent Argoverse 2 dataset and outperforms state-of-the-art models by a margin of 2.17%-24.15%, 5.38%-30.05%, 9.41%-46.89% and 0.20%-21.21% on the minADE6, minFDE6, MR6 and b-FDE6 respectively.},

  abstract     = {Despite the development of several vision-based methods over past decades, lane detection is still a challenging issue in computer vision community. Traditional research on lane detection is mainly based on inter-frame similarity. Conversely, our methodology challenges this assumption, allowing the algorithm to adapt in diverse dynamic driving scenarios. In this paper, we proposed an advanced lane detection and tracking method using robust thresholding and frame coherence. A novel two stage feature extraction methodology for lane detection is introduced. In the initial stage, adaptive thresholding is employed based on the local statistical and geometrical constraints of lane markings at the sub-image level. Subsequently, artifacts are addressed and removed using a vertical aggregation technique combined with the Hough transform at the regional level. In this lane detection framework, tracking is integrated to establish a dynamic area of interest for lane search in the subsequent frame. For robust tracking, Kalman filter parameters are adjusted based on measurement reliability. To adapt to the non-linear variations inherent in real-world driving scenarios, outcomes of inter-frame similarity analysis are compared with periodic full-frame detection and a moving average window estimator is employed within the verification protocol. The proposed method is evaluated using Caltech dataset and our dataset, which was recorded at Indian highway and urban roads. Experiment results shows that the proposed method is robust to varying illumination conditions, dense shadows, lane change scenarios, abrupt change in lane width, and occluded lanes with a whooping average detection rate of 98.37%.},

  abstract     = {Most autonomous driving (AD) datasets incur substantial costs for collection and labeling, inevitably yielding a plethora of low-quality and redundant data instances, thereby compromising performance and efficiency. Many applications in AD systems necessitate high-quality training datasets using both existing datasets and newly collected data. In this paper, we propose a traffic scene joint active learning (TSceneJAL) framework that can efficiently sample the balanced, diverse, and complex traffic scenes from both labeled and unlabeled data. The novelty of this framework is threefold: 1) a scene sampling scheme based on a category entropy, to identify scenes containing multiple object classes, thus mitigating class imbalance for the active learner; 2) a similarity sampling scheme, estimated through the directed graph representation and a marginalize kernel algorithm, to pick sparse and diverse scenes; 3) an uncertainty sampling scheme, predicted by a mixture density network, to select instances with the most unclear or complex regression outcomes for the learner. Finally, the integration of these three schemes in a joint selection strategy yields an optimal and valuable subdataset. Experiments on the KITTI, Lyft, nuScenes and SUScape datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods on 3D object detection tasks with up to 12% improvements.},

  abstract     = {The increasing need for pedestrian tracking within public and commercial domains necessitates innovative solutions that respect privacy concerns. Traditional surveillance methods employing RGB video footage for the monitoring of pedestrian movements have raised significant privacy issues, attributed to their capability to easily identify individuals. This paper shifts focus towards the utilization of 3D point cloud data as a less intrusive alternative for pedestrian monitoring, which inherently minimizes the risk of individual identification. Notwithstanding, traditional tracking methodologies frequently encounter difficulties in environments characterized by high pedestrian density, where occlusions caused by individuals obscuring one another from the sensors’ perspective are commonplace. This research introduces an advanced approach leveraging 3D point cloud data to address the challenges inherent in pedestrian tracking. A particular obstacle addressed is the frequent obstruction caused by pedestrians, who may be accompanied by objects such as baby strollers and/or luggage, thus complicating their detection and tracking when positioned behind others or in close proximity to the sensors. Such scenarios significantly undermine the efficacy of pedestrian segmentation and tracking, particularly in the context of Kalman-Filter-based methodologies. To mitigate these challenges, the proposed solution incorporates a method to spatially enhance the missing segments within the framework of Kalman-Filter-based multi-object tracking. The effectiveness of this approach has been rigorously assessed through the application of 3D point cloud data derived from diverse real-world settings, including laboratory environments, shopping mall entrances, and a densely populated urban area in Kita-ku, Osaka City, during a festival event.},

  abstract     = {In the evolving landscape of mixed traffic environments, the interaction between Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) and Human-driven Vehicles (HVs) introduces complex dynamics that challenge traditional traffic control paradigms. The Mixed Platoon Hierarchical Control (MPHC) model innovatively addresses these dynamics by integrating advanced control strategies that optimize the coexistence of CAVs and HVs. Specifically, the model introduces two novel approaches: the Incorporate Real-time Changes in Dynamic Headway (IRC_DH), which dynamically adjusts CAV headways by utilizing real-time traffic data and road conditions, enhancing platoon efficiency and reducing headway by up to 24.35%; and the Incorporate Controls to Improve Response Speed (IC_IRS) for HVs, a multi-variable control strategy that considers vehicle states, reducing speed differentials by as much as 53.125%, thereby stabilizing platoon dynamics and significantly lowering collision risks. These strategies distinguish themselves from existing approaches by providing a more precise, adaptable, and robust solution to the dynamic challenges of mixed traffic flow, addressing both efficiency and safety. Simulation results confirm that these strategies significantly improve traffic flow efficiency and safety, providing a scalable and adaptable framework for traffic management in mixed vehicular environments. This work makes a substantial contribution to the field by emphasizing a comprehensive, real-time, and multi-dimensional approach to managing mixed traffic environments, thereby advancing the state-of-the-art in CAV-HV integration.},

  abstract     = {Visual perception, as a core component of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), plays a key role in enhancing safety and efficiency in urban mobility. While single-task visual perception methods have applications in areas like pedestrian detection and traffic sign recognition, the complexity of real-world scenarios necessitates a shift toward multi-task approaches. This paper introduces the Edge-assisted Multi-task Visual Perception (EMVP) system, which is specifically designed to address the computational intensity and dynamic concurrency challenges inherent to multi-task processing in edge environments. EMVP adopts a collaborative architecture that strategically partitions computational tasks between vehicles and Road-Side Units (RSUs). By integrating Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs), the system achieves a lightweight yet efficient multi-task model for resource-constrained environments. To adapt to the dynamic and concurrent nature of multi-vehicle scenarios, EMVP incorporates a content-aware adaptive inference mechanism based on reinforcement learning, enabling dynamic task scheduling to improve Quality of Service (QoS). Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to the single-task baseline model, the multi-task model of EMVP reduces the computational cost by 86.59% on average while achieving a 4.32% improvement in accuracy. Additionally, in dynamic multi-access environments, EMVP’s adaptive scheduling mechanism, which leverages spatiotemporal content awareness, achieves an average QoS improvement of 7.36% over the sub-optimal method.},

  abstract     = {In the rapidly evolving landscape of mobility modelling, the application of deep learning approaches introduces both opportunities and challenges. Such approaches, while powerful, yield opaque models that lack interpretability and adaptability to diverse traffic contexts. Addressing those challenges, a finite set of humanly-interpretable traffic states is exploited here for the purpose of facilitating the annotation of mobility data with meaningful labels such as congestion, free-flow, traffic build-up, etc. Such annotation unlocks a range of opportunities to integrate multiple complementary approaches for modelling state transition behaviour. Concretely, a novel hybrid modelling framework is introduced in this article leveraging multiple data representations (temporal, time-frequency and symbolic) with the aim to forecast traffic progression in terms of humanly-explicable state transitions. Three distinct modelling paradigms are subsequently explored: neural, neural-to-symbolic, and symbolic-to-neural, by demonstrating their potential to capture and forecast traffic dynamics on real-world mobility data. While the fully neural approach is undoubtedly the most accurate one, the two neuro-symbolic approaches offer a better trade-off between accuracy on one side and interpretability, probability calibration, and computational efficiency, on the other. This work illustrates the importance of tailored data representations in understanding and predicting complex mobility behaviour, highlighting the benefits of hybrid approaches in achieving interpretability and efficiency in traffic data analysis.},

  abstract     = {The estimation of bus passenger origin-destination (OD) flow is crucial for bus operation and management. Although many existing studies have made efforts to reconstruct OD flow from passenger counts at each station, few of them tracked individual passengers because it is still infeasible in practice to monitor all onboard passengers throughout their entire journeys. This study proposes a passenger reidentification method for estimating route-level bus passenger OD flow using video images at bus doors. All boarding and alighting passengers are identified and their appearance features are extracted from video images. Boarding passengers at upstream stations and alighting passengers at downstream stations are matched considering not only the similarities of their appearance features but also historical alighting probabilities. Reliable passenger matches are filtered out by a matching probability threshold. The corresponding accurate OD samples, together with the boarding and alighting counts at each station, are utilized to estimate OD flow between bus stations. A comprehensive case study was carried out on an operational bus route in Shanghai, China during morning and evening peak hours over 15 weekdays. Results of the case study showed that the proposed method is capable of generating accurate OD estimates, with cosine similarities remaining above 0.9, root mean square errors within 0.5 person, and mean absolute percentage errors of approximately 12%. The error metrics were decreased by nearly half compared to the traditional method that only uses the boarding and alighting counts.},

To describe this phenomenon, a shape-dependent Gaussian mixture measurement model is presented, with each mixture component being used to describe a sub-rectangle region by introducing a shape scaling factor. The shape scaling factor is also shape-dependent and can characterize the measurement spread across the corresponding edge. In this model, parameters and mixture structure are highly shape-dependent, and the rectangular shape prior information is also incorporated. Based on the proposed model, a variational Bayesian approach is derived, which recursively and efficiently estimates the kinematic, shape, shape scaling factors, and orientation states of a vehicle. Additionally, the Doppler velocity measurement can also be integrated into the variational Bayesian framework by introducing a latent variable. This approach can effectively and adaptively describe the complex measurement distribution. From the simulation and real experimental results, the proposed approach has a great improvement in the tracking performance, and the superior performance of the proposed model is more significant in estimating the centroid position compared with the state-of-the-art approaches.},

  abstract     = {Detecting vulnerable road users (VRUs) at night presents significant challenges. Numerous methods rely heavily on annotations, yet the low visibility of nighttime images poses difficulties for labeling. To obviate the need for nighttime annotations, unsupervised domain adaptation manifests as a viable solution. However, existing approaches primarily focus on semantic-level domain gaps, often overlooking pixel-level discrepancies caused by inherent degradations in the nighttime domain. These degradations can impair machine vision and limit detection performance. In this paper, we propose TripleA, an unsupervised domain adaptation framework tailored for nighttime VRU detection. TripleA includes triple alignment. First, it aligns daytime and nighttime images to generate synthetic nighttime images, which are then enhanced for illumination and noise. To remove noise, we introduce an illumination difference-aware denoising network, incorporating a novel pseudo-supervised attention to achieve pixel-wise noise distribution alignment. This alignment is driven by pseudo-ground truth generated through a carefully designed exchange-recombination strategy, facilitating self-supervised training of the denoising network. Additionally, we introduce degradation alignment to ensure domain-invariant degradation encoding, which enhances the network’s robustness for real-world nighttime images. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework for nighttime VRU detection, all without the need for annotated nighttime data.},

Additionally, the low penetration rate of probe vehicle trajectories poses another challenge. This study proposes a probe-vehicle-trajectory-based algorithm for IIC detection on urban roads at the movement and cycle levels. Two critical features (i.e., the average speed and the entrance time into the road segment) are defined to capture the characteristics of trajectory segments. A Vehicle Trajectory Polar Coordinate Transformation (VTPCT) method is proposed to differentiate anomalous trajectory segments (ATS) affected by IIC from normal ones, considering the periodicity of fixed signal timing at the intersections. Anomaly rates calculated from the identified ATS within a spatiotemporal window are introduced to reflect the movement-cycle-level traffic states. A two-stage algorithm framework is designed to enhance the algorithm’s adaptability to spatially sparse trajectories and diverse road networks. Experimental studies show that the proposed algorithm is applicable to trajectory data with low penetration rates and outperforms benchmarks of typical statistical and AI-based algorithms.},

In specific, extensive motivating experiments on an open benchmark dataset are conducted, which reveal that the cooperative perception accuracy is a submodular combination of selected CAVs, and such selection is non-trivial due to high vehicular mobility as well as unstable vehicular network conditions. Then, we develop an Edge coordinated COoperative Perception (ECOP) framework, taking into account both cooperative vehicle selection and adaptive bandwidth allocation. The novelty of the ECOP design is threefold. First, a new metric named perceptual gain is designed, which properly quantifies the individual perception contributions of each CAV without incurring additional computational overhead. Secondly, an online vehicle selection strategy, which utilizes continual learning to assess the perceptual gain of each CAV, is devised. Theoretical analysis indicates that the proposed vehicle selection strategy can achieve asymptotically diminishing learning regret, highlighting its effectiveness in adapting to vehicular mobility. Finally, an optimal bandwidth allocation method is proposed, which can adapt to heterogeneous and unstable vehicular network conditions. Simulation results demonstrate that, compared with other benchmarks, ECOP can select vehicle sets with the highest cooperative perception accuracy and ensure real-time perception in the presence of fluctuating bandwidth. Furthermore, a case study is presented to visualize the effectiveness of the proposed ECOP framework.},

  abstract     = {Accurately predicting the trajectories of surrounding agents is critically important for the safe operation of autonomous vehicles. However, complex environments not only increase the computational cost but also introduce multimodality in the agent’s future motions, presenting significant challenges for motion prediction. Therefore, we propose FSGA, a trajectory prediction framework that constructs a relationship graph between agents and lanes in future spacetime and utilizes a graph attention mechanism to analyze the interactions between these future spacetime agents and lanes. We employ a vectorized representation method to model the traffic scene as a graph. Through this vectorized scene representation, FSGA extracts spatio-temporal features from agents’ historical trajectories, including interactions between agents, and between agents and lanes. To reduce computational costs, a lane scoring mechanism is employed, allowing the model to focus only on the lanes that have a significant impact on the current agent’s motion. To address complexity and multimodality of future trajectories, we introduce a branching tree goal prediction structure that models multiple possible motion trends by representing waypoints and endpoints at different temporal stages. Based on these predicted goals, we construct a relationship graph that captures the associations between agents and lanes in future spacetime and obtains the interactions between agents and lanes, improving trajectory prediction accuracy. Experiments show that FSGA achieves state-of-the-art performance on Argoverse1.},

  abstract     = {Efficient traffic signal control (TSC) has been one of the most useful ways for reducing urban road congestion. By modeling each intersection as an autonomous agent, multiagent reinforcement learning (MARL) shows remarkable performance in solving dynamic TSC. However, most of TSC methods based on MARL suffer from a non-stationarity problem since agents update their policies simultaneously. To resolve this issue, this paper considers multi-intersection TSC as a multi-agent sequential decision-making process with policy online learning. We utilize a sequential model such as Transformer architecture to learn the multi-agent joint policy. By carefully designing the advantage function of each agent, the monotonic improvement property can be guaranteed. Moreover, to fully exploit the advantages of both simultaneous and sequential MARL, we further propose a novel MARL network selection algorithm (MARL-NS) which selectively employs simultaneous MARL only at states that sequential MARL might fall into local optimum. Our theory proves that MARL-NS preserves cooperative MARL converge properties. Finally, we validate the proposed MARL-NS method on a unified TSC benchmark, LibSignal. Experimental results show that our method can outperform the baseline methods in network-level and arterial coordination.},

This study introduces an Agent-Based Modeling (ABM) framework for traffic management, dynamically assigning eVTOLs to landing pads based on real-time data to enhance efficiency in congested urban environments. A comparative analysis is conducted across various scheduling and sequencing approaches, including Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP), Time-Advance (TA), heuristic methods, receding horizon scheduling, reinforcement learning (RL)-based frameworks, and decentralized agent-based strategies. While MILP and TA offer structured scheduling, they struggle with scalability. Heuristic and receding horizon methods improve adaptability but require frequent recomputation, and RL-based approaches show promise but demand extensive training. Current Decentralized models support distributed decision-making but face efficiency constraints at scale. The proposed ABM framework effectively manages 200 eVTOLs with near-linear computational scaling, facilitating real-time negotiations and reducing computational bottlenecks seen in centralized models. Simulation results indicate improved assignment efficiency, landing pad utilization, and reduced negotiation times under high-density conditions. As UAM systems expand, ABM may contribute to operational resilience. Future work will explore integrating environmental factors to further enhance robustness.},

Additionally, noise factors such as stains, scratches, and complex textures in the pavement background can easily be confused with cracks, increasing the risk of false prediction in the segmentation process. Therefore, we propose Background Morphology Learning (BML) to reconstruct morphological features of the pavement background noise, extract background morphological dissimilarity maps to suppress interference and reduce false alarms. In addition, we propose Crack Morphology-aware Attention (CMA), which adaptively learns the morphological shape of cracks and dynamically adjusts the shape of the attention receptive field to the topological features of the cracks. This significantly improves the completeness of segmentation. Our method mitigates the problems of false alarms and incomplete segmentation results in the crack segmentation task. Therefore, we propose a Morphology-Aware Transformer (MorFormer) that achieves state-of-the-art results on five public datasets. Moreover, we propose a large-scale cross-domain benchmark for crack segmentation, where MorFormer exhibits excellent domain generalization.},

An optimization problem is formulated to maximize symmetry across clusters, evaluating the effectiveness of clustering based on stop location using k-means. A novel deep reinforcement learning algorithm utilizing the Double Deep Q-Network framework is proposed to identify optimal clusters, demonstrating an 8% improvement in symmetry optimization over k-means. Notably, k-means clusters still achieve an average symmetry level of 62% when accounting for geographical proximity and walking distance limits. Through the proposed clusters, transit planners can better understand passenger flow dynamics and predict alighting counts with incomplete data.},

To address these challenges, we propose a novel person re-identification network, ReID-FSAI, which fuses personal belongings information and attribute descriptions from isolated semantic regions. ReID-FSAI integrates personal belongings areas identified through feature clustering with semantic parsing results from an auxiliary semantic model. By treating the generated semantic regions as body labels, our network refines global features into precise semantic features and accurately predicts attribute information from these regions. Furthermore, ReID-FSAI employs a reweighting model to enhance the confidence in specific attributes, improving attribute prediction accuracy. By combining predictions of attributes and personal belongings with global features, our approach significantly improves the representation ability of pedestrians. Experimental evaluations on the Market-1501 and DukeMTMC-reID datasets demonstrate that ReID-FSAI achieves superior performance in both person re-ID and attribute prediction, surpassing state-of-the-art methods.},

To alleviate these problems, we propose a unified scheduling model based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL) for both TTO and TTR problems with similar formulations. The key components of our approach include a state representation utilizing the Markov decision process that captures global train and station characteristics, and a policy network that extracts information from this representation to sequentially construct the train departure order. The main benefits of our framework include adaptability to different stopping plans and delay scenarios, decoupling from the problem size, and ensuring the feasibility of generated schemes. Furthermore, to improve the solution quality, we integrate the learned decision policies with a local search method, enabling the scalability of the model with little additional computation cost. Experiments on extensive TTO and TTR instances of the Beijing-Shanghai high-speed railway line demonstrate the effectiveness and practicality of our approach. Our DRL-based method outperforms all the heuristic rules and commercial solvers without retraining the model on various problem sizes, especially on large-scale cases under limited calculation time.},

Traditionally, solving Eikonal equations has relied on iterative numerical methods through the discretization of the continuum space. However, this discretization compromises the precision of numerical solutions and could lead to non-convergence issues during iterative processes. This study refers to Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) and develops the Distance-Informed Neural Eikonal Solver (NES-DI) for solving Reactive Dynamic User-Equilibrium models. While the previously proposed Neural Eikonal Solver (NES) performs badly in a strong heterogeneous cost field with large cost differences, NES-DI explicitly considers the influence of solid boundaries during the factorization process by incorporating accurate distance information. Numerical examples of RDUE at both the static and dynamic levels are presented to illustrate the performance and applications of the NES-DI framework. The results demonstrate that NES-DI greatly outperforms both NES and the fast sweeping method. Moreover, NES-DI overcomes the limitations of discretization, enabling predictions of solutions at arbitrary locations within the computational domain. At the dynamic level, transfer learning is employed to leverage historical solutions to solve RDUE problems more efficiently. Overall, NES-DI shows the potential of solving reactive dynamic problems with strong heterogeneity, which offers a promising alternative to discretization-reliant numerical methods.},

The development of objective measures to detect the intuitively perceived level of criticality across various scenarios remains unresolved. The major challenge lies in the evaluation of all sensitive metrics of all participants in a scenario, which goes beyond assessing individual criticality metrics or providing only non-operational definitions. To address these challenges, a modular and practice-oriented framework that assesses traffic criticality is proposed. Vehicular and environmental data can be used to objectively measure individual critical elements of traffic, which are then aggregated into a comprehensive scenario assessment. The framework is illustrated by applying it (i) to two maneuvers discussing effects of single criticality metrics and (ii) to two widely used datasets featuring highway and intersecting traffic for a statistical analysis. The assessment framework can be applied in many scenarios, ranging from identifying safety critical scenarios in existing data as a fundament for early development of ADSs to detecting safety critical emergency maneuvers in live data to trigger a deployed ADS. Fundamental to this process is the suitable selection of metrics, thresholds for critical behavior, and the system’s sensitivity in aggregating partially critical scenarios.},

  abstract     = {Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) are designed to prevent collisions, identify the condition of drivers while operating vehicles, and provide additional information to enhance drivers’ awareness of potential hazards on the road. Today, ADAS are capable of predicting drivers’ actions several seconds in advance, preparing for potential future hazards to prevent accidents or reduce injuries to occupants. Most previous works have achieved prediction results by analyzing and processing a vast amount of driving data from multiple drivers, based on the macro intention preferences of multiple drivers and external environmental features, collectively referred to as the generalized intention prediction network. This network utilizes extensive driving data to predict the common driving intentions of the overall driving population, without considering individualized driving styles. However, according to our research, different drivers exhibit distinct latent preferences in real-world driving scenarios. The generalized intention prediction network is influenced by these latent preferences, resulting in poor generalization capabilities and inaccurate predictions across different drivers. In this study, we propose a individualized driver intention prediction network. Based on Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL), it extracts individualized driving intention feature preferences that influence driving intentions from the driver’s historical behavior to improve generalized prediction results and achieve individualized driving intention prediction. We demonstrate that preferences vary among different drivers in the driving domain, leading to biases in model predictions. Upon experimental validation, the method we have proposed demonstrates remarkable efficacy on both the Brain4Cars and IESDD datasets, thereby showcasing its enhanced applicability in real-world scenarios.},

  abstract     = {Authenticated key agreement (AKA) between vehicles and road side units (RSUs) is crucial in vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANETs). However, existing solutions still suffer from high overheads of AKA and lack a mechanism to balance privacy strength and system efficiency. In this paper, we present a lightweight anonymous authenticated key agreement (LWAKA) scheme for VANETs, supporting lightweight anonymous authentication and key agreement between vehicles and RSUs simultaneously. In particular, vehicles’ authentication information is synchronized to target RSUs in advance for accelerating authentication, and lightweight cryptographic operations (i.e., hash function, hash-based message authentication, physical unclonable function, fuzzy extractor and symmetric encryption) are employed to ensure the high efficiency of AKA in terms of computation and communication overheads. The system efficiency and privacy are balanced through modeling the relationship between the frequency of pseudonym updates and the unlinkability of the vehicles’ new and old pseudonyms. Security analysis shows that LWAKA not only achieves anonymity, conditional privacy, pseudonym unlinkability, key escrow freeness, and physical security, but also resists against most known attacks. Comparative experimental results demonstrate that LWAKA outperforms existing schemes in terms of lightweight design.},

However, in the face of multi-sensor high-frequency monitoring signals under extreme operating conditions, limited by the ability of model data modeling, the existing methods, based on classification and reconstruction strategies, are difficult to further improve the anomaly localization precision. To address the challenges and overcome the limitations of existing methods, this paper proposes a Dual-control Inference Diffusion Model (DIDM), which reconstructs and inferences on specified sensor samples to achieve accurate anomaly detection. The reverse diffusion inference process is controlled by the channel condition and mask prior, combined with two loss functions for alternating training, which enables inference for samples from specified sensors at specific moments. We evaluate the model based on the static ignition test data of a certain type of LRE. The results show that DIDM outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in terms of detection accuracy, which demonstrates the effectiveness and superiority of DIDM. Furthermore, by combining the error distributions of the inference results, we can achieve a more accurate location of anomaly in the time and frequency domains, which could increase the efficiency of rocket launches and air and space transportation, and enhance the potential of the academic results for industrial applications.},

  abstract     = {In the domain of autonomous ship navigation, the construction of bird’s-eye view (BEV) layouts for waterways has obvious significance. A helmsman can generate the BEV layout of the waterway using his/her eyes only. To simulate this intelligence, a novel neural network-based algorithm named Waterway-BEV is proposed, which enables reconstructing a local map formed by the waterway layout and ship occupancies in the bird’s-eye view given a first person view monocular image only. Waterway-BEV employs an efficient SEResNeXt encoder to extract features from first person view (FPV) monocular images, capturing deep semantic information related to waterways and ships. Due to the variations in information across different perspectives, Waterway-BEV incorporates a Cross-View Transformation Module, which takes the constraint of cycle consistency between views into account and makes full use of their correlation to strengthen the view transformation and scene understanding. To fully leverage the feature output of the SEResNeXt encoder, Waterway-BEV employs a decoder based on a dedicated lightweight network. This decoder is responsible for decoding the enhanced bird’s-eye view (BEV) feature maps and generating the BEV layout. By employing the Focal Loss as the loss function for model optimization, Waterway-BEV takes into account the quantity and classification difficulty of ship samples during the training process, thereby improving the generation performance and convergence speed. The experiments demonstrated that Waterway-BEV achieved notable performance metrics, with mIOU and mAP rates reaching 97.8% and 98.2%, respectively, in waterway bird’s-eye view layout generation. Waterway-BEV outperformed other state-of-the-art (SOTA) algorithms in generating BEV layouts of waterways. In particular, during specialized scenarios such as crossroads of waterways and tasks involving small target ships, Waterway-BEV consistently generated satisfactory bird’s-eye view layouts, demonstrating robustness and applicability.},

  abstract     = {Situation awareness (SA) is a crucial factor affecting flight safety for pilots, yet few studies have focused specifically on modeling SA for pilots, resulting in limited success. In this paper, we propose a novel multimodal deep learning approach to monitor pilots’ SA. The approach combines handcrafted and deep features obtained from eye movement and flight control data collected from 27 novice pilots across different training phases using a flight simulator. Ground truth SA measurements were obtained using the Situation Awareness Global Assessment Technique (SAGAT). The handcrafted features included 13 eye movements and 22 flight control features, while deep features were extracted from time-series of gaze positions using a deep extractor based on Transformer. By fusing the handcrafted features of eye movement and flight control, along with one deep feature of eye movement, we predicted the final SA level. Through leave-one-flight-out cross-validation, our model achieved a higher accuracy of 92.04%. The results indicate that the multimodal model outperforms the unimodal models, with the eye movement modality demonstrating superiority over the flight control modality in predicting SA. This suggests our method provides an objective means of predicting pilot’s SA and offers new insights for SA assessment in aviation and other fields. Overall, our multimodal deep learning approach holds promise for enhancing pilot training and flight safety by facilitating a more comprehensive understanding of pilots’ SA during critical flight scenarios.},

Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) has recently shown significant potential in addressing complex traffic dynamics, but the intricacies of partial observability and coordination in decentralized environments still remain key challenges in formulating scalable and efficient control strategies. To address these challenges, we present CoordLight, a MARL-based framework designed to improve intra-neighborhood traffic by enhancing decision-making at individual junctions (agents), as well as coordination with neighboring agents, thereby scaling up to network-level traffic optimization. Specifically, we introduce the Queue Dynamic State Encoding (QDSE), a novel state representation based on vehicle queuing models, which strengthens the agents’ capability to analyze, predict, and respond to local traffic dynamics. We further propose an advanced MARL algorithm, named Neighbor-aware Policy Optimization (NAPO). It integrates an attention mechanism that discerns the state and action dependencies among adjacent agents, aiming to facilitate more coordinated decision-making, and to improve policy learning updates through robust advantage calculation. This enables agents to identify and prioritize crucial interactions with influential neighbors, thus enhancing the targeted coordination and collaboration among agents. Through comprehensive evaluations against state-of-the-art traffic signal control methods over three real-world traffic datasets composed of up to 196 intersections, we empirically show that CoordLight consistently exhibits superior performance across diverse traffic networks with varying traffic flows.},

Federal Learning (FL) has shown great promise in training large-scale ML models without exposing raw data. However, many vehicles are reluctant to participate in FL training due to high resource demands and the inherent mobility challenges of vehicular networks. To address this issue, this paper proposes an FL auction framework that incentivizes vehicle participation by maximizing the utility of the FL platform. Specifically, our approach factors in the basic utility, average reward and tolerance delay of dynamic vehicles to determine their bidding intent. Additionally, an online auction-based client selection algorithm is proposed that ensures individual rationality for vehicles, coupled with a reward function based on model accuracy to further encourage participation in FL training. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, showing a 38.9% improvement in platform utility and a 31.3% reduction in average payments compared to the Online Auction (OA) algorithm.},

To this end, we propose a novel self-supervised VO based on scene appearance-structure incremental fusion scheme. Specifically, a Global-Local Context awareness-based Depth estimation Network (GLC-DN) is designed to introduce the scene structural cues, thus laying the foundation for realizing the scene appearance-structure incremental fusion. Then, a Dual stream Pose estimation Network based on Scene Appearance-Structure Incremental Fusion (SASIF-DPN) is devised, which consists of a Dual Stream Network (DSN) and multiple Cross-Modal Complementary Fusion Modules (CM-CFMs). CM-CFM fully leverages the complementary properties between the RGB information and the predicted depth information, and the combination of multiple CM-CFMs facilitates the information interaction between the two modalities in an incremental fusion manner. Detailed evaluations of GLC-DN and SASIF-DPN provably confirm the effectiveness and design principles of each component we propose. Extensive comparison experiments have also been conducted, which clearly verify the superiority of our method compared to current counterparts.},

A novel observation modality, the “beam map”, is designed to accurately perceive obstacles in all directions, mimicking the functionality of an onboard LiDAR system. To further refine collision avoidance maneuver, a warning zone is introduced, adjusting the agent’s sensitivity to obstacles and allowing ample time and space for decision-making. Additionally, we propose a continuous-time short-distance constraint to calculate the International Regulations for Preventing Collision at Sea (COLREGs) adherence rewards, enabling legal and rational navigation without requiring prior knowledge of the encounter situation. Extensive experimental results, comparing various RL policies and classical methods, demonstrate the planner’s exceptional obstacle avoidance capability and adaptability to changing environments.

The lower bound on the time headway is dependent on the upper bound on the parasitic actuation lag ( $\tau _{0}$ ) and the communication delay ( $\ell $ ). The main result of the paper is that if $\tau _{0}$ exceeds $\ell $ , then the employable time headway is lower bounded by $\tau _{0}+\ell $ . Otherwise, it is better to use adaptive cruise control (ACC) where the employable time headway is lower bounded by $2\tau _{0}$ .

  abstract     = {Pedestrian historical trajectory completion significantly bolsters the predictive accuracy of models. However, traditional statistical models such as Hidden Markov Models (HMM), which focus solely on individual pedestrian trajectories, often fall short in terms of generalization. Conversely, data-driven deep learning approaches demand extensive and meticulous data annotation as well as large datasets. Additionally, leveraging sequential historical data and uncovering the correlation between neighboring pedestrians during absences presents a significant challenge. To address these issues, we introduce a novel trajectory completion method that harnesses prior-posterior knowledge and interactive information, termed CMPT. Our approach commences with the design of a Neighbor Pedestrian Selection module (NPS), adept at identifying neighboring pedestrians through a composite scoring system that evaluates feature similarity and proximity. Subsequently, we employ a Top-Graph Attention Network (T-GAT) to extract multiple correlation sets between preceding and succeeding moments within the scenario. These correlations are then fed into the Markov-Inverse Recovery module (MR), which utilizes prior and posterior insights to flesh out the neighbor influence at the unobserved intervals. Culminating in the Trajectory Reconstruction module (TR), we integrate the completed neighbor influence data with the historical trajectory of the missing pedestrian to finalize the missing trajectory reconstruction. Empirical evidence from our experiments indicates that the Final Distance Error (FDE) of the trajectories completed by CMPT is a commendable 0.30. The source code for CMPT is available from https://github.com/ZYueliang/CMPT-Net.},

As a result, the predictability of the data-driven model in unseen scenarios, such as evacuation scenarios, remains unknown due to the challenges of collecting out-of-distribution data regarding emergency conditions. To address this problem, we present an evaluation pipeline to evaluate different kinds of data-driven models. A method is proposed to generate realistic scenarios by simulation and collect synthetic data from these scenarios to acquire a comprehensive dataset. With these synthetic data, we evaluated different predictive models, from traditional machine learning methods to deep learning time-series prediction models, to explore their generalizability. Furthermore, we propose a weighted average metric, which is better suited to determine the performance of forecasting algorithms under adverse conditions. Through extensive experimentation, we showcase the heterogeneity and diversity of the simulation dataset. The evaluation results also revealed that all the data-driven models performed poorly in unseen scenarios, highlighting the urgent need to develop a robust and generalizable model for predicting crowd flow in indoor spaces.},

  abstract     = {3D object detection based on LiDAR point cloud and prior anchor boxes is a critical technology for autonomous driving environment perception and understanding. Nevertheless, an overlooked practical issue in existing methods is the ambiguity in training sample allocation based on box Intersection over Union (IoUbox). This problem impedes further enhancements in the performance of anchor-based LiDAR 3D object detectors. To tackle this challenge, this paper introduces a new training sample selection method that utilizes point cloud distribution for anchor sample quality measurement, named Point Assisted Sample Selection (PASS). This method has undergone rigorous evaluation on four widely utilized datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that the application of PASS elevates the average precision of anchor-based LiDAR 3D object detectors to a novel state-of-the-art, thereby proving the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

  abstract     = {Unsignalized intersections represent a typical societal road scenario, where severe spatio-temporal conflicts occur in the central area. The indiscriminate competition for spatio-temporal resources by vehicles at intersections leads to low traffic efficiency and frequent accidents. This paper proposes a universal and unified multi-vehicle cooperative motion planning framework for intersections, coupling optimization scheduling with vehicle motion control tasks, with the aim of achieving more rational resource allocation and enhanced efficiency. Specifically, the proposed optimal control conflict-based search (OPC-CBS) algorithm constructs a conflict search tree for spatio-temporal conflict detection, and further formulates a multi-objective optimization control problem based on conflict objects. This effectively transforms the large-scale global optimization problem into a small-scale multi-stage optimization problem, achieving a balance between optimality and computational efficiency. The algorithm efficiently establishes the passing order and motion trajectories of connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) in continuous spatio-temporal domains. Simulation experiments demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can comprehensively address multiple objectives such as vehicle kinematic constraints, environmental constraints, and performance constraints in complex and dynamic scenarios. It achieves approximately an 89.06% improvement in solution efficiency while reducing energy consumption by around 17.11%.},

  abstract     = {In autonomous driving, accurate 3D lane detection using monocular cameras is important for downstream tasks. Recent CNN and Transformer approaches usually apply a two-stage model design. The first stage transforms the image feature from a front image into a bird’s-eye-view (BEV) representation. Subsequently, a sub-network processes the BEV feature to generate the 3D detection results. However, these approaches heavily rely on a challenging image feature transformation module from a perspective view to a BEV representation. In our work, we present CurveFormer++, a single-stage Transformer-based method that does not require the view transform module and directly infers 3D lane results from the perspective image features. Specifically, our approach models the 3D lane detection task as a curve propagation problem, where each lane is represented by a curve query with a dynamic and ordered anchor point set. By employing a Transformer decoder, the model can iteratively refine the 3D lane results. A curve cross-attention module is introduced to calculate similarities between image features and curve queries. To handle varying lane lengths, we employ context sampling and anchor point restriction techniques to compute more relevant image features. Furthermore, we apply a temporal fusion module that incorporates selected informative sparse curve queries and their corresponding anchor point sets to leverage historical information. In the experiments, we evaluate our approach on two publicly real-world datasets. The results demonstrate that our method provides outstanding performance compared with both CNN and Transformer based methods. We also conduct ablation studies to analyze the impact of each component.},

  abstract     = {Millimeter-wave (mmW) automotive radar imaging technology shows significant promise in advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS). Super-resolution imaging methods can be employed the limited aperture length of automotive radar to improve azimuth (angular) resolution. However, automotive radar images typically exhibit large dynamic range (LDR) and large scene (LS), leading to pay extensive computational complexity and storage demands when striving for higher image quality. To tackle this challenge, a fast $l_{q}$ sparsity-driven imaging method with adaptive-focusing framework (FLSD-AF) for mmWave automotive radar super-resolution imaging in this article. First, in AF framework, a detect-before-imaging (DBI) is proposed to make echo data to adaptive focused on potential target area (PTR), thereby reducing the dimension of the effective data to reduce computational complexity and storage demands. Second, a subspace-phase-compensation (SPC) is proposed to reduces storage demands of the measurement matrix by addressing the imaging model mismatch in near-field under LS. Finally, a fast $l_{q}$ sparsity-driven (FLSD) imaging method is proposed. It employs $l_{q}$ -norm nonconvex penalty function to address the biased problem to improve imaging quality under LDR, meanwhile the computational complexity of the matrix operation is greatly reduced by utilizing joint Kailath-Variant (K-V) formula and Gohberg-Semencul (G-S) factorization. In summary, the proposed FLSD-AF not only substantially enhances the imaging performance, but also significantly diminishes the storage demands and computational complexity under LDR and LS. The results of simulations and experimental data all verify the proposed method.},

Although several methods have been proposed to detect UAVs, a pressing open challenge is posed by varying adverse weather conditions that could degrade the performance of many existing methods. To address these limitations, this work proposes a YOLO-based (You Only Look Once) novel model, YOLO-RAW that exhibits improved performance in adverse weather conditions and considers different scales of UAVs. Furthermore, to facilitate a more comprehensive evaluation of the proposed model’s effectiveness in UAV detection, we have curated a complex background dataset and introduced three distinct test sets affected by adverse weather conditions. These three test sets comprise the Rainy Test Set (RTS), the AWGN (Additive White Gaussian Noise) Test Set (ATS), and the Motion Blurred Test Set (MBTS).

While recent studies on truck platooning have emphasized platoons’ energy savings, stability, and safety, there has been limited exploration of platoon formation and control. This paper uses optimal control theory to address the dispatching control of trucks with arriving platoons. In particular, trucks arrive at a highway station while platoons arrive alongside it. The station controls the truck holding and dispatching, where trucks are sent out with or without a platoon. Dispatching trucks with an arriving platoon reduces fuel consumption while waiting for a platoon to arrive increases the dwell time (i.e., transportation delay). We assume that an arriving platoon determines the number of trucks (i.e., the batch size) it can accept. Only a single truck can be dispatched if a platoon is absent. Hence, we formulate the dispatching control problem and derive the optimal policy for the discounted costs and the average cost governing the dispatch of trucks alongside platoons. We proved the optimality of threshold policies. Numerical results for the average cost case are presented. They are consistent with the optimal ones.},

  abstract     = {Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) are redefining the transportation sector through their ability to navigate, make decisions, and complete autonomous tasks. For accurate perception and comprehension of the surroundings, the AVs heavily rely on segmenting high-resolution 3D point cloud data provided by Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) sensors for discerning objects and other environmental features. However, the current vehicular segmentation approaches experience shortcomings in data insufficiency, computational performance, and precision concerns. Hence, to counteract these limitations, the paper proposes a Semantic Segmentation approach using Ball-Pivoting Algorithm and U-Net (SSBU) that harmoniously combines the Ball-Pivoting surface reconstruction algorithm and 3D U-Net to enhance image characteristics, leading to highly accurate outcomes with optimal cost efficiency. This SSBU integration involves carrying out augmentations and pre-processing of the raw LiDAR data to transform them into voxels through the process of Voxelization. The voxels are further improved through a surface reconstruction technique that utilizes the Ball Pivoting Algorithm (BPA). The resulting 3D model is analyzed using 3D U-Net deep learning architecture for robust and real-time interpretation. The implementation has produced a mean Intersection Over Union (IoU) of 83.3 over the NuScenes data and 69.7 on the KITTI dataset, outperforming the state-of-the-art.},

This study proposes a multimodal DDD system with a deep neural network that combines computer vision-based face expression analysis and electroencephalogram (EEG) data analysis. Key contributions include: 1) providing a comprehensive hardware, firmware, and software design for the DDD system to acquire behind-the-ear (BTE) EEG signals, rather than conventional scalp EEGs, due to their convenience and practicality; 2) proposing a powerful and lightweight GAN-based auto-denoising method to eliminate artifacts from EEG signals during signal acquisition, significantly influencing the quality of the obtained result; 3) developing a multimodal DDD network by combining EEG analysis and computer vision-based face expression identification to improve performance in monitoring and early detection of the driver’s drowsiness while engaging in traffic. The study employs the relative root mean squared error (RRMSE) in both temporal and spectral domains to quantitatively assess the performance of the proposed approaches in artifact removal. The proposed GAN-based auto-denoising network outperforms other comparable approaches, with an RRMSE (temporal) of 0.210 and RRMSE (spectral) of 0.161. The proposed trained multimodal model with GAN-based auto-denoising is superior to other models with different denoising approaches in driver drowsiness detection across all five-evaluation metrics, with an accuracy of 95.33%, specificity of 95.48%, sensitivity of 95.17%, precision of 95.47%, and an F1-score of 95.32%.

This study investigates a new vehicle group (VG) based risk analysis method and explores risk evolution mechanisms considering VG features. An impact-based vehicle grouping method is proposed to cluster vehicles into VGs by evaluating their responses to the erratic behaviors of nearby vehicles. The risk of a VG is aggregated based on the risk between each vehicle pair in the VG, measured by inverse Time-to-Collision (iTTC). Logistic Regression and a Graph Neural Network (GNN) are used to predict VG risks based on both aggregated and disaggregated VG information. Both methods achieve excellent performance with AUC values exceeding 0.93. For the GNN model, GNNExplainer with feature perturbation is applied to identify critical individual vehicle features and their directional impact on VG risks.

  abstract     = {Trajectory prediction under Bird’s Eye View (BEV) refers to predicting the movement intention of agents based on the historical observation trajectories, which is of great significance for autonomous driving, driving safety and social navigation. The traffic prediction trajectory is multimodality with multiple reasonable trajectories and various prediction time, which often suffer complex agents interaction, cumulative errors and a large number of agents. To overcome these problems, we explore the BEV-based traffic participants trajectory prediction problem and propose the novel End-point Drive and Reverse Enhanced Decoding Network (EDRED-TPNet), based on the mechanisms of end-point driving and reverse enhanced decoding. Firstly, the Encoder based on Dynamic Spatio-temporal Graph and Multimodality Coding Fusion (ST-MC-Encoder) are constructed to effectively represent complex traffic scenario with changeable agents, encode social interactions with historical trajectories, social interaction, future trajectory and multimodality. Secondly, the End-Point Drive Module is proposed to predict the end point before predicting the complete trajectory, thus providing more accurate trajectory prediction; Lastly, to further improve the long-term prediction performance, the Reverse Enhanced Decoder (RE-Decoder) is proposed to fuse forward and reverse hidden state vectors to obtain diverse trajectories that conform to physical and social acceptability rules. We build the first AAV-captured Trajectory Prediction Dataset (UTP-Dataset) for traffic participants trajectory prediction. Experimental results show that the proposed methods can fulfill the multi-target trajectory prediction task in complex traffic scenarios and achieve high performance.},

  abstract     = {There has been considerable interest in recent years regarding how a small fraction of autonomous vehicles (AVs) can mitigate traffic congestion. However, the reality of vehicle-based congestion mitigation remains elusive, due to challenges of cost, technology maturity, and regulation. As a result, recent works have investigated the necessity of autonomy by exploring driving advisory systems. Such early works have made simplifying assumptions such as perfect driver compliance. This work relaxes this assumption, focusing on compliance errors caused by physical limitations of human drivers, in particular, response delay and speed deviation. These compliance errors introduce significant unpredictability into traffic systems, complicating the design of real-time driving advisories aimed at stabilizing traffic flow. Our analysis reveals that performance degradation increases sharply under compliance errors, highlighting the associated difficulties. To address this challenge, we develop a reinforcement learning (RL) framework based on an action-persistent Markov decision process (MDP) combined with domain randomization, designed for robust coarse-grained driving policies. This approach allows driving policies to effectively manage the cumulative impacts of compliance errors by generating various scenarios and corresponding traffic conditions during training. We show that in comparison to prior RL-based work which did not consider compliance errors, our policies achieve up to 2.2 times improvement in average speed over non-robust training. In addition, analytical results validate the experiment results, highlighting the benefits of the proposed framework. Overall, this paper advocates the necessity of incorporating human driver compliance errors in the development of RL-based advisory systems, achieving more effective and resilient traffic management solutions.},

  abstract     = {Stereo matching that provides dense 3D information is crucial in the perception of autonomous driving. Most state-of-the-art stereo matching networks pursue higher prediction accuracy relying on the strong regularization of 3D convolutions, but at the cost of speed. The computational complexity and memory consumption brought by 3D convolutions hinder the application of stereo matching in real-time scenarios. Thus, in this paper, we propose a two-stages stereo matching network with lightweight shallow 3D cost aggregation in the first stage and 2D cost aggregation in the second stage. We propose conv-atten fusion (CAF) block to efficiently explore positional and contextual information over a large receptive field. On the basis of CAF, a learnable regularized upsampling (LRU) is proposed to enable 3D aggregation on low-size cost volume to significantly cut down resource consumption. LRU provides a learnable way to upsample the regularized cost volume with much less ambiguities. By incorporating CAF into a simple 2D cost aggregation, a non-local aggregation is constructed to effectively yet efficiently regularize the cost volume in the second stage to obtain reliable matching proposals. By evaluating on KITTI benchmarks, the accuracy of CAFNet surpasses all published real-time results, and its comprehensive performance is outstanding among all published state-of-the-art results in terms of the proposed quality factor.},

  abstract     = {Pedestrian trajectory prediction grapples with the demanding feat of modeling complex interactions and learning multimodal distribution to navigate different human-centric environments. Despite superior performance in reducing distance-based metrics, recent works tend to predict out-of-distribution trajectories, as the distribution of forthcoming paths comprises a blend of various manifolds that may be disconnected. These unrealistic trajectories can potentially jeopardize the safety of traffic participants and result in significant damage. To meet these challenges, we propose DMPred, a graph-based generator adversarial network that generates realistic multimodal trajectory predictions by better modeling the social interactions of pedestrians across different scenes in disconnected manifolds. The core of DMPred is an attentive radiate graph sequence constructed by considering the localized influence radiating from pedestrian movements, which is followed by a spatiotemporal extractor that stores and reuses potentially forgotten neighboring pedestrian information to allow for better extraction of complex interactions. Additionally, a collection of generators is utilized for forecasting, which incorporates spectral clustering on trajectories during the prior learning process of multiple generators to help reduce model redundancy and enhance flexibility for various prediction scenarios. Through extensive experiments on multiple real-world and simulation datasets, we demonstrate that DMPred obtains highly competitive results with efficacy in predicting realistic multimodal trajectories.},

  abstract     = {In the era of crowd delivery vehicle routing and traffic management in smart cities, a complex challenge appears indistinctly, affecting both developed and developing nations worldwide. This challenging problem involves optimizing multi-depot routes while addressing various hurdles: minimizing travel time, distance, fuel consumption, and carbon emissions, all while navigating dynamic traffic congestion across diverse pathways. Existing approaches often focus on isolated aspects like shortest paths, carbon emissions, or traffic prediction, leaving the comprehensive multi-depot traffic management problem unaddressed. In response, this research work proposes an Intelligent Multi-Depot Vehicle Routing and Management (IM-VRM) model which provides a comprehensive and holistic solution. It employs a Graph Neural Network (GNN) learning-based routing with a greedy optimization to establish initial optimal pathways for multi-depot journeys. Subsequently, the IM-VRM model integrates traffic congestion prediction with green parameter computation, engaging the Dijkstra algorithm to select the most admissible routes. This consecutive steps-based travel route guidance process optimizes routing for heterogeneous vehicles, including both heavy-duty and light-duty types. It accounts for load-dependent fuel consumption, velocity, and carbon emissions. By doing so, it simplifies the complexities of multi-depot traffic routing and management. The proposed model has been rigorously evaluated using a real-world multi-depot traffic dataset, demonstrating its practical viability. Notably, IM-VRM model achieves a remarkable improvement in fuel savings, reduced carbon emissions, and shorter travel time outperforming previous state-of-the-art methods in both efficiency and precision.},

  abstract     = {Foreground object segmentation is one of the most important pre-processing steps in intelligent transportation and video surveillance systems. Although background modeling methods are efficient to segment foreground objects, their results are easily affected by dynamic backgrounds and updating strategies. Recently, deep learning-based methods have achieved more effective foreground object segmentation results compared with background modeling methods. However, a large number of labeled training frames are usually required. To reduce the number of training frames, we propose a novel cross-scale guidance network (CSGNet) for few-shot moving foreground object segmentation in surveillance videos. The proposed CSGNet contains the cross-scale feature expansion encoder and cross-scale feature guidance decoder. The encoder aims to represent the scenes by extracting cross-scale expansion features based on cross-scale and multiple field-of-view information learned from a limited number of training frames. The decoder aims to obtain accurate foreground object segmentation results under the guidance of the encoder features and the foreground loss. The proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art background modeling methods and the deep learning-based methods around 2.6% and 3.1%, and the average computation time is 0.073 and 0.046 seconds for each frame in the CDNet2014 dataset and the UCSD dataset under a single GTX 1080 GPU computer.

  abstract     = {The highly variable nature of cellular networks challenges end-to-end network transmissions in achieving low-latency and high-throughput performance. In high-speed rail (HSR) networks, the intermittent connectivity and capacity dynamics imposed by high client mobility further add complexity and difficulty in providing seamless service. While congestion control algorithms (CCAs) play an essential role in ensuring optimal network performance, prior works on congestion control have predominantly concentrated on enhancing network performance within stationary or low-mobility mobile networks without considering frequent disconnections and highly dynamic network capacities imposed by HSR networks, resulting in severe RTT inflation and slow loss recovery. In this paper, we argue that a dedicated transport layer protocol is necessary for high-mobility scenarios. We propose an end-to-end low-latency congestion control algorithm HiMo for HSR networks that reacts to abrupt bandwidth changes quickly, handles frequent handovers, and is immediately deployable. Our trace-driven emulation on real-world datasets demonstrates that HiMo can reduce 51.3% 95th-percentile latency with comparable throughput on high-speed rail networks, compared to state-of-the-art CCAs.},

Due to the absence or malfunction of detectors, some road segments are undetected, leading to a complete absence of volume data and thereby weakening the traffic monitoring capability of ITS. The existing estimation methods are either inapplicable to this scenario or yield poor results due to a lack of available data, which will compromise the traffic monitoring capability of ITS. To handle it, this work proposes a novel Road Network Similarity-based Transfer Learning method (RNS-TL) for real-time traffic estimation. Firstly, the Small-scale Road Network Similarity Evaluation Module (SSEM) is initially proposed which aims to identify the most similar road segments and their small-scale road networks for the undetected segments, serving as the source domain for transfer learning. Then, based on SSEM, a transfer learning framework is proposed where a traffic estimation model trained on the source domain is fine-tuned for the target undetected road segment. Finally, the results from two real-world traffic cases show that the estimation errors, MAE and RMSE, for the proposed method are 7.813 and 6.383, and 10.689 and 8.892, respectively, outperforming all comparison methods.},

  abstract     = {Truck parking on freight corridors faces the major challenge of insufficient parking spaces. This is exacerbated by the Hour-of-Service (HOS) regulations, which often result in unauthorized parking practices, causing safety concerns. It has been shown that providing accurate parking usage prediction can be a cost-effective solution to reduce unsafe parking practices. In light of this, existing studies have developed various methods to predict the usage of a truck parking site and have demonstrated satisfactory accuracy. However, these studies focused on a single parking site, and few approaches have been proposed to predict the usage of multiple truck parking sites considering spatio-temporal dependencies, due to the lack of data. This paper aims to fill this gap and presents the Regional Temporal Graph Convolutional Network (RegT-GCN) to predict parking usage across the entire state to provide more comprehensive truck parking information. The framework leverages the topological structures of truck parking site locations and historical parking data to predict the occupancy rate considering spatio-temporal dependencies across a state. To achieve this, we introduce a Regional Decomposition approach, which effectively captures the geographical characteristics of the truck parking locations and their spatial correlations. Evaluation results demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms other baseline models, showing the effectiveness of our regional decomposition.

This paper proposes an innovative solution to tackle these challenges based on heterogeneous graph multi-agent reinforcement learning and traffic theories. Our approach involves: 1) designing platoon and signal control as distinct reinforcement learning agents with their own set of observations, actions, and reward functions to optimize traffic flow; 2) designing coordination by incorporating graph neural networks within multi-agent reinforcement learning to facilitate seamless information exchange among agents on a regional scale; 3) applying alternating optimization for training, allowing agents to update their own policies and adapt to other agents’ policies.

The integration of these techniques has the potential to further enhance the traffic operation efficiency of both freeway and adjacent arterial networks. In this regard, we propose a freeway traffic control (FTC) strategy that coordinates VSL, LC, RM actions using a Q-learning (QL) framework which takes into account arterial traffic characteristics. The signal timing and demands of adjacent arterial intersections are incorporated as state variables of the FTC agent. The FTC agent is initially trained offline using a single-section road network, and subsequently deployed online in a connected freeway and arterial simulation network for continuous learning. The arterial network is assumed to be regulated by a traffic-responsive signal control strategy based on a cycle length model. Microscopic simulations demonstrate that the fully-trained FTC agent provides significant reductions in freeway travel time and the number of stops in scenarios with traffic congestion. It clearly outperforms an uncoordinated FTC and a decentralized feedback control strategy. Even though the FTC agent does not control the arterial traffic signals, it leads to shorter average queue lengths at arterial intersections by taking into account the arterial traffic conditions in controlling freeway traffic. These results motivate a future research where the QL framework will also include the control of arterial traffic signals.},

  abstract     = {The problem of the Flexible Pickup and Delivery Services Problem (FPDSP) arises from the actual needs of multi-warehouse management strategies and is one of the key challenges in the current urban distribution logistics industry. The problem aims to quickly calculate the route planning in complex scenarios to ensure that the total traveling time of the vehicle is minimized while meeting the time window requirements. To address this problem, we propose a deep reinforcement learning method based on the Actor-Critic algorithm to quickly calculate the approximate optimal solution of FPDSP. Specifically, we propose a Transformer Model with Parallel Encoders (TMPE). The model efficiently extracts order features through parallel encoders and then uses serial decoders to optimize the fusion of feature information to optimize the order selection process. In addition, we designed a reward function to reduce the number of repeated pickups made by the vehicle at the same consignor’s location between different orders, thereby effectively reducing the vehicle’s total travel time. Experimental results show that our method can quickly find feasible solutions to the problem compared with heuristic methods on seven different datasets. At the same time, compared with all baseline methods, the number of optimal solutions of our method reaches 14, which significantly improves the problem-solving ability. This result provides a new solution for optimizing pickup and delivery logistics in multiple warehouses in cities in the future.},

  abstract     = {Eco-driving control for connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) aims to co-optimize energy efficiency, ride comfort, and travel time while adhering to safety regulations. Model-based eco-driving strategies have proven robust and effective in simplified traffic scenarios. However, their application to complex tasks incurs high computational costs due to their reliance on precise nonlinear models that accurately reflect real-world physical systems. Model free deep reinforcement learning (DRL) methods exhibit potential in addressing challenges presented by high-dimensional state/action spaces encountered in real-time CAV control. Nevertheless, they require extensive training data and time, and are susceptible to getting stuck in suboptimal solutions, especially in complex urban traffic scenarios. To leverage the advantages of both model-based controllers and DRL algorithms, this study develops a novel model based controller online assisted-twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm (MCOA-TD3) algorithm. The proposed algorithm integrates imitation learning into the Vanilla TD3 agent. During training, the MCOA-TD3 agent can learn from demonstrations generated by a model predictive control-based expert controller. The performance of the proposed strategy is evaluated through simulations conducted in a dynamic traffic simulation scenario replicating the testfield of Hamburg, Germany. The results show that our proposed strategy improves energy efficiency and ride comfort while maintaining comparable driving times to the Vanilla TD3 strategy. Notably, compared with the Vanilla TD3 strategy, our proposed strategy demonstrates superior adaptability and online fine-tuning ability. These improvements make it more suitable for complex and dynamic real-world scenarios.},

  abstract     = {A fifth-generation vehicle-to-everything (5G-V2X) communication network has been created by combining the capabilities of vehicular networks and 5G technologies. This advanced network provides assurance of increased comfort, reliability, and security for vehicle user data. However, because of the high mobility, one of the major difficulties in 5G-V2X is the Handover (HO) process when a vehicle switches from one base station to another. This procedure is vulnerable to a variety of attacks, including impersonation, DoS, and Man in the Middle attacks. This study focuses specifically on the impersonation attack during the HO procedure, which can lead to critical DoS situations with potential real-life implications. The attack scenario involves rogue Femto Access Points (FAPs) exploiting the HO event. In this scenario, a malicious vehicle poses as a legitimate FAP, disrupting communication for nearby vehicles. To mitigate this attack, a novel attack detection model is proposed, relying on metrics like HO Failure Ratio (HFR) and Radio Link Failure (RLF). The adverse effects of this attack are demonstrated within the 5G-V2X context through measurable parameters such as packet loss rate, throughput, block rate, and HFR. Regarding the localization aspect, an ML-based multiclass classification mechanism is adopted. This mechanism leverages features particularly relevant to the handover scenario. A variety of classification methods, including k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN), Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF), Logistic Regression (LR), and Naive Bayes (NB), are employed for localization purposes. To enhance localization accuracy, an Ensemble Learning approach is implemented by involving the integration of KNN, LR, and RF techniques. Overall, the proposed approach effectively detects and localizes attackers during HO procedures, and also outperforms existing approaches.},

Our results demonstrate improved performance in small object detection, partial occlusion handling, and drivable area segmentation. The recall of the traffic object detection is 1.3% higher than that of the state-of-the-art model, reaching 94.1%, the mAP50 is 6.4% higher, reaching 89.8%, and the mIoU of the drivable area segmentation is 2.7% higher, reaching 95.9%. Additionally, the accuracy of lane detection reached 88.7%.

  abstract     = {Cracks on road surfaces pose serious risks to both pedestrians and drivers. Traditional manual crack detection methods are not only slow but also pose safety risks. Automating this process has the potential to greatly enhance detection efficiency and consequently improve driving safety. Although previous methods have shown promise in road crack detection, they often neglect interactions between multiple scales, causing smaller cracks to be overlooked in later stages of detection. This paper introduces the Cross-scale Overlapping Patch-based attention Network (COP-Net), which incorporates two critical components: the Scale-aware Channel Attention (SCA) module and the Patch-based Cross-scale Attention (PCA) module for crack detection. These innovations enable dynamic inference on multiple scales, resulting in a significant improvement in crack detection and segmentation. Notably, our approach excels at detecting both small and large cracks simultaneously. To validate the effectiveness of our approach, we conducted evaluations on three open datasets: CRACK500, CFD, and AEL. These evaluation results demonstrate that COP-Net surpasses eleven comparison methods, including HED, DeepCrack, UHDN, SSGNet, MFANet, FPHBN, DeepCrack, PBNet, PAFNet, CarNet, and SegFormer. Our model achieves new State-of-The-Art (SoTA) performance levels in terms of segmentation metrics such as AIU, ODS, and OIS.},

The experimental findings highlight ELP 1.0 challenges as well as its usefulness to question ALPR models’ capacities.

  abstract     = {Owing to the shortage of computing resources for autonomous vehicles and redundant modeling among similar tasks, multi-task models have become a feasible solution. The multi-task prediction model of autonomous vehicles refers to the realization of trajectory, behavior, and risk predictions through a multi-task deep neural network. However, whether the multi-task prediction networks can effectively share information between multiple inputs and whether the shared representations are interpretable remains a concern. To address the aforementioned concerns, this study proposes a multi-source multi-dimensional model interpretation (M3-interpretation) method for multi-task prediction neural network (MPNN). The MPNN proposed in this paper is designed with a structure that emphasizes a “task-specific pipeline as the main, high-level semantic information sharing as the supplement”. Then, based on the information entropy theory, this study creatively extends the information bottleneck attribution method to M3 and uses feature masks to display fine-grained interpretation results. Comparison and ablation experiments using naturalistic trajectory datasets indicated that the proposed model has better prediction performance than single-task models. In addition, fine-grained attribution analysis was conducted on specific behaviors in temporal, spatial, and feature dimensions to explore the laws that affect behavioral inference in MPNN.},

For urban road networks, relieving congestion at traffic bottlenecks can effectively improve overall traffic congestion, so identifying traffic bottlenecks in the road network is essential. Some researchers currently use spatial features based on section congestion propagation to predict bottlenecks, but their temporal features are also an important factor. A new bottleneck definition that considers both the temporal and spatial characteristics of congestion propagation is proposed. A congestion propagation dynamic model is built based on this definition, and the congestion propagation probability between different time periods is estimated using causal anonymous walks. The total congestion cost of road segments is then calculated, and traffic bottlenecks in the road network at different time periods are predicted. Finally, we used SUMO to simulate the Sioux city road network and collected 30 days of traffic flow information to construct a congestion propagation dataset. We then trained a causal anonymized walking network to estimate the congestion propagation probability for different time periods and predict traffic bottlenecks. By alleviating congestion on bottleneck sections, we demonstrated the effectiveness of this method in predicting bottlenecks and improving traffic flow for the road network as a whole.},

In this paper, we present a novel joint Self-Correlation and Cross-Correspondence Estimation Framework (SC3EF), leveraging both local representative features and global contextual cues to effectively generate RGB-T correspondences. For this purpose, we design a convolution-transformer-based pipeline to extract local representative features and encode global correlations of intra-modality for inter-modality correspondence estimation between unaligned visible and thermal images. After merging the local and global correspondence estimation results, we further employ a hierarchical optical flow estimation decoder to progressively refine the estimated dense correspondence maps. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method, outperforming the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on representative RGB-T datasets. Furthermore, it also shows competitive generalization capabilities across challenging scenarios, including large parallax, severe occlusions, adverse weather, and other cross-modal datasets (e.g., RGB-N and RGB-D).},

Due to the limited observations and annotations of pedestrian crossing behaviors in real situations, recent studies have begun to leverage synthetic data with flexible variation to boost prediction performance, employing domain adaptation frameworks. However, different domain knowledge has distinct cross-domain distribution gaps, which necessitates suitable domain knowledge adaption ways for PCP tasks. In this work, we propose a gated syn-to-real knowledge transfer approach for PCP (Gated-S2R-PCP), which has two aims: 1) designing the suitable domain adaptation ways for different kinds of crossing-domain knowledge, and 2) transferring suitable knowledge for specific situations with gated knowledge fusion. Specifically, we design a framework that contains three domain adaption methods including style transfer, distribution approximation, and knowledge distillation for various information, such as visual, semantic, depth, bounding boxes, etc. A learnable gated unit (LGU) is employed to fuse suitable cross-domain knowledge to boost pedestrian crossing prediction. We construct a new synthetic benchmark S2R-PCP-3181 with 3181 sequences (489,740 frames) which contains the pedestrian bounding boxes, RGB frames, semantic segmentation maps, and depth maps. With the synthetic S2R-PCP-3181, we transfer the knowledge to two real challenging datasets of PIE and JAAD, and superior PCP performance is obtained to the state-of-the-art methods.},

To analyze the influencing factors of driver’s takeover time in the mixed traffic flow environment, we study a real-vehicle takeover experiment with the CADV and radar video integrated machine provided by Jiangsu University. DeepGBM algorithm and Shapley additive explanation (SHAP) are utilized to predict and analyze the takeover time based on the data obtained from the real-vehicle experiment. The results show that the DeepGBM algorithm performs a better accuracy in predicting the takeover time compared with the other algorithms. Moreover, the predicting effect of DeepGBM in the scene of average takeover time is better than the shorter and longer ones. On the other hand, when taking over CADV in the intersection area, the driver pays more attention to the vehicle’s speed. While in the non-intersection area, the driver is more attentive to the longitudinal distance difference with the vehicle ahead. This study further found that CADVs are subject to significant lateral interference for the takeover process in intersection areas, significantly impacting the driver’s takeover time and vehicle safety.

  abstract     = {The vehicular cloudlet (VC), capable of leveraging synergies to support emerging cooperative services and task offloading among neighboring vehicles, will be adopted in the Internet of Vehicles (IoV). Compared with traditional clustering methods based on link connectivity, VCs require higher transmission capacity and stability. Three major challenges must be addressed when optimally establishing the VC structure. First, the transmission capacity is affected by inherent stochastic characteristics, including channel fading and interference. Second, the mobility of vehicles introduces instability. Third, a comprehensive optimization model is required to jointly improve the stability and transmission capacity of the established VC. Therefore, this paper proposes a dual cyber-physical network (DCP) model to represent the dynamic physical network and the coupled transmission network. Generalized analytical expressions for channel quality are derived using moment-generating functions based on a Nakagami-m small-scale fading model to handle stochastic characteristics. Furthermore, a DCP association density optimization model is proposed that considers the stability of the physical topology and the transmission capacity of the channel. Symmetric non-negative matrix factorization is used to solve the optimization problem with low complexity. Simulation results confirm that our proposed method achieves higher transmission capacity and stability compared existing link connectivity-based clustering methods.},

  abstract     = {This paper proposes a novel hierarchical controller for connected truck platoons. To this end, the predecessor following topology is used to characterize the communication connectivity between connected trucks. Then, a longitudinal efficient controller consisting of upper-level and lower-level controllers is proposed. In particular, the upper-level controller is designed based on the kinematic model to handle the car-following interactions between connected trucks and delays in communication and input. The lower-level controller comprises a feedforward and a feedback control law. The feedforward control law converts the desired acceleration from the upper-level controller into the vehicle throttle or braking pressure using the inverse dynamic model, while the feedback control law compensates for the control error caused by unknown vehicle parameters. In addition, in the linear region, the internal stability is analyzed based on the second-order kinematic model using s-domain analysis and linearization method, respectively. Then, the string stability is proved. The influence of parameters on the stability performance is extensively discussed using the stability diagram. Finally, the feasibility of the proposed controller is verified via co-simulations in PreScan and TruckSim, in terms of acceleration, velocity, and spacing error profiles.},

  abstract     = {The integration of look-ahead information into Model Predictive Control (MPC) frameworks has shown promise for intelligent transportation systems. However, transitioning Predictive Cruise Control (PCC) system research into practical application poses challenges due to numerous weighting parameters and increased computational demands in complex driving environments. Although the Weighted Sum Method is commonly used in PCC system research to balance fuel consumption and trip time objectives, it requires time-consuming weight tuning and often results in suboptimal performance due to fixed weighting parameters. To address this, this paper proposes a Utopia-tracking Model Predictive Control (UTM-MPC) controller, where the cost function is reformulated as the sum of the distances between the objectives and the average Utopia point over the prediction horizon. By analyzing the Pareto front of the PCC optimization problem under varying slope profiles extracted from digital map data, we demonstrate that the proposed UTM-MPC effectively leverages the geometric characteristics of the Pareto front to identify preferred trade-off solutions. The adaptive weighting mechanism—derived from the online-calculated Utopia point—enhances the robustness of the PCC system under complex and dynamic driving conditions. To mitigate the computational burden associated with integrating UTM-MPC into the MPC framework, we introduce a tailored neighboring extremal-based solving algorithm. Leveraging the receding horizon nature of MPC, this method requires only minimal updates to efficiently identify an optimal solution near the nominal trajectory from the previous sampling instance. Simulation results show that the UTM-MPC controller, with its adaptive weighting strategy, consistently outperforms the traditional Weighted Sum Method in terms of both fuel efficiency and trip time.},

While traditional vSLAM systems have shown significant progress in indoor or outdoor environments, their performance often degrades in complex scenes, limiting their adaptability and robustness. Semantic vSLAM, which integrates high-level semantic information into vSLAM systems, has emerged as a promising solution to address these limitations by enabling a richer understanding of the environment. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive review of semantic vSLAM, offering a critical analysis of its evolution, methods, and challenges. We begin by revisiting the development of traditional vSLAM, emphasizing its limitations and the motivation for incorporating semantic information. Subsequently, we delve into the core modules of semantic vSLAM, including semantic extraction, object association, semantic loop closing, back-end optimization, and semantic mapping. Then, we present a performance comparison of semantic vSLAM systems under two different datasets, indoor and outdoor, respectively. Furthermore, we also provide a comparative analysis of widely used SLAM datasets to provide guidance for performance testing and validation. To further enrich the discussion, we identify unresolved challenges in semantic vSLAM, such as long-term semantic perception and association, open and unstructured environments. We propose future research directions, including balancing computational resources and quantifying system risk, large model-based navigation and mapping, and embodied AI SLAM. By providing key insights and forward-looking perspectives, this work aims to stimulate future research and improve the capabilities of semantic vSLAM in real-world applications.},

Given the cost of sensors and the advantages of visual data in color information, 3D lane detection based on monocular vision is an important research direction in the realm of AD that increasingly gains attention in both industry and academia. Nevertheless, recent advancements in visual perception seem inadequate for the development of fully reliable 3D lane detection algorithms, which also hampers the progress of vision-based fully autonomous vehicles. We believe that it still leaves an open and interesting problem for improvement in 3D lane detection algorithms for autonomous vehicles using visual sensors, and significant enhancements are essentially required.

Therefore, inspired by visual grounding, we present WaterVG, the inaugural visual grounding dataset tailored for USV-based waterway perception guided by human prompts. WaterVG contains a wealth of prompts describing multiple targets, with instance-level annotations, including bounding boxes and masks. Specifically, WaterVG comprises 11,568 samples and 34,987 referred targets, integrating both visual and radar characteristics. The text-guided two-sensor pattern provides a fine granularity of text prompts aligned with the visual and radar features of the referent targets, containing both qualitative and numeric descriptions. To enhance the endurance and maintain the normal operations of USVs in open waterways, we propose Potamoi, a low-power visual grounding model. Potamoi is a multi-task model employing a sophisticated Phased Heterogeneous Modality Fusion (PHMF) mechanism, which includes Adaptive Radar Weighting (ARW) and Multi-Head Slim Cross Attention (MHSCA). The ARW module utilizes a gating mechanism to adaptively extract essential radar features for fusion with visual inputs, ensuring prompt alignment. MHSCA, characterized by its low parameter count and computational efficiency (FLOPs), effectively integrates contextual information from both sensors with linguistic features, delivering outstanding performance in visual grounding tasks. Comprehensive experiments and evaluations on WaterVG demonstrate that Potamoi achieves state-of-the-art results compared to existing methods.

  abstract     = {The accuracy and stability of motion prediction are crucial for the safe planning of autonomous driving systems. The widely used attention mechanisms effectively improve prediction accuracy. However, their computational cost grows quadratically with sequence length, presenting challenges for handling complex, large-scale scenarios. The attention patterns of motion prediction tasks exhibit significant data-related sparsity, indicating that not all scene elements are worth interaction. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel motion prediction framework that enhances the efficiency and stability of interaction fusion while achieving promising prediction accuracy. Firstly, an adaptive self-distillation attention module based on sparse interaction graph is designed. This module adaptively filters high-value sequences for each target to achieve sparse attention calculation and balance scene scale. Due to the lack of interaction labels in the original dataset, a self-distillation strategy is employed for model training. Secondly, a multi-stage dynamic anchor decoder is introduced that leverages the information filtering and aggregation capabilities of the sparse attention mechanism to improve prediction accuracy. The decoder dynamically updates the target anchor representations as the prediction progresses, ensuring consistency between interaction states and the prediction process in long-term forecasting. This approach effectively focuses attention calculation on the most relevant scene context fusion and trajectory decoding at each prediction stage. Validation results on Argoverse 1 and Argoverse 2 demonstrate that the proposed method achieves competitive accuracy while effectively reducing computational resource consumption. The proposed method can also serve as a plug-in that can be seamlessly incorporated into standard motion prediction pipelines to optimize scene interaction, making it more friendly to low-cost devices.},

To address this challenge, this study proposes lightweight optimization strategies for decision-making models from the aspects of parameter size, training memory usage, and inference speed. Specifically, an innovative solution is proposed to achieve lightweight parameters. The Video Swin Transformer is employed to simultaneously extract temporal and spatial features, with the network trained using a Prioritized Replay Deep Q-Network (PRDQN) that incorporates risk assessment. To further reduce training memory usage, the Q-target network in PRDQN is removed, and the mellowmax operator is integrated to enhance the training process, resulting in the PRDeepMellow Swin Transformer. After analyzing the inference speed problems encountered by the algorithm in practical applications, the vanilla self-attention is replaced by a linear self-attention based on double softmax, namely Double Softmax Linear Video Swin Transformer (DSLVS Transformer) which improves the inference speed for long sequences. The proposed methods were evaluated across three high-speed lane change scenarios (a static scenario, a dynamic scenario, and a randomly changing scenario). Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed methods can still maintain excellent decision performance after the corresponding lightweight optimizations.},

  abstract     = {Discriminative correlation filter (DCF)-based tracking algorithms continue to advance in the field of UAV tracking due to their computational efficiency. The idea of integrating the advantages of historical information and response adjustments into the CF tracking framework is continuously being developed. However, maintaining the stability of mobile video tracking in highly dynamic environments is extremely challenging. This difficulty arises from frequent changes in targets and backgrounds, as well as the stochastic noise generated by the photon-counting process in sensors. In addition, the inconsistent rates of these changes are often overlooked and require further scrutiny. In this paper, we propose a dynamic sensitivity enhanced correlation filter with adaptive second-order difference spatial regularization to address the issue of inconsistent motion rates in dynamic videos. We use the non-local means algorithm to denoise template images before feature extraction, improving the discriminative power of target contours. Then, we incorporate the proposed dynamic-sensitivity error method into CF learning and employ a novel adaptive second-order difference spatial regularization to simultaneously optimize the filter coefficients and spatial regularization weights. This regularization effectively works in synergy with the dynamic-sensitivity error strategy. Furthermore, an additional ADMM optimizer is introduced to derive the solution, thereby improving the convergence and computational efficiency of the algorithm. This algorithm supports the adjustment of filter updates in dynamic environments by balancing consistency with previous filter templates and flexibility to accommodate rapid target changes. By conducting extensive experiments on three challenging UAV tracking databases, we compare the proposed model with existing models. The experimental results demonstrate our superior performance.

  abstract     = {Multi-UAV autonomous cooperative air warfare is an important mode of future intelligent air warfare. However, due to the complexity and uncertainty of air combat situation information, how to accurately interpret the enemy’s sustained combat intent remains a major challenge. To address this problem, we propose a Context-Aware Adaptive Feature Fusion (CAAFF) method, which can effectively utilize the time-series data of battlefield situation for hierarchical feature fusion. Specifically, the input data is first subjected to dimensionality reduction processing and feature extraction by an encoder-decoder to provide high-quality low-dimensional feature representations for further feature fusion. Next, the middle layer captures attitude changes by aggregating information from neighboring nodes via a graph attention convolutional network (GACN), flexibly fusing the features of each node, and identifying complex relationships between nodes. Finally, the mechanism of stabilizing multi-attention with self-attention is used to integrate global information at the upper layer to construct an overall feature representation of the mission and realize local-to-global posture analysis. In order to enhance the interpretation of persistent operational intent, we utilize the context-aware module to construct contextual feature representations by combining current and historical state information, thus improving the depth and interpretability of mission understanding. Finally, we combine the CAAFF method with reinforcement learning and verify its performance through multiple experiments, demonstrating the applicability and effectiveness of the method in Multi-UAV cooperative air combat.},

This paper combines the advantages of decentralized and distributed architectures and proposes a scenario-driven extension Hybrid-DMPC algorithm with variable topology and distributed modeling. Firstly, a two-dimensional extension coordinate is constructed with the $\beta - \dot {\beta } $ phase plane and LTR as feature states. The correlation function is then solved to divide the vehicle states into classical domain, extension domain, and non-domain, forming a mapping relationship with the control architecture. Secondly, the distributed state space equations with state coupling and input coupling are constructed. The proposed algorithm is designed to employ decentralized, distributed, and hybrid architectures in the classical domain, non-domain, and extension domain, respectively. The correlation function determines the fusion rules for multiple control inputs in the extension domain. Thirdly, a cost-coupled weighted optimization function is designed, enabling local agents to coordinate global performance goals through iterative optimization. Finally, co-simulation and HIL test results verified that the proposed algorithm effectively coordinates multiple control objectives, achieving high-precision trajectory tracking, excellent handling stability, and anti-roll performance.},

To obtain the objective safety metrics, insecurity quantification is built based on the fuzzy theory and fault tree analysis. The subjective cognition of drivers for different driving policies is modeled by deep successor representation and encoded in POCRM using deep reinforcement learning. Driving data collected from the public dataset for realistic traffic environment are used to evaluate the proposed POCRM.

Despite the rapid development, most existing studies solely focus on normal and safe scenarios while largely neglecting safety-critical scenarios, particularly those involving imminent collisions. This oversight may result in autonomous vehicles lacking the essential predictive ability in such situations, posing a significant threat to safety. To tackle these, this paper proposes a risk-aware trajectory prediction framework tailored to safety-critical scenarios. Leveraging distinctive hazardous features, we develop three core risk-aware components. First, we introduce a risk-incorporated scene encoder, which augments conventional encoders with quantitative risk information to achieve risk-aware encoding of hazardous scene contexts. Next, we incorporate endpoint-risk-combined intention queries as prediction priors in the decoder to ensure that the predicted multimodal trajectories cover both various spatial intentions and risk levels. Lastly, an auxiliary risk prediction task is implemented for the ultimate risk-aware prediction. Furthermore, to support model training and performance evaluation, we introduce a safety-critical trajectory prediction dataset and tailored evaluation metrics. We conduct comprehensive evaluations and compare our model with several SOTA models. Results demonstrate the superior performance of our model, with a significant improvement in most metrics. This prediction advancement enables autonomous vehicles to execute correct collision avoidance maneuvers under safety-critical scenarios, eventually enhancing road traffic safety.},

  abstract     = {Railway object intrusion poses a significant threat to railway safety, so it is vital to monitor the obstacles within the track area in real-time to prevent accidents, which can be achieved by vision-based technologies. However, most existing vision-based railway obstacle detection algorithms are limited to stationary cameras, which restricts the monitoring range. In contrast, onboard approaches enable full-line monitoring but face more challenges in achieving high accuracy and real-time performance. To address these challenges, we developed an onboard end-to-end multitask perception model (MTP-Rail), which includes variants of different scales (S, M, L) to realize railway obstacle detection in real-time with high accuracy. Our model consists of two decoders, which can simultaneously implement the tasks of object of interest detection and track segmentation. In addition, we designed a post-processing scheme to analyze the relationship between the detected object and the track and assess the obstacle risk level. Experiments on our dataset show that one of the proposed model MTP-rail-M achieved an 89.6% classification accuracy of obstacle risk level and 54.3% on mAP, 78.6% on mPA and 64.9% on mIoU with an inference speed of 181 FPS at an input size of $640\times 640$ on RTX 3060Ti.

  abstract     = {Vision-based intelligent systems are extensively used in autonomous driving, traffic monitoring, and transportation surveillance due to their high performance, low cost, and ease of installation. However, their effectiveness is often compromised by adverse conditions such as haze, fog, low light, motion blur, and low resolution, leading to reduced visibility and increased safety risks. Additionally, the prevalence of high-definition imaging in embedded and mobile devices presents challenges related to the conflict between large image sizes and limited computing resources. To address these issues and enhance visual perception for intelligent systems operating under adverse conditions, this study proposes an all-in-one isomorphic dual-branch (IDB) framework consisting of two branches with identical structures for different functions, a loss-attention (LA) learning strategy, and feature fusion super-resolution (FFSR) module. The versatile IDB network employs a simple and effective encoder-decoder structure as the backbone for both branches, which can be replaced with task-specific tailored backbones. The plug-in LA strategy differentiates the functions of the two branches, adapting them to various tasks without increasing computational demands during inference. The FFSR module concatenates multi-scale features and restores details progressively in downsampled images, producing outputs with improved visibility, brightness, edge sharpness, and color fidelity. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms several state-of-the-art methods for image dehazing, low-light enhancement, image deblurring, and super-resolution image reconstruction while maintaining low computational overhead.

Traditional continuum models for macroscopic pedestrian flow models usually assume that the pedestrian flow could be described by certain governing equations. Whether the dynamics of real crowd follow the governing equations remains unconfirmed, which would limit the ability of continuum models to reproduce real pedestrian dynamics. This paper introduces a novel data-driven approach, FAM-LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory with flow attention module) trained with empirical data from controlled pedestrian experiments, designed to predict macroscopic pedestrian dynamics. The flow attention module enhances the learning performance by accounting for the physical correlations between pedestrian density and velocity. Extensive testing of open-loop and closed loop predictions demonstrates that FAM-LSTM achieves satisfactory prediction accuracy, time adaptability, and robustness. The approach presented offers a beneficial advancement in macroscopic pedestrian dynamics prediction and provides a new perspective on crowd management efforts.},

Firstly, a distributed event-triggered extended state observer (ESO) is designed to observe the virtual leader’s position information, and another ESO is used to estimate the quantized state information of each USV and the uncertainty terms existing in the model. Subsequently, the kinematic guidance law and the kinetic control laws based on a time-varying threshold event-triggered mechanism are proposed in quantized environment using the hierarchical design approach. In addition, the linear splitting of the input quantization makes the designed controller no longer require a priori information on the quantization parameters. Finally, the stability of the designed distributed USV formation tracking control system with input and state quantization based on the time-varying threshold event-triggered mechanism is demonstrated by input-to-state stability theory, and the absence of Zeno behavior in the proposed control strategy is also verified.

A novel learning-based approximate optimal control policy including two-stage designs is presented. At the first stage, a steady-state robust control protocol is developed to steer UAVs to precisely travel along a predefined elliptical path based on concise filtering. At the second stage, to address specified-time constraints and gain the online optimization ability, a single-critic based enhanced learning rule is explored to generate an approximate optimal regulator that stabilizes error dynamics and minimizes value functions, wherein specified-time constraints can be handled by encoding inequality conditions as skilled barrier functions, and by making full use of historical data and current information, a finite-time learning mechanism driven by weight errors rather than Bellman errors is proposed to approximate the solution of Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation with faster decaying. The distinct merit is that an improved reinforcement learning (RL) paradigm is formulated to prescribe an elliptical circumnavigation with assured time requirements and optimization behaviors, which can greatly outperform non-RL alternatives in maintaining the optimal performance index while exhibiting restriction handling ability via online learning. Lyapunov stability demonstrates that involved error variables are ultimately limited and resultant controller obeys optimality.

In this approach, the leading train uses a high-order extended Kalman filter to obtain its current operational state and then transmits historical state data to the following train. The following train then employs a high-order extended Kalman smoother to refine the state estimation and determine dynamic headway estimation. The high-order extended Kalman filter, based on Taylor series expansion, enhances state estimation accuracy by minimising truncation errors. It constructs a pseudo-linear representation of the full-space hidden variables and establishes high-order states, facilitating the modelling of measurements to align with the filtering derivation process. The high-order extended Kalman smoother continuously optimises current-state estimation using future measurement sequences, with the derivation process realised through the orthogonal theorem and innovation analysis. Ultimately, the headway estimation is updated based on the smoothed state provided by the smoother, and the effectiveness of the proposed method is validated through a multi-mode operating process of virtual coupling trains.},

  abstract     = {Accurate performance and low energy consumption are essential for trajectory tracking control of an underactuated surface vessel (USV) to satisfy marine operation requirements. This paper studies the user-specified optimal tracking control problem for the USV in the presence of modeling uncertainties. A fuzzy weights-based adaptive reinforcement learning (RL) control scheme is developed to achieve the tracking control with the predefined convergence time and steady-state accuracy while minimizing the performance index function. The constructed performance index function includes the surge velocity control law and the constrained position tracking error. Following that, an optimal backstepping design frame is proposed to derive the controllers with unknown gradient terms by constructing the error subsystems at the kinematic and kinetic levels of the USV. Then, a fuzzy reinforcement learning algorithm (FRLA) is presented to derive the optimal control solutions of corresponding error subsystems. Since the fuzzy basis function vectors derived from measured states of the USV system may be zero vectors, the persistence excitation condition may not always be satisfied. Thus, in the design of fuzzy RL updating laws of critics and actors, a positive parameter compensation technique is proposed to make the matrixes consist of fuzzy basis functions strictly positive definite. It releases the need for assumption of persistence excitation, and the convergence of the critic weight estimate and the boundedness of closed-loop systems can be guaranteed. Finally, the effectiveness of the presented method is demonstrated by numerical simulations and real-world experiments.},

  abstract     = {To address the collaborative issue in large-scale urban rail transit (URT) network operations, this paper proposes an adaptive real-time control framework based on the Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) deep reinforcement learning (DRL) method, featuring flexible train scheduling capabilities. First, by analyzing dynamic passenger travel behavior (e.g., entering/exiting stations, transferring) and train operation events (e.g., dispatching, interstation running, station dwelling), the control problem is modeled as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and an efficient URT simulation environment is constructed. Then, considering constraints such as train capacity and dispatch intervals, a train scheduling model is developed to minimize both passenger costs and operational costs. Subsequently, the real-time state of the URT system is represented by the overall number of passengers present at every platform, and train dispatch intervals on all lines are used as decision variables. A solving algorithm based on the SAC framework is developed. Finally, experimental results on a large-scale URT network comprising 10 lines demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework, showing superior performance compared to other reinforcement learning algorithms and traditional heuristic optimization algorithms. The proposed approach achieves a 1.63% reduction in average passenger waiting time, equivalent to 2.09 seconds, while utilizing 49 fewer trains, representing a 2.97% decrease, compared to the second-best TD3 algorithm.},

  abstract     = {The electro-mechanical braking (EMB) system, known for its integration and intelligence, is considered an ideal actuator for vehicles. However, accurate slip ratio tracking is hindered by uncertainties in the road adhesion coefficient and communication delays, which adversely affect anti-lock braking performance. This study proposes an interval type-2 Takagi-Sugeno (IT2 T-S) fuzzy robust $H_{\mathrm {\infty }}$ anti-lock braking control strategy to address these challenges. An IT2 T-S fuzzy anti-lock braking system (ABS) model is designed to enhance ABS linearization accuracy under uncertainties in the road adhesion coefficient. The vehicle speed is observed using an IT2 T-S fuzzy observer. A delay-product-type Lyapunov-Krasovskii (L-K) functional robust $H_{\mathrm {\infty }}$ anti-lock braking controller is designed. The delay-product-type L-K functional effectively utilizes delay information to reduce the conservatism of the controller, improving the slip ratio tracking performance of the EMB system under input delay conditions. Additionally, a motor torque compensation strategy is introduced to optimize slip ratio control on different roads. Simulations verify that the proposed strategy improves the EMB system’s slip ratio control performance under conditions of uncertainty and input delay.},

  abstract     = {Driving on public roads is inherently an interactive task, i.e., autonomous vehicles’ (AVs) actions will influence nearby traffic participants’ reactions, and vice versa. Decision-making for AVs in highly interactive driving scenarios (e.g., dense traffic) requires accurately forecasting the impact of the AVs’ intention on nearby traffic participants’ motion. To this end, a hierarchical decision-making framework (HDM) is proposed to navigate through interactive scenarios safely and efficiently. Specifically, the upper layer of the HDM serves as a coarse-level policy generator, which utilizes the plan-informed graph attention network (P-GAT) to provide interaction-aware guidance. The P-GAT predictor takes the historical states of nearby traffic participants, road structure information, and AVs’ potential intentions as inputs. Subsequently, it predicts the motions of other traffic participants in response to potential actions of the AVs, which is then systematically evaluated to generate interactive guidance. Furthermore, the learned policy is utilized to guide the lower layer, which utilizes a fine-level model predictive control (MPC)-based planner to ensure safety and kinematic feasibility. Finally, to validate the effectiveness of HDM, both qualitative and quantitative experiments are carried out. More importantly, the hardware-in-the-loop (HiL) experiment is also implemented, including mandatory lane change in dense traffic flow and interaction with the human driver. The results demonstrate that the proposed HDM can improve driving safety and efficiency compared with baselines.},

While the static imaging method with a coplanar array capacitance sensor has great detection efficiency. Therefore, a dynamic coplanar capacitance imaging method using an innovative mobile coplanar array capacitance sensor is proposed. This method combines the strengths of both methods to image and identify concealed damage in asphalt materials. Initially, the dynamic sensitivity field distribution is established. Subsequently, the normalized dynamic coplanar capacitance of the measured electrode pairs is analyzed. Finally, concealed damages in asphalt materials are identified. Layer D1 is determined to be the optimal dynamic sensitivity layer. Circle damages exhibit the greatest normalized coplanar capacitance, followed by square and triangle damages. Normalized coplanar capacitance decreases with increasing relative depth of concealed damage. The deeper damage with larger relative permittivity differences displays redder in the reconstructed images. Square damages have the highest imaging accuracy, followed by circle and triangle damages. The imaging accuracy of concealed damages in asphalt materials ranks from lowest to highest: void damages in asphalt mixtures, void damages in asphalt mastics, moisture damages in asphalt mastics, and moisture damages in asphalt mixtures. The dynamic coplanar array capacitance imaging method can identify the relative depth and shape characteristics of various concealed damages in different asphalt materials. The outcomes of this research have the potential to assist engineers in visually and precisely recognizing concealed damages in in situ shallow asphalt layers.},

Their subjective feedback on situational trust and system aggressiveness was collected through questionnaires, and eye movements related to gaze, blink, saccade, fixation, pupil diameter, and eyelid opening were monitored. The analysis identified 25 significant eye movement features. The experimental results show that lower situational trust during automated lane changes correlated with increased attention to side mirrors, decreased attention to the front vehicle in the original lane, reduced blink frequency and suppressed saccade amplitude which increased the duration of effective visual information acquisition, smaller pupil diameter and greater fluctuations indicating increased cognitive load. The extracted features proved effective in building predictive models for drivers’ subjective evaluations. This study provides practical recommendations for selecting eye movement features and implementing personalized automated lane-change systems through eye movement monitoring. Future research will focus on expanding the dataset, improving predictive model performance, and exploring the application of these models.},

For example, methods based on time series analysis perform well in short-term traffic prediction, and neural networks show strong capabilities in processing complex nonlinear relationships within traffic data. However, previous studies also have the following two limitations: 1) a large amount of complex traffic data will increase the complexity of the model during training and further reduce the accuracy of the training results; 2) the large-scale distribution of traffic data leads to incomplete model training and data security issues. To address these issues, we propose a Formal Concept-enhanced Federated Graph Convolutional Network (FC-FedGCN), which adopts formal concept analysis to fully mine graph data and improve the training accuracy of the GCNs model. Under federated learning, the GCNs model can be trained independently on different clients, and the local model is optimized by sharing model parameters. Coupled with the premise of protecting data privacy, the integrity of the data is guaranteed and the training accuracy of the GCNs model is improved. We compare our model with various baseline models based on the PEMS datasets, and the results demonstrate that FC-FedGCN has significant advantages in traffic prediction, outperforming the comparison methods in multiple indicators.},

Previous trajectory prediction methods face two common problems: 1. ignoring the joint modeling of pedestrians’ complex spatial-temporal interactions, and 2. suffering from the long-tail effect, which prevents accurate capture of the diversity of pedestrians’ future movements. To address these problems, we propose a Deformable Spatial-Temporal Interaction Graph Convolution Network (DSTIGCN). First, we construct a spatial graph and employ the attention mechanism to preliminarily describe the spatial interactions of pedestrians at each moment. To solve problem 1, we design a deformable spatial-temporal interaction module. The module autonomously learns the spatial-temporal interaction relationships of pedestrians through the offset of multiple asymmetric deformable convolution kernels in both spatial and temporal dimensions, thereby achieving joint modeling of complex spatial-temporal interactions. Next, we obtain trajectory representation features through graph convolution and then predict the two-dimensional Gaussian distribution parameters of future trajectories using the Temporal Attention-Gated Temporal Convolution Network (TAG-TCN). To address problem 2, we introduce Latin hypercube sampling to sample the two-dimensional Gaussian distribution of future trajectories, thereby improving the multi-modal prediction effect of the model under limited samples. Experiments on ETH, UCY, and SDD datasets have verified that our method can achieve high-precision prediction of pedestrian future trajectories under limited parameters.},

Recent studies have shown the significant advantages of the wheel-mounted inertial measurement unit (Wheel-IMU)-based dead reckoning system. However, it still drifts over extended periods because of the absence of external correction signals. To achieve the goal of long-term accurate localization, we propose Wheel-GINS, a Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS)/inertial navigation system (INS) integrated navigation system using a Wheel-IMU. Wheel-GINS fuses the GNSS position measurement with the Wheel-IMU via an extended Kalman filter to limit the long-term error drift and provide continuous state estimation when the GNSS signal is blocked. Considering the specificities of the GNSS/Wheel-IMU integration, we conduct detailed modeling and online estimation of the Wheel-IMU installation parameters, including the Wheel-IMU leverarm and mounting angle and the wheel radius error. Experimental results have shown that Wheel-GINS outperforms the traditional GNSS/Odometer/INS integrated navigation system during GNSS outages. At the same time, Wheel-GINS can effectively estimate the Wheel-IMU installation parameters online and, consequently, improve the localization accuracy and practicality of the system.

This study proposes three novel prediction and feedback assisted evolutionary algorithms (PFAEAs) to address the urban traffic signal scheduling problem (UTSSP) with minimizing vehicle delays. First, we construct a mathematical model of UTSSP and design an improved evolutionary algorithm (EA) framework that integrates an eight-phase control strategy based on a vehicle movement relationship graph. Then, by combining a back-propagation neural network (BPNN) and meta-heuristics, we improve the prediction accuracy of the vehicle turning rate for generating high-quality initial solutions. Further, 12 problem-specific search operators (PSSOs) are designed to enhance the exploration capability of EA. Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms, especially the Q-learning and Sarsa algorithms, are employed to select premium PSSOs dynamically for guiding the search direction of EA. Finally, for 18 cases with different scales, the proposed PFAEAs show significant advantages in reducing vehicle delays compared with the state-of-the-art algorithms.

  abstract     = {In a parts-to-picker system, robots move racks from the storage area to picking stations where pickers pick products from the racks. This paper proposes an Order Processing and Robot Scheduling Problem (OPRSP), which optimizes order allocation, rack selection, and robot scheduling together. A mixed integer programming model is developed for OPRSP to minimize the system completion time of fulfilling a given set of customer orders. In OPRSP, customer orders are reorganized into multiple order batches, each allocated to a picking station and treated as an aggregated order. A multi-station visit policy is employed to allow one rack carried by a robot to visit multiple picking stations. A variable neighborhood search-based algorithm is proposed to solve OPRSP. Seven neighborhood structures are specifically devised for OPRSP. Some heuristic algorithms, including order batching algorithm, rack selection algorithm, order batch allocation algorithm, robot task assignment algorithm, and robot scheduling algorithm, are newly devised for initial solution generation and neighborhood structures. The superior performance of the proposed method is validated through a series of experiments and comparisons with other approaches. Experiments reveal that compared to optimizing robot scheduling only, integrating robot scheduling with order processing decisions can greatly improve picking efficiency.},

  abstract     = {In the field of multi-intersection signal control, Reinforcement Learning (RL) has demonstrated significant technical benefits in terms of optimization speed, stability, and scalability. Moreover, Graph Neural Networks (GNN) exhibit strong functional abilities in capturing multi-agent and multi-task relationships within non-Euclidean spaces, surpassing other models in these regards. However, existing algorithms based on homogeneous graph neural networks struggle to encapsulate the heterogeneous nature of traffic object. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel algorithm, termed the Heterogeneous Graph Attention Network (HGAT) and Multi-Agent RL (MARL)-based Method for Multi-Intersection Traffic Signal Control. HGAT-MARL establishes a heterogeneous graph model to explicitly represent the states of various traffic objects in the road network. Leveraging a graph attention model, it learns and aggregates traffic state data within intersections and their proximate adjacent intersections, thereby capturing the mechanism of information transfer among diverse object such as vehicles and intersections. Subsequently, within the multi-agent RL framework, agents collaborate by sharing global states and rewards among multi-intersection, actively exploring and refining the optimal control policy to achieve optimized control of global traffic flow. Experimental results on real-world traffic datasets demonstrate that HGAT-MARL exhibits significant advantages in reducing vehicle travel time.},

  abstract     = {Vehicular platoon, a cutting-edge technology in the realm of intelligent transportation systems, holds the promise of transforming vehicle operations on roadways. By fostering seamless communication among vehicles and leveraging advanced automation, vehicular platoon enables vehicles to travel closely together, thereby reducing aerodynamic drag, optimizing fuel consumption, and improving road safety. However, due to their open and highly dynamic characteristics, the existing platoon communication schemes face efficiency and privacy challenges. These challenges stem from a substantial overhead on the Trusted Authority (TA) and vehicle sides during platoon communication, and a lack of multi-dimensional privacy preservation (e.g., identity privacy, location privacy, attribute privacy, and reputation value privacy) for platoon vehicles. To overcome these challenges, in this paper, we propose an efficient and multi-dimensional privacy-preserving platoon communication (EMPPC) scheme. Specifically, platoon formation is cloud-assisted and relies on the location, attribute, and reputation value of vehicles. We introduce a secure reputation value ciphertext comparison (SRCC) protocol during platoon leader selection, and present an attribute verification and matching (AVM) algorithm during platoon followers matching. Theoretical analysis and simulation evaluation demonstrate that the EMPPC scheme can offer multi-dimensional privacy preservation, and it is secure and efficient for platoon communication.},

  abstract     = {Human-driven Vehicles (HVs) and Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) will inevitably coexist in the future, resulting in mixed traffic conditions. Modeling car-following behavior in such mixed traffic is crucial for better understanding the differences in driving behavior between AVs and HVs, thereby facilitating the development of AV driving strategies to enhance traffic safety. In such mixed traffic, the car-following modes typically include AVs following HVs, HVs following HVs and HVs following AVs. Previous studies have compared the driving behavior of HVs following HVs and HVs following AVs, but few have considered the driving behavior of AVs following HVs in the comparison. To bridge this gap, this paper first decomposes car-following events in mixed traffic extracted from a Lyft level-5 dataset into driving primitives using the Hidden Markov Model with Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM-HMM). Then, the Latent Dirichlet Allocation with GMM (GMM-LDA) is introduced to cluster the driving primitives into different car-following behavior patterns. Based on the identified patterns, the differences across the three car-following modes are further explored. The results show that the driving behavior under three car-following modes differs from each other. Specifically, compared to the HVs following HVs mode, in the AVs following HVs mode, AVs tend to maintain car-following behavior patterns with a longer distance gap and adopt a lower speed to ensure safety. This study offers a comprehensive understanding of car-following behavior in mixed traffic, which will facilitate the development of human-like driving strategies for AVs and enhance the safety of mixed traffic.},

  abstract     = {A lane-changing decision system based on improved Stackelberg Game and traffic flow information is proposed. The system consists of three parts: Lane-Changing Demand Assessment, Lane-Changing Condition Assessment and Multi-Lane Game Model. In Lane-Changing Demand Assessment, a lane-changing demand function considering the urgency and potential of lane change is proposed and traffic flow information is used as input to make assessment more forward-looking. Lane-Changing Condition Assessment is developed to assess the feasibility of lane change. Existing game models determine players before the game starts, but in multi-lane scenarios, they cannot determine in advance who will participate in the game. Inclusion of unrelated players will cause the game to collapse. To solve the problem of multi-lane game, we propose a new mechanism to improve the Stackelberg Game, and develop Multi-Lane Game Model based on the improved Stackelberg Game. The mechanism changes the classical game structure and determines actual players halfway through the game, which expands the application scope of game theory in the field of lane change. Additionally, a classifier is designed to incorporate driving style into Multi-Lane Game Model for enhancing its personalization. To verify the performance of the lane-changing decision system, three experiments were carried out. The results indicate that by considering traffic flow information, the assessment of lane-changing demand becomes more forward-looking, thereby avoiding unnecessary lane changes. By comparing with human drivers, it’s found that the decision-making of our system is more rational and reliable, mitigating the risks caused by the irrational decision-making of human drivers.},

Firstly, a data mining mechanism was developed to extract comprehensive ship following data from the 2022 Arctic AIS dataset, enabling a comprehensive analysis of ship-following behavior. Then, Sea Ice Thickness (SIT) and Sea Ice Concentration (SIC) data are extracted and spatiotemporally linked to the ship following data to reveal the influence of sea ice on the ship following speed and distance within formations. Finally, a quantitative analysis of ship following speeds and distances under varying ice conditions were analyzed. A total of 76 formations are recorded, with formations involving icebreaker being more common, predominantly from January to May in the central Kara Sea and southeast East Siberian Sea. Results revealed that SIT mainly affects ship following speed, while SIC predominantly influences following distance, with significant negative correlations observed in formations with or without an icebreaker. This research elucidates the ship formation characteristics and the influence of sea ice on ship following behavior, providing theoretical guidance for safe formation in the Arctic waters.},

We present an outdoor navigation assistive system that collaborates with infrastructure to address these limitations. Our system includes an RGB-D inertial sensor, GPS sensor, Jetson Orin NX 16GB, and bone-conduction headphones. It improves localization accuracy through semantic segmentation, depth map enhancement (Depth-Decoder), and a prior map. The proposed semantic segmentation convolutional neural network (CNN) is designed to operate on low-compute devices, achieving competitive performance with 71.2 mean Intersection of Union (mIoU) on the Cityscapes and 74.46 mIoU on the Camvid. It operates at 209 frames per second (fps) with $480\times 848$ image resolution on the GTX 1080 desktop and 50 fps on the low-compute Jetson. Additionally, our Depth-Decoder enhances raw depth maps using geometrical loss with semantic segmentation constraints and structure-from-motion. Depth-Decoder demonstrated an average deviation of 0.66m compared to 2.23m from raw depth maps for landmarks within 10m. Notably, the outcomes of both CNNs are inferred from a single RGB image. Two visually impaired individuals assessed the technology. Participant S001 completed 6/8 trials and S002 completed 7/7 trials. Infrastructure collaboration is demonstrated by using existing prior maps and by dynamically adjusting paths based on real-time information from sensing nodes, to avoid collisions with oncoming agents not visible with the wearable camera. This research provides fundamental design principles for future outdoor navigation assistive technologies, offering insights into addressing challenges for people with visual impairment and other vulnerable road users.},

  abstract     = {The integration of intelligent transportation systems (ITS) within the smart grid has significantly enhanced the reliability, efficiency, and security of vehicle-to-grid (V2G) services over the past decade, leading to increased research interest in this technology. Charging stations (CSs) utilize electric vehicles (EVs) to manage demand response and provide sustainable energy solutions. However, the transmission of information between EVs and CSs via public channels causes critical security vulnerabilities. Although much effort has been made to overcome the challenge of protecting security and privacy in V2G environments, these efforts have either been proposed based on a centralized architecture or do not ensure essential security requirements, such as self-sovereignty, reliable, and blockchain scalability. Furthermore, in decentralized network, it is difficult to provide reliable energy distribution because a malicious participant can easily try to inflate trading volumes and manipulate energy prices. In this paper, we propose a new blockchain-enabled, reliable, privacy-preserving scheme using decentralized identifiers (DIDs) for preventing energy wash trading in V2G networks called BAPS-DITS. BAPS-DITS guarantees to tackle the above challenges without a trusted third-party intervention. Additionally, we use informal and formal (mathematical) analysis to prove the security of BAPS-DITS and conduct a comparative analysis comparing the security properties, computational cost, and communication cost of BAPS-DITS to previous studies. Furthermore, we implement BAPS-DITS on a practical Ethereum network, demonstrating its efficiency and feasibility, showing that BAPS-DITS provides self-sovereignty, accountability, and blockchain scalability; thus, it is suitable for actual V2G environments.},

  abstract     = {In the intelligent transportation system, the collected traffic data are usually incomplete. The low-rank completion models are effective in processing missing traffic data (MTD) imputation. However, the existing low-rank completion models encounter the following challenges: 1) Incorporating spatio-temporal information of traffic data often leads to significant time overhead; 2) To reduce the time overhead, some models based on the low-rank completion only embed the temporal information and discard the spatial information, thereby resulting in low imputation accuracy; 3) Missing traffic data carries complex spatio-temporal information, requiring multi-faceted analysis to extract valuable insights. To address these issues, we propose an efficient fourth-order dimension preserved tensor completion (FDPTC) with temporal constraint model. It works based on our proposed fourth-order dimension preserved (FDP) tensor decomposition model to capture the spatio-temporal information of traffic data from a high-dimensional perspective by extending dimensions. Additionally, we embed a temporal constraint into FDP tensor decomposition model to ensure consistency of MTD and introduce a non-negative constraint to accelerate convergence speed. By constructing this model, we successfully avoid direct operations on the extra information matrix/tensor, thereby optimizing efficiency. Experimental results on four real traffic datasets demonstrate that our proposed model achieves significantly higher imputation accuracy at an affordable computational burden compared with state-of-the-art models.},

  abstract     = {In complex traffic environments, the driving performance of the leader vehicle in a platoon can be greatly impacted by sudden and unexpected changes in vehicle acceleration rates. This phenomenon is known as unknown jerk dynamics (JDs), and it can lead to more extreme car-following behaviors (CFBs) in platoon tracking control, which may raise safety and traffic capacity issues. To tackle these concerns, this work studies cooperative platoon tracking control and intermittent optimization problems for connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs) with unknown reaction time delays (RTDs) using a nonlinear car following model (NCFM). In a free-design but directed communication network, we assume that the leader CAV’s external inputs have unknown but bounded parameters both for the JDs and RTDs, while only a small number of nearby follower CAVs are aware of the leader CAV’s acceleration signals. To solve these issues, we consider that each follower CAV implements a distributed observer law, which provides a reference signal stated as an estimated JD of the leader CAV. Then, a distributed platoon tracking control protocol is proposed to construct cooperative tracking controllers with identical inter-vehicle constraints (ICs). This maintains the desired safety distance between the CAVs and allows each follower CAV to track its leader CAV only through local information exchange. In addition, we present a robust intermittent optimization design and a novel intermittent sampling condition that can guarantee optimally scheduled feedback gains for the cooperative platoon tracking controllers to minimize the control cost in the presence of unknown JDs and RTDs under non-identical ICs. Simulation case studies are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approaches. We also demonstrate the efficient development of such a distributed cooperative car-following model for the platoon’s motion (or as an intelligent speed advising system for automated or human-driven vehicles), resulting in a trip that is safe, comfortable, and energy efficient.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, based on bidirectional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM) neural network, a resilient partial form dynamic linearization data-driven integral sliding mode control (PFDL-DDISMC) method is designed to realize the trajectory tracking for unmanned marine vehicles (UMVs) under deny-of-service (DoS) attacks and false data injection (FDI) attacks in the measurement channel. First, the generalization error bound of the Bi-LSTM, which is related to the number of samples and the bounds of the weight matrices, is proved through Rademacher complexity analysis. A Bi-LSTM-based intelligent predictor is designed to predict the position and velocity of UMVs and to estimate external disturbances. Based on this, a threshold-based attack detection and compensation scheme is proposed to determine whether the UMVs are suffering from attacks and to compensate for the compromised transmission signals. Furthermore, considering the bounds of the generalization errors of predictions, a resilient secure controller is designed using the compensation data from the proposed compensation mechanism and a data-driven discrete-time integral sliding mode control method. Compared with the data-driven control scheme, the UMVs with proposed PFDL-DDISMC can exhibit more effective trajectory tracking performance under disturbances and hybrid attacks. Theoretical analysis verifies that the proposed PFDL-DDISMC method ensures the stability of the tracking error system for UMVs subjected to hybrid attacks and external disturbances. Finally, three simulation examples are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed resilient PFDL-DDISMC scheme and the convergence of the tracking error.},

  abstract     = {Public transportation electrification stands as a crucial strategy in combating climate change and reducing carbon emissions. However, due to short driving ranges and limited charging resources, it becomes imperative to collectively optimize the battery electric bus (BEB) fleet, charging schedules, and charging infrastructure to enhance system efficiency. This study proposes an electric bus system optimization method considering vehicles to charging guns compatibility and multi-gun fast charging, in which BEBs can be charged by multiple charging guns simultaneously. Firstly, we establish a mixed integer programming model to minimize the total costs of the BEB transit system, including the purchase costs of charging guns, fleet composition costs, and electricity costs. Then, to accelerate the solving speed, a dual extended column generation algorithm (DX-CG) is designed to solve the model. Finally, the proposed model and algorithm are validated by the bus network in Nanjing, China. The results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms traditional column generation (CG) algorithms and CPLEX in both solution time and quality. Compared with the baseline solution, the total costs are reduced by 6.79%, and the utilization rate of charging facilities increases by 30.30%, verifying the effectiveness of the proposed method. The findings in this study provide practical guidance on BEB charging scheduling and promote the sustainable development of bus transit systems.},

  abstract     = {Effective multi-intersection collaboration is crucial for mitigating urban traffic congestion through reinforcement learning (RL)-based traffic signal control (TSC). Existing work mainly considers scenarios involving a single vehicle type, where cooperation is typically limited to neighboring intersections. However, in urban traffic scenarios where high priority vehicles coexist with ordinary vehicles, considering only a limited number of neighboring nodes may be insufficient to ensure the swift passage of high priority vehicles while minimizing the impact on overall traffic efficiency. Therefore, we formulate the multiple intersections’ decision-making process in urban scenarios as a Markov game and propose a novel centralized cooperative RL framework called MATLIT to solve the game. Specifically, we adopt a multi-agent transformer (MAT)-based architecture that facilitates efficient global cooperation among intersections. The attention mechanism and auto-regressive process of the MAT effectively mitigate the curse of the dimensionality problem, which guarantees MATLIT to tackle large-scale traffic scenarios. Meanwhile, the stability and sequence action generation capacity of the MAT-based architecture is further enhanced by incorporating MAT with a gated mechanism. Furthermore, considering the inherent topological constraints in urban traffic scenarios, we utilize graph attention networks (GATs) to capture graph-structured mutual influences. Additionally, in response to the urban traffic scenarios with various types of high priority vehicles that have time-varying priorities, we integrate the soft actor-critic (SAC) algorithm to enhance the exploration capabilities of our framework, allowing it to learn robust strategies in heterogeneous traffic conditions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed MATLIT framework outperforms all baselines and can reduce high priority vehicles’ waiting time by 24.57% while reducing the average waiting time of all vehicles by 18.51% in realistic urban scenarios.},

  abstract     = {ETSI has considered a new set of services for the Release 2, which cannot be implemented using the single control channel. Therefore, it is necessary to regulate the operation of applications on multiple channels, what is called Multi-Channel Operation (MCO). In this case the interference from the first adjacent channel is not negligible and is recommended to manage it by congestion control mechanisms. We propose an elastic channel usage scheme for MCO, based on an optimal scheduler whose goal is to maximize the traffic on the channels while minimizing the adjacent channel interference generated by that load and controlling the congestion. We formulate the interference and congestion control as a constrained convex optimization problem and derive as solution a distributed algorithm called MINOS (MultI-chaNnel operation Optimal Scheduler). MINOS seamlessly work when vehicles have a different number of network interfaces available, and constraints and priorities can be set individually and dynamically, which provides flexibility to implement more sophisticated services on top of the framework. Our results show that MINOS effectively controls the congestion and reduces the interference, achieving an increased packet reception ratio across all channels and a higher allocated traffic, compared to other proposals.},

In this study, we propose an innovative unified multimodal LiDAR segmentation network, named Align and Blend (A2Blend for short), which skillfully integrates three representative forms of point clouds: point view, voxel view, and range view. The core innovation of A2Blend lies in addressing two primary tasks: Align and Blend. For the “Align” task, we have carefully designed a learnable cross-modal association module, whose core is a unique “Cross-Modal Triplet Alignment Loss” mechanism. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first application of such a mechanism in the field of LiDAR segmentation. This mechanism applies principles from contrastive learning, promoting the tight clustering of similar semantic groups both within and across modalities, while increasing the separation between dissimilar groups by expanding the distance between similar and dissimilar sample clusters in the feature space. This significantly enhances the discriminative power and representational capacity of the feature embeddings. For the “Blend” task, we propose a fusion strategy that integrates intragroup self-attention within modalities and intergroup self-attention across modalities. This approach combines key concepts from standard self-attention and cross-self-attention mechanisms to achieve more comprehensive multimodal fusion. The segmentation performance on two large-scale outdoor datasets and one indoor dataset surpasses that of most state-of-the-art algorithms.},

First, to realize the dynamic resource allocation between slices and users respectively to adapt to network dynamics, we propose a two-level dynamic resource management strategy based on the DT-assisted slicing architecture of IoV. Second, to guarantee the timeliness of user information transmission and realize the accuracy of the resource management strategy, we propose a DT satisfaction evaluation model including DT mapping granularity, DT timeliness, and resource residual rate to quantify the users’ satisfaction with their DTs association. Finally, we establish a joint optimization model for resource management and DT association to maximize system utility. To address the coupling between strategies, we split the optimization problem into service utility and information synchronization utility subproblems. In the service utility subproblem, we propose a Counterfactual Multi-Agents Twin-Actors Soft Actor-Critic (COMATASAC) algorithm, which can perform slice-level and user-level resource allocation and scheduling actions separately. In the information synchronization utility subproblem, we utilize the Branching Dueling Q-network (BDQ) algorithm to solve the dimensionality explosion problem, and implement the association policy between users’ DTs and servers.

Based on the direct F2F point-cloud association method, the same-plane points are associated among the LiDAR keyframes. Hence, the F2F plane-point BA measurement model can be constructed using the same-plane points. The LiDAR BA and the inertial measurement unit (IMU)-preintegration measurements are tightly coupled under the framework of factor graph optimization. Meanwhile, an effective adaptive covariance estimation algorithm for LiDAR BA measurements is proposed to improve the accuracy further. Exhaustive experiment results on public and private datasets demonstrate that BA-LINS yields superior accuracy to state-of-the-art methods. Compared to the baseline system FF-LINS, the absolute translation accuracy and state-estimation efficiency of BA-LINS are improved by 29.5% and 28.7%, respectively. Besides, the proposed adaptive covariance estimation algorithm exhibits notably improved accuracy and robustness.},

  abstract     = {Recently, graph reinforcement learning (GRL)-based methods have demonstrated superior performance in solving decision-making issues. However, existing GRL-based methods encounter challenges in adequately integrating driving environment information and accurately capturing vehicular interactions. Resolving these issues is crucial for enhancing the safety and efficiency of intelligent transportation systems. To address these challenges, this paper presents a novel multi-modal failure-aware graph representation (MM-FA-GR) approach. The objective is to enhance the completeness and stability of graph representation techniques in the GRL-based setting, thereby improving the decision-making performance of CAVs operating in mixed autonomy traffic. Initially, a risk assessment invariant feature extractor (RA-IFE) is introduced to efficiently and selectively aggregate vehicle driving features into the node feature matrix. Subsequently, a multi-modal interaction model (MIM) is developed to comprehensively represent the mutual effects among vehicles and construct a multi-dimensional adjacency matrix. Moreover, a dynamic failure model (DFM) is incorporated to assess the sensing and communication failures of CAVs, enhancing the model’s robustness in non-ideal driving environments. Finally, a GRL model is established to solve the optimized driving strategies for CAVs. The proposed MM-FA-GR method has large potential to advance the graph representation technology, thereby enhancing decision-making performance in mixed autonomy traffic and improving robustness in non-ideal driving conditions. Comprehensive experiments are conducted with three typical traffic scenarios. Results show that our proposed MM-FA-GR method outperforms several baselines regarding safety, efficiency, and stability, highlighting the effectiveness of the core components within the proposed method. Moreover, the quantitative experiment validates the generalization capability of the proposed method in addressing the decision-making challenges of CAVs across diverse scenarios and traffic densities.},

  abstract     = {3D object detection is a fundamental yet critical task for autonomous driving. In this paper, we investigate a novel self-distilling paradigm by proposing Self-distilling Introspective Data (SID) to boost the accuracy of 3D object detection in both LiDAR-based and LiDAR-Camera-based scenarios. The proposed SID significantly improves the applicability of the distillation approach since it does not require extra training data or complex teacher network design. Specifically, we first employ an introspective data augmentation method to enrich object-aware information in sparse point clouds through geometric or semantic injection. We then utilize this enhanced data to train a robust teacher model. In contrast to traditional distillation that relies on larger models to enhance the representations of smaller ones, the teacher model in SID shares the same architecture as the student model but exhibits exceptionally high discriminative ability. This enables the effective transfer of rich feature representations to the student model. Rooted on such a scheme, when conducting LiDAR-based detectors, SID significantly enhances the semantic representation capabilities of sparse point clouds. Additionally, in the LiDAR-Camera-based setting, SID also effectively supervises the fusion of the two modalities at the feature level, ensuring more reasonable cross-modal learning. Extensive experiments show the proposed SID improves a variety of detectors. For the LiDAR-based detector, the SID gains 2.31% mAP improvements for the hard objects in KITTI, while 1.76% NDS improvements on nuScenes. For the LiDAR-Camera-based detectors, the SID boosts the detection accuracy significantly, with 1.5% mAP promotion on KITTI and 2.15% NDS improvements on the nuScenes benchmark.},

  abstract     = {The global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) are crucial for applications such as traffic monitoring, intelligent transportation systems and advanced driver assistance systems; however, they are prone to large deviations or even failures in hidden scenarios such as urban canyons and tunnels. In this paper, we investigate a system based on distributed arrays for positioning and tracking of multiple vehicles as a supplement to the GNSS. Conventional tracking methods often assume a constant signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) across arrays; however, this assumption does not hold in dynamic, dense traffic or signal-obstructed areas where variable SNR conditions frequently arise. To address this, this paper proposes two adaptive passive position tracking methods utilizing distributed sparse arrays, which are robust to variations in SNR and capable of maintaining reliable tracking performance. The first method relies on the extended Kalman filter (EKF) algorithm, while the second employs the unscented Kalman filter (UKF) algorithm. A novel tracking system model is developed, including a multi-target state transfer equation and a fused signal equation. The unknown noise covariance and signal covariance of the fused signal are estimated using vectorization and least squares methods, respectively. Prior state information and minimum mean square error estimation are incorporated to address unknown signal challenges within the EKF and UKF frameworks. Additionally, the posterior Cramér-Rao bound provides a performance benchmark, underscoring the robustness of the proposed methods. Computer simulation studies and practical tests show that the proposed methods significantly improve computational efficiency and tracking performance in vehicle tracking, demonstrating high adaptability to noise variations compared to traditional methods.},

  abstract     = {Timely detection and treatment of road cracks are crucial to prevent further deterioration of pavement. An accurate road crack detection algorithm can significantly reduce the human resources required for pavement maintenance. However, existing CNN-based object detectors, such as the You Only Look Once (YOLO) series of algorithms, face challenges such as receptive field fixation and information loss during feature extraction, resulting in lower accuracy in road crack detection. Therefore, we propose the Selective Dynamic Feature Compensation-YOLO (SDFC-YOLO) algorithm for pavement distress detection. Firstly, we introduce the Dynamic Downsampling Module (DDM), which adaptively adjusts the sampling positions of the convolutional kernel during the feature extraction process, addressing the issue of a fixed receptive field. Secondly, we propose a novel feature fusion method compensating for lost feature information in the path aggregation network. Lastly, we design a multi-scale weight selection module based on the above feature fusion method. It aims to utilize the channel weights of high-level features to guide bottom-level features and select more important features for compensation, thereby further enhancing detection accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that compared to the benchmark model YOLOv8s, our method improves Precision (P), Recall (R), mean Average Precision@0.5 (mAP@0.5), and F1 score on the UAPD dataset by 6.8%, 2.4%, 5.3%, and 4.3%, respectively. Similarly, on the UAV-PDD2023 dataset, the aforementioned metrics are enhanced by 3.1%, 4.4%, 2.7%, and 3.8%, respectively. Furthermore, our method takes only 10.53ms to process a $1280\times 1280$ resolution image, which fully meets the requirement of real-time detection.},

Additionally, a combination of random forests and linear regression is employed to model the relationship between Chargco electricity and hydrogen loads and their selling prices. Finally, we propose an Improved L-Shaped Decomposition (ILSD) algorithm to solve our stochastic MILP. Our ILSD algorithm not only addresses infeasibilities through an innovative approach but also incorporates warm starts, valid inequalities and multiple generation cuts, thereby reducing computational complexity. Numerical experiments illustrate the Chargco trading using our proposed stochastic MILP and its solution algorithm.},

  abstract     = {Blockchain-based Vehicular Ad-hoc Network (VANET) is widely considered a secure communication architecture for a connected transportation system. With the advent of quantum computing, there are concerns regarding the vulnerability of this architecture against attack algorithms implemented in a quantum computer. In this study, a potential threat is investigated in a blockchain-based VANET with an impersonation attack utilizing Shor’s algorithm implemented in a quantum computer. Specifically, the impersonation attack using Shor’s algorithm is created by compromising the Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA) encrypted digital signatures of VANET, and thus a threat to the trust-based blockchain scheme of VANET is successfully established. We implemented an integrated simulation platform combining OMNET++, vehicles-in-network simulation (VEINS), and simulation of urban mobility (SUMO) traffic simulator. In addition, we incorporated vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication in OMNET++ using the extended INET library. An impersonation attack on a blockchain-based VANET is implemented using IBM Qiskit, which is an open-source quantum software development kit. The findings reveal that an impersonation attack is feasible on the Blockchain-based VANET, which compromises the trust chain of a blockchain-based VANET. This research highlights the need for a quantum-secured blockchain for VANET.},

  abstract     = {Conducting real-world train crash experiments is the most straightforward and effective method to research the train’s crashworthiness and enhance passive safety protection. As a non-contact measurement method, high-speed camera can efficiently capture the evolving motion patterns of trains under the high-speed states. Traditional data extraction methods rely on expert-based manual annotations, which are susceptible to factors such as illumination changes, scale variance, and shock debris. Inspired by the tremendous success of Deep Neural Networks in the computer vision community, we firstly collect 75 real-world train crash scenes and manually annotated them to form the Crash2024 dataset, enriching the community’s data resources. Moreover, we propose a novel Gradient-guided Joint representation loss with Adaptive neck Detection network (GJADet). At the macro level, we embed the adaptive module into the Path Aggregation Feature Pyramid Network, which combines multiple self-attention mechanisms to achieve scale-awareness, spatial-awareness, and task-awareness, improving the detector’s representation ability and alleviating the dense-small characteristics of the ‘point’ class without significant computational overhead. At the micro level, due to the extreme imbalance of ‘point’ class compared to other classes, we propose a gradient-guided joint representation classification loss to mitigate the long-tailed detection issue. Moreover, the classification and regression are joint representation to maintain consistency between training and inference phase. On the Crash2024, GJADet achieves the performance improvement of 3.5AP and significantly alleviate the accuracy loss problem for rare categories. Our code are open source at https://github.com/YanJieWen/GJADet-crash-pytorch.},

A continuous gain function is introduced, combining with finite-time performance function, a novel prescribed performance control (PPC) scheme is developed, which makes the tracking error tend to the prescribed region with different threshold within the user-defined time. Then, a new finite-time reaching law is proposed, based on which, an improved finite-time sliding mode platoon control algorithm is proposed. The suggested control strategy not only ensures the two stability indexes of the platoon system, i.e., finite-time individual vehicle stability and finite-time string stability, but also realizes the asymptotic convergence of the spacing tracking error. Eventually, numerical simulations are carried out, based on which, the feasibility of the proposed scheme are validated.},

We propose a hybrid approach that incorporates novel physics-based modalities, specifically incidence angle and material reflectance, into the learning model to generate more realistic intensity data. We test this methodology across two architectures: (i) U-NET (Convolutional Neural Network) and (ii) Pix2Pix (Generative Adversarial Network), using the SemanticKITTI and VoxelScape datasets.

  abstract     = {RGB-T semantic segmentation can effectively pop-out objects from challenging scenarios (e.g., low illumination and low contrast environments) by combining RGB and thermal infrared images. However, the existing cutting-edge RGB-T semantic segmentation methods often present insufficient exploration of multi-modal feature fusion, where they overlook the differences between the two modalities. In this paper, we propose an adaptive gated fusion network (AGFNet) to conduct RGB-T semantic segmentation, where the multi-modal features are combined via the gating mechanisms and the spatial details are enhanced via the introduction of edge information. Specifically, the AGFNet employs a cross-modal adaptive gated-attention fusion (CAGF) module to aggregate the RGB and thermal features, where we give a sufficient exploration of the complementarity between the two-modal features via the gated attention unit (GAU). Particularly, in GAU, the gates can be used to purify the features, and the channel and spatial attention mechanisms are further employed to enhance the two-modal features interactively. Then, we design an edge detection (ED) module to learn the object-related edge cues, which simultaneously incorporates local detail information from low-level features and global location information from high-level features. After that, we deploy the edge guidance (EG) module to emphasize the spatial details of the fused features. Next, we deploy the contextual elevation (CE) module to enrich the contextual information of features by iteratively introducing the sine and cosine functions. Finally, considering that the quality of thermal images is usually lower than that of RGB images, we progressively integrate the multi-level RGB encoder features with multi-level decoder features, thereby focusing more on appearance information. Following this way, we can acquire the final high-quality segmentation result. Extensive experiments are performed on three public datasets including MFNet, PST900 and FMB datasets, and the experimental results show that our method achieves competitive performance when compared with the 22 state-of-the-art methods.},

The method is designed to facilitate the occurrence of rare events and expedite the probability assessment process, thereby enabling rapid evaluation of the failure probability of deep reinforcement learning (DRL)–based end-to-end decision-making algorithms.

Experimental results indicate that our method maintains evaluation errors within 5%. Compared with the naive Monte Carlo method and other existing evaluation techniques, our approach significantly enhances evaluation accuracy, reduces variance, and improves confidence levels, while accelerating evaluation efficiency by 5-200 times.

To address such problems, this paper proposes a multi-stage control strategy for UVDS based on Internet of Things (IoT). The optimal decision is decided by utilizing four indicators: performance recovery efficiency, normal detection probability, operation cost, and economic benefit cost, respectively. The simulation results show that the proposed strategy improves the performance recovery efficiency by 12.1% and the normal detection probability by 3.9%, the operation cost declines by 58.4%, and the economic benefit cost by 75.9% compared with the general control strategy.},

Subsequently, we develop a novel hierarchical distributed multi-agent system (HDMAS), where the coordination problem among a DSO agent, EVA agents, and VG agents is transformed into an exchange problem and effectively solved in a distributed manner using the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). To address the charging issue for each EV, we propose a policy called deadline-differentiated threshold charging (DDTC), which ensures that the charging rate of EVs within each VG is solely determined by their VG threshold. Finally, we provide simulation results using an independently developed simulator for NEU-ITS (Northeastern University - Intelligent Transmission System) to demonstrate the effectiveness and applicability of our proposed model. The experimental results demonstrate that the algorithm’s complexity exhibits a linear relationship with the number of EVAs and VGs, while the complexity of the comparative models is linearly associated with the number of EVs.},

  abstract     = {We will apply dual three-phase permanent magnet synchronous motors (DTP-PMSM) to the road sensing unit of the steer-by-wire system to improve redundancy and fault tolerance performance, meeting the requirements of intelligent transportation systems. However, open circuit faults inevitably lead to periodic torque ripple, parameter mismatch, and current harmonics, which pose a huge threat to drivers and traffic participants. Therefore, this article proposes a dynamic balancing strategy that can operate stably under both motor health and fault conditions. Firstly, this strategy does not require diagnostic fault information, thereby fundamentally avoiding performance degradation caused by diagnostic accuracy, time, model reconstruction, and strategy switching. The torque control module (TCM) is based on adaptive iterative learning control with a forgetting factor, which achieves torque tracking and suppression of periodic ripple after faults. The current control module (CCM) is based on ultra local model free predictive current control and extended state observer to track current and suppress the effects of parameter mismatch and current harmonics. Based on the multi-variable multi-objective sliding mode extreme value search strategy, the internal parameters and external weights of the two modules are dynamically adjusted to achieve dynamic balance between health and fault operation of TCM and CCM. The experimental results show that this strategy effectively improves the robustness of the system in a healthy state and the fault tolerance performance in a faulty state, effectively suppressing the periodic torque ripple and current harmonics caused by faults.

  abstract     = {Optimizing the generalization performance of road surface crack models in practical applications represents a challenging task. Especially for thin and irregular cracks with random and expansive topologies, the loss functions used in current deep learning-based crack segmentation models are sensitive to single pixels, which tends to cause the model to overfit the training data, diminishing its generalization ability in real-world scenarios. Therefore, we take the loss function as a starting point and explore the introduction of proactive fault tolerance mechanisms into the training process of the crack segmentation model, which is called Proactive Fault Tolerance Loss (PFT Loss), to enhance the generalization capability of model in actual applications. Specifically, the PFT Loss function establishes correlations between the segmentation prediction pixels and the corresponding labeled pixels within the neighborhood window using Markov Random Fields (MRFs). The correlation is used as a reference for predicting relative shifts in segmented pixels. Proactive Fault Tolerance is performed on the loss between labeling and prediction to achieve a more natural and adaptive training method for crack segmentation. Full experiments are conducted on five public crack datasets and one self-constructed dataset. The experimental results indicate that the model trained with PFT Loss has better segmentation performance compared to other loss functions.},

  abstract     = {We propose a robust control method for vehicle platoons based on a unified spacing policy, which can be customized for different vehicles within the platoon. This spacing policy integrates the constant time headway (CTH) and constant spacing (CS) policies into a single framework with some modifications. The policy can be adjusted to resemble either a CTH-like or CS-like approach by simply tuning a weighting factor for each vehicle. To increase road throughput, the velocity difference between the current vehicle’s velocity and the preceding vehicle’s low-pass filtered velocity is introduced to the proposed policy. A second-order low-pass filter is used for the preceding vehicle’s velocity. As a result, the sliding variable for each vehicle’s spacing error only requires the current vehicle’s position, velocity, acceleration, and the preceding vehicle’s position and velocity, all of which can be measured by onboard sensors. This design reduces the platoon’s reliance on inter-vehicle communication. A predefined-time modification is introduced to eliminate nonzero initial conditions in spacing and velocity errors, thereby improving transient performance. The local controller for each vehicle is based on a third-order nonlinear system model that accounts for nonlinear disturbances and engine lag. A smoothed sliding mode robust controller is then designed for each vehicle to stabilize its spacing error. The input-to-state stability (ISS) property of the spacing error is established through rigorous theoretical analysis. Furthermore, we demonstrate the practical strong frequency domain string stability (PSFSS) of the entire vehicle platoon, focusing on signal oscillations along the platoon. Finally, extensive numerical studies are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

In UAV-assisted Data Time-Sensitive IoT (DTIoT), the Age of Information is a crucial metric assessing data freshness, measuring the elapsed time from traffic sensors to the base station. Optimizing flight trajectories of multiple UAVs to minimize AoI while adhering to energy constraints poses a significant challenge. Current research often employs deep reinforcement learning for UAV trajectory control. Nevertheless, managing multi-agent continuous trajectories in intricate DTIoT network environments faces obstacles due to sparse rewards, thus impeding the training of deep neural network-based control policies using traditional DRL techniques. In this paper, we propose a network-oriented hierarchical reinforcement learning (NO-HRL) to control the UAVs’ flight trajectory in DTIoT networks for minimizing the AoI. We devise a control policy leveraging a two-tier hierarchical DRL framework, with the upper tier determining the target and the lower tier executing it. We also introduce a decoupled sequential training approach to efficiently train the mutually dependent two-tier DRL network of NO-HRL. Experimental results demonstrate that our method excels in optimizing AoI for DTIoT compared to other baselines.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, vehicular communications have attached great interests in both academy and industry for its potential of promoting safety and autonomous driving. Unlike classical communication scenarios, in vehicular communications the optimal resource allocation must be accomplished in a real-time manner, in order to maximally reduce the response delay. This presents a substantial challenge for current machine learning based intelligent resource optimization methods which may be sample inefficient, especially when the problem space becomes extremely huge. In this study, we develop a fast reinforcement learning (RL) framework for the real-time resource optimization of vehicular communications, whereby the transmitting power and the accessing frequency channels need to be jointly allocated. The main concept of our new method is that it incorporates a sample efficient structured exploration mechanism in the action space, which firstly ignores the local exploitation but focuses on a randomized global exploration. Thus, our exploration-first method, in contrast to classical exploitation-first RL, can reconstruct the coarse-grained global landscape of a huge Q-table from only the few samples. This learned prior knowledge would remarkably accelerate the convergence of subsequent incremental learning process, by concentrating on the identified attentional subspace of the Q-table. As demonstrated by numerical results, our new method would reduce the time complexity or the response delay by around 10 folds. As such, our fast RL method would have the great potential to such challenging optimization problems whereby the acquisition of massive training samples is time demanding, which hence provides the great promise to the emerging vehicular networks.},

Since human drivers have distinctly different steering feel preferences and requirements, the personalized matching is essential for ensuring safety and comfort of human-vehicle collaboration. Therefore, this paper proposed a novel personalized steering feel design method based on the driver’s steering characteristics, utilizing steer-by-wire (SBW) vehicle as the platform. Specifically, the personalized steering feel was composed of conventional steering torque, customizable module and mechanical compensation. The conventional steering torque was calculated by a tire model. Then, the concept of road sense style was the first introduced as the basis for the design of the customizable module. Furthermore, a complete road sense style recognition system was put forward from the perspective of semi-supervised learning. The driver’s steering characteristics were collected and classified by k-means algorithm, and a generic road sense style recognition model was built and optimized through support vector machine with crow search (CS-SVM) method. The recognition results were integrated into the design of the personalized steering feel. In addition, a steering controller adopting sliding mode control (SMC) was designed to facilitate stable and rational steering maneuvers by drivers. Finally, driving experiments were performed. The results show that the designed steering feel can rapidly adapt to diverse drivers’ preferences, offering a more satisfying driving experience and improving overall safety.},

  abstract     = {The development of intelligent transportation has generated many ultra reliable low latency communication (URLLC) tasks, which require sufficient communication and computation resources for task offloading and processing. Although mobile edge computing (MEC) provides a promising solution, its efficiency is subject to the limited knowledge and analysis capability on the physical networks. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a digital twin (DT) empowered MEC framework to strengthen the MEC task offloading efficiency in cellular vehicle-to-everything (C-V2X) networks. Our proposed DT is constructed through a hybrid data-driven and model-driven approach to capture the realistic transportation network features. Then, DT leverages the metric of time to collision to predict vehicular safety levels and estimates the corresponding URLLC task requirements of future time slots. The prediction results are further utilized to make decisions on the URLLC resource reservation. Different from conventional studies, we consider the influence of DT’s inaccurate predictions (i.e., the prediction with error) on the resource allocations. Specifically, the inaccurate DT prediction results are considered as uncertain constraints of the resource reservation problem. A robust parameter from the robust optimization is adopted to adjust the tradeoff between the problem uncertainty and solution optimality degree. Further, we leverage the optimized resource reservation results to construct the task offloading problem. The problem is decoupled into two sub-problems of channel resource allocation and computation resource allocation, respectively. And a two-stage matching algorithm is developed to solve each sub-problem based on the resource reservation constraints. Finally, realistic road information is mapped into DT for simulations. Simulation results validate the advantages of our proposed approach by comparing with existing schemes.},

In this paper, (dis)charging behavior modelling and bidirectional charging station (BCS) deployment optimization are addressed, since they are crucial in EVEN for EV accommodation, renewable energy utilization, drivers’ profitability estimation, operators’ cost assessment, and financial policy establishment. A novel stochastic Markov (dis)charging behavior model is proposed to calculate the spatiotemporal load pattern considering the realistic factors such as personal features, state of charge (SoC), electricity price, and BCS locations. Unlike most works ignoring energy trading, six scenarios are explored: (S1) no trade; (S2) trade in main battery. (S3) trade in extra battery. (S4) trade in extra ultracapacitor; (S5) trade in both main and extra battery; (S6) trade in both main battery and ultracapacitor. Also, a multi-objective BCS deployment strategy is newly designed, aiming at minimizing installation cost and driver’s electricity bill, while quality of service (QoS) and voltage stability are ensured. An improved hybrid algorithm is developed, which combines hill climbing for enhanced exploitation and particle swarm optimization for better evolvement based on genetic algorithm framework. The simulation validates the fitting ability of charging model, the effectiveness of parameter selection algorithm and the deployment approach. Comparing 6 scenarios, benefits of energy trading in EVEN is confirmed and the superiority of ultracapacitor for trading is demonstrated. The feasibility of financial policies is also studied, and certain guidance is provided for drivers to improve their cost.},

However, this technology has primarily been explored on multi-lane divided highways, neglecting potential applications on two-lane undivided highways prevalent in rural areas. This paper addresses the challenges of deploying truck platooning on such highways, focusing on overtaking safety. We formulate safe overtaking via stochastic approximation as a feasibility problem. An algorithm is proposed to determine operational rules for truck platooning, considering factors including traffic flow, road segment geometry, and vehicle dynamics. Values for truck platooning operational parameters such as speed, inter-truck following gap, and number of trucks in platoon are decided which ensure overall overtaking safety. The algorithm is iterative and depends on first order information, avoiding possible complex computations of stochastic objective with respect to truck platooning operational parameters. The algorithm is general and adapts to different roadway and traffic conditions and weights on platooning parameters. We show that computation of the algorithm is linear in sample size used in approximation. Simulations show that the algorithm-generated platooning rules offer an overtaking safety guarantee of up to 93% on a straight and flat road segment with sparse traffic.},

  abstract     = {Existing arterial signal coordination predominantly adopts physical traffic performance indicators or alternative progression bandwidth as optimization objectives, which lack a constraint mechanism between traffic efficiency and the environmental impacts associated with signal parameters. This study proposes a novel arterial ecosignal coordination approach to minimize gas emissions, energy consumption, and passenger delays by leveraging vehicle trajectory data. Initially, a vehicle kinematic analytical model incorporating driving behavior is developed to extract second-by-second individual vehicle trajectories. Through the analysis of micro-trajectory data and comparison with the evaluation metrics from VISSIM simulator, the model is validated to accurately simulate vehicle operating conditions. Subsequently, an exact ecological cost unit, encompassing gas emissions, fuel consumption, and delays for all vehicles by explicitly accounting for both electric and conventional fuel vehicles, is calculated based on the trajectory data. This cost unit is then selected as the objective function of the optimization problem, which is formulated as a bi-level model. Numerical experiments on a five-intersection arterial segment demonstrate that the proposed ecosignal coordination can significantly enhance environmental benefits at the cost of a small amount of delay growth compared to existing methods.},

  abstract     = {The Internet of Vehicles (IoV) has become a key pillar in the future network system. However, intensive computing and task offloading required vehicles to compete for communication and computing resources, seriously affecting the systems time cost, robustness, and security. This paper focuses on solving resource management problems in the presence of interconnected multi-vehicles using shared information. We model this problem using a time-varying Markov decision process, addressing the challenges in task offloading for vehicles. The innovation lies in addressing different offloading scenarios, including vehicle-to-vehicle, vehicle-to-roadside unit (RSU) vehicle-to-multi-access edge computing (MAEC) server offloading, and vehicle-to-base station (BS). We propose a Quantum-inspired Dueling Deep Q-learning (QDDQL) algorithm to develop an Edge Intelligent (EI) offloading strategy. This method allows vehicles’ task offload to become an automated step based on network conditions and user status. The MAEC server offers computing offloading services, while the base station can submit offloading tasks to a cloud blockchain system. This innovative approach balances communication resource utilization, computational resource utilization, and transmission delay. Blockchain technology ensures transparency and security in resource allocation strategies, preventing edge nodes from making wrong decisions using consensus mechanism, and thereby improving the accuracy, timeliness, and security of resource allocation. Simulation results show that compared with existing methods, the proposed solution can significantly improve resource utilization, adaptability, and system scalability, and effectively address the defects of traditional methods.},

  abstract     = {Estimating traffic demand, or origin-destination (OD) matrices, is crucial for transport studies and smart city development. The main objective is to calculate an OD matrix based on available sources (e.g. link traffic counts obtained from traffic sensors) to accurately reproduce field data. A significant complication when using information obtained from traffic sensors, is that such sensors are subject to considerable disruptions impacting data quality and reliability. Despite the extensive study of efficient OD estimation, there is a considerable gap in detecting faulty measurements and identifying faulty sensors within the estimation procedure. This work presents a novel methodology for OD matrix estimation in the presence of faulty measurements. The path-based cell transmission model (CTM) is employed to capture traffic network dynamics within a specified time window, linking link densities with per-path densities and path demand. For the purposes of this work, traffic networks that operate under free-flow conditions are considered and the problem is formulated in an optimisation framework with two distinct variations: 1) no explicit formulation of potential faulty sensors and 2) explicit modelling of potential faulty sensors. Following, a fault-adaptive algorithm is constructed that identifies, isolates and corrects faults to achieve robust demand estimation. The methodology is tested on two realistic literature networks and shows great potential in terms of OD matrix estimation in the presence of faulty measurements. Simulation results underpin the advantage of the proposed approach in terms of performance in estimating quantities of interest as well as identifying the faulty sensors and their fault characteristics.},

  abstract     = {This paper proposes a Learning-Enhanced Adaptive Decision-Making (LEAD) framework for autonomous vehicles (AVs) focusing on dynamic merging scenarios. To capture the competitive and strategic nature of vehicle interactions, we develop an interaction behavior model based on non-cooperative game theory. The behavior is modeled as a dynamic game, where each vehicle optimizes its actions using a multifactorial reward function. To optimize the behavior model parameters, maximum entropy inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) is employed to acquire optimal matching parameters. Additionally, a behavioral decision-making framework LEAD adapted to dynamic environments is proposed. By establishing a mapping between environmental variables and behavior model parameters, it enables parameters online learning and recognition, and achieves interactive behavior probabilities of AVs. Quantitative analysis employing naturalistic driving datasets (highD and exiD) and real-vehicle test data validates LEAD’s high consistency with human decision-making. In 188 tested interaction scenarios, the average human-like similarity rate is 81.73%, with a notable 83.12% in the highD dataset. Furthermore, in 145 dynamic interactions, LEAD matches human decisions at 77.12%, with 6913 consistence instances. Moreover, in real-vehicle tests, a 72.73% similarity with 0% safety violations is obtained. Results demonstrate the effectiveness of our LEAD framework in enabling AVs to make informed, adaptive behavior decisions in interactive environments.},

However, existing path planning methodologies fall short of addressing this need due to their incapability to handle the diverse and complex parking scenarios in reality.

To leverage the strengths of both approaches, we introduce Hybrid pOlicy Path plannEr (HOPE). This novel solution integrates a reinforcement learning agent with Reeds-Shepp curves, enabling effective planning across diverse scenarios. HOPE guides the exploration of the reinforcement learning agent by applying an action mask mechanism and employs a transformer to integrate the perceived environmental information with the mask. To facilitate the training and evaluation of the proposed planner, we propose a criterion for categorizing the difficulty level of parking scenarios based on space and obstacle distribution. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms typical rule-based algorithms and traditional reinforcement learning methods, showing higher planning success rates and generalization across various scenarios. We also conduct real-world experiments to verify the practicability of HOPE. The code for our solution is openly available on https://github.com/jiamiya/HOPE.},

To address these challenges, we present MT-DyNN, a Multi-Teacher knowledge-distilled Dynamic Neural Network framework for instance-adaptive detection, optimizing detection accuracy and inference cost in autonomous driving. The framework’s student network comprises a customizable multi-branch residual detection network and a lightweight policy network. The former efficiently extracts multi-scale features in parallel without altering receptive fields, while the latter, depending on curriculum learning, captures task-relevant features and dynamically generates routing vectors to guide the activation or deactivation of residual blocks according to image instance complexity. The framework’s teacher network employs a soft-voting strategy to consolidate knowledge from multiple pre-trained teacher models, providing consistent guidance to the student. Within this distillation paradigm, the policy network’s routing search space is gradually refined, and the policy and detection networks are jointly fine-tuned to optimize the alignment between routing decisions and feature extraction. Experimental results on CIFAR and ImageNet demonstrate that compared to early exiting and stochastic depth methods, MT-DyNN achieves higher accuracy at the same inference cost and reduces the cost by 50% and 59% at comparable accuracy levels. The generated routing maintains channel sparsity across diverse scenarios.},

  abstract     = {In mixed autonomous driving environments, accurately predicting the future trajectories of surrounding vehicles is crucial for the safe operation of autonomous vehicles (AVs). In driving scenarios, a vehicle’s trajectory is determined by the decision-making process of human drivers. However, existing models primarily focus on the inherent statistical patterns in the data, often neglecting the critical aspect of understanding the decision-making processes of human drivers. This oversight results in models that fail to capture the true intentions of human drivers, leading to suboptimal performance in long-term trajectory prediction. To address this limitation, we introduce a Cognitive-Informed Transformer (CITF) that incorporates a cognitive concept, Perceived Safety, to interpret drivers’ decision-making mechanisms. Perceived Safety encapsulates the varying risk tolerances across drivers with different driving behaviors. Specifically, we develop a Perceived Safety-aware Module that includes a Quantitative Safety Assessment for measuring the subject risk levels within scenarios, and Driver Behavior Profiling for characterizing driver behaviors. Furthermore, we present a novel module, Leanformer, designed to capture social interactions among vehicles. CITF demonstrates significant performance improvements on three well-established datasets. In terms of long-term prediction, it surpasses existing benchmarks by 12.0% on the NGSIM, 28.2% on the HighD, and 20.8% on the MoCAD dataset. Additionally, its robustness in scenarios with limited or missing data is evident, surpassing most state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines, and paving the way for real-world applications.},

These applications pose challenges to onboard computation and energy resources. To address these issues, Vehicle Edge Computing (VEC) has been introduced as a novel computing paradigm. Given the rapid and frequent changes in the topology of VANET networks due to the highspeed movement of vehicles, most VANET applications adopt broadcast communication, except for a few employing unicast communication. However, traditional task offloading models struggle to support broadcast applications. Therefore, this paper proposes a VANET broadcast task model to offload tasks from On-Board Units (OBUs) to Road-Side Units (RSUs) for the first time. To meet the requirement of low latency, an efficient polynomial-time heuristic algorithm is further proposed. Numerical results demonstrate the outstanding performance of the algorithm, with all instances being solved in less than 6ms, which significantly surpasses the performance of existing solvers. Moreover, the solutions obtained from the algorithm exhibit gaps below 1%, indicating their high acceptability and applicability in practical VANET applications. Furthermore, extensive numerical experiments provide valuable insights into the practical implementation of task offloading, suggesting an appropriate ratio of 6 between the number of OBUs and RSUs.},

A co-simulation platform integrating Simulation of Urban Mobility (SUMO) and Webots was developed to serve as the driving simulator. A real-world roundabout in Ann Arbor, Michigan was built in the co-simulation platform as the study area, and merging scenarios were investigated. 36 participants were recruited and asked to navigate the roundabout under three aggressiveness levels (low, medium, and high) and three collision-warning designs (no-warning, 1-second-in-advance warnings, and 2-second-in-advance warnings). Experiment results indicate that advanced warnings can significantly enhance safety by minimizing potential risks compared to scenarios without warnings. Earlier warnings enable smoother driver responses and reduce abrupt decelerations. In addition, a personalized intent prediction model was developed to predict drivers’ stop-or-go decisions when the warning was displayed. Among all tested machine learning models, the XGBoost model achieves the highest overall prediction accuracy.},

A sample was collected with over 4,000 seconds of data of AS following a conventional car (human driver). The sample contained GPS positions from both AS and conventional vehicles. Latitude and longitude coordinates were used to calculate the speed, acceleration, and jerk of the leader and follower. The data analyses indicated that AS has higher jerk values that may impact the passengers’ comfort.

  abstract     = {Straight-right mixed lanes are common in urban signalized intersections. Right-turning vehicles during green light will conflict with pedestrians, increasing the risk to pedestrian safety. In addition, right-turning vehicles cannot pass the intersection during the red light, which seriously affects the saturation rate of the traffic flow. To solve the above problems, this paper proposes dynamic straight-right lane (DSRL) design scheme that is able to separate straight-through and right-turning vehicles in time and space. Based on the driving characteristics of right-turning vehicles, the operating rules for DSRL have been established. Combined with the intersection design, DSRL control strategy is proposed under the linkage of intersection traffic light and pre-signals. By studying the pedestrian crossing characteristics, the conflict between right-turning vehicles entering the intersection and crossing pedestrians is analyzed under the DSRL. Vehicle delays and traffic capacity are quantified under the DSRL on the basis of vehicle operating rules. The vehicle delay model is tested using SUMO simulation software to prove the validity of the model proposed in this paper. Finally, the simulation environment based on real intersections was set up using MATLAB and sensitivity analyses of the main impact parameters were carried out. It has been experimentally demonstrated that the DSRL not only effectively reduces the delay of both straight-through and right-turning vehicles, but also improves the actual capacity of the lane. In addition, the DSRL reduces conflicts between right-turning vehicles and pedestrians crossing the street. The experimental results can effectively prove that the DSRL can improve the traffic efficiency of vehicle and ensure the safety of pedestrians.},

  abstract     = {As the adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) within electrified road networks (ERNs) continues to grow, the criticality of fast-charging stations (FCSs) to support this growth and alleviate range anxiety for EV users is increasingly evident. Due to the complex operating environment of FCSs, their reliable, safe operation faces significant challenges, from exposure to natural disasters, deliberate attacks, and technical failures. This leads to the need to analyze the vulnerability of FCSs within ERNs. This paper provides a mathematical framework to assess the vulnerability of the ERN to intentional attacks and identify critical FCSs within ERNs. We propose a System Optimal Dynamic Mixed Traffic Flow Assignment Model (SODTA) game-theoretical for an ERN where electric and fuel vehicles coexist. Building upon this model, an attacker-defender (AD) framework is established for assessing the vulnerability of FCSs within the ERN. We transform this AD problem into a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) one to solve it efficiently. Two indices are proposed to evaluate the vulnerability and the reallocation of charging loads within the ERN. Finally, we apply the proposed framework to conduct a vulnerability assessment of the ERN in North Carolina, USA. The key findings are as follows: 1) As the EV penetration increases, the studied ERN becomes more vulnerable to attacks. 2) With limited attack resources, mitigating performance losses over time is possible through charging load redistribution. 3) Variation in overall vulnerability levels with increasing attack resources reveals distinct patterns, ranging from mitigable to unmitigable vulnerability.},

  abstract     = {In the backdrop of an increasingly pressing need for effective urban and highway transportation systems, this work explores the synergy between model-based and learning-based strategies to enhance traffic flow management by use of an innovative approach to the problem of ramp metering control that embeds Reinforcement Learning (RL) techniques within the Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework. The control problem is formulated as an RL task by crafting a suitable stage cost function that is representative of the traffic conditions, variability in the control action, and violations of the constraint on the maximum number of vehicles in queue. An MPC-based RL approach, which leverages the MPC optimal problem as a function approximation for the RL algorithm, is proposed to learn to efficiently control an on-ramp and satisfy its constraints despite uncertainties in the system model and variable demands. Simulations are performed on a benchmark small-scale highway network to compare the proposed methodology against other state-of-the-art control approaches. Results show that, starting from an MPC controller that has an imprecise model and is poorly tuned, the proposed methodology is able to effectively learn to improve the control policy such that congestion in the network is reduced and constraints are satisfied, yielding an improved performance that is superior to the other controllers.},

  abstract     = {Intelligent transportation systems are at risk of data misuse. Watermarking data that needs to be opened and shared can mitigate this problem, i.e., embedding signals into generated images, which are imperceptible to humans. Regardless of the shape of the image or any potential attacks it may undergo, the watermark can be detected by algorithms when needed. However, many watermarking schemes fail to resist attacks like cropping and translation, limiting their applicability in the intelligent transportation domain. To tackle these issues, we propose a dual watermarking framework based on Zernike moments for intelligent transportation systems, where a robust watermark and a periodic watermark are embedded in different planes of the cover image. Specifically, we propose a single-circle model (SCM) where Zernike moments are locally computed based on a circle centered at the image center with a radius proportional to image size for embedding the robust watermark. Since SCM is determined by measuring its center and radius, SCM is applicable to images of various sizes and shapes. Then we employ a robust combination of discrete wavelet transform (DWT) and discrete cosine transform (DCT) watermarking algorithms to embed the periodic watermark. For watermark extraction, we propose an efficient adaptive correction mechanism (AC) to recognize attack types and automatically relocate the embedding position of the watermark. By combining the above strategies, our proposed scheme can adaptively resist various attacks (e.g., random cropping, translation), which addresses the shortcomings of most existing watermarking schemes. We test the watermark using over 300 images of different sizes and shapes, and the experimental results prove that our proposed scheme achieves stronger robustness against various distortions with better invisibility, outperforming the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.},

Consequently, we propose a very simple ray tracing model to analyze the multipath behavior of the channel. We also discuss the stationarity of the channel through the comparison of three state-of-the-art methods. Stationarity time values between 25 ms and 41 ms were obtained for a car moving slightly under the maximum allowed speed of 120 km/h. Taking stationarity into account, we computed the channel wideband parameters. Delay spread values of less than 10 ns were obtained when the link antennas were properly aligned. However, they can jump to more than 100 ns when a line-of-sight (LOS) component is not dominant due to the presence of discrete reflectors.},

  abstract     = {Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as an effective approach for signal control, and several studies attempt to apply RL to network-wide signal control problems. Most existing methods for network-wide signal controls simply apply the pretrained model independently to the network or simply expand the observation range for the neighbors. While several recent studies have proposed cooperative signal control models using multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) approaches, they have not considered the transferability of the policy. This issue becomes more critical in treating a multi-agent signal control problem, since there exist innumerable possibilities of data distributions for the demand patterns. Hence, this research aims to develop a transferable and cooperative multi-agent traffic signal control model. As the key idea, we propose a decentralized and communication-based MARL approach that considers the spatial correlation of traffic dynamics in the model design and employs a graph representation for the state. Three experiments in simulated environments of the Gangnam district in Seoul, South Korea are conducted to 1) validate the model, 2) assess the policy’s transferability, and 3) evaluate the efficiency of the multi-agent cooperation. The experimental results show that the proposed model obtains a transferable policy so that it adapts to the unexperienced demand scenario. In addition, it is concluded that the joint action of the proposed RL model cooperatively rebalances the traffic demands so that it improves the efficiency of the network-wide signal controls.},

To mitigate the effects of measurement error and actuation fault on coordinated train operation, this paper proposes a distributed fault-tolerant control strategy for the virtual coupling train system by the integration of moving horizon estimation (MHE) and model predictive control (MPC). Considering potential faults for virtually coupled trains during operation, a faulty model is developed to capture measurement errors and loss of actuator effectiveness. A fault-tolerant control strategy is designed that consists of two modules, i.e., fault estimation and fault-tolerant control. The MHE method is employed in the fault estimation module to estimate faults by solving a local quadratic optimization problem based on historical data. In the fault-tolerant control module, a reconfigured train tracking control problem is constructed under the MPC framework on the premise of real-time estimation. An accelerated alternating direction method of multipliers algorithm is further designed to embed with the fault-tolerant model predictive controller to calculate the control commands in a distributed manner. Numerical experiments are conducted and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

  abstract     = {Trajectory prediction is an essential component in autonomous driving, particularly for collision avoidance systems. Considering the inherent uncertainty of the task, numerous studies have utilized generative models to produce multiple plausible future trajectories for each agent. However, most of them suffer from limited representation ability or unstable training issues. To overcome these limitations, we propose utilizing the diffusion model to generate the distribution of future trajectories. Two cruxes are to be settled to realize such an idea. First, the diversity of intention is intertwined with the uncertain surroundings, making the true distribution hard to parameterize. Second, the diffusion process is time-consuming during the inference phase, rendering it unrealistic to implement in a real-time driving system. We propose an Intention-aware denoising Diffusion Model (IDM), which addresses the above two problems. We decouple the original uncertainty into intention uncertainty and action uncertainty and model them with two dependent diffusion processes. To decrease the inference time, we reduce the variable dimensions in the intention-aware diffusion process and restrict the initial distribution of the action-aware diffusion process, which leads to fewer diffusion steps. To validate our approach, we conduct experiments on the Stanford Drone Dataset (SDD) and the ETH/UCY dataset. Our methods achieve state-of-the-art results, with a minFDE of 13.83 pixels on the SDD dataset and 0.36 meters on ETH/UCY datasets. Compared with the original diffusion model, IDM reduces inference time by two-thirds. Interestingly, our experiments further reveal that introducing intention information is beneficial in modeling the diffusion process of fewer steps.},

  abstract     = {Due to the difficulties in data collection or data barriers, some crash types may not have sufficient data for analysis, i.e., data scarcity in task (DST). Furthermore, as in crash severity analysis, the number of serious injury or fatality crashes is usually much smaller than that of property damage or injury crashes, there exists class imbalance issue, i.e., data scarcity in class (DSC). To tackle the DST problem, as common crash severity knowledge may hide among cross-task crashes, cross-task crash severity analysis is proposed. Intuitively, by transferring the common crash severity knowledge from source task which contains sufficient crashes to assist the modelling in target task that suffers from DST problem, more effective target task crash severity model can be obtained. Meanwhile, to address the DSC issue, the cost-sensitive learning algorithm for unbiased modelling is adopted by which unequal cost values are assigned to the crashes with different severity levels. In this paper, we develop a cost-sensitive transfer graph convolutional network, where the advanced graph convolutional network is taken as the base learner to guarantee the effectiveness of crash severity analysis. The vehicle-pedestrian and vehicle-vehicle crash severity analysis in city of Seattle are taken as the target and source tasks, respectively. In comparison with eighteen state-of-the-art crash severity models, the proposed model can achieve at least 21.29%, 8.10% and 8.02% improvement in terms of overall summary score, Macro-F1 and Macro-Gmean, respectively. The significant contributing factors analysis also shows that the additional crash contributing factors can be identified, including not only common factors among cross-task data, but also new ground-truth factors of target task crash severity analysis.},

While trajectory prediction methods based on deep learning have achieved promising results, these data-driven models lack interpretability and transparency, making their reliable use a significant challenge. In this paper, firstly, an intention-aware spatial-temporal attention network-based trajectory prediction model is constructed, which considers the coupling of driving intention and the interaction with surrounding vehicles, extracts important feature information of vehicles in both temporal and spatial dimensions. Secondly, a vehicle trajectory prediction method via the integration of data-driven and knowledge-guided is proposed, considering both hard and soft constraints. A hard constraint of vehicle kinematics is incorporated into the intention-aware spatial-temporal attention network prediction model to generate physically feasible predicted trajectories and to make this part of the network structure have a human-understandable physical meaning. In addition, by leveraging knowledge related to traffic rules, an auxiliary loss function based on knowledge constraint penalties is designed as a soft constraint to optimize the training of the model and improve the interpretability of the training process. Finally, the proposed model is experimentally evaluated on the datasets and the prediction results are analyzed in terms of reliability and accuracy. The experimental results demonstrate that knowledge guidance effectively enhance the reliability and interpretability of the prediction, and improve the accuracy of long-term trajectory prediction.},

This method mainly includes two parts: the computation of vehicle cooperative state based on car-following model and the redesign of virtual vehicles. This paper also analyzes the stability of the mixed platoon composed of CHV and CAV, and obtains the conditions for the string stability of the mixed platoon. Simulation experiments demonstrate that the proposed method can overcome the problems caused by driver compliance in the collaborative process of the on-ramp area. Additionally, the proposed method has the advantages in reducing fuel consumptions and improving the comfort of drivers and passengers. The experiments based on SUMO platform show that the method can reduce traffic density and increase average speed, and that the improvement is more significant at lower CAV penetration rates.

However, due to high costs, most existing V2V studies focus on characterizing the vehicular channel theoretically and comparing it with simulation data or studying the empirical V2V channel in a specific scenario. In this work, we investigate the time variability of the received signal based on experimental data collected in an extensive measurement campaign at 5.9 GHz in a large set of propagation environments: urban-high traffic density, urban-low traffic density, suburban, highway, and rural environments. The time-variability of the received signal is characterized by time and frequency. The relationship between coherence time and the terminal velocity, coherence time and transmitter-receiver separation distance, and the relationship between Doppler spread and both effective velocity and separation distance, have been investigated. Furthermore, the correlation between coherence time and separation distance and effective velocity was investigated, as well as the correlation between Doppler spread and separation distance and effective velocity. The results provide a deeper understanding of the temporal variability of the channel and how it is influenced by factors such as traffic density, unique/multiple driving directions, terminal speed, separation distance, characteristics of the propagation environment, and visibility conditions. This knowledge is crucial for developing vehicular communication systems and can be applied to design strategies that reduce temporal variability in received signals.},

  abstract     = {Global localization can estimate geo-referenced locations (e.g., longitude and latitude), which is a fundamental capability for autonomous vehicles. Most existing solutions rely on the Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS). Their accuracy could be degraded by the multi-path effects or occlusions of GNSS signals in urban environments. Some GNSS-free methods could achieve global localization by comparing the current on-line sensory data with pre-built databases/maps. However, they require tedious human efforts to drive a vehicle to collect and maintain the databases/maps. Moreover, most of these methods use front-looking cameras or LiDARs, so the captured data could be easily contaminated by dynamic objects (e.g., moving vehicles and pedestrians). To provide a solution to these problems, this paper proposes a novel global localization method by comparing an image from a sky-looking fish-eye camera with the publicly available OpenStreetMap (OSM), and using particle filter to achieve real-time metric localization in dynamic traffic environments. To evaluate our method, we extend a public dataset with OSM data, which are retrieved through the given geo-referenced location information. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our method.},

  abstract     = {The performance improvement of perception algorithms and integrated validation of driving decision making remains challenging in the fields of computer vision and intelligent transportation systems. In this paper, we propose a novel vision-based framework for driving decision making, which is composed of three stages: object perception, lane line perception and driving decision making. For the object perception stage, an improved object perception model named CenterNet-ARA is developed, composing of a new adversarial training method, a receptive field enhancement module and an adaptive sample allocation equalization strategy to fuse multi-scale feature maps. For the lane line perception stage, a lane line perception method named Lite-MobileTR is proposed, which contains an improved Lite-MobileNetV3 encoder and an improved lite-transformer decoder. Moreover, a noise removal task is incorporated to alleviate the problem of slow convergence speed caused by Hungarian loss function. For the driving decision making stage, a new Multi-Action DQN is proposed utilizing a vehicle curriculum learning strategy and a curiosity exploration strategy to alleviate the problem of random exploration in the learning process. The proposed framework is evaluated on the Tusimple, CULane, TSD-max, and KITTI datasets. Finally, an integration verification is performed in Carla simulator to validate the driving decision making process. The experimental results well demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.},

  abstract     = {In remote or disaster areas, where terrestrial networks are difficult to cover and Terrestrial Edge Computing (TEC) infrastructures are unavailable, solving the computation computational offloading for Internet of Vehicles (IoV) scenarios is challenging. Current terrestrial networks have high data rates, great connectivity, and low delay, but global coverage is limited. Space–Air–Ground Integrated Networks (SAGIN) can improve the coverage limitations of terrestrial networks and enhance disaster resistance. However, the rising complexity and heterogeneity of networks make it difficult to find a robust and intelligent computational offload strategy. Therefore, joint scheduling of space, air, and ground resources is needed to meet the growing demand for services. In light of this, we propose an integrated network framework for Space-Air Auxiliary Vehicle Computation (SA-AVC) and build a system model to support various IoV services in remote areas. Our model aims to maximize delay and fair utility and increase the utilization of satellites and Autonomous aerial vehicles (AAVs). To this end, we propose a Deep Reinforcement Learning algorithm to achieve real-time computational computational offloading decisions. We utilize the Rank-based Prioritization method in Prioritized Experience Replay (PER) to optimize our algorithm. We designed simulation experiments for validation and the results show that our proposed algorithm reduces the average system delay by 17.84%, 58.09%, and 58.32%, and the average variance of the task completion delay will be reduced by 29.41%, 48.74%, and 49.58% compared to the Deep Q Network (DQN), Q-learning and RandomChoose algorithms.},

  abstract     = {With the explosion of connected devices and Internet-of-Things (IoT) services in the smart city, the challenge to meet the demands of urban computing is increasingly prominent. Recent advances in vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communications promote urban Internet-connected vehicles to become excellent candidates for computing tasks. However, due to the limited computing capacity of vehicles, conducting computation in the vehicular networks themselves is insufficient to satisfy the demands of smart city applications. Edge computing, which delivers computing tasks to edge servers (e.g., base stations, BSs, or roadside units, RSUs) with plenty of computing resources, could be a possible solution. However, the static deployment of edge servers may cause severe load unbalance among servers in both real-time communication and computation, thereby decreasing the system performance. This paper explores a two-hop vehicle-assisted edge computing network framework in which vehicles are able to offload the tasks beyond their capabilities to underloaded edge servers relaying via neighbor vehicles. According to the state of the time-varying vehicular environment and the dynamic traffic loads among RSUs, we formulate the task offloading, relay node selection, and resources allocations problem as a Markov decision process (MDP) aiming at maximizing the performance of the computation offloading capacity with the considerations of load balancing and latency constraints. We propose a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm with a DNN as Q action-value function approximator to solve this problem. Extensive simulation results reveal that the proposed scheme can significantly improve the system performance compared to other state-of-the-art algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Vehicle Make and Model Recognition (VMMR) is a fine-grained classification task in Intelligent Transportation System (ITS). Recent works address VMMR through feature encoding schemes, part-based methods or attention modules. Despite their astounding results, these techniques concentrate on the high-level semantic features. This practice cripples the feature expressive ability of the networks as the granular traits of the vehicle distilled from the early convolution layers are not embedded into the final feature representations. In this work, by contrast, a Cross-Granularity (CG) module which is responsible for the integration of macroscopic and microscopic components is proposed. By incorporating the CG module into a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), the resultant network i.e. CGNet reinforces the feature extraction ability by amalgamating the feature maps from different scales to render a balanced mix between local contextual information and global semantic details. To validate the proposed framework, experiments are conducted on four publicly available datasets. We report competitive performance on web-nature Comprehensive Cars, Stanford Cars, Car-FG3K and surveillance-nature Comprehensive Cars datasets with 98.3%, 95.4% 86.4% and 99.1% accuracies. Furthermore, we demonstrate the ability of the CGNet to pinpoint distinctive fine-grained details via the Gradient-Weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) technique and compare it against the baseline which learns on deep features alone. The generalization ability of the CG module on other CNNs is also examined and the results suggest a high compatibility between the two.},

In a mixed and connected environment, different traffic streams in complex driving scenarios are intertwined with each other, and driving behaviours such as steering and lane-changing between various traffic streams are frequent, thus increasing the crash risk of vehicles. To understand the research methods, theoretical models, and system architectures in the field of driving safety analysis in this mixed-connected environment, this article reviews the driving safety risk progress from four major aspects: driving safety risk perception and identification, driving safety risk prediction, driving safety risk quantification, and driving safety risk early warning. By summarizing the existing research, it can be found that academics have achieved many achievements in urban driving safety risk evaluation in mixed-connected environments. Still, there are several problems and challenges that need to be solved, such as the stability and reliability of collaborative sensing systems of AV and CAV in complex traffic environments, the accuracy of object detection, the vehicle information security, the limitations of a single factor analysis used in driving safety risk assessment, and the accuracy of trajectory prediction for both the CV, AV, and CAV. By analyzing the limitations of the existing research, this article proposes a future research direction, which provides a reference for the development of driving safety risk research.},

  abstract     = {3D occupancy perception holds a pivotal role in recent vision-centric autonomous driving systems by converting surround-view images into integrated geometric and semantic representations within dense 3D grids. Nevertheless, current models still encounter two main challenges: modeling depth accurately in the 2D-3D view transformation stage, and overcoming the lack of generalizability issues due to sparse LiDAR supervision. To address these issues, this paper presents GEOcc, a Geometric-Enhanced Occupancy network tailored for vision-only surround-view perception. Our approach is three-fold: 1) Integration of explicit lift-based depth prediction and implicit projection-based transformers for depth modeling, enhancing the density and robustness of view transformation. 2) Utilization of mask-based encoder-decoder architecture for fine-grained semantic predictions; 3) Adoption of context-aware self-training loss functions in the pertaining stage to complement LiDAR supervision, involving the re-rendering of 2D depth maps from 3D occupancy features and leveraging image reconstruction loss to obtain denser depth supervision besides sparse LiDAR ground-truths. Our approach achieves State-of-the-Art performance on the Occ3D-nuScenes dataset with the least image resolution needed and the most weightless image backbone compared with current models, marking an improvement of 3.3% due to our proposed contributions. Comprehensive experimentation also demonstrates the consistent superiority of our method over baselines and alternative approaches.

  abstract     = {Flight safety incidents, such as hard landings and tail strike risks, represent critical concerns during the landing phase. Although Quick Access Recorder (QAR) systems collect extensive multivariate flight data, previous studies have faced challenges in effectively modeling the complex interdependencies between flight parameters, which has limited their ability to predict multiple safety incidents simultaneously. To address this issue, we propose a novel model, named MDGNN, to capture hidden spatio-temporal dependencies and predict both hard landing and tail strike risk incidents. Specifically, we employ temporal convolutional networks (TCNs) to extract both localized representations and long-term temporal trends from multivariate flight data, ensuring the standardization of flight parameters across varying frequencies. Additionally, we are the first to construct a dynamic graph to model temporal relationships, applying a dynamic graph neural network and a temporal convolution module to accurately capture intricate spatial and temporal dependencies. Extensive experiments conducted on 37,904 Airbus A320 flight samples demonstrate that the MDGNN model surpasses state-of-the-art baselines with high prediction accuracy. Furthermore, a case study visualizing key flight parameters highlights the model’s ability to reveal the root causes of safety exceedances, offering valuable insights for flight safety analysis.},

  abstract     = {Self-supervised monocular depth estimation usually assumes that training samples contain only static objects, which leads to poor performance in real-world environments. The presence of dynamic objects incurs camera motion estimation errors, motion blur, and occlusions, which induce significant challenges for network training. To address these issues, we introduce EDS-Depth, a self-supervised learning framework, that improves monocular depth estimation in dynamic scenes. Firstly, we propose a novel TCE (Temporal Continuity Enhancement) strategy to reduce camera motion estimation errors and motion blur caused by dynamic objects. Video frames are interpolated to generate more continuous frames in order to smooth dynamic changes and enrich motion details. Secondly, we design a novel IPDM (Iterative Pseudo Depth Masking) module to address inaccurate object motion and occlusions in dynamic scenes. The module integrates multiple optical flows from different frames for triangulation, generating optimal depth as pseudo-supervision labels in dynamic regions. Extensive experiments on Cityscapes and KITTI datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of EDS-Depth, which surpasses state-of-the-art self-supervised monocular depth estimation methods, particularly in dynamic scenes.},

The final dataset includes forty variables related to pedestrian characteristics, environmental circumstances, and vehicle specifications. Pedestrian injury severity was divided into three categories: fatal, injury, and no injury. The novelty of this approach lies in the application of explainable AI (XAI), specifically SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values, to interpret the AutoML model’s predictions. This combination not only addressed the opaqueness typically associated with AI “black box” models but also illuminated the critical variables influencing pedestrian injury severity outcomes. The results revealed that the weighted ensemble model emerged as top performers, showcasing high accuracy with minimal prediction times, demonstrating the potential of ensemble methods in improving prediction outcomes by integrating the strengths of various individual models. Furthermore, the global and local explainability analyses provided by SHAP values afforded us an in-depth understanding of the variables influencing pedestrian injury severity. This dual-level explanation offered valuable insights into the complex dynamics at play, ranging from pedestrian impairment and driver condition to environmental variables like lighting and weather conditions. These findings underscore the importance of specific variables in crash outcomes, offering actionable intelligence for targeted interventions.},

This paper presents a performance-prescribed optimal control algorithm using control barrier function (CBF)-based reinforcement learning (RL) to address the above problem, which contains two key contributions. First, a special CBF-based argument term is developed and embedded into the reward function to characterize environmental feedback regarding the risk of violating constraints, which enables the controller to confine enclosing errors within declared boundaries with minimal intervention. Second, a critic-only neural network is utilized to synthesize the optimal control policy, where a novel fixed-time updating law is presented to accelerate the weight convergence to ideal values within a fixed settling time, thereby enhancing the online learning ability and further improving control performance. Theoretical outcomes related to learning convergence, safety, stability, and robustness are rigorously verified. Simulations reveal that the proposed strategy outperforms the previously designed enclosing controllers based on the non-RL and RL ways in terms of complying with prescribed safety constraints and optimizing long-term performance.},

  abstract     = {With the rapid growth of electric vehicles (EVs), EV aggregators have been playing an increasingly vital role in power systems by not merely providing charging management but also participating in wholesale electricity markets. This work studies the optimal real-time bidding strategy for an EV aggregator. Since the charging process of EVs is time-coupled, it is necessary for EV aggregators to consider future operational conditions (e.g., future EV arrivals) when deciding the current bidding strategy. However, accurately forecasting future operational conditions is challenging under the inherent uncertainties. Hence, there demands a real-time bidding strategy based solely on the up-to-date information, which is the main goal of this work. We start by developing an online optimal EV charging management algorithm for the EV aggregator via Lyapunov optimization. Based on this, an optimal real-time bidding strategy (bidding function and bounds) for the aggregator is derived. Then, an efficient yet practical algorithm is proposed to obtain the bidding strategy. It shows that the cost of the aggregator is nearly offline optimal with the proposed bidding strategy. Moreover, the wholesale electricity market clearing result aligns with the individual aggregator’s optimal charging strategy given the prices. Case studies against several benchmarks are conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) equipped with high line-of-sight communications have been explored as a complement to emergency communication vehicles (ECVs), particularly when ground Internet of Vehicles (IoVs) is dysfunctional resulting from natural disasters. To protect the communication security and integrity of this air-ground integrated networks created in an untrusted and open wireless environment, authentication and key agreement (AKA) is an essential mechanism to establish a secure communication channel by negotiating a session key. Nonetheless, general AKA protocols are typically not ideal for time-sensitive and computing-intensive UAVs-assisted IoVs emergency rescue, in that they are unable to simultaneously satisfy efficiency and key security requirements including accountability, resilience, thresholds changeability, shares verifiability, group adaptability, and key update. To address this challenge, this paper proposes an accountable group authentication and key agreement (GAKA) protocol with changeable thresholds and verifiable shares supporting adaptive group memberships and updatable keys (i.e. SecER). To safeguard accurate rescue decisions for ground ECVs enabled by reliable collaboration among multiple UAVs, we propose a pseudonym mechanism that aims to provide accountability for UAVs. To achieve resilience and thresholds changeability, our SecER utilizes secret sharing coupled with random parameters to seamlessly transform our GAKA protocol into one running with a new threshold in one round (i.e. round-optimal), rather than two rounds. Finally, verifiable parameters and updatable keys are respectively applied to counter deception attacks caused by maliciously distributed shares and to support adaptive network topology (i.e. UAVs joining and leaving). Extensive simulations show that compared to the state-of-the-art approaches, our SecER is superior in balancing security and efficiency.},

This approach quantifies the probability of positioning failure, which is the probability of the position estimator being outside a safety-region, and compares it against an application specific requirement. The design of positioning algorithms for safety-critical applications, such as automated/autonomous vehicles, should consider the dependence between parameter or state estimation and statistical hypothesis testing for model misspecifications in the evaluation of positioning safety. If this dependence is not considered, as this article shows, the conclusions drawn from the positioning safety analysis might be overly-optimistic. Therefore, this article focuses on the aforementioned dependence through a vehicle positioning scenario based on an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) and the Detection, Identification, and Adaptation (DIA) method for misspecifications in the motion and measurement models. Grounded in the distributional theory for the DIA method, our positioning safety analysis utilizes the conditional probability density functions (PDFs) of the combined EKF and DIA position error, which are generally nonnormal. We compute the probability of vehicle positioning failure in two cases 1) when the dependence is considered and 2) when it is not, to quantify the over-optimism introduced by ignoring this dependence. Finally, we present our conclusions and recommendations.},

  abstract     = {Although the global navigation satellite system (GNSS) has been successfully applied in search and rescue operations for locating lost or damaged vehicles due to its significance in precise positioning, there are still challenges. To enhance the accuracy of localization, positioning can be done with the collaborative estimation provided by neighbouring mobile terminals as reference vehicles. Meanwhile, there are security and privacy implications associated with such an approach – e.g., potential for privacy leakage of both the positioning-related data (e.g., positions of reference vehicles, distances between reference vehicles and the target vehicle) and the estimated positions of the target vehicle. Such concerns are important to address in deployments for sensitive applications such as defense. For example, the location information of a damage vehicle on the battlefield should only be securely evaluated by search unit and be successfully decrypted by an authorized set of officers in rescue unit with the required authorization levels. Accordingly, the threshold should be flexibly allocated and changed for types of security surroundings. However, existing techniques of threshold public key homomorphic encryption approaches are not only computationally and communication intensive, but merely support a fixed pre-defined threshold. To address these challenges, we propose an efficient multilevel threshold changeable homomorphic data encapsulation mechanism (MCTh-HDEM). In MCTh-HDEM, we leverage the technique of multilevel threshold changeable secret sharing in order to support both batch encryption and lightweight matrix calculations in the encrypted domain, and also multilevel threshold changeable decryption. Then, we design a lightweight privacy-preserving vehicle positioning scheme (PPVPS), by refining our proposed MCTh-HDEM. The position of the lost and damaged target vehicle on the battlefield would be efficiently inferred by a set of reference vehicles in search unit while protecting positioning related data, and the target vehicle location can be flexibly decrypted by rescue unit. Finally, we give the formal security proofs of our proposed MCTh-HDEM and PPVPS. The performance evaluation and extensive experimental results demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of our proposal.},

The architecture constructs DTs of UAV swarms and shifts the scheduling of traffic flow paths to the virtual world, thereby sidestepping the overhead of routing configuration and network reorganisation. With the aid of a traffic flow allocation algorithm based on Stochastic Network Calculus (SNC), the virtual swarm pre-schedules traffic flows and assesses end-to-end delay theoretically, so as to achieve a collaborative deployment of sensing, computational, and communication resources within the swarm.

  abstract     = {Technological advancements focus on developing comfortable and acceptable driving characteristics in autonomous vehicles. Present driving functions predominantly possess predefined parameters, and there is no universally accepted driving style for autonomous vehicles. While driving may be technically safe and the likelihood of road accidents is reduced, passengers may still feel insecure due to a mismatch in driving styles between the human and the autonomous system. Incorporating driving style preferences into automated vehicles enhances acceptance, reduces uncertainty, and poses the opportunity to expedite their adoption. Despite the increased research focus on driving styles, there remains a need for comprehensive studies investigating how variations in the driving context impact the assessment of automated driving functions. Therefore, this work evaluates lateral driving style preferences for autonomous vehicles on rural roads, considering different weather and traffic situations. A controlled study was conducted with a variety of German participants utilizing a high-fidelity driving simulator. The participants experienced four different driving styles, including mimicking of their own driving behavior under two weather conditions. A notable preference for a more passive driving style became evident based on statistical analyses of participants’ responses during and after the drives. This study could not confirm the hypothesis that people prefer to be driven by mimicking their own driving behavior. Furthermore, the study illustrated that weather conditions and oncoming traffic substantially influence the perceived comfort during autonomous rides.

However, one deployed policy encounters difficulties in satisfying the drivers’ diverse decision-making preferences simultaneously. Meanwhile, training personalized policies for each driver from scratch is time-consuming and resource-intensive. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a human-guided continual learning framework, wherein the human drivers could real-time take over a deployed policy when it performs unsatisfactorily, and the autonomous vehicle (AV) agent would automatically acquire human demonstrations and dynamically alter itself in accordance with personalized decision-making preference. Furthermore, a priority experience memory-enabled elastic weight consolidation (PEM-EWC) mechanism is developed to prevent the AV agent from overfitting to a limited number of human demonstrations and catastrophically forgetting its acquired fundamental driving abilities. Driver-in-the-loop simulations and real-world experiments are conducted in representative autonomous driving decision-making scenarios, and experimental results demonstrate the superior equilibrium of our proposed approach in terms of driving safety, human likeness, and training efficiency, compared to other baselines, which suggests that it provides a promising solution for personalized decision-making in autonomous driving.

On this basis, an adaptive robust preview control method is developed, integrating feedforward and feedback control to improve tracking performance and robustness. The feedforward controller is designed to proactively minimize tracking errors. In the feedback control, an adaptive observer-based $H_{\infty } $ robust feedback controller is developed to limit the effects of stochastic disturbances, where an innovative preview distance model, considering variable vehicle velocity and path curvature, is applied to achieve preview control. Then, based on the $H_{\infty } $ theory, the design criterion of the proposed feedback controller is established, where bilinear matrix inequality (BMI) is transformed into linear matrix inequality (LMI) to solve the observer and controller gains. Additionally, the fuzzy algorithm is performed to enable the feedback controller to adapt to variable velocity. Finally, we evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method using a hardware-in-the-loop platform. Simulation results confirm its superior robustness and performance compared to the existing baseline control method.},

  abstract     = {Traffic flow imputation aims to estimate missing flow values within a traffic network. While machine learning methods have been widely applied to this challenge and outperformed conventional approaches, the current literature must explore the potential benefits of integrating network indices into traffic flow imputation. Network indices encompass attributes associated with nodes and links, such as centrality measures, which provide valuable insights into the network’s structure. This study proposes adopting network indices in addition to link features to enhance the accuracy of traffic flow imputation. Our proposed feature set incorporates network indices from the original graph and its line graph transformation, alongside inherent link features. Subsequently, we employ a correlation matrix analysis to discern relationships between features, thus excluding dependent features. We estimate missing traffic flow based on the proposed feature set by utilizing five state-of-the-art machine learning and deep learning methods, including KNN, Random Forest, XGBoost, Graph Convolutional Network (GCN), and Graph Attention Network (GAT). The results of testing our proposed method across various traffic networks with varying sizes (Sioux Falls, Anaheim, and Chicago) and under different missing rates (0.1-0.9) consistently demonstrate that each machine learning method experiences an improvement in imputation accuracy when augmented with network indices. More specifically, on the Anaheim dataset, our proposed approach improves by 8.74% with KNN, 3.26% with Random Forest, 2.69% with XGBoost, 4.88% with GCN, and 4.85% with GAT, compared to using only link properties as the feature set, in terms of PCC. Our study also includes further investigations into feature importance and computational cost analysis of network indices.},

  abstract     = {Pedestrian intent prediction is critical for autonomous driving, as accurately predicting crossing intentions helps prevent collisions and ensures the safety of both pedestrians and passengers. Recent research has focused on vision-based deep neural networks for this task, but challenges remain. First, current methods suffer from low efficiency in multi-feature fusion and unreliable predictions under challenging conditions. Additionally, real-time performance is essential in practical applications, so the efficiency of the algorithm is crucial. To address these issues, we propose a novel architecture, Dual-STGAT, which uses a dual-level spatio-temporal graph network to extract pedestrian pose and scene interaction features, reducing information loss and improving feature fusion efficiency. The model captures key features of pedestrian behavior and the surrounding environment through two modules: the Pedestrian Module and the Scene Module. The Pedestrian Module extracts pedestrian motion features using a spatio-temporal graph attention network, while the Scene Module models interactions between pedestrians and surrounding objects by integrating visual, semantic, and motion information through a graph network. Extensive experiments conducted on the PIE and JAAD datasets show that Dual-STGAT achieves over 90% accuracy in pedestrian crossing intention prediction, with inference latency close to 5ms, making it well-suited for large-scale production autonomous driving systems that demand both performance and computational efficiency.},

Because of this feature, efficient and reliable access control has raised a challenge in Internet of vehicles. Ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryption (CP-ABE) could be denoted as an efficient solution for this problem. However, directly applying traditional single-authority CP-ABE schemes may result in single-point performance bottleneck. Besides, the secrets of the whole system may be leaked if any node is attacked. To solve these challenging tasks, we proposed MA-CP-ABE-CRF, a multi-authority CP-ABE scheme with cryptographic reverse firewalls. The system is designed to grant vehicles fine-grained access control by encrypting data under vehicle attributes. Besides, load balancing of authorization in distributed systems is achieved based on the characteristic of multi-authority. Meanwhile, specific nodes are equipped with cryptographic reverse firewalls (CRFs) to prevent information leakage. As the first scheme with the above features for Internet of vehicles, the system achieves adaptive CPA-security and ASA-security. Through rigorous theoretical analysis and experimental comparison, MA-CP-ABE-CRF is proved to be highly efficient and practical.},

In this work, the synthetic image generation model (SIGM) is proposed to generate images to synthesize rain and fog effects for testing CFs. First, to synthesize the rain blur effects on raw images, the geometric-physical fusion model is proposed based on the properties of raindrop microparticles and vehicle features. In this model, the position distribution of raindrops is determined by the geometric model part, and the image pixel effects are realized by the physical model part. Second, the atmospheric scattering model is used to synthesize the fog effect and contains two parts: an airlight estimation model to estimate airlight values and a transmittance estimation model, where the corrected image depth and fog microphysical information based on the Mie theory are used to determine the fog transmittance. Finally, SIGM is validated through real rain and fog in image quality, testing CFs with synthetic images and videos. The result absolute error sum obtained with SIGM (0.45) is smaller than that of the simulation software (0.57) and another synthetic method (0.65), and all unrecognized targets identified by SIGM match the real test results, whereas both the simulation software and another synthetic method fail to accurately test CF. The experimental results indicate that the proposed SIGM has higher authenticity and reliability than testing using the simulation platform and has higher efficiency, controllability, repeatability, and safety than testing using real vehicle.},

An advanced multi-frequency impedance measurement (MFIM) system was used to operate the IL sensors. For a passing vehicle, the impedance of every IL sensor at three different operating frequencies is computed and finally recorded at a sampling frequency of 1 kHz. Each of the 12 recorded signals provides a complex-value vehicle magnetic profile (VMP). Based on the VMPs from two IL sensors positioned one after the other, an accurate measurement of vehicle speed is obtained. Furthermore, the system can capture images of vehicles. A reference database of VMPs was created for various vehicle categories. The software selects 10 statistical features from each real and imaginary VMP part. Eight machine learning algorithms were implemented using ready-made Python3 implementations. Cross-validation accuracy was tested for five feature configurations, including slim and wide IL sensors. The Random Forest (RF) algorithm, utilizing 20 features from the complex VMP, achieved an accuracy of 99.8 % for the wide IL sensor.

The inherent stochasticity and dynamic nature in both passenger demand and drivers’ decision-making pose challenges in capturing vacant taxis movements. This study proposes a novel deep clustering framework to comprehensively uncover passenger-searching strategies from extensive trajectory data. Specifically, multiple features from vacant searching trips are extracted and analogously defined as multi-channel images, where each channel corresponds to a specific feature. A novel deep image clustering approach is then proposed, integrating a feature representation module utilizing convolutional neural networks (ConvNets), a self-expression module for affinity learning, a spectral clustering module, and a classification module for self-supervision. An effective training procedure is also presented for the proposed deep clustering framework. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach against benchmark methods. Based on the clustering results, common and specific passenger searching strategies are further revealed. Specifically, our findings highlight the importance of individual’s contextual experience in explaining searching behavior and operational efficiency. Moreover, drivers cruising without clear searching strategy often exhibit lower performance, and some drivers may gamble with peers to increase their chances of picking up passengers. These results deliver important justifications for future studies and provide managerial implications to improve on-demand mobility.},

However, current terrestrial networks and resource management mechanisms may only partially guarantee vehicle and in-vehicle user equipment (VUE)’s quality of service due to the limited coverage of roadside units (RSU), especially in remote areas. This paper investigates vehicular edge computing (VEC) in satellite-terrestrial integrated networks with multiple low-earth orbit (LEO) satellites, ground RSUs, and VUEs. In remote areas without RSU coverage, VUEs can offload their partial tasks to satellites to save energy and guarantee latency. We aim to minimize VUEs’ weighted sum energy consumption by jointly optimizing VUEs’ association, data partition, computing resource allocation, power control, and bandwidth assignment under the constraints of maximum tolerant latency, maximum number of outage time slots, computation capacity at each satellite and each RSU, and maximum allowable transmission power at VUEs. Furthermore, we introduce an iterative algorithm by decomposing the original non-convex problem into several sub-problems. We efficiently solve each sub-problem by utilizing variable substitutions, the difference of convex functions algorithms, the Lagrangian dual method, and the Karush-Kuhn-Tucke conditions. Simulation results show that the introduced satellite-terrestrial integrated networks-enabled VEC scheme significantly reduces VUEs’ energy consumption compared to other schemes.},

  abstract     = {Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have enabled numerous inventive solutions to multiple problems, considerably facilitating our daily lives; however, UAVs frequently rely on an open wireless channel for communication, making them susceptible to cyber-physical threats. Also, UAVs cannot execute complicated cryptographic algorithms due to their limited onboard computing capabilities. Balancing high-security levels and minimum computation costs is imperative when developing a security solution for UAVs. Consequently, several proxy signature schemes have been proposed in the literature to fulfill these requirements. Nevertheless, many of these solutions face the issue of high computation costs, and some exhibit security vulnerabilities that could not be more feasible options for UAV communication. Considering these constraints in mind, in this article, we introduce an improvised certificate-based proxy signature scheme (ICPS), which leverages the concept of hyperelliptic curve cryptography (HECC) to meet the security and efficiency requirements of UAV networks. The proposed ICPS scheme offers a range of notable features, including its ability to address key escrow and secret key distribution issues. The proposed ICPS scheme’s security hardness has been evaluated using the widely known security tool, the random oracle model (ROM), proving its resilience against known and unknown cybersecurity threats. Finally, this study conducts a performance comparison of the proposed scheme against existing schemes, emphasizing its outstanding cost-efficiency. Notably, the computation cost is measured at 5.3536 ms and the communication cost at 1120 bits, substantially lower than relevant existing schemes.},

  abstract     = {Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks (VANETs) empower vehicles equipped with onboard units to exchange traffic-related messages, enhancing vehicle navigation safety and efficiency. Providing secure privacy-preserving authentication schemes for VANETs is indispensable. It ensures that only legitimate vehicles can communicate, preventing external adversaries from injecting falsifiable information that could mislead vehicles, cause accidents, or disrupt traffic flow. Simultaneously, the privacy-preserving features prevent curious adversaries from compromising vehicle privacy and tracking users. Secure centralized vehicular communication protocols, where a single entity issues certificates for all vehicles, face challenges in enabling cross-domain communications. Adoption of such centralized protocols necessitates that vehicles within each domain possess their certificate authority, restricting cross-domain communication due to inherent distrust in the certificate authorities of other domains. In this paper, we propose a Conditional Privacy-preserving Message Authentication protocol for VANET Emergency message exchange (CP-MAVE), designed to ensure message authentication, integrity, and anonymity of vehicles across different domains. In the event of misbehavior, distributed key generation centers collaborate to trace back the identity of the vehicle. To evaluate the security of our protocol, we formally prove the existential unforgeability of CP-MAVE against chosen message attacks based on the intractability of the elliptic curve discrete logarithm problem. Additionally, we demonstrate that CP-MAVE achieves message authentication, conditional privacy preservation, and resilience against replay and modification attacks. Moreover, we model and analayze CP-MAVE using the Tamarin prover and show that CP-MAVE maintains the secrecy and the message authentication of the vehicle traffic messages. Furthermore, we evaluate CP-MAVE’s performance regarding communication overhead and computation complexity. On a Raspberry Pi 4 Model B/8GB, equipped with a 1.5 GHz 64-bit Quad-core ARM Cortex-A72 processor, CP-MAVE requires a 304-byte communication overhead and 9.4897 msec as cryptographic operation overhead. Finally, to simulate the flow of messages between entities in our protocol, we implement CP-MAVE using socket programming, resulting in an end-to-end delay of 111.05 msec.},

  abstract     = {Currently, heterogeneous driving scenarios and complex traffic conditions challenge connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) to achieve accurate sensing of road conditions. Existing research on the sensing capabilities of vehicles only relys on adding more onboard sensors, which makes the driving safety unable to be guaranteed due to the installment and cost limit of various sensors. Therefore, this paper proposes an enhanced 3D sensor deployment method to break through the sensing capabilities of CAVs’ own equipment limitations. By efficiently utilizing road infrastructure, reasonable roadside sensor deployment will effectively assist CAVs to expand the sensing range and improve overall sensing accuracy. Firstly, in order to address the limitations of existing works that often rely on simplified sensor models and idealized road conditions, we propose a Bresenham-based sensor and environment model that can be used to construct realistic road environments. Secondly, a decision transformer (DT)-based method is adopted to solve the problem of optimal deployment of sensors in road environments. Our approach effectively addresses the limitations of traditional static deployment methods, which often fail to consider the complexities of real-world driving conditions and the diverse factors influencing optimal sensor deployment. Finally, in order to solve the problem of DT delayed rewards, we propose a two-layer optimization method to redistribute the reward function to solve the challenge of local optimization. A large number of simulations oriented to sensing effects not only verify the effectiveness of the sensor deployment method but also ensure the reliability of sensing assistance.},

  abstract     = {Lane detection plays a critical role in the field of autonomous driving. Most previous lane detection methods focus exclusively on analyzing individual images and overlook the inter-frame dynamics, while car-mounted cameras capture continuous streams amenable to leveraging intra-video context. In challenging scenes with blur, occlusion, or illumination variations, considering visible lanes from previous frames can aid current frame interpretation. To tackle above challenges, we introduce a parallel heterogeneous framework, called PHNet, for video lane detection. First, a novel router automatically analyzes multi-level features to determine the inference route of candidates with different visual cues. Then, a cross-frame attention mechanism leverages relationships between current candidates and positive embeddings from past frame to aggregate contextual cues. Unlike existing offline video lane detection methods, which face limitations in handling long video sequences and real-time video streams due to computational constraints, our proposed method operates as an online framework capable of processing clips of any length. Our method demonstrates robust lane detection through temporally association modeling and efficient online inference. The extensive experiments on public benchmark show that PHNet has superior performance versus state-of-the-art video lane detection methods.},

Traditional deep-learning techniques, while effective, rely heavily on supervised learning, necessitating extensive and costly annotated datasets. This paper presents CL-PSDD(Contrastive Learning for Adaptive Generalized Pavement Surface Distress Detection), a novel unsupervised contrastive learning approach that overcomes these limitations by capturing robust feature representations of pavement surface distress across various conditions without manual labeling. We introduce a synergistic methodology that combines SwAV for effective unsupervised learning and YOLO for efficient object detection, enabling the model to learn intricate feature representations of pavement surface distress. Furthermore, we propose RE-RPN-K(Road Enhanced Region Proposal Network in K), a specialized region proposal network that distills precise road surface information, and integrates a transformer-based DETR-Head, eliminating the need for conventional NMS(Non-Maximum Suppression) post-processing. Our experiments on the GRDDC and IRRDD datasets demonstrate that CL-PSDD achieves competitive mean Average Precision (mAP) scores of 76% and 60%, respectively, rivaling the performance of supervised methods and excelling in generalization.

The CGC module constructs a spatiotemporal graph model of the cyclist with both the behavioral and risk information. The RLG module leverages the graph representation method (GRM) to extract features and assigns risk labels using unsupervised learning. The RA module employs spatiotemporal graph convolutional networks (ST-GCN) to extract features from the cyclist graph. Additionally, it facilitates feature fusion through interactions between the human body and the two-wheeler and between hierarchical levels. The fused features, along with the risk labels, are used to train a classifier for the risk assessment of cyclists. The proposed framework is validated using real-world data, and the comparative results with state-of-the-art methods demonstrate the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed approach in cyclist risk assessment in mixed traffic.},

The paper incorporates precise location information into road code, which can assist vehicles in achieving reliable, high-precision positioning. Based on the inertial odometer (vehicle-end) and road code (road-end), the vehicle-road cooperative positioning algorithm is proposed. First, the road code that contains sufficient location information is designed, and the regression-based one-stage road code detection network is developed. The network can detect road code accurately and in real-time, and then road-end location information can be obtained through decoding and pose estimation. An inertial odometer is used to acquire vehicle-end location measurements. Then an Error State Kalman Filter (ESKF) is designed to correct the vehicle-end location with that of the road-end and output high-precision location information. We conducted road tests to validate the performance of the proposed positioning system. The results demonstrate that this system can provide reliable and high-precision vehicle positioning without GNSS signals. The positioning precision can reach the decimeter level.},

However, existing array self-position determination methods show decrease in performance under multipath environments. To deal with this problem, we propose an array self-position determination method based on orthogonal grid matching with the spatial differencing method. Specifically, the direction of arrival (DOA) of direct path and multipath signals are respectively estimated by array spatial differencing method. The matching accuracy is enhanced by utilizing the prior information of direct path signal. After calculating correlation coefficients of different sources, estimated angles with high correlation are then classified into the same set. Then, the noise subspace of each angle set is reconstructed and the position is estimated by grid matching with the orthogonal property between the noise subspaces and the characteristic steering vectors. The matching results of redundant angle sets are removed as non-matching items, thus averting positioning deviations. The simulation results demonstrate that the computational complexity of the proposed method is comparable to that of the signal subspace fitting (SSF). Moreover, in terms of positioning precision, the proposed method outperforms multiple signal classification with enhanced spatial smoothing (ESSMUSIC), initial signal fitting (ISF), and SSF.},

This study introduces an unsupervised learning algorithm for detecting risky driving behaviors on expressways within Cooperative Intelligent Transport Systems (C-ITS) environments, employing deep clustering techniques to analyze individual driving patterns from Probe Vehicle Data (PVD). Utilizing data from 116 vehicles, including buses and heavy trucks, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based autoencoder was employed to extract latent hierarchical features, facilitating the clustering of similar driving patterns. Elementary Driving Behaviors (EDBs) were identified for different vehicle types and driving statuses, serving as a foundation for detecting risky driving behaviors against the proposed criteria. The research revealed a clear positive correlation between detected risky driving behaviors and traffic crashes across the vehicle types. Furthermore, when comparing our model’s criteria with traditional safety indexes, our proposed model demonstrated stronger correlations with traffic crashes, indicating its effectiveness in expressway driving environments.

However, substantial differences between CAVs and the prior knowledge can significantly diminish the evaluation efficiency. In response to this issue, existing studies predominantly concentrate on the adaptive design of testing scenarios during the CAV testing process. Yet, these methods have limitations in their applicability to high-dimensional scenarios. To overcome this challenge, we develop an adaptive testing environment that bolsters evaluation robustness by incorporating multiple surrogate models and optimizing the combination coefficients of these surrogate models to enhance evaluation efficiency. We formulate the optimization problem as a regression task utilizing quadratic programming. To efficiently obtain the regression target via reinforcement learning, we propose the dense reinforcement learning method and devise a new adaptive policy with high sample efficiency. Essentially, our approach centers on learning the values of critical scenes displaying substantial surrogate-to-real gaps.

As DAS traffic applications are still in their early stages, effective solutions to these challenges are yet to be developed. This paper proposes a new deep learning method named DAS High Speed Traffic Trajectory (DAS-HTT) network, which contributes threefold: (i) Multi-Scale Context Extraction Module (MSCE) effectively enlarges the receptive field to capture long-range contextual information comprehensively; (ii) Stripe Convolution Decoder (SCD) acquires remote information along four directions, preventing irrelevant region interference in feature learning; (iii) Hierarchically Hough Transform Fusion Decoder (HHTFD) introduces the structural information of trajectory linearity, reducing the reliance on label data while enhancing trajectory continuity.

Simulation of pedestrian behavior in a commercial complex is difficult due to the heterogeneity of pedestrians and different attractions from various kinds of shops. Inspired from the law of universal gravitation and the pedestrian dynamics theory, we propose an attractive potential based social force framework for pedestrian simulation in commercial complexes. Our framework consists of an attractive potential model and an attractive potential based social force model. The former model evaluates the attractive force of different types of shops towards heterogeneous pedestrians, by associating the attributes of pedestrians with the types of shops. The latter model effectively evaluates the travel direction of pedestrians by incorporating the attractive force with the social force model via a synthesis force criterion. We conduct the simulation experiment based on 600 groups of pedestrian tracking data collected in the China World Mall, Beijing, a typical commercial complex. The simulation results show that the model can effectively simulate not only the trajectory of real pedestrians, but also the behavior of entering shops. Our research significantly improves the authenticity of pedestrian simulation and provides support for travel behavior modeling of heterogeneous pedestrians in the commercial complex.},

  abstract     = {Traffic congestion poses significant economic, environmental, and social challenges. High-resolution loop detector data and signal state records from Automated Traffic Signal Performance Measures (ATSPM) offer new opportunities for traffic signal optimization at intersections. However, additional factors such as geometry, traffic volumes, Turning-Movement Counts (TMCs), and human driving behaviors complicate this task. Existing simulators (e.g., SUMO, Vissim) are computationally intensive, while machine learning models often lack lane-specific traffic flow estimation. To address these issues, we propose two computationally efficient Attentional Graph Auto-Encoder frameworks as “Digital Twins” for urban traffic intersections. Leveraging graph representations and Graph Attention Networks (GAT), our models capture lane-level traffic flow dynamics at entry and exit points while remaining agnostic to intersection topology and lane configurations. Trained on over 40,000 hours of realistic traffic simulations with affordable GPU parallelization, our framework produces fine-grained traffic flow time series. This output supports critical applications such as estimating Measures of Effectiveness (MOEs), scaling to urban freeway corridors, and integrating with signal optimization frameworks for improved traffic management.},

The traffic scene is an open environment that is constantly changing, and the segmentation model needs to have the ability of domain incremental learning to maintain stable performance in the changing environment. The main challenges include the diversity of the traffic scene and the accumulation of forgetting about the previous traffic scenes. In this work, an adapter-based network model is proposed to solve the domain-incremental traffic scene segmentation task. Specifically, the domain-aware adapter (DAA) module is proposed, which divides the model parameters into domain-shared and domain-specific, so that the model can handle the information of all learned domains by dynamically expanding parameters. To further alleviate catastrophic forgetting, the inter-class correlation enhancement (ICE) module is proposed, which utilizes inter-class correlation to improve segmentation accuracy for single domain and knowledge transfer between domains. Extensive experimental results show that the proposed method can achieve promising results for retaining the competitive performance for both new and old domains.},

In the terminal with AGV-supports in the yard, AGVs can autonomously place or pick up containers without waiting for yard cranes. Therefore, in such a terminal, meticulous scheduling and coordination between quay cranes (QCs) and AGVs are core for efficient and orderly operations. However, managing the operation of QCs and AGVs is complex as numerous factors affect the operational performance, such as QC interference, vehicle congestion, and limited capacity of handover points. To address the problem, we formulate a mixed-integer linear programming model that explicitly considers the above realistic factors. As the model is computationally inefficient even for small-scale instances, we develop a tailored two-stage algorithm, where the first stage is branch-and-bound for QC operations and the second is column generation for AGV operations. To validate the solution quality, we compare the proposed algorithm with some benchmark methods, and the numerical experiments confirm the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

  abstract     = {Driving an Autonomous Vehicle (AV) in dynamic traffic is a critical task, as the overtaking maneuver being considered one of the most complex due to involvement of several sub-maneuvers. Recent advances in Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) have resulted in AVs exhibiting exceptional performance in addressing overtaking-related challenges. However, the intricate nature of the overtaking presents difficulties for a RL agent to proficiently handle all its sub-maneuvers that include left lane change, right lane change and straight drive. Furthermore, the dynamic traffic restricts the RL agents to execute the sub-maneuvers at critical checkpoints involved in overtaking. To address this, we propose an approach inspired by semi-Markov options, called Dynamic Option Policy enabled Hierarchical Deep Reinforcement Learning (DOP-HDRL). This innovative approach allows the selection of sub-maneuver agents using a single dynamic option policy, while employing individual DRL agents specifically trained for each sub-maneuver to perform tasks during overtaking in dynamic environments. By breaking down overtaking maneuvers into several sub-maneuvers and controlling them using a single policy, the DOP-HDRL approach reduces training time and computational load compared to classical DRL agents. Moreover, DOP-HDRL easily integrates basic traffic safety rules into overtaking maneuvers to offer more robust solutions. The DOP-HDRL approach is rigorously evaluated through multiple overtaking and non-overtaking scenarios inspired by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) pre-crash scenarios in the CARLA simulator. On an average, the DOP-HDRL approach shows 100% completion rate, 14% least collision rate, 25% optimal clearance distance, and 7% more average speed compared to the state-of-the-art methods.},

Currently, two major factors degrade the performance of SINS/GPS in-motion initial alignment, i.e., outliers in GPS measurements and cumulative low-accuracy inertial measurement unit (IMU) bias errors. This article considers both factors and proposes GISEIA-EMM: a high-accuracy GPS-inertial state estimator for in-motion alignment based on extended magnitude matching (EMM) method. First, we use the full integral method and non-interpolation procedure to construct the vector observation, which reduces the number of outliers and improves the accuracy of outlier detection. Second, we use an error-state extended Kalman filter (ESEKF), based on an augmented state-space model where the reference vector is regarded as a state, to suppress cumulative IMU bias errors, which improves the alignment accuracy. Third, we propose an EMM method, with the non-drifted expected normalized magnitude error, to detect and eliminate outliers in GPS measurements, which makes the alignment process stable. Simulation and field test results demonstrate that GISEIA-EMM can effectively address the negative impact of the two factors.},

However, with the growing intelligence and connectivity of modern vehicles, the in-vehicle network (IVN) faces significant security challenges due to the lack of inherent security mechanisms in the CAN protocol. Therefore, it is necessary to develop a monitoring and protection scheme for IVN. In this article, we propose a novel knowledge graph-based intrusion detection methodology, referred to as KG-ID. The proposed KG-ID methodology leverages a knowledge graph to analyze CAN frame and signal features for detecting several types of attacks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first application of knowledge graph technology for intrusion detection in the IVN. Subsequently, the selection of CAN signal feature, construction of in-vehicle ontology model, knowledge extraction, and robustness against various attacks are explained in detail. In addition, a series of experiments demonstrate that the proposed methodology can accurately detect fabrication, masquerade, and fuzzy attacks. In particular, the time overhead of intrusion detection in a real vehicle supported by XPeng is only 0.031 ms for KG-ID.

However, existing Transformer-based semantic segmentation methods often do not fully exploit their potential in understanding driving scene dynamically. These methods typically lack spatial reasoning, failing to effectively correlate image pixels with their spatial positions, leading to attention drift. To address this issue, we propose a novel architecture, the Hierarchical Spatial Perception Transformer (HSPFormer), which integrates monocular depth estimation and semantic segmentation into a unified framework for the first time. We introduce the Spatial Depth Perception Auxiliary Network (SDPNet), a framework for multiscale feature extraction and multilayer depth map prediction to establish hierarchical spatial coherence. Additionally, we design the Hierarchical Pyramid Transformer Network (HPTNet), which uses depth estimation as learnable position embeddings to form spatially correlated semantic representations and generate global contextual information. Experiments on benchmark datasets such as KITTI-360, Cityscapes, and NYU Depth V2, demonstrate that HSPFormer outperforms several state-of-the-art networks, and achieves promising performance with 66.82% top-1 mIoU on KITTI-360, 83.8% mIoU on Cityscapes, and 57.7% mIoU on NYU Depth V2, respectively.

  abstract     = {Electric Vehicles (EVs) have become popular in the domain of Intelligent Transportation Systems for their ability to mitigate increasing environmental concerns by reducing carbon footprints and conserving fossil fuels. Due to the scarcity of static charging stations, Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) charge sharing can facilitate the on-demand charging requirement of EVs. However, most of the V2V charge-sharing solutions are either centralized or semi-centralized, causing long waiting times, huge message overhead, and high infrastructural costs. For a large network, assigning a suitable donor EV for an acceptor EV as well as maximizing the matching cardinality in a distributed environment is a challenging problem. In this paper, the problem of V2V matching for charge sharing is mapped to the classical stable matching problem in bipartite graphs. The problem is formulated using integer linear programming that considers flexible decision making for EVs based on multiple charging criteria and constraints. However, as EVs have limited communication ranges, an EV can’t possess knowledge about the entire vehicular network. So we propose two sets of distributed heuristics under the name of Vehicle to Vehicle Distributed Charge Sharing (V2VDisCS), which yield a sub-optimal solution with lower computational and message complexities compared to existing distributed solutions. We analyze the average case matching probabilities and prove the sub-optimality of our approach. Simulation studies show that our heuristics outperform the existing distributed approaches in terms of message overhead and matching percentage. They show a comparable result for matching preference with respect to the standard centralized stable matching algorithm.},

Even though reinforcement learning (RL) is capable of optimizing energy efficiency in intricate environments, it is challenged by safety requirements during both the training and deployment stages. The lack of safety guarantees impedes the application of RL to real-world problems. Compared with RL, model predicted control (MPC) can handle constrained dynamics systems, ensuring safe driving. However, the major challenges lie in complicated eco-driving tasks and the presence of disturbances, which pose difficulties for MPC design and constraint satisfaction. To address these limitations, the proposed framework incorporates the tube-based enhanced MPC (RMPC) to ensure the safe execution of the RL policy under disturbances, thereby improving the control robustness. RL not only optimizes the energy efficiency of the connected and automated vehicle in mixed traffic but also handles more uncertain scenarios, in which the energy consumption of the human-driven vehicle and its diverse and stochastic driving behaviors are considered in the optimization framework. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves an average improvement of 10.88% in holistic energy efficiency compared to the RMPC technique, while effectively preventing inter-vehicle collisions when compared to the RL algorithm.},

  abstract     = {Blended traffic, comprising autonomous buses (ABs) and human-driven vehicles (HDVs), is becoming increasingly common, yet the lane change decision-making for ABs remains challenging due to complex interactions with heterogeneous HDVs. To address the challenge above, this paper proposes a game theory-based harmonious decision-making (GTHD) algorithm considering nuance of driving styles of HDVs, achieving human-like performance in interactions with HDVs. Technically, a game theoretic model of the GTHD uses predictions of the opposing vehicle’s motion and the information from preplanned trajectories. Besides, a prior estimation for driving styles is obtained utilizing clustering of historical data, and refined in real time through Bayesian estimation. Then, the driving style estimation is utilized to modify the game theoretic model. The modified model provides a closer depiction of the opponent’s preferences, meanwhile adjusts self-preferences to adapt to the opponent. The efficacy of GTHD is validated using a hardware and human in loop simulator and datasets in MLC scenarios. It is shown that the GTHD achieves human-like performance with 91.50%-98.50% accuracy compared with human bus driver under different conditions, better than several lane change models based on data driven methods.

This paper introduces a novel Cost-aware Adaptive Bike Repositioning Agent (CABRA), which harnesses advanced deep reinforcement learning techniques in dock-based BSS. By analyzing demand patterns, CABRA learns adaptive repositioning strategies aimed at reducing shortages and enhancing truck route planning efficiency, significantly lowering operational costs. We perform an extensive experimental evaluation of CABRA utilizing real-world data from Dublin, London, Paris, and New York. The reported results show that CABRA achieves operational efficiency that outperforms or matches very challenging baselines, obtaining a significant cost reduction. Its performance on the largest city comprising 1765 docking stations highlights the efficiency and scalability of the proposed solution even when applied to BSS with a great number of docking stations.},

  abstract     = {With electric vehicles (EVs) and charging facilities as a bridge, the coupling of transportation network (TN) and distribution network (DN) is getting closer, and EV charging navigation considering TN-DN convergence is a current research hotspot. In order to reduce the total cost of EV charging navigation and the impact of charging load on the grid, this paper proposes a novel bi-layer coordinated charging navigation model (Bi-CCNM). The upper layer model is to minimize the total cost of EV charging navigation. To precisely estimate travel costs, a dynamic spatio-temporal energy consumption estimation model is established, which considers the impact of dynamic traffic flow on EV travel resistance. The lower layer model aims to reduce energy exchange between the charging station (CS) and the main grid, and maximize the utilization of local renewable energy sources. To cope with the intermittent nature of renewable energy generation, this paper utilizes Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) technology to effectively mitigate the impact of EV charging loads on the grid. To efficiently tackle the Bi-CCNM, the Joint Optimization algorithm combining Generalized Benders Decomposition and Logarithmic Barrier Function Method (JO-GBLB) is developed. Ultimately, an optimal solution can be obtained through the interaction of information between the two layers. Real-world case validates the effectiveness of the proposed the Bi-CCNM, energy consumption estimation model, and JO-GBLB algorithm. The results indicate which it provides a low-cost charging navigation solution while significantly reducing the power exchange between the CS and the main grid, effectively preventing safety issues caused by load fluctuations. Besides, the accuracy of energy consumption estimation of EVs increases by 5.1% - 6.7%.},

  abstract     = {The effectiveness of transportation systems is significantly influenced by the field of view (FOV) of cameras, with larger FOVs yielding more reliable performance. Conventional cameras with restricted FOV face difficulties in scenarios characterized by field-of-view shake or low-texture imaging areas, complicating feature extraction and matching tracking. Conversely, 360° panoramic cameras, which provide an expansive field of view and high pixel density, are emerging as promising alternatives. While many studies have explored motion calculation based on panoramic vision, most resort to conventional image processing methods for panoramic images, leading to inefficiencies and reduced accuracy. This article proposes a novel approach to panoramic vision motion estimation and reconstruction. The method involves projecting the panoramic image onto a fitting sphere and establishing a mapping relationship between a uniform spherical grid and the pixels of the panoramic image. This enables distortion-free mapping imaging for the entire panorama, addressing issues with matching consecutive frame images caused by distortion in the polar regions. Going beyond conventional epipolar constraints, this paper introduces a geometric constraint of epipolarity within a three-dimensional sphere and derives pose-solving equations tailored for panoramic vision, enabling motion estimation between frames. Additionally, it derives the polar arc equation of panoramic images, accelerating three-dimensional reconstruction of dense point clouds. The sliding window estimation method is used for iterative algorithm optimization, along with an optimization mechanism aligned with the panoramic camera model. Validation on public datasets and hardware experimental platforms demonstrates the proposed method’s significantly improved accuracy compared to existing optimal algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) has shown considerable promise in enhancing the efficiency of adaptive traffic signal control (ATSC) systems. However, existing MARL approaches primarily focus on optimizing overall traffic flow, often overlooking the issue of fairness in vehicle waiting times. Considering that there is no need to strive for the ultimate fairness, this paper models the ATSC problem as a Constrained Partially Observable Markov Game (CPOMG), where fairness is modeled as a constraint on the maximum waiting time of vehicles on lanes of intersections instead of a reward term that pursues maximization. CPOMG aims to find a cooperative control policy with optimal traffic efficiency within the constrained solution space by multiple agents. On this basis, this paper proposes a new centralized training and decentralized execution cooperative MARL method, i.e., vehicle-level fairness multi-agent proximity policy optimization (VF-MAPPO). VF-MAPPO leverages a centralized trained global Critic Network to estimate the average vehicle traffic efficiency and vehicle maximum waiting time, and an Actor Network shared by all intersections for decentralized execution, which converts the optimization problem with constraints to an unconstrained optimization objective through the Lagrange multiplier method and adopts proximity policy optimization during training. Additionally, VF-MAPPO incorporates spatial-temporal graph attention in the Critic network to efficiently extract state representations in multi-intersection environments. We qualitatively analyzed the monotonic improvement guarantee of VF-MAPPO. Extensive experimental validation across two real-world and one synthetic scenarios substantiates that VF-MAPPO enhances vehicle-level fairness and maintains average traffic efficiency, surpassing state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract     = {Electric vehicles have become a trend as a replacement to gasoline-powered vehicles, and been promoted by worldwide policy makers as a solution to combat environmental problems and stimulate economy, whereas the lack of extreme fast charging infrastructure has become one main obstacle to broad adoption of electric vehicles. To promote the commercial success of electric vehicles, effective placement of electric vehicle (EV) charging stations is pivotal. While numerous studies address EV charging station placement, the integration of transportation network traffic, specifically equilibrium traffic assignment, where flows stabilize as drivers seek routes to minimize travel time, has been relatively limited. This research investigates equilibrium traffic assignment with the inclusion of extreme fast charging (XFC) stations and introduces an algorithmic solution. We assess diverse charging station placement strategies, including node-based and network-based approaches, weighing their respective advantages and drawbacks. Extensive experiments on real transportation networks of varying scales validate our algorithm and evaluate different charging station placement strategies. Many interesting findings are drawn from the study. For instance, increasing the number of XFC charging stations may not always result in reduced traffic time; the added value of extra stations beyond a certain threshold can be quite limited. The findings offer valuable insights for strategically deploying EV charging infrastructure, thus promoting electric vehicle adoption.},

  abstract     = {The gradual advancement of Internet-connected vehicles has transformed roads and highways into an intelligent ecosystem. This advancement has led to a widespread adoption of vehicular networks, driven by the enhanced capabilities of automobiles. However, managing mobility-aware computations, ensuring network security amidst instability, and overcoming resource constraints pose significant challenges in heterogeneous vehicular network applications within Fog computing. Moreover, the latency overhead remains a critical issue for tasks sensitive to latency and deadlines. The objective of this research is to develop a Mobility-aware Secured offloading and Scheduling (M-SOS) technique for a Dew-enabled vehicular Fog-Cloud computing system. This technique aims to address the issues outlined above by moving the computations closer to the edge of the network. Initially, a Dew-facilitated vehicular Fog network is proposed, leveraging heterogeneous computing nodes to handle diverse vehicular requests efficiently and ensuring uninterrupted services within the vehicular network. Further, task management is optimized using a Fuzzy logic that categorizes tasks based on their specific requirements and identifies the target layers for offloading. Besides, a cryptographic algorithm known as SHA-256 RSA enhances security. Moreover, a novel Linear Weight-based JAYA scheduling algorithm is introduced to assign tasks to appropriate computing nodes. The proposed algorithm surpasses the comparable algorithms by 23% in terms of AWT, 18% in terms of latency rate, 14% and 23% in terms of meeting the hard-deadline ( $H\_d$ ) and soft-deadline ( $S\_d$ ), and 35% in terms of average system cost, respectively.},

This model is based on the Generative Adversarial Networks self-supervised learning framework, which can allow to learn high-accuracy estimation without using observed passenger alighting data. To show the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method, a case study is conducted on the real-world datasets in Tianjin, China, Brisbane, Australia, and Panjin, China. Using the entry-only data in the Tianjin case, results show the effectiveness to estimate accurate OD flow without alighting data. The sensitivity analysis on the proportion of data loss shows that when the loss rate is less than 40%, the proposed method is still capable to provide accurate outputs. Using the ground-truth OD flow data in the Brisbane case, results show the ability to obtain the realistic estimation from flawed OD flow. The robustness analysis results also show the sufficient accuracy for bus planning and operation under various data flaw levels.

To further improve their intelligence, we propose a collaborative collision avoidance decision-making approach for USVs based on Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning (MADRL). Firstly, a collision risk assessment model is established using Closest Point of Approach and Quaternion Ship Domain to guide USVs to take timely and effective collision avoidance actions. Secondly, we adopt Deep Recurrent Q-Network algorithm to overcome the challenges posed by multi-ship scenarios, and the Decentralized Partially Observable Markov Decision Process framework is employed in it to accurately establish multi-ship collaborative collision avoidance model. Moreover, to introduce a novel collaborative collision avoidance mechanism for multiple ships, we improved the network update mechanism of DRQN: by synergistically integrating the local Q value of each agent to acquire the multi-agent joint action Q value and the network parameters are subsequently updated based on the calculated global loss. Finally, we designed various experiments in a real water to validate the applicability and efficacy of the proposed approach. The experimental results indicate that this approach has the capacity to enable the ships to make effective collision avoidance actions in accordance with navigation practices and good seamanship. Comparative analysis with Deep Q-Network (DQN), DDQN, Dueling DQN, and Artificial Potential Field underscores the superior safety and rationality of the proposed approach in collision avoidance.

  abstract     = {Traffic forecasting is the foundation of intelligent transportation systems (ITS). In recent, graph neural networks (GNNs) have successfully captured spatial-temporal dependencies to forecast traffic conditions by transforming traffic data in the graph domain. Nevertheless, the existing methods focus only on learning informative graph representations and fail to model informative graph structures, which hinders the capture of dynamic spatial-temporal dependencies caused by dynamic factors such as weather, accidents, and special events. In this paper, we propose a novel task-oriented Spatial Graph Structure Learning (SGSL) method, which aims to capture dynamic dependencies by jointly learning graph structures and graph representations. Compared to methods that use spectral graph representations, we exploit a learnable spatial graph to effectively model dynamic dependencies in traffic data. Moreover, we directly define graph convolutions on spatial relations to specify different edge weights when aggregating the information of spatial neighbours. Thus, the graph structure alterations, i.e., the relation changes, and the time-varying weights of relations can be encapsulated, thereby effectively representing dynamic dependencies. The gradient descent strategy is introduced to periodically learn a spatial graph through joint optimization with a newly designed deep graph learning model named GAT-nLSTM. In this manner, the intrinsic behaviours of nodes are learned to capture correlations across periods. Notably, the optimization process is performed under the traffic forecasting constraint to ensure that the learned spatial graph is specific to this task. Compared with those of state-of-the-art baselines, the experimental results obtained on real-world traffic datasets show significant improvement, which verifies the superiority of the proposed SGSL.},

  abstract     = {Conventional ACC method has great fluctuation and deviation when solving speed and distance control problems. Thus, this paper develops a reinforcement learning (RL) based robust optimal prescribed performance controller for ACC systems. To this end, we first construct a continuous time ACC system with unknown system dynamics (e.g., target vehicle acceleration, sensor and actuator attacks, etc). To estimate the unknown system dynamics, an unknown system dynamic estimator (USDE) is designed, where the unknown system dynamic can be accurately estimated by using the input-output information, this is helpful for controller design. Then, a RL based optimal control method is developed, where the prescribed performance function (PPF) is applied, the system states can be effectively defined within a certain range. To realize the online solution for optimal control, we design a new adaptive law based on the adaptive dynamic programming (ADP) framework to online learn the critic neural network (NN) weights, because of the strong convergence, the proposed learning algorithm can be effectively applied in practical industrial systems. Finally, the efficacy of the proposed control technique is tested through simulations and experiments.},

  abstract     = {In real-world scenes, vehicles and pedestrians on the road often exhibit consistency in their overall motion, forming the traffic flow we observe. Exploring this global collective motion consistency to aid in 3D multi-object tracking (MOT) tasks is an under-investigated issue in existing research. Recently, Graph Neural Networks (GNN) have been introduced to model interactions between targets in 3D tracking problems, achieving remarkable performance. However, existing GNN based methods usually employ neighborhood-based approaches to construct graphs which are unable to fully exploit collective relations in traffic flow. In this paper, we propose a GNN based 3D MOT method which effectively utilizes the collective motion consistency in traffic flow. Collective motion is modeled with a densely connected intra-flow graph within the collective group, allowing information to flow quickly. To build the intra-flow graph, we propose an effective collinearity condition to distinguish potential collective groups from the detected objects. For reasoning on the graph, we propose a progressive serial message-passing solver which enables the network to learn complex group movement relationships based on a thorough understanding of simple neighborhood relations. Our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on public datasets: NuScenes and KITTI tracking benchmark. We have conducted extensive experiments to evaluate the comprehensive performance of our proposed method which demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {This paper addresses the longitudinal control problem of an on-ramp vehicle merging into a platoon on the main road. To tackle this challenge, a finite-time model predictive control (MPC) algorithm with a specialized feedback control law is proposed. A constraint set of the state error is designed and based on this, a decision-making scheme is established to allow the on-ramp vehicle to assess the feasibility of the merging operation at the beginning under the designed MPC strategy. If the merging is feasible, the proposed MPC strategy will be applied to drive the on-ramp vehicle towards a small neighborhood around the desired state on the basis of platoon’s velocity and position within a finite time step before joining the platoon. Furthermore, asymptotic convergence towards the desired state is achieved by a co-designed feedback control law. Otherwise, the MPC strategy will not be triggered, instead an alternative method such as slowing down the on-ramp vehicle to create space and allow the vehicles on the main road to proceed ahead. Under the proposed method, the recursive feasibility of the MPC optimization problem is achieved at all time steps and the finite time convergence to the small neighborhood of the desired state can be proved under the MPC algorithm. An upper bound on the convergence time step is also derived, which is used to prove the effectiveness of the decision-making mechanism. In addition, the closed-loop constraints satisfaction and asymptotic stability of the on-ramp vehicle are also guaranteed. The effectiveness of the proposed MPC method is demonstrated through simulation examples.},

  abstract     = {Traffic accidents remain a significant concern due to their potential severity and impact on society. The rapid and accurate detection of car damage is increasingly crucial. Manual assessment of car damage usually relies on multi-view car images taken at the scene, which can provide richer information for damage assessment. However, most car damage algorithms are based on single-view datasets, and it is hard to fully leverage the complementary information and alignment information between distant view and close-up images. In this paper, we propose the Multi-View Car Damage Detection model (MVA-CDD), comprising three key modules: Feature Split (FS), Feature Fusion (FF), and Image Alignment (IA). The FS module extracts global and detailed information from distant-view and close-up images separately, which are then combined by the FF module. The IA module effectively aligns car damage information in distant-view and close-up images to correct errors and biases. Meanwhile, we created the new Car Damage Detection Multi-view dataset (CDDM), which has a significant advantage in both image quantity and diversity across categories, addressing the shortcomings of existing multi-view datasets. Our proposed MVA-CDD outperforms the state-of-the-art single-view and multi-view models with the dataset. Results from ablation studies further confirm the efficiency of MVA-CDD. This study contributes to optimizing the car damage detection and claims adjudication process, leading to significant labor and material cost savings. CDDM dataset is available at https://github.com/SCUT-CCNL/CDDM.},

The addition of GCAA enhances accuracy further, with an average improvement of 51.7%. This demonstrates our model’s superior ability to understand the contextual relationships within driving scenarios, making it highly effective for AVs to assess driver status in complex situations and interact more efficiently with human drivers.

In complex driving conditions, accurate and fast lane recognition is a challenging issue. In this paper, a vision-based geometric model (VBGM) is proposed for accurate and fast lane recognition in complex conditions. The framework of the VBGM includes an image preprocessing stage and a lane recognition stage. In the image preprocessing stage, the region of interest (ROI) is extracted from the original image, and the original image is transformed into an undistorted greyscale image. In the lane recognition stage, the lane contour is first extracted using the Roberts operator. Then, to accurately and quickly recognize the lane marking, a lane recognition coordinate system (LRCS) and a rotational LRCS (R-LRCS) are constructed. The distracting contours in abnormal regions are padded based on the LRCS using a contextual frames correlation (CFC) strategy, and the midpoints of the lane contour are identified based on the R-LRCS. Finally, an adaptive-order polynomial fitting model is built to fit the lane marking according to the midpoints in the LRCS. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method, two state-of-the-art methods are selected for comparison. The comparative results indicate that the proposed method possesses a higher recognition rate and speed for lane recognition in complex conditions.},

This paper proposes a safety field (SF)-based vehicle-infrastructure cooperative perception approach by quantifying the driving risk in complex traffic scenarios. Leveraging the SF theory and point cloud downsampling, we design a delay-aware early fusion framework with adaptive communication volume control. We propose a latency-compensation error (LCE) for performance evaluation considering data transmission delay. The proposed framework is tested and verified in simulated city environments and simulated and real-world datasets.

  abstract     = {The platoon technology is gradually applied in the intelligent transportation systems to improve the safety, efficiency, energy saving, and emission reduction of vehicles during driving. However, in contrast to the traditional ramp merging scenario that consists of individual vehicles, the existing platoons from the upstream bring new challenges to the merging problem on ramps. Without an effective coordination strategy, the unnecessary congestion and disintegration of the existing platoons will lead to an increase in driving costs and safety risk. Therefore, this paper optimizes the merging strategy of vehicle sequences involving platoons on highway ramps. A merging strategy, based on an adaptive headway threshold, is first proposed, where the comprehensive economic benefit is considered as its optimization objective while taking into account the decrements of the time, fuel, and carbon emission costs. The vehicle sequence merging is then modeled as a Markov decision process to derive the optimal threshold, where the action set includes three actions: accelerating, decelerating, and maintaining the constant cruising speed. Afterwards, the constraints are brought to the decision-making to ensure the safety of the merging process. The calculation of the action value, combining the derived optimal threshold and constraint, is then detailed. Finally, the results of the simulation are evaluated, and a comparison between the proposed strategy and other existing methods is conducted, which demonstrates that the proposed approach improves the comprehensive economic benefits.},

  abstract     = {The widespread deployment of wireless communication networks has catalyzed significant advancements in utilizing signal channs to address real-world challenges, such as vehicle trajectory reconstruction (VTR), drone trajectory planning, and network optimization. Existing methods primarily utilize time-difference-of-arrival (TDoA) measurements for vehicle localization. However, these methods require specialized decoding receivers capable of deciphering communication protocols, leading to increased application costs. received signal strength (RSS), a measure of wireless signal strength, can be recorded by any standard communication device, thus allowing RSS-based VTR to benefit from cost-effectiveness. Nevertheless, the inherently noisy and sporadic nature of RSS poses significant challenges for accurately reconstructing vehicle trajectories. This paper aims to utilize RSS measurements to reconstruct vehicle trajectories within a road network. We constrain the trajectories to comply with signal propagation rules and vehicle mobility constraints, thereby mitigating the impact of the noisy and sporadic nature of RSS data on the accuracy of trajectory reconstruction. The primary challenge involves exploiting latent spatial-temporal correlations within the noisy and sporadic RSS data while navigating the complex road network. To overcome these challenges, we develop an hidden Markov model (HMM)-based RSS embedding (HRE) technique that utilizes alternating optimization to search for the vehicle trajectory based on RSS measurements. This model effectively captures the spatial-temporal relationships among RSS measurements, while a road graph model ensures compliance with network pathways. Additionally, we introduce a maximum speed-constrained rough trajectory estimation (MSR) method to effectively guide the proposed alternating optimization procedure, ensuring that the proposed HRE method rapidly converges to a favorable local solution. The proposed method is validated using real RSS measurements from 5G NR networks in Chengdu and Shenzhen, China. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, even with limited RSS data.},

  abstract     = {Map matching is crucial to facilitating location-based services, and recent advancements in map matching have demonstrated excellent performance with high-quality data. However, the use of low-precision devices often introduces high measurement noise, and the slow update rate of maps may result in errors in digital maps. Consequently, multiple types of noise significantly impact the performance of map matching algorithms. To tackle this issue, this paper presents a novel multi-noise perception framework, named MPF, aiming to enhance the performance and robustness of existing map matching algorithms. The main challenge lies in detecting anomalies during map matching, identifying the root causes, and devising appropriate solutions. Firstly, we propose a matching quality assessment (MQA) method that assesses abnormal variance in matching probability. Secondly, we introduce a multiple noise discrimination (MND) mechanism to effectively differentiate between measurement noise and map errors. Thirdly, we present a missing segment generation (MSG) scheme that dynamically fills in map gaps to prevent significant detours. To validate the effectiveness of MPF, we conduct experiments using real-world taxi trajectories from four cities, covering a total distance of 79,670.6 km. MPF is compare with seven online map matching algorithms and is used to optimize their performance. The experiments show that MPF outperforms the top baselines by 15.6%-26.9% and enhances their performance by 18.7%-38.2%.},

  abstract     = {Accurate environmental perception is essential for the effective operation of autonomous vehicles. However, visual images captured in dynamic environments or adverse weather conditions often suffer from various degradations. Image restoration focuses on reconstructing clear and sharp images by eliminating undesired degradations from corrupted inputs. These degradations typically vary in size and severity, making it crucial to employ robust multi-scale representation learning techniques. In this paper, we propose Multi-Scale Feature Modulation (MSFM), a novel deep convolutional architecture for image restoration. MSFM modulates multi-scale features in both frequency and spatial domains to make features sharper and closer to that of clean images. Specifically, our multi-scale frequency attention module transforms features into multiple scales and then modulates each scale in the implicit frequency domain using pooling and attention. Moreover, we develop a multi-scale spatial modulation module to refine pixels with the guidance of local features. The proposed frequency and spatial modules enable MSFM to better handle degradations of different sizes. Experimental results demonstrate that MSFM achieves state-of-the-art performance on 12 datasets for a range of image restoration tasks, i.e., image dehazing, image defocus/motion deblurring, and image desnowing. Furthermore, the restored images significantly improve the environmental perception of autonomous vehicles.},

  abstract     = {Low-friction surface conditions significantly contribute to the reduction of the wheel/rail adhesion capability and the occurrence of wheel/rail slipping behaviors, which may lead to the degradation of mechanical properties and frictional wear damage at the wheel/rail interface. To mitigate these undesirable consequences, modern railway locomotives are equipped with on-board anti-slip control systems. In this study, three different anti-slip controller models, comprising the traditional re-adhesion anti-slip controller and PID-based anti-slip controller with fixed threshold and with optimal threshold, are established. The wheel/rail rolling-slipping performances subjected to different anti-slip control algorithms under changing wheel/rail friction conditions are compared based on train-track interaction simulations. The results demonstrate that the PID-based anti-slip controller with an optimal threshold achieves the maximum utilization of wheel/rail adhesion in the presence of low-friction conditions, outperforming the other two types of anti-slip controllers. Additionally, the adoption of an anti-slip controller with a lower control threshold can effectively reduce the tread wear of locomotive wheels. This research can provide a deep going understanding of optimization design of anti-slip controller on railway vehicles.},

  abstract     = {Infrared imaging is widely applied in assisted driving systems to enable night vision for sensitive targets such as vehicles and pedestrians. However, the detection accuracy of these targets is limited on lightweight detection networks due to their coarse color and texture characteristics rendered in infrared images. To solve this problem, we propose an adaptive feature-manipulated network (AFMNet) for accurate vehicle and pedestrian detection in infrared images. First, a refined spatial pooling module that uses one-dimensional convolution is proposed to establish local and channel feature mapping under different receptive fields so that different fine-grained features are fused. Second, the shuffle manipulation module is designed which includes slicing and shuffling to manipulate the spatial and channel features so that the information loss problem caused by conventional convolutional downsampling is overcome. Third, the adaptive connection of features at different scales using learnable parameters is proposed, and then the target features are reinforced by location and channel calibration branches. The experimental results show that AFMNet achieves the best performance in terms of average detection accuracy of 86.4%, model size of 5.3MB, and detection speed of 48FPS on GTX 2080Ti.},

However, these systems increasingly rely on collecting and processing extensive data, posing confidentiality challenges that must be addressed to protect sensitive information and safeguard against cyber-threats. This article proposes a privacy-preserving traffic signal control strategy based on secure multi-party computation. The design uses multiple computing servers and a secret sharing scheme to encrypt traffic data into several shares, each corresponding to a server. The servers then securely compute the green time plans, working directly on the encrypted data. The proposed method protects traffic data from curious computing servers and external eavesdroppers, preventing the adversaries from gaining the required information to launch a complex attack. Additionally, a detection and recovery procedure from false data injection attacks on green time signals is presented using secret reconstruction from different server combinations. Simulation results for various scenarios demonstrate the proposed method’s effectiveness in maintaining data confidentiality while achieving the same performance as an unprotected control strategy, with a reasonable addition to computation time. It also depicts a significant reduction in vulnerability against falsified green time signal attacks in terms of total travel time in the network.},

  abstract     = {3D scene flow represents the 3D motion of each point in the point cloud, which is a base 3D perception task for autonomous driving, like optical flow for 2D images. As non-learning methods are often inefficient or struggled to learn accurate correspondence in complex 3D real world, recent works turn to supervised learning methods, which require ground truth labels. However, acquiring the ground truth of 3D scene flow is challenging mainly due to the lack of sensors capable of capturing point-level motion and the complexity of accurately tracking each point in real-world environments. Therefore, it is important to resort to self-supervised methods, which do not require ground truth labels. In this paper, a novel unsupervised learning method of scene flow with LiDAR odometry is proposed, which enables the scene flow network can be trained directly on real-world LiDAR data without scene flow labels. In this structure, supervised odometry provides a more accurate shared cost volume for the interframe association of 3D scene flow. In addition, because static and occluded points are more suitable for using the pose transform while dynamic and non-occluded points are more suitable for using the scene flow transform, a static mask and an occlusion mask are designed to classify the states of points and a mask-weighted warp layer is proposed to transform source points in a divide-and-conquer manner. The experiments demonstrate that the divide-and-conquer strategy makes the predicted scene flow more accurate. The experiment results compared to other methods also show the application ability of our proposed method to real-world data. Our source codes are released at: https://github.com/IRMVLab/PSFNet.},

  abstract     = {In mixed-autonomy traffic environments, accurately predicting the lane change behavior of human-driven vehicles is critical for ensuring the safety and reliability of autonomous vehicle decision-making. However, existing approaches face two major challenges: 1) they tend to represent the relationships between the target vehicle and surrounding vehicles using parameters like relative position and speed. This approach either requires a fixed number of surrounding vehicles or introduces significant noise by relying on virtual vehicles; and 2) they often fail to fully exploit the vast amount of available vehicle trajectory data, leaving the complexities of vehicular interactions underexplored. To address these issues, this paper presents a novel lane change prediction framework using Transformer-based transfer learning. Our design aims to leverage inter-vehicle interactions learned from trajectory data to improve lane-change prediction accuracy. Specifically, pre-trained trajectory prediction models are used to adapt dynamically to the varying number of surrounding vehicles and to capture interaction context from large sets of trajectory data. We then refine the Transformer model to integrate this context and predict the target vehicle’s lane change intentions. The Transformer encoder transforms trajectory interaction context into a lane-change-oriented context using aggregated multi-head attention. The Transformer decoder, in turn, utilizes this context alongside the target vehicle’s states through relation-aware multi-head attention to forecast lane change behavior. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposed framework outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both accuracy and robustness.},

  abstract     = {As a sustainable participant in the modernization of transportation systems, electric vehicles (EVs) call for a well-planned charging infrastructure. To meet the ever-increasing charging demands of EVs, an efficient dynamic spatio-temporal allocation strategy of charging stations (CSs) is necessary. With newly allocated CSs, additional distributed generators (DGs) are required to compensate for the load increase. Given a budget to be allocated over a certain time horizon, we formulate the joint spatio-temporal CSs and DGs planning problem as a multi-objective optimization problem. During each planning period, the allocation strategy aims at minimizing the total power generation costs and CSs/DGs installation costs while satisfying budgetary and power constraints and ensuring a minimum level for the charging requests satisfaction rate. In this regard, we first predict the future power demand of EVs using a graph convolutional neural network (GCNN). Then, using the power demand forecast, we obtain the optimal number and locations of CSs and DGs at each time stage using reinforcement learning. A case study of the proposed allocation strategy over 6 time stages for the 2000-bus power grid of Texas coupled with 720 initially existing CSs is presented to illustrate the performance of the planning strategy.},

  abstract     = {Accurately estimating the position and attitude of vehicles is essential for intelligent transportation systems. The GNSS/INS integrated system offers precise navigation information. However, the system’s positioning errors may accumulate rapidly in challenging GNSS signal conditions. Odometer (ODO) and nonholonomic constraints (NHC) are commonly employed to mitigate the rapid accumulation of INS errors. Compensating for the mounting angles of INS and the scale factor of the odometer is necessary to fully exploit the potential of ODO/NHC. However, many studies employ Kalman filters with small mounting angle assumption, which limits their applicability for large mounting angles in practice. To accurately estimate the mounting angle of INS with any installation attitude, we propose a new algorithm called Fast Estimation of Mounting Angle and Scale Factor (FEMASF). FEMASF employs Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to obtain a closed-form solution for the parameters. It also incorporates an enhanced Sage-Husa scheme, enhancing overall estimation accuracy by reducing the weight of outlier data through a forgetting factor. Extensive simulation experimental results demonstrate that our proposed FEMASF algorithm outperforms filter-based methods in terms of accuracy and convergence speed for large mounting angles. Specifically, for the −90° mounting angle, FEMASF achieves 0.45° angle error, while the velocity-based Kalman filter (VKF) fails to converge and the position-based Kalman filter (PKF) yields about 4° error. Furthermore, neither VKF nor PKF converges for the 120° mounting angle, whereas FEMASF exhibits only about 3.2° estimation error.},

  abstract     = {Vehicle detection at night is a crucial task in Intelligent Transportation Systems. Due to the complex lighting environment, vehicle detection at night remains a challenging task. Headlights and taillights are essential cues to identify vehicles at night. However, existing methods struggle to effectively utilize the light information of the vehicle. This paper proposes a novel highlight-guided framework to identify vehicles, named HighlightNet, by utilizing both the illumination data from the vehicle lights and the reflective properties of vehicles. The framework combines vehicle detection and highlight area recognition via dual-branch joint learning. To ensure that both branches focus on the highlighted regions, Feature Similarity Awareness Attention (FSAA) is introduced to capture the common attention regions of different branches. Highlight Region Perception (HRP) is proposed to exclude streetlights and other reflective illuminations from the FSAA output, which generates a mask map capable of differentiating the foreground from the background of highlighted areas. It improves the allocation of feature weights and adaptively modifies the distribution within the dual-branch configuration. Furthermore, to address the severe pixel imbalance between the highlighted area and the background, Adaptive Spatial Balance (ASB) loss is introduced to allocate the attention towards prospective vehicle regions while diminishing the emphasis on background regions. Extensive experiments conducted on the BDD100K-Night dataset and a newly acquired dataset specifically designed for nighttime surveillance, called the NightVehicle dataset, demonstrate that HighlightNet outperforms the state-of-the-art methods for nighttime vehicle detection.},

The intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) is proposed as a solution to configure the propagation channel in a smart radio environment by adjusting phase shifts. However, designing IRS-assisted V-Nets that achieve ultra-reliability in dynamic and noisy communication is challenging due to the passive nature of the IRS and the limitations of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) methods. To overcome these challenges, this paper presents a computer vision (CV) enabled IRS framework for V-Nets, which combines a convolutional neural network and CV techniques. The framework utilizes real-time visual information to estimate and configure optimal beamforming for IRS-assisted V-Nets. Adapting to real-time network dynamics and intelligently guiding signals, the CV-IRS framework improves prediction accuracy to 95%, an achievable maximum rate of 11.2 bps/Hz with 100 IRS elements, and resource allocation efficiency of 88% with 10 vehicles. The simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the CV-IRS framework over benchmark schemes, making it a promising approach for the efficient configuration of IRS-assisted 6G V-Nets.},

This approach avoids incorporating depth information with different distributions when estimating missing values, resulting in a full-resolution dense depth map with sharp edges. We conducted a quantitative comparison with state-of-the-art models on the KITTI and MidAir datasets, demonstrating that our algorithm has better performance and robustness in terms of completion accuracy.

  abstract     = {Understanding the indigenous driving styles of individuals is significant to avoid oversighting the behavioral generalization across varying geographical locations. The past research on driving style classification mostly focused on identifying the driving patterns using the kinematic feature magnitudes. The variation in the instantaneous driving decisions termed as “driving volatility” is not explored in the context of performance assessment. In this regard, the present study proposes a methodology to explore the driving styles of Indian drivers, using both the magnitude and variation exhibited in the short-term driving decisions. The real-time driving profiles of 47 professional car drivers were collected and segmented into maneuvers based on the respective driving regimes. The performance features representative of each maneuver are extracted, defining 12 measures of driving volatility. The K-means clustering was performed on the event dataset at two-levels, which resulted in four patterns of driving styles under acceleration and braking regimes. The results showed that, a driver can exhibit speedy and aggressive maneuvers in a stable as well as in a highly volatile pattern. The generated driving style profiles at individual-level highlight the behavioral changes in drivers pertained to external influencing factors, and helps to identify the aberrations performed in each trip.},

  abstract     = {Travel data containing personal identification information needs to be anonymized before being shared and analyzed for privacy considerations. While this approach protects personal privacy, it makes it difficult for researchers and planners to identify the same traveler from different databases and to construct complete multi-modal trips, which greatly reduces the value of data. To address this challenge, this paper develops TBLink, a method to match individual travelers between different modes. The underlying idea is that if a traveler makes a transfer, the spatiotemporal signatures of the previous and next trips will be similar and must satisfy certain conditions. When this pattern occurs for two travelers in the two datasets repeatedly, we can infer that the two travelers are actually the same person. The matching of travelers is regarded as a stable matching problem, and the Gale-Shapley algorithm is used to solve the problem. TBLink is demonstrated using metro and bus trip data from Chengdu City between January and March 2021. The results show that the precision, recall, and recovery rate of user matching are 80.83%, 92.82%, and 10.56% respectively, and the matching is more reliable as the dataset increases. Sensitivity analysis is performed to study the effect of several model parameters on the matching performance.},

  abstract     = {Accurate future traffic flow prediction is essential for decision-making in travel recommendations and route planning, aiming to reduce congestion and enhance traffic safety. Traditional traffic flow prediction models often face limitations in quality and structure, leading to increased training costs and inefficiencies, due to data scarcity and centralized training modes that compromise data privacy. To address these issues, we propose a model called 2MGTCN, which combines Multi-modal Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) and Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCN) for Cross-city Traffic Flow Prediction (TFP). Our 2MGTCN model utilizes federated transfer learning (FTL) to transfer the model from the source to the target domain, mitigating data scarcity. It also incorporates GCN and TCN to capture both spatial and temporal information, enhancing cross-city adaptability. Additionally, Grey Relation Analysis (GRA) and Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) methods are applied to capture road relationships, and a Federated Parameter Aggregation based on Spatial Similarity (FPASS) algorithm is proposed for ensuring effective parameter aggregation by considering spatial similarity. Simulation results show that our 2MGTCN algorithm outperforms traditional TFP models in both centralized and distributed training modes, ensuring higher accuracy and better privacy protection.},

This type of semi-dry electrode possesses the merits of facile placement and low impedance, rendering it conducive for application in construction settings. Furthermore, the study applied Multifractal Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (MF-DFA) to analyze the electroencephalogram (EEG) features of tower crane operators. Evaluation and comparison using the traditional wet electrode and the new semi-dry electrode to extract the EEG features show that the performance of the novel semi-dry electrode closely approximates that of the traditional wet electrode, effectively tracking alterations in the cognitive fatigue indicators among tower crane drivers during prefabricated building construction. These findings contribute to the detection of the mental state of tower crane drivers and the identification of physiological characteristics associated with unsafe conduct in the actual process of prefabricated construction, thereby enhancing construction safety.},

The basic characteristics of the model are first examined on a small network, demonstrating the non-uniqueness of the link flow in the user equilibrium pattern. Then, the model is extended to the case of a general network with Variational Inequality (VI) equations. In addition, a two-level optimization strategy is developed by incorporating the pricing and quantity control strategies to the reliability model.

  abstract     = {Transportation systems often exhibit uncertainty, dynamics, and nonlinearity, making them highly susceptible to perturbations. Overhead crane systems, being a crucial mode of transportation, find wide application in engineering practice. This paper proposes a compound control strategy for underactuated overhead crane systems, combining a deep reinforcement learning controller with a novel observer-based disturbance compensation algorithm. The aim is to suppress model uncertainties and external disturbances. Initially, an equivalent state variable is constructed to stabilize the overhead crane system, simplifying controller design. Subsequently, the model uncertainties and external disturbances are treated as generalized disturbances and incorporated as a new state. This state is estimated and compensated through a super-twisting extended state observer (STESO) with finite-time convergence. Lyapunov-based analysis demonstrates that the established state observer can reduce the residual estimate error to zero. Moreover, the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) algorithm, a form of deep reinforcement learning, is employed to effectively eliminate tracking errors. The proposed scheme enables the underactuated system to achieve satisfactory performance, with adaptive control effort suited to different control states and disturbances. Simulation and hardware experiments are conducted, comparing the proposed control strategy with traditional methods, to illustrate its effectiveness and robustness.},

  abstract     = {Powered two-wheelers exhibit complex dynamics, primarily due to their broader range of possible attitude configurations compared to four-wheelers. This is especially true when considering accident scenarios, in which the dynamics can be affected by both high-frequency events, such as in high-sides, marked by rapid variations of the characteristics signals, and low-frequency events, such as in side slips, which exhibit slower and monotonic change in the same quantities. Therefore, designing an effective automatic eCall system for this type of vehicle is particularly challenging, while at the same time, it can significantly increase safety in dangerous situations. This paper proposed a novel approach for detecting falls of two-wheeled vehicles that avoids missed detections while minimizing the number of false alarms, which would heavily undermine its usability. We show, based on extensive analysis of a wide range of experimental data, why and how the proposed approach allows us to overcome the limitations of the existing proposal, ensuring a consistent detection of the wide range of falls that can happen on two-wheelers, also providing a detailed comparison with the scientific literature.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, enormous investments in Automated Driving Systems (ADSs) have distinctly advanced ADS technologies. Despite promises made by several high profile auto-makers, it has however become clear that the challenges involved for deploying ADS have been drastically underestimated. Contrary to previous generations of automotive systems, common design, development, verification and validation methods for safety critical systems do not suffice to cope with the increased complexity and operational uncertainties of an ADS. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to provide an understanding of existing methods for providing safety evidence and, most importantly, identifying the associated challenges and gaps pertaining to the use of each method. To this end, we have performed a literature review, articulated around four categories of methods: design techniques, verification and validation methods, run-time risk assessment, and run-time (self-)adaptation. We have identified and present eight challenges, collectively distinguishing ADSs from safety critical systems in general, and discuss the reviewed methods in the light of these eight challenges. For all reviewed methods, the uncertainties of the operational environment and the allocation of responsibility for the driving task on the ADS stand-out as the most difficult challenges to address. Finally, a set of research gaps is identified, and grouped into five major themes: 1) completeness of provided safety evidence, 2) improvements and analysis needs, 3) safe collection of closed loop data and accounting for tactical responsibility on the part of the ADS, 4) integration of AI/ML-based components, and 5) scalability of the approaches with respect to the complexity of the ADS.},

Recently, various approaches have been proposed to characterize such effects through quantitative measures, leveraging formal stochastic modeling and evaluation of the TCS behavior. In this paper, we illustrate the results of a systematic review of the literature on quantitative evaluation of dependability-related attributes of TCSs under uncertainty on vital parameters. Specifically, we have finally selected 42 relevant papers, published between 2011 and 2023, that succeed in giving, through an empirical perspective and classification, a comprehensive view of current research and practice in quantitative dependability assessment of TCSs.},

Particularly, the existence of code repositories for standardized machine learning applications as well as the available data on this subject, has led to an increasing number of papers, usually comparing the performance of different new and existing delay prediction techniques. In this study, we review the contributions of papers to delay prediction in recent years. Based on a six-step comparison framework, covering many aspects, starting with data collection / processing, including, e.g., model and feature selection, and ending with evaluation, integration of various technologies, and reproducibility considerations, we find that although the current studies have put forward effective concerns, there are still some challenges in the field of delay prediction.

As the number of connected vehicles continues to grow, the importance of ensuring security and privacy within VANETs becomes paramount. Robust authentication protocols are essential to safeguard vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communications, given the vulnerability of the open wireless communication medium in VANETs to interception and manipulation. While researchers are actively developing authentication and privacy schemes to secure message exchanges, existing solutions have not fully satisfied all the security and privacy requirements, thereby fueling ongoing research in this field. A significant challenge in this context is balancing the conflicting goals of privacy—protecting sensitive information from unauthorized access—and traceability—ensuring accountability by identifying malicious actors. This paper presents a comprehensive overview of VANETs, covering their key components, prevalent attack types, and the security and privacy prerequisites essential for effective authentication and privacy mechanisms. Specifically, the paper delves into the realm of identity-based authentication schemes within VANETs, subjecting them to rigorous evaluation based on security, privacy, and scalability. The primary objective is to empower the research community to design and implement efficient and secure authentication schemes, minimizing communication and computational overhead while ensuring resilience against a multitude of potential attacks.},

  abstract     = {Digital twin (DT) technology, which creates virtual representations of physical systems to optimize their life-cycle, has drawn significant attention across various industries. The automotive and aviation industries have been pioneers in adopting DTs for enhanced efficiency, predictive maintenance, and real-time decision-making. However, the maritime industry, crucial to global trade and logistics, has lagged in DT implementation. This paper aims to bridge this gap by systematically surveying DT applications in the automotive and aviation industries and exploring how this knowledge can be transferred to the maritime industry. By analyzing existing literature, identifying key trends, and summarizing best practices, a comprehensive roadmap is provided for maritime industry adoption of DT technology. The surveyed papers are selected systematically following the PRISMA statement and categorized based on characteristics such as single vs. multiple systems, modeling methods (model-driven, data-driven, and hybrid), and life-cycle phases. We introduce DT models using a five-dimensional framework and analyze their characteristics in terms of research object, subsystem application, and modeling method. Additionally, DT applications from a product life-cycle perspective, covering design, manufacturing, operation, and maintenance phases are examined. Knowledge transfer from the automotive and aviation industries to the maritime industry is summarized.

  abstract     = {Various artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms have been developed for autonomous vehicles (AVs) to support environmental perception, decision making and automated driving in real-world scenarios. Existing AI methods, such as deep learning and deep reinforcement learning, have been criticized due to their black box nature. Explainable AI technologies are important for assisting users in understanding vehicle behaviors to ensure that users trust, accept, and rely on AI devices. In this paper, an explainable Q-learning method for AV longitudinal control is proposed. First, AI control of AVs is realized by constructing a deep Q-network (DQN) with an intelligent driver model, with the control objective maximizing vehicle speed while preventing collisions. Then, a deep explainer for humans is developed via a Shapley additive explanation (SHAP), and a novel positive SHAP method that defines new base values is proposed to explain how individual state features contribute to decisions. Finally, statistical analyses and intuitive explanations are quantified based on SHAP tools to improve clarity. Elaborate numerical simulations are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. The code is available at https://github.com/limeng-1234/Pos_Shap.},

However, in some unstructured environments, the point cloud registration cannot constrain the poses of the LiDAR due to its sparse geometric features, which leads to the degeneracy of multi-sensor fusion accuracy. To address this problem, we propose a novel real-time approach to sense and compensate for the degeneracy of LiDAR. Firstly, this paper introduces the degeneracy factor with clear meaning, which can measure the degeneracy of LiDAR. Then, the Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) clustering method adaptively perceives the degeneracy with better environmental generalization. Finally, the degeneracy perception results are utilized to fuse LiDAR and IMU, thus effectively resisting degeneracy effects. Experiments on our dataset show the method’s high accuracy and robustness and validate our algorithm’s adaptability to different environments and LiDAR scanning modalities.},

  abstract     = {In most of the recent literature about model predictive control (MPC) on vehicles, the finite-time and bipartite control are rarely considered. Although existing MPC methods can be applied to address the separation and rendezvous problem, they may suffer from time wasting and consistency conflicts. The finite-time control facilitates the motion planning by pre-calculating the coverage time horizon, which can avoid the unnecessary time-wasting. The bipartite control can realize the collision avoidance for the multi-vehicle system unless the reference state is zero. Therefore, a finite-time bipartite (FTB) control method for the UAV-USV system based on MPC is proposed. However, in most of the existing UAV-USV systems, the sustainable operating mechanism is not considered as usual. In this paper, to realize the sustainable operating mechanism, an UAV-USV ecosystem is introduced and further improved. Specifically, a battery replacement process is proposed and realized by the MPC method with switching topologies. Considering an UAV-USV system, the UAVs on the USV can help the USV replace the rechargeable batteries. And this process can be realized automatically by the proposed MPC method with switching topologies in a finite time. The recursive feasibility and asymptotic stability of the proposed method are proven. In addition, a series of simulations are given to demonstrate the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed method.},

By integrating the Metacognitive Theory and Attribution Theory from the psychology field with reinforcement learning, this study enriches the learning mechanisms of autonomous vehicles with human cognitive processes. Specifically, it applies Metacognitive Theory’s three core elements—Metacognitive Knowledge, Metacognitive Monitoring, and Metacognitive Reflection—to enhance the control framework’s capabilities in skill differentiation, real-time assessment, and adaptive learning for interactive motion planning. Furthermore, inspired by Attribution Theory, it decomposes the reward system in RL algorithms into three components: 1) skill improvement, 2) existing ability, and 3) environmental stochasticity. This framework emulates human learning and behavior adjustment, incorporating a deeper cognitive emulation into reinforcement algorithms to foster a unified cognitive structure and control strategy. Contrastive tests conducted in various intersection scenarios with differing traffic densities demonstrated the superior performance of the proposed controller, which outperformed baseline algorithms in success rates and had lower collision and timeout incidents. This interdisciplinary approach not only enhances the understanding and applicability of RL algorithms but also represents a meaningful step towards modeling advanced human cognitive processes in the field of autonomous driving.},

In autonomous driving models, even minor perception differences can significantly influence the decision-making process, and this impact often diverges markedly from human cognition. However, understanding the specific reasons why a model decides to stop or keep forward remains a significant challenge. This paper presents an attribution-guided visualization method aimed at exploring the triggers behind decision shifts, providing clear insights into the underlying “why” and “why not” of such decisions. We propose the cumulative layer fusion attribution method that identifies the parameters most critical to decision-making. These attributions are then used to inform the visualization optimization by applying attribution-guided weights to crucial generation parameters, ensuring that decision changes are driven only by modifications to critical information. Furthermore, we develop an indirect regularization method that increases visualization quality without necessitating additional hyperparameters. Experiments on large datasets demonstrate that our method produces insightful visualization explanations and outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations.},

In order to implement the scientific decision-making of PM, suitable maintenance procedures were ultimately chosen based on the predominant damage kinds of the pavement units. The results showed that, when compared to the original SVM model, the classification accuracy of the PCA-PSO-SVM model was greatly improved, with total accuracy and accuracy of each class increasing by 10%, 41.7%, 4.6%, and 7.8%, respectively.

To address this issue, we design a scheduling strategy based on deep reinforcement learning and improve the neural network structure using a branch network approach, reducing complexity by decreasing the number of actions represented in the network’s output layer. Moreover, we introduce an action masking scheme that accelerates the algorithm’s convergence in this system.

However, the existing research has revealed challenges in maintaining an equilibrium between energy supply and demand, often resulting in underutilization or overutilization of energy networks. Blockchain technology has emerged as a promising solution to enhance transparency and secure decentralized energy distribution; however fails to connect the equilibrium in the presence of uncertainty of demand-supply and/or handling information cascading. In this paper, we introduce TAURITE (sTAckelberg eqUilibRium in blockchaIned energyneT with Evs), a novel blockchain-based energynet framework that explicitly leverages the Stackelberg model for energy flow equilibrium within EV interfaces. TAURITE employs Subgame Perfect Nash Equilibrium (SPNE) to address demand uncertainty in dynamic vehicular environments. It also tackles information cascades’ impact on energy distribution, demonstrating its ability to maintain equilibrium even in such scenarios. TAURITE introduces a multi-variate polynomial-based key generation process through the smart contract AVTAL and incorporates Proof-of-Energy-Equilibrium (PoEE) as an energy sector consensus mechanism. Experimental results show that TAURITE significantly improves throughput, latency, and energy efficiency, with an average 30% enhancement in these metrics. Notably, TAURITE ensures 100% allocation stability, even in the presence of information cascades, marking a substantial advancement in sustainable and efficient energy management within the evolving energynet-EV ecosystem.},

Inspired by the prescribed performance control, an improved asymmetric barrier function with prescribed performance is provided to ensure that the yaw angle errors satisfy the prescribed performance constraints. Eventually, theoretical analysis demonstrates that the optimal formation control scheme can produce position tracking errors that converge to a prescribed arbitrarily small region within a prescribed time interval, along with the yaw angle that adheres to the time-varying partial constraints, subject to optimal cost with limited communication ranges and collision avoidance constraints.

  abstract     = {Learning multi-scale feature representations is essential for dense prediction tasks in autonomous driving. Most existing works are based on U-shaped architectures, where high-resolution representations are progressively recovered by connecting different levels of the decoder with low-resolution representations from the encoder. We observed that rich details from low-level representation and high semantic information from high-level representations are not fully utilized in the cross-stage fusion process. Additionally, current architectures often struggle to extract efficient discriminative feature along object boundaries. To address this issue, we propose CSNet, a generic cross-stage subtraction network that extracts spatial and semantic multi-scale representations through guided contextual feature. This approach allows fine-grained features to refine deeper layers, capturing discriminative high-resolution features while filtering out redundant information. Specifically, we introduce a cross-stage subtraction module (CSM), which consists of three sub-modules: 1) a Short Path Unit, focusing on capturing complementary adjacent information; 2) Medium Path Unit for effective middle-stages features aggregation; and 3) Long Path Unit for redundant information masking and long-range context modeling. Additionally, we propose the Semantic Guided Context Reasoning (SGCR) module to reason and model contextual relations between different subtraction units. CSNet demonstrates consistent performance gains across various semantic segmentation datasets. Our model, CSNet-M, achieves 82.2% mIoU on the Camvid dataset, while CSNet-S and CSNet-M attain 79.6% and 80.5% mIoU accuracy, respectively, on the Cityscapes dataset. These results show that the proposed CSNet has the potential for enhancing real-time semantic segmentation in autonomous driving applications, offering improved accuracy and efficiency in diverse urban scenarios.

  abstract     = {Traffic prediction is an essential function of intelligent transportation system for traffic control and autonomous driving. Most existing methods encode traffic spatial and temporal data separately, and then design a feature fusion module to correlate spatial and temporal features. However, spatial information is often static, and repetitive static spatial encoding leads to waste of resources, especially in large-scale traffic network prediction. In this paper, we propose a dynamic edge interaction encoding method for spatio-temporal features based on inverse Transformer (iTransformer) and Graph Transformer, named iTPGT-former. The dynamic edge interaction process is designed to embed dynamic temporal features into static edges via a convolutional embedding module. To enhance the Graph Transformer, a relative position encoding strategy based on the self-attentive score of the positive definite kernel (PDK) on graphs and a method for graph substructure encoding (GSE) via enumeration of paths are introduced. In the experimental and discussion session, the iTPGT-former is considered for accuracy, parameters, inference speed, and rich ablation experiments are provided based on six publicly available traffic datasets. The results show that iTPGT-former outperforms the baseline model in both traffic flow and traffic speed prediction. The maximum improvement is achieved in the METR-LA 60-min speed prediction task, with 15.2% reduction in Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE).

  abstract     = {With the advancement of satellite communication technology, the maritime Internet of Things (IoT) has made significant progress. As a result, vast amounts of Automatic Identification System (AIS) data from global vessels are transmitted to various maritime stakeholders through Maritime IoT systems. AIS data contains a large amount of dynamic and static information that requires effective and intuitive visualization for comprehensive analysis. However, two major deficiencies challenge current visualization models: a lack of consideration for interactions between distant pixels and low efficiency. To address these issues, we developed a large-scale vessel trajectories visualization algorithm, called the Non-local Kernel Density Estimation (NLKDE) algorithm, which incorporates a non-local convolution process. It accurately calculates the density distribution of vessel trajectories by considering correlations between distant pixels. Additionally, we implemented the NLKDE algorithm under a Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) framework to enable parallel computing and improve operational efficiency. Comprehensive experiments using multiple vessel trajectory datasets show that the NLKDE algorithm excels in vessel trajectory density visualization tasks, and the GPU-accelerated framework significantly shortens the execution time to achieve real-time results. From both theoretical and practical perspectives, GPU-accelerated NLKDE provides technical support for real-time monitoring of vessel dynamics in complex water areas and contributes to constructing maritime intelligent transportation systems.

  abstract     = {This paper proposes a weight-aware deep reinforcement learning (WADRL) approach designed to address the multiobjective vehicle routing problem with time windows (MOVRPTW), aiming to use a single deep reinforcement learning (DRL) model to solve the entire multiobjective optimization problem. The Non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II (NSGA-II) method is then employed to optimize the outcomes produced by the WADRL, thereby mitigating the limitations of both approaches. Firstly, we design an MOVRPTW model to balance the minimization of travel cost and the maximization of customer satisfaction. Subsequently, we present a novel DRL framework that incorporates a transformer-based policy network. This network is composed of an encoder module, a weight embedding module where the weights of the objective functions are incorporated, and a decoder module. NSGA-II is then utilized to optimize the solutions generated by WADRL. Finally, extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms the existing and traditional methods. Due to the numerous constraints in VRPTW, generating initial solutions of the NSGA-II algorithm can be time-consuming. However, using solutions generated by the WADRL as initial solutions for NSGA-II significantly reduces the time required for generating initial solutions. Meanwhile, the NSGA-II algorithm can enhance the quality of solutions generated by WADRL, resulting in solutions with better scalability. Notably, the weight-aware strategy significantly reduces the training time of DRL while achieving better results, enabling a single DRL model to solve the entire multiobjective optimization problem.},

  abstract     = {This paper investigates discrete-time sliding mode trajectory tracking control for fully actuated autonomous surface vessels (ASVs) with unknown nonlinear dead-zone and saturation inputs, utilizing a switching dynamic event-triggered mechanism (DETM). Through model integration, a direct relationship between ASV position and control inputs is established, simplifying trajectory tracking strategy design. ASVs face dead-zone and saturation constraints in control inputs, where low input signals may not overcome static friction, hindering maneuverability, and further increases are ineffective once actuators reach maximum thrust. Unlike linear dead-zone and saturation input constraints with known parameters, this paper considers a more realistic scenario of unknown nonlinearity, employing adaptive neural networks to approximate and compensate for the resulting unknown dynamics. Moreover, limited internal communication resources constrain real-time inter-subsystem communication in ASVs, while frequent short-period sampling in stable conditions results in unnecessary energy and computational consumption, collectively degrading trajectory tracking performance. A novel switching DETM is proposed to reduce unnecessary data transmission, which switches triggering conditions based on variations in auxiliary dynamic variables. Meanwhile, the controller output variation is integrated into the event-triggered conditions to enhance tracking control performance. Based on this, a discrete-time sliding mode trajectory tracking controller suitable for large sampling periods is designed. This ensures satisfactory tracking control effectiveness while further reducing unnecessary data transmission frequency and conserving limited communication resources within a larger range of sampling periods. All tracking errors are proven to be controlled within a small vicinity near zero. The numerical simulation results validate the efficacy of the proposed control strategy.},

The vehicle self-organizing formation control module organizes the merging vehicles within the V2V communication range into multiple local platoons. The dynamic self-adjusting critical interval and a fixed-topology second-order platoon consistency control protocol are proposed to divided the vehicles reasonably and make the states of local platoon vehicles consistent. The merging vehicles merge into the target platoon as a whole in the form of a local platoon, which transforms the complex multi-vehicle merge problem into a platoon cooperative control problem and improves the merging efficiency. The platoon cooperative merging control module adopts a distributed model predictive control (DMPC) theory to design two longitudinal cooperative merging controllers, which control the target platoon to split to create a merging gap and the local platoon to align with this gap longitudinally. The lateral merging controller controls the local platoon change the lane to merge into the target platoon safely and smoothly. Simulation experiments are conducted in typical scenarios, and it is verified that the proposed control strategy can enable multi-vehicles to merge into a platoon efficiently, safely, and stably.},

  abstract     = {3D object detection has aroused increasing interest as a crucial component of autonomous driving systems. While recent works have explored various multi-modal fusion methods to enhance accuracy and robustness, fusing multi-view images and high-definition (HD) maps remains uncharted. Inspired by our previous work, we endeavor to introduce HD maps to camera-based detection, prompting the design of a new framework. To address this, we first analyze the function of HD maps in object detection to understand their benefits and the rationale for their fusion. From this analysis, we identify key disparities in view, semantics, and scale, leading to the development of MIM, a framework for HD Maps Incorporated Multi-view 3D object detection. HD maps are enriched in semantics by sampling unlabeled areas and encoding them into map features. Simultaneously, multi-view images are transformed into features in bird’s-eye view (BEV) using the adopted baseline. These features are then fused using attention mechanisms to align scales. Experiments conducted on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate that MIM outperforms camera-based methods. Moreover, an in-depth analysis investigates how HD maps impact object detection regarding each semantic layer. The results underscore the operational intricacies of HD maps in perception, setting the stage for future research. Code is available at https://github.com/WHU-xjs/MIM-3D-Det.},

  abstract     = {Safe urban driving is challenging due to the high density of traffic flow and various potential hazards, such as the sudden appearance of unknown objects. Traditional rule-based approaches and imitation learning methods struggle to address the diverse driving scenarios encountered in urban environments. Reinforcement learning (RL), which adapts to a wide range of driving scenarios through continuous interaction with the environment, has demonstrated success in autonomous driving. Making safety decisions when driving in urban environments necessitates a comprehensive perception of the current scene and the ability to predict the evolution of the dynamic scene. In this paper, we present a novel cascade deep reinforcement learning framework, CDRP3, designed to enhance the safety decision-making capabilities of self-driving vehicles in complex scenarios and emergencies. We leverage a multi-modal spatio-temporal perception (MmSTP) module to fuse multi-modal sensor data and introduce temporal perception to capture spatio-temporal information about dynamic driving environments, and a future state prediction (FSP) module to model complex interactions between different traffic participants and explicitly predict their future states. Subsequently, in the PPO-based planning module, we use the comprehensive environmental information obtained from perception and prediction to decode an optimized driving strategy using a lateral and longitudinal separated multi-branch network structure guided by a customized reward function. This approach enables knowledge transfer from the perception and prediction components to planning, and planning-oriented enhancement of safety decision-making capabilities to improve driving safety. Our experiments demonstrate that CDRP3 outperforms state-of-the-art methods, providing superior driving safety in complex urban environments.},

Various objectives must be fulfilled in a PP task, and the majority of prior works integrate all objectives into a unified cost function. To prioritize the dominant objectives of each PP stage, we propose to decouple the PP task into two separate subtasks, enabling the logical establishment of subtask-oriented segmented PP methods. First, based on risk evaluation of four vehicle vertices, an improved artificial potential field was established. Second, a novel transit point selection method was applied to decouple the PP task into two segmented subtasks. Then, the optimization problem was converted into a multi-attribute decision-making (MADM) problem and the technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) method was utilized to obtain two optimal segmented paths. Finally, a velocity planner based on cubic polynomial, in conjunction with a support vector machine-based stability classifier, was designed. The proposed trajectory planner was then verified in six typical driving scenarios, including both simulation and real vehicle studies. Verification results demonstrate that the proposed planner effectively decouples the PP task and achieves a safe, comfortable, efficient, and trackable trajectory.},

  abstract     = {Urban Air Mobility (UAM), powered by flying cars, is poised to revolutionize urban transportation by expanding vehicle travel from the ground to the air. This advancement promises to alleviate congestion and enable faster commutes. However, the fast travel speeds mean vehicles will encounter vastly different environments during a single journey. As a result, onboard learning systems need access to extensive environmental data, leading to high costs in data collection and training. These demands conflict with the limited in-vehicle computing and battery resources. Fortunately, learning model sharing offers a solution. Well-trained local Deep Learning (DL) models can be shared with other vehicles, reducing the need for redundant data collection and training. However, this sharing process relies heavily on efficient vehicular communications in UAM. To address these challenges, this paper leverages the multi-hop Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS) technology to improve DL model sharing between distant flying cars. We also employ knowledge distillation to reduce the size of the shared DL models and enable efficient integration of non-identical models at the receiver. Our approach enhances model sharing and onboard learning performance for cars entering new environments.

The model’s backbone employs structured reparameterization and lightweight Vision Transformers, using multi-branch and Feed-Forward Network structures to boost informational richness and positional awareness, respectively. The Neck network utilizes the Low-GD structure to enhance the aggregation and integration of multi-scale features, reducing information loss during cross-layer exchanges. We introduce a data augmentation strategy using Stable Diffusion to expand our traffic light dataset in complex weather conditions like fog, rain, and snow, improving model generalization. Our method excels on the YCTL2024 traffic light dataset, achieving a detection speed of 135 FPS and 98.23% accuracy, with only 1.3M model parameters.

  abstract     = {Lane changing presents a dynamic scenario characterized by intricate interactions among vehicles. Within mixed-autonomy traffic environment, modeling a human-like lane-change trajectory enables human drivers to better understand and predict autonomous vehicles’ behaviors, thereby enhancing road safety and travel efficiency. In this study, we achieve human-like interactive lane-change modeling based on a novel framework named Diff-LC. The human-like modeling of LCV behaviors relies on an advanced diffusive planner, and the implemented trajectory is selected based on the recovered LCV reward function learned through Multi-Agent Adversarial Inverse Reinforcement Learning (MA-AIRL). To account for interactions between FVs and LCVs, we further employ a diffusive predictor to forecast future behaviors of FVs conditioned on both historical and planned trajectories. Additionally, we leverage the recovered reward function of FVs to enable controllable prediction of trajectories. In the experimental part, we begin by analyzing the significance of features in the recovered reward functions and then proceed to compare the distinctions between the LCV and the FV. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework, we compare the diffusive predictor and planner with several state-of-the-art methods. The results demonstrate that motions planned by Diff-LC closely reach the intended positions with small displacement errors and exhibit highly similar speed and jerk distributions to those of human drivers. We also conduct a dynamic simulation to evaluate Diff-LC’s performance across different traffic conditions. Finally, we explore customized generation using the Diffusion Posterior Sampling method.

This study proposes a novel context-aware knowledge graph (CKG) framework to enhance traffic speed forecasting by effectively modeling spatial and temporal contexts. Employing a relation-dependent integration strategy, the framework generates context-aware representations from the spatial and temporal units of CKG to capture spatio-temporal dependencies of urban contexts. A CKG-GNN model, combining the CKG, dual-view multi-head self-attention (MHSA), and graph neural network (GNN), is then designed to predict traffic speed utilizing these context-aware representations. Our experiments demonstrate that CKG’s configuration significantly influences embedding performance, with ComplEx and KG2E emerging as optimal for embedding spatial and temporal units, respectively. The CKG-GNN model establishes a benchmark for 10-120 min predictions, achieving average MAE, MAPE, and RMSE of 3.46±0.01, 14.76±0.09%, and 5.08±0.01, respectively. Compared to the baseline DCRNN model, integrating the spatial unit improves the MAE by 0.04 and the temporal unit by 0.13, while integrating both units further reduces it by 0.18. The dual-view MHSA analysis reveals the crucial role of relation-dependent features from the context-based view and the model’s ability to prioritize recent time slots in prediction from the sequence-based view. Overall, this study underscores the importance of merging context-aware knowledge graphs with graph neural networks to improve traffic forecasting.},

  abstract     = {The increased prevalence of stairs and ramps in urban areas has highlighted the importance of understanding pedestrian dynamics on inclined surfaces. Previous studies indicate that pedestrians exhibit distinct motion characteristics on slopes compared to level ground. While traditional rule-based models used for pedestrian simulation may not accurately capture the complexities of pedestrian behaviour on slopes, this paper presents a Transferable Pedestrian Motion Simulation Network (TPMSN) tailored for accurately modelling pedestrian dynamics on slopes. The TPMSN incorporates five key input features to capture relative position information, neighbour motion states, and trends in pedestrian motion. Through a transferable layer, the network demonstrates versatility in handling crowd simulation tasks across different slope angles. Networks pre-trained with data from pedestrian single-file flow experiments exhibit robust fitting performance, with R-square values ranging from 0.848 to 0.999. Furthermore, transfer learning is applied with experimental data from pedestrian unidirectional flow on slopes. Two independent networks are trained to predict instantaneous velocity vectors. Simulations carried out by the two networks demonstrate promising accuracy and authenticity, which are validated by a mean Average Displacement Error (ATE) of 0.0926 m and reproduction of flow-density fundamental diagrams. Additionally, the networks could capture pedestrian lateral body sway, a crucial aspect of real-life pedestrian behaviour on slopes, as evidenced by lane entropy trends consistent with empirical studies. Overall, the TPMSN offers a successful approach for crowd simulation on slopes. This work contributes to the advancement of crowd simulation techniques in complex terrains, offering valuable implications for urban planning, crowd management and architectural design.},

  abstract     = {With the rapid expansion of information technology, the complexity of transportation systems is increasing, which promotes the application of prediction on the field of intelligent transportation. However, the existing methods about intelligent transportation prediction have the phenomenon of losing some important information in the prediction process. Meanwhile, some redundant features affect the improvement of prediction accuracy. Moreover, the randomness of k-value selection in k-nearest neighbour (KNN) leads to some limitations in the prediction performance of intelligent transportation prediction. To address these challenges, this paper designs a dynamic prediction system of generalized regression neural network (GRNN) with feedback mechanism by virtue of KNN and modified grey wolf optimization algorithm (MGWO), named KNN-MGWO-FMGRNN. Firstly, the discrepancy value between different samples for each feature is calculated and the k nearest samples to a certain sample are taken as the discrepancy result of this sample under this feature. Then, the KNN results are fused with the difference results and combined with the MGWO algorithm to obtain the optimal k-value. Next, the optimal k-value is used to recalculate the difference result and the KNN result to complete the feature subset selection (FSS). Further, the optimal FSS and model learning are completed simultaneously using FMGRNN. Finally, the availability and merits of the established model are affirmed by six real data sets.},

The problem is formulated as a mixed-integer linear programming aiming to minimize operational costs and risks over a day-to-day rolling planning horizon. A two-stage decomposition (TSD) method is proposed to solve this challenging problem. In the first stage, bus maintenance is scheduled on a daily basis. The second stage then optimizes specific bus maintenance and vehicle schedules within each day. With such a problem decomposition, the computational complexity is significantly reduced as the within-day problems become independent. Computational experiments conducted on a real-world bus line demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the TSD method. Compared to a one-step solution method and an algorithm in a similar existing study, the proposed TSD method consumes far less computation time, while delivering high-quality solutions. Moreover, the TSD solution method can be further greatly accelerated if the within-day problems of the second stage are solved in parallel with different computers. The computational results also highlight the benefits of the proposed two-stage optimization approach in enhancing operational cost-efficiency and bus resource utilization.},

In this paper, we first propose to ensure the isolation of VDTs with the assistance of intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) and network slicing (NS), and obtain better update time of the VDTs within limited resources. Specifically, we divide resources for VDTs with different update requirements to ensure the isolation of VDTs and the resources required for update. On the other hand, considering that the communication performance between vehicles and base stations is affected by urban building density, we propose using an intelligent controller to achieve intelligent control of the physical channel by adjusting the phase shift of passive reflective elements to ensure better transmission performance during VDTs updating. Secondly, considering the dynamic variability of vehicles and the environment, we propose an improved deep reinforcement learning algorithm based on the actor-critic framework to allocate communication, computing resources, and adjust the phase shift of the IRS. Finally, a large number of simulation results indicate that our proposed algorithm performs better than the benchmark algorithms.},

Specifically, battery swapping is a novel mode of power supply for EVs. However, the new way of energy supply complicates the action policies of EVs, especially when the number of power supply facilities is limited. To address this issue, this paper proposes a multilevel deep reinforcement learning (DRL) method to coordinate the action of EVs within the battery charging and swapping station (BCSS) environment. Firstly, an action-driven simulation framework is developed to simulate the BCSS environment and obtain the EVs’ attributes. Then the multilevel algorithm is proposed to drive the EVs to obtain charging strategies. In the multilevel algorithm, the initial decision for EVs is provided by a DRL-based model. Then the advantage value function is utilized to adjust the initial decision of EVs to meet the constraints of limited charging and swapping equipment. Besides, unlike traditional DRL-based methods, the proposed model is driven by the rewards obtained from EV actions. Finally, extensive experiments have shown that the proposed multilevel DRL-based method has superior performance over existing methods in resolving coordinated battery charging and swapping actions. In particular, the proposed model can provide a suggested and reasonable price range for the practical battery swapping mode operation.},

However, current ISAC research often focuses on overall performance assessment across extended periods, potentially overlooking practical sensing requirements, resulting in degraded or even unstable communication performance. To mitigate these challenges, we propose an Integrated On-Demand Sensing and Communication (IDSAC) mechanism for HSRMNs. IDSAC optimizes train communication energy efficiency (EE) by jointly optimizing target sensing selection and transmit beamforming, while adhering to Age of Information (AoI) constraints and ensuring beam pattern gain for designated targets. To tackle the non-convex mixed-integer programming challenge, we decompose the problem into two parts. First, we employ iterative algorithms using successive convex approximation (SCA) and semidefinite relaxation (SDR) to address the EE problem. Second, we introduce a dynamic control algorithm employing the Lyapunov drift-plus-penalty method to manage AoI constraints and sensing selection. Our joint optimization approach achieves optimal EE under dynamic operational constraints typical of high-speed rail systems. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of IDSAC in optimizing ISAC performance, enhancing railway safety and communication efficiency.},

In this paper, we propose a novel flow-based generative method JTE-CFlow for low-light image enhancement, which consists of a joint-attention transformer based conditional encoder (JTE) and a map-wise cross affine coupling flow (CFlow). Specifically, JTE executes short-range and long-range operations by RRDBs (i.e., residual-in-residual dense blocks) and JATs (i.e., joint-attention transformer blocks) in series connection. JAT achieves weak information amplification and information loss restoration of zero-element pixels by the integration of self-attention and specific-attention with sharing the same value vectors, where the query and key vectors of specific-attention are from the zero-map feature of the low-light image. On the other hand, CFlow develops a map-wise cross affine coupling (MCAC) layer to perform cross learning for the flow feature, and a multiplication coupling network (MCN) to learn the transformation parameters of MCAC. JTE-CFlow learns to map the subtraction of outputs of CFlow and JTE (i.e., the residual code) into a standard normal distribution, and the inverse network of CFlow takes the latent feature of the low-light image as its input to infer the enhanced image. Experiments show that JTE-CFlow outperforms most SOTA methods on 7 mainstream low-light datasets with the same architecture, and can be applied to enhance NTM images.

This paper introduces a novel lane-changing method that interactively combines prediction and planning to cope with the complex traffic scenarios. Firstly, a new target vehicle trajectory prediction network based on the hierarchical attention modules is proposed. The initial predictions are fed into a combined sampling and optimization method for selecting an ego vehicle lane changing maneuver. Unlike previous unidirectional frameworks, the selected maneuver is re-entered into the prediction network so that extra ego vehicle planning information can be incorporated to reduce prediction uncertainties. Finally, based on the planning-informed predictions and the selected maneuver, we design a nonlinear model predictive controller to achieve a safe, efficient and comfortable lane change trajectory in the Frenet coordinate. The root mean square errors of the proposed prediction network at the fifth second on the NGSIM and HighD test sets are 3.54 m and 1.18 m, respectively, which both achieve the state-of-the-art performance. Moreover, the results of real traffic data based simulations and real-vehicle experiments highlight the effectiveness of the lane-changing framework.},

As we all know, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Transformers have the unique strengths to extract local and global features, respectively. Considering this fact, we focus on the mutual fusion between them to learn more comprehensive representations for persons. In particular, we utilize the complementary integration of deep features from different model structures. We propose a novel fusion framework called FusionReID to unify the strengths of CNNs and Transformers for image-based person ReID. More specifically, we first deploy a Dual-branch Feature Extraction (DFE) to extract features through CNNs and Transformers from a single image. Moreover, we design a novel Dual-attention Mutual Fusion (DMF) to achieve sufficient feature fusions. The DMF comprises Local Refinement Units (LRU) and Heterogenous Transmission Modules (HTM). LRU utilizes depth-separable convolutions to align deep features in channel dimensions and spatial sizes. HTM consists of a Shared Encoding Unit (SEU) and two Mutual Fusion Units (MFU). Through the continuous stacking of HTM, deep features after LRU are repeatedly utilized to generate more discriminative features. Extensive experiments on three public ReID benchmarks demonstrate that our method can attain superior performances than most state-of-the-arts.

  abstract     = {Given the complex nature of interaction under ambiguous right-of-way scenarios, the interactions between Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) and Human-driven Vehicles (HVs) present considerable challenges to the safety and efficiency of the traffic system. Existing AVs struggle to comprehend and apply common HV social norms, especially the proactive behavior exhibited by adept human drivers in ambiguous right-of-way scenarios. In this study, we propose a novel framework to leverage expert priors for proactive-aware decision-making in ambiguous right-of-way, merging Reinforcement Learning (RL) with parameterized modeling. Building upon unprotected-turning interactions from real-world driving datasets, we select typical cases under ambiguous right-of-way as human-expert priors, which are utilized to guide the learning of the RL agent. Then, a Hidden Markov Model (HMM), which is governed by interpretable parameters derived from expert priors, introduces human decision updating mechanism into AV strategy. Experimenting with typical driving tasks, our approach achieves balanced safety and efficiency in tackling ambiguities of right-of-way, with superior decision-making performance via the guidance of expert priors when compared with established baselines. Furthermore, the results indicate that the proposed method enables AVs to accelerate the convergence during the interaction by consistent probing and decision updates.},

Double-side cantilever yard cranes (DCYCs) perform stacking and unstacking operations for containers transported by AGVs and ETs. Managing and coordinating the operations of DCYC, AGVs, and ETs, not only improves the operation efficiency of U-ACTs but also helps to promote the development of green ports. This paper addresses the problem of scheduling DCYCs and path planning for AGVs and ETs in the U-ACT. To achieve this, we establish a bi-objective mixed integer programming model to minimize both the makespan and the energy consumption. The model considers conflicts between two DCYCs within each block, ensures workload balance for these DCYCs, optimizes parking slots for AGVs and ETs, and schedules appropriate entry times for AGVs and ETs into the yard to reduce conflicts. To solve this model, we develop an improved multi-objective particle swarm optimization (IMOPSO) algorithm, where a globally optimal heuristic search mechanism and several conflict avoidance strategies to plan conflict-free spatiotemporal paths are introduced to accelerate the convergence of the algorithm. Numerical experiments demonstrate the superiority of the IMOPSO approach in terms of multiple metrics, confirming the effectiveness of the optimized vehicle entry timing strategy, which improves efficiency by 7.33% and yields energy savings by 11.72%. These findings clearly highlight that our model and solution approach can effectively enhance the operational efficiency of DCYCs, AGVs, and ETs, contributing to the overall improvement of container terminal operations.},

It is a task that aims to combine visual and auxiliary linguistic modalities to co-locate the target object in a video sequence. Currently, multi-modal data scarcity and burdensome modality fusion have become two major factors in limiting the development of vision-language tracking. To tackle the issues, we propose an efficient and effective one-stage vision-language tracking framework (CPIPTrack) that unifies feature extraction and multi-modal fusion by interactive prompt learning. Feature extraction is performed by the high-performance vision-language foundation model CLIP, resulting in the impressive generalization ability inherited from the large-scale model. Modality fusion is simplified to a few lightweight prompts, leading to significant savings in computational resources. Specifically, we design three types of prompts to dynamically learn the layer-wise feature relationships between vision and language, facilitating rich context interactions while enabling the pre-trained CLIP adaptation. In this manner, discriminative target-oriented visual features can be extracted by language and template guidance, which are used for subsequent reasoning. Due to the elimination of extra heavy modality fusion, the proposed CPIPTrack shows high efficiency in both training and inference. CPIPTrack has been extensively evaluated on three benchmark datasets, and the experimental results demonstrate that it achieves a good performance-speed balance with an AUC of 66.0% on LaSOT and a runtime of 51.7 FPS on RTX2080 Super.},

  abstract     = {Coordinated ramp metering (CRM) is one effective measure to alleviate urban expressway congestion. Traditional model-based methods generally concentrate on single-bottleneck scenarios, while ignoring the case of multiple bottlenecks. In addition, the fixed-sensor fails to fully capture the dynamic traffic characteristics. The rapid development of traffic detection technology has made available a large amount of automatic vehicle identification (AVI) data, which can record detailed individual trajectories. Taking advantage of the AVI data, CRM can be improved. Besides, multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) and game theory have been proven to be effective for traffic signal control. These methods can address the challenges faced by CRM, such as solving nonlinear and high-dimensional optimization problems. This paper proposes a distributed CRM strategy with multi-bottleneck to minimize the total travel time and balance the multiple on-ramps equity, using the individual trajectory information from AVI data. Firstly, the paper defines road segment units, road segment groups, and bottlenecks. Next, the problem is formulated as a potential game that captures the interaction among multiple bottlenecks. The controllers utilize the MADDPG algorithm to determine the green duration of the on-ramps. Finally, the proposed strategy is tested on a real-world urban expressway in a microsimulation platform SUMO. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed strategy performs better than the baseline methods in eliminating mainline congestion and improving the multiple on-ramps equity. Compared to the no-control scenario, the proposed strategy has improved the performance of the system throughput, average travel time, and average mainline speed by 1.31%, 44.36%, and 115.23%.},

  abstract     = {This study addresses the challenge of retrieving traffic road visibility in the Internet of Video Things (IoVT). The complexity arises from the highly ill-posed inverse problem of estimating road visibility from video frames due to indirect inference, leading to ambiguity and multiple possible solutions. Initially, this study formulates the fog effects on images and discovers that the first and second eigenvalues of the observed image matrix closely approximate those of the airlight component under fog conditions. Based on this important discovery, a four-step framework is proposed for estimating road visibility. The framework includes defining persistent scatterers, formulating a singular value decomposition (SVD)-based method for background and airlight separation, extracting crucial physical features, and designing a hybrid convolutional long short-term memory (LSTM) network for accurate visibility estimation. Specifically, the foundational step defines persistent scatterers in visual scenes, followed by a sophisticated SVD-based method for background and airlight separation. Subsequently, physical features, including eigenvalue-based entropy and persistent scatterer intensity, are computed. The framework concludes with a novel hybrid convolutional LSTM network tailored for traffic road visibility estimation. To validate the methodology, three comparative research methods are introduced: one based on the Koschmieder law, another utilizing a convolutional neural network (CNN), and a third employing a deep LSTM approach. Results indicate correlation coefficients of 0.2417, 0.3325, 0.7930, and 0.9484 for the Koschmieder law-based, CNN, deep LSTM, and the proposed method, respectively, when compared to true visibility measurements. Furthermore, the averaged root mean square estimation errors are 6539 m, 9095 m, 1600 m, and 681 m for the Koschmieder law-based, CNN, deep LSTM, and the proposed method, respectively.

To improve the detection accuracy on infrared small targets, we introduce Light-SGMTLM, a lightweight and saliency-guided multi-task learning model. This model integrates saliency detection into the YOLOv5x framework through a parallel multi-task learning structure and employs a joint loss function during training. Such integration significantly alleviates the impact of complex backgrounds and improves the precision of small target localization. Moreover, we have developed a streamlined module, termed SIWD, to create a more agile backbone, which establishes an optimal balance between precision and efficiency, making the model more suitable for situations with limited computational resources. Comprehensive comparative experiments were conducted on six infrared small target datasets, namely, Small-ExtIRShip, Small-SSDD, IHAST, NUAA-SIRST, IRSTD-1k, and IRDST, and we assessed the model’s performance against ten leading target detection models, such as YOLOv7, YOLOv8, DINO, and Relation-DETR. The findings reveal that our method’s unique joint learning architecture, combining saliency and object detection tasks, significantly improves accuracy for infrared small target detection. Notably, it achieved impressive mean average precision (mAP) values of 92.60% and 75.71% on the NUAA-SIRST and IRSTD-1k datasets, respectively.},

  abstract     = {Headway regularity is an essential indicator of transit reliability, directly influencing passenger waiting time and transit service quality. In this paper, we employ multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) to develop a Cooperative Transit signal priority strategy with Variable phase for Headway adherence (CTVH) under a multi-intersection network. Each signalized intersection is controlled by an RL agent, which determines the next step’s signal, adapting to real-time traffic dynamics of transits and non-transits and promoting transit headway adherence. The proposed approach considers four critical aspects, i.e., complicated states with multiple conflicting bus requests, rational actions constrained by domain knowledge, comprehensive rewards balancing buses and cars, and a collaborative training scheme among agents. They are correspondingly addressed by proper state representation with estimated bus headway deviations, irrational actions masking, reward functions formulated by general traffic queue and transit headway deviation, and appropriate MARL approach with synchronous action processing. Our method also takes into account the phase transition loss by setting yellow and all-red time. Simulation results compared with the coordinated fixed-time signal (CFT) and bus holding (BH) strategy verify the merits of the proposed method in terms of improvements in transit headway adherence and influence on general traffic. Based on the results, we further discuss the BH method’s limitations due to bus bay length and various holding lines and the CTVH method’s benefits in the three-intersection environment and the entire-line network. The proposed method has a promising application in practice to improve transit reliability.},

  abstract     = {Monocular 3D object detection finds applications in various fields, notably in intelligent driving, due to its cost-effectiveness and ease of deployment. However, its accuracy significantly lags behind LiDAR-based methods, primarily because the monocular depth estimation problem is inherently challenging. While some methods leverage additional information to aid in network training and enhance performance, they are hindered by their reliance on specific datasets. We contend that many components of monocular 3D object detection lack the necessary adaptability, impeding the performance of the detector. In this paper, we propose six adaptive methods addressing issues related to network structure, loss function, and optimizer. These methods specifically target the rigid components within the detector that hinder adaptability. Simultaneously, we provide theoretical insights into the network output and propose two novel regression methods. These methods facilitate more straightforward learning for the network. Importantly, our approach does not depend on supplementary information, allowing for end-to-end training. In comparison with existing methods, our proposed approach demonstrates competitive speed and accuracy. On the KITTI dataset, our method achieves a 17.72% AP3D(IOU =0.7, Car, Moderate), outperforming all previous monocular methods. Additionally, our approach prioritizes speed, achieving a runtime of up to 52 FPS on an RTX 2080Ti GPU, surpassing all previous monocular methods.

  abstract     = {3D object detection by autonomous vehicles is integral to intelligent transportation. Existing systems often compromise essential foreground point features and local spatial interactions through random down-sampling, focusing primarily on local feature extraction. However, this neglects interactions among distant yet significant points, limiting semantic information and detection performance due to inherent point cloud data sparsity. Addressing this, our proposed Geometric Feature Aggregation and Self-Attention in a Multi-Head Transformer (GFA-SMT) architecture leverages Graph Convolutional Networks and multi-channel transformers to enhance weak semantic information of distant sparse objects. GFA-SMT comprises three modules: Distance Suppression for Local Receptive Fields (DsLRF), Geometric Feature Aggregator with Multi-head Self Attention (GFaSA), and Predicted Key-point Weighting and Refinement (PKwR). DsLRF preserves foreground features, GFaSA encodes similar features and aggregates edge features, while PKwR focuses on key-points for enhancing geometric knowledge of distant and sparse objects. Extensive experiments on KITTI, DIARV2X-I and NuScenes datasets show significant enhancements in widely used techniques, resulting in notable increases in average precision (AP) for 3D object detection: 4.08%, 5.56%, and 4.62%, respectively, on the KITTI test dataset. GFA-SMT enhances point cloud detection accuracy, particularly at medium and long distances, with minimal impact on run-time performance and model parameters.},

  abstract     = {The availability of GPS data from motorized vehicles potentially enables a much more detailed, accurate, and up-to-date analysis of traffic behavior than survey data. Exact routes and driving behavior (speed, acceleration, etc.) can be observed, making it possible to analyze and model congestion and emissions on specific road sections. However, these advantages come with drawbacks: Raw GPS data usually only includes timestamps and coordinates and lacks information on trip purpose, transportation mode, and socio-demographics. This is one reason traffic simulation models are still primarily based on conventional travel survey data. Conventional travel surveys suffer from small sample sizes and infrequent updates. To exploit the potential of GPS data, we present a method for detecting trip purposes from raw GPS data of motorized vehicles. In contrast to previous approaches that rely on supervised machine learning and require ground truth data for training, our methodology uses only unsupervised machine learning techniques. This enables the utilization of any GPS datasets, a capability previously unavailable. The proposed method is based on the plausible assumption that especially destination areas can reveal trip purposes. We apply this methodology to analyze 170, 000 trips for Frankfurt / Germany. Initially, we segment the study area into clusters of sub-areas to condense origin and destination information, which we then integrate with other trip-related variables in a multi-phase trajectory clustering process. Our analysis identifies eight distinct trip purposes. These findings are validated by comparing them with results from the national travel survey, demonstrating the plausibility of our proposed methodology.},

  abstract     = {Autonomous vehicles in Intelligent Transportation Systems aim to boost the adaptability performances of complex problem-solving behaviour in the Sim-to-Real self-driving mission. However, the difficulty for Sim2Real adaption is the so-called “catastrophic forgetting” challenge, i.e., the pre-training policy exposes the flaws of the inability to retain previously skill motion when generalizing to the mixed real-world scenario, which affects learning in an inefficient way. This paper could deal with the above challenge by taking advantage of reconfigurable Sim2Real policies from simpler, previously learned sub-tasks, which are superior to those of pre-defined artificial systems. Specifically, a novel reward-oriented hierarchical learning framework based on hierarchical cognitive mechanisms is proposed dedicated to Sim2Real autonomous driving. Such a learning mechanism breaks down the behavior-aware experience into two distinguished types concerning environmental rewards: basic task-agnostic background and dynamic object-specific foreground. It further reveals the intrinsic association between previously learned knowledge and multiple changing events, by utilizing goal-conditioned key skill motion tailored for specific sub-task rewards. Moreover, the reconfigurable Sim2Real rehearsal is developed to boost the efficiency of high-level policies’ generalization ability according to the reuse of the configurable skill motion via mirrored composition. Extensive validation on both simulated and real-world Sim2Real testbench of challenging autonomous driving scenarios outperforms, demonstrating the superiority of the proposed learning mechanism in improving task efficiency and handling stochasticity throughout learning.},

Existing research has focused on traditional graph neural networks, which use predefined graphs and have shared parameters. But intuitive predefined graphs introduce biases into prediction tasks and the fine-grained spatio-temporal information can not be obtained by the parameter sharing model. In this paper, we consider it is crucial to learn node-specific parameters and adaptive graphs with complete edge information. To show this, we design a model based on graph structure that decouples nodes and edges into two modules. Each module extracts temporal and spatial features simultaneously. The adaptive node optimization module is used to learn the specific parameter patterns of all nodes, and the adaptive edge optimization module aims to mine the interdependencies among different nodes. Then we propose a Decoupled Adaptive Graph Convolution Attention Network for Traffic Forecasting (DAGCAN), which relies on the above two modules to dynamically capture the fine-grained spatio-temporal relationships in traffic data. Experimental results on four public transportation datasets, demonstrate that our model can further improve the accuracy of traffic prediction.},

  abstract     = {In the domain of route planning, the critical concern for travel efficiency has shifted towards optimizing travel time over distance due to the rise in congestion and the dynamic nature of modern road networks. Addressing this shift, we introduce Dynamic Route Optimization with Multi-Category Constraints (DROMC) for Point-of-Interest (POI) visits, which seeks to find the most time-efficient path that satisfies a user-defined list of requirements, considering both the spatial and temporal dimensions. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages a path enumeration algorithm, which iteratively validates the k-fastest paths until all user queries are satisfied, ensuring adherence to time constraints and POI availability. To enhance the algorithm’s efficiency, we employ several key methodologies. First, we adapt the kSP algorithm to account for POI-focused path enumeration. We also introduce a Shared Prefix Tree (SPFT) with binary encoding, which significantly improves the storage and retrieval of path information. Moreover, we integrate a grid-based heuristic for quicker computation and implement strategic pruning methods to circumvent redundant calculations and manage POI business hours effectively. Our extensive experiments on real-world networks demonstrate the algorithm’s superiority in finding more efficient paths in shorter time frames compared to existing methods.},

The primary objective of this framework is to alleviate traffic oscillations, thereby improving overall traffic flow. To achieve this, we introduce a novel total equilibrium spacing estimation method, incorporating stochastic parameters into a car-following model and quantifying the deviation between the mean and equilibrium spacing. This estimation, integrated with a jam-absorption driving strategy, is embedded into a Model Predictive Control (MPC) model for the objective of mitigating traffic oscillations. The efficacy of the proposed control method is evaluated through two experiments utilizing real vehicle trajectory datasets. The first experiment focuses on a single CAV, exploring the impact of key controller parameters on oscillation mitigation. Results demonstrate the optimal performance of the proposed Oscillation Mitigation-based Model Predictive Control (OM-MPC) model, even with a shorter CAV distance (e.g., 100 m), revealing a positive correlation between CAV distance and suitable preset oscillation duration. The second experiment extends the investigation to multiple stop-and-go shockwaves and varying CAV penetration rates. A comparative analysis of control models, including OM-MPC, regular MPC, and proportional-integral with saturation, is conducted based on velocity mean (VM), road segment congestion index (RI), and vehicle stop times (VST). The findings underscore the effectiveness of the proposed control method in mitigating traffic oscillations and enhancing overall traffic efficiency, establishing it as the optimal choice among the three approaches.},

The optimal design objective function is to maximize the radar performance, while keeping the communication rate constant. The measure of radar performance is the Cramér-Rao bound (CRB) of the direction of departure (DOD), which is a special capability of a collocated antenna array multiple input multiple output (MIMO) radar. The joint optimization process comprises two steps, namely the passive optimization of IRSs and the active transmit beamforming. Due to the non-convexity of the optimization problem, a solver based on semidefinite relaxation (SDR) is proposed.

This study introduces a novel approach, specifically a dynamic control authority allocation method, for implementing shared control in autonomous vehicles. Unlike conventional mixed-initiative control techniques that blend human and vehicle inputs with weights determined by predefined index, the proposed method utilizes optimization-based techniques to obtain an optimal dynamic allocation for human and vehicle inputs that satisfies safety constraints. Specifically, a convex quadratic programm (QP) is constructed incorporating control barrier functions (CBF) for safety and control Lyapunov functions (CLF) for satisfying automated control objectives. The cost function of the QP is designed such that human weight increases with the magnitude of human input. A smooth control authority transition is obtained by optimizing over the change rate of the weight instead of the weight itself. The proposed method is verified in lane-changing scenarios with human-in-the-loop (HmIL) and hardware-in-the-loop (HdIL) experiments. Results show that the proposed method outperforms index-based control authority allocation method in terms of agility, safety and comfort.},

  abstract     = {Game-theoretic decision making has the potential to bring human-like reasoning skills to autonomous vehicles (AVs), fostering trust between humans and AVs. However, to make these approaches sufficiently practical for real-world use, challenges such as game complexity and incomplete information have to be addressed. Game complexity refers to the difficulties in solving a game-theoretic problem, which include solution existence, algorithm convergence, and scalability. We show in our recent work that a possible solution to overcoming these difficulties is to use potential games. However, constructing a potential game often requires specific cost function designs, limiting their broad use. To address this challenge, we propose to employ a game projection technique in this paper, relaxing the cost function design conditions and making the potential game approach applicable to broader scenarios, even including the ones that cannot be modelled as a potential game. Incomplete information refers to the ego vehicle’s lack of knowledge of other traffic agents’ cost functions. In a driving scenario, deviations of the ego vehicle assumed/estimated others’ cost functions from their actual ones are often inevitable. This necessitate the robustness analysis of a game-theoretic solution. This paper defines the robustness margin of a game solution as the maximum magnitude of cost function deviations that can be accommodated without changing the optimality of the game solution. With this definition, closed-form robustness margins are derived. Numerical studies using highway lane-changing scenarios are reported.},

Traditional methods for panoramic observation and map generation suffer from issues such as limited parallax tolerance, poor stitching robustness, and low mapping accuracy. In this paper, these problems are addressed by a proposed online panoramic method based on multi-perspective image projection and camera pose rectification. The proposed method incorporates a modified inverse projection module that dynamically adapts to the ship’s attitude, thereby stably restoring the sea-ice images into bird’s-eye view (BEV) in real-time. In order to resolve the challenging sea-ice feature alignment under significant parallax, a planar feature registration method is proposed which robustly aligns the features between the projected images. Moreover, a camera pose rectification module is specifically designed for planar projection tasks, which virtually adjusts the camera’s extrinsic parameters for obtaining more precise and high-quality panoramic sea-ice maps. Finally, online construction of global sea-ice field maps is achieved by fusing the local maps during navigation. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms other panoramic methods in terms of map accuracy and stitching quality. Additionally, the proposed method is more suitable for downstream tasks, including polar simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) and path planning.},

  abstract     = {The significance of maritime transportation highlights the need to enhance the efficiency of container terminals. This study addresses a challenge within maritime transportation, specifically the continuous berth allocation and time-variant quay crane assignment problem (C/T-V BACAP). We formulate a comprehensive mathematical model of C/T-V BACAP. To solve the problem, we propose an effective memetic algorithm with a heuristic decoding method, named HMA, which comprises three essential components: a three-stage heuristic decoding method, a clustering-based evolutionary strategy, and a target-guided local search operator. The three-stage heuristic decoding method guarantees solution feasibility and high quality through the entire optimization, allowing the following strategies to fully utilize their search capabilities. The clustering-based evolutionary strategy refines the search space and diversifies the promising candidates. Meanwhile, the target-guided local search operator rapidly optimizes the allocation for the challenging vessel. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm delivers excellent performance, especially in handling large-scale instances (up to 60 vessels). Our proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art BACAP algorithms by an average margin of 150% in terms of berth offset and waiting time in most problem instances.},

  abstract     = {In large-scale urban environments, precise six-degree-of-freedom (6DOF) pose estimation is essential for vehicles and robots to perform autonomous driving and exploration, as well as to achieve high intelligence and full autonomy of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV). Achieving 6DOF pose estimation in Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS)-denied environments is challenging. The performance of relative 6DOF localization systems based on Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR), vision, and inertial data is easily affected by environmental conditions, leading to error accumulation and a significant decrease in estimation accuracy in complex environments. To address this issue, we propose a tightly coupled framework based on nonlinear optimization for vision, LiDAR, inertial, and GNSS raw data. In the experimental section, we validate the effectiveness of the proposed optimization factor model for GNSS data, LiDAR data, and visual data in improving position and orientation estimation accuracy through simulations. Additionally, we use real datasets to compare the proposed algorithm with several existing open-source programs in terms of computational efficiency, pose estimation accuracy, worst-case scenarios, and reliability. The experimental results show that, although the total processing time increases, the position estimation accuracy and orientation estimation accuracy of the proposed fusion algorithm improve by at least 58.0%. Overall, the proposed tightly-coupled algorithm outperforms the existing methods.},

  abstract     = {Understanding the movement of crowds is important to the management of public places and urban safety. Existing researches mostly focused on tracking pedestrians in video clips from a single camera or across multiple cameras (Multi-Object Tracking) by identifying individuals with similar appearance or spatial-temporal movement features. However, how crowds navigate through invisible area between cameras in crowded environments have been overlooked. Moreover, identifying individuals across camera in a crowded environment could be challenging due to cluttered pedestrian appearance and highly uncertain movements. In this paper, we focus on recovering crowd trajectories in the invisible area of sparse camera networks within crowded public environments. We achieve better spatial-temporal feature matching by estimating the most likely travel time between segmented tracklet observations of individuals with elaborate consideration of pedestrian interactions, which reduces the dependence on unreliable appearance features. Subsequently, we recover trajectories for matched tracklets in the invisible area with a high fidelity crowd simulation model. Extensive experiments on two real-world trajectory datasets show that our proposed method is superior to existing spatial-temporal based MOT methods and improves the appearance-based MOT models in terms of association accuracy and trajectory fidelity.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a novel terrain-adaptive local trajectory planner designed for the autonomous operation of off-road vehicles on deformable terrains. State-of-the-art solutions either do not account for deformable terrains, or do not offer sufficient robustness or computational speed. To bridge this research gap, the paper introduces a novel model predictive control (MPC) formulation. In contrast to the prevailing state-of-the-art approaches that rely exclusively on hard or soft constraints for obstacle avoidance, the present formulation enhances robustness by incorporating both types of constraints. The effectiveness and robustness of the formulation are evaluated through extensive simulations, encompassing a wide range of randomized scenarios, and compared against state-of-the-art methods. Subsequently, the formulation is augmented with an optimal-control-oriented terramechanics model from the literature, explicitly addressing terrain deformation. Additionally, a terrain estimator employing the unscented Kalman filter is utilized to dynamically adjust the sinkage exponent online, resulting in a terrain-adaptive formulation. This formulation is tested on a physical vehicle in real world experiments against a rigid-terrain formulation as the benchmark. The results showcase the superior safety and performance achieved by the proposed formulation, underscoring the critical significance of integrating terramechanics knowledge into the planning process. Specifically, the proposed terrain-adaptive formulation achieves reduced mean absolute sideslip angle, decreased mean absolute yaw rate, shorter time to goal, and a higher success rate, primarily attributed to its enhanced understanding of terramechanics within the planner.},

  abstract     = {Although current Artificial Intelligence (AI) can detect maneuvering intentions, it often overlooks the underlying driving goals that reveal drivers’ genuine requirements. To detect real-time driving goals using AI for providing effective decision aids, this research introduces the Framework of Adaptive Driving (FAD), which considers cognitive activities and action strategies. We have outlined five driving goals to elucidate the connections between Situation Awareness (SA), and intentions. The study involved 31 participants and 573 driving simulation events, during which we collected both eye-tracking and kinetic data. Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) identified 8 factors, categorized into SA and maneuver-related factors. Statistical and qualitative analysis follow up to specify the varying requirements among the driving foals defined. Generally, factor ‘Cognitive load’ can reflect cognitive activities, while ‘Saccade on the surroundings’ and ‘Saccade movement’ can indicate action strategies. For the goals where emerging risks are not a concern, ‘Active acceleration’ signifies drivers’ intention to enhance driving efficiency. However, the diverse features in ‘Saccade on the surroundings’ imply varying driving considerations. Goals for routine tasks focus on internal vehicle operations, while goals for driving benefits management highlight adjacent surroundings. Conversely, for goals addressing emerging risks, ‘Deceleration’ prevails. Furthermore, ‘Steering strategy’ implies a preference for steering when SA is adequate. In this context, SA-related factors like ‘Front observation,’ ‘Saccade movement,’ and ‘Cognitive load’ signify efforts to enhance SA under time constraints. However, for the driving goals under extreme urgency, the factor ‘Lateral movement’ replaces ‘Steering strategy’, implying severe steering without adequate SA.},

  abstract     = {Vehicle detection based on remote sensing images is widely used in urban traffic management and disaster rescue. RGB images, which are used more, lead to poor detection performance in low light conditions due to the imaging mechanism. At present, the main solution is to improve the detection performance in low light by fusing with infrared images. However, the current methods often overlook the impact of illumination changes on RGB images, and ignore the important role of high-frequency information for object detection, especially for low-light target detection. In this paper, we propose a Cross-modality and Cross-domain Low-light Detector (CCLDet) for low-light vehicle detection, including three improvements. First, an object illumination-aware module (OIAM) is proposed, which can adjust adaptively the weight of different modalities according to the object illumination intensity in the training phase and enables the detector to adapt to different lighting conditions. Second, we propose a visibility loss, which converts the position deviation into the illumination intensity deviation of each point in the object area. Compared with relying only on semantic information for object localization, the illumination makes the information that can be used for localization more abundant. Third, we design a cross-domain feature fusion module (CDFFM), which can enhance high-frequency features and enrich target information when low-frequency features are lost due to low light pollution. Extensive experiments on three challenging RGB-infrared objects detection datasets demonstrated the mAP and the parameter quantities of CCLDet over popular object detectors.},

By enhancing the perceptual capabilities of the model to accurately anticipate the actions of vulnerable road users, the overall driving experience can be significantly improved, ensuring higher levels of safety. Existing research efforts focusing on the prediction of pedestrians’ crossing intentions have predominantly relied on vision-based deep learning models. However, these models continue to exhibit shortcomings in terms of robustness when faced with adverse weather conditions and domain adaptation challenges. Furthermore, little attention has been given to evaluating the real-time performance of these models. To address these aforementioned limitations, this study introduces an innovative framework for pedestrian crossing intention prediction. The framework incorporates an image enhancement pipeline, which enables the detection and rectification of various defects that may arise during unfavorable weather conditions. Subsequently, a transformer-based network, featuring a self-attention mechanism, is employed to predict the crossing intentions of target pedestrians. This augmentation enhances the model’s resilience and accuracy in classification tasks. Through evaluation on the Joint Attention in Autonomous Driving (JAAD) dataset, our framework attains state-of-the-art performance while maintaining a notably low inference time. Moreover, a deployment environment is established to assess the real-time performance of the model. The results of this evaluation demonstrate that our approach exhibits the shortest model inference time and the lowest end-to-end prediction time, accounting for the processing duration of the selected inputs.},

Therefore, establishing security measures against potential threats through trust assessment and trust authentication has become a key goal. Blockchain has the characteristics of traceability, anonymity, transparency, etc., and can achieve trust authentication for trust assessment. In our work, we propose a lightweight decentralized authentication and trust management scheme for edge AI-enabled CPSs that supports access control on the basis of extended chaotic maps, which meets the privacy and security needs of data transmission in a broader sense. Moreover, we develop a trust model for checking the trustworthiness of data collected by smart devices/sensor nodes. A formal security analysis is executed by utilizing the broadly applicable real-or-random (RoR) model. Our scheme, which is different from previous methods, combines high security with relatively low communication and computational costs. Through an informal security analysis, we verify that our proposal is in compliance with the security requirements and can withstand various forms of attacks. Furthermore, the functionality and performance analysis results indicate that our method is better suited for lightweight validation in CPS networks while providing a higher level of security than other methods.},

A new trajectory reconstruction algorithm is proposed to transform the CAN messages, specifically vehicle speed and accelerator pedal position, into weighted graphs accommodating various driving statuses. CAN-Trace identifies driving trajectories using graph-matching algorithms applied to the created graphs in comparison to road networks. We also design a new metric to evaluate matched candidates, which allows for potential data gaps and matching inaccuracies. Empirical validation under various real-world conditions, encompassing different vehicles and driving regions, demonstrates the efficacy of CAN-Trace: it achieves an attack success rate of up to 90.59% in the urban region, and 99.41% in the suburban region.},

  abstract     = {Deep graph convolutional networks (GCNs) have shown promising performance in traffic prediction tasks, but their practical deployment on resource-constrained devices faces challenges. First, few models consider the potential influence of historical and future auxiliary information, such as weather and holidays, on complex traffic patterns. Second, the computational complexity of dynamic graph convolution operations grows quadratically with the number of traffic nodes, limiting model scalability. To address these challenges, this study proposes a deep encoder-decoder model named AIMSAN, which comprises an auxiliary information-aware module (AIM) and a sparse cross-attention-based graph convolutional network (SAN). From historical or future perspectives, AIM prunes multi-attribute auxiliary data into diverse time frames, and embeds them into one tensor. SAN employs a cross-attention mechanism to merge traffic data with historical embedded data in each encoder layer, forming dynamic adjacency matrices. Subsequently, it applies diffusion GCN to capture rich spatial-temporal dynamics from the traffic data. Additionally, AIMSAN utilizes the spatial sparsity of traffic nodes as a mask to mitigate the quadratic computational complexity of SAN, thereby improving overall computational efficiency. In the decoder layer, future embedded data are fused with feed-forward traffic data to generate prediction results. Experimental evaluations on three public traffic datasets demonstrate that AIMSAN achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art algorithms, while reducing GPU memory consumption by 41.24%, training time by 62.09%, and validation time by 65.17% on average.},

  abstract     = {Autonomous vehicles (AVs) still pose challenges in improving intelligence, safety, and reliability in complex motorway scenarios. Recently, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has demonstrated superior decision-making capabilities in dynamic environments compared to rule-based methods. However, it requires considerable training resources due to a lack of innovative DRL component design (e.g., state space and reward) to link observation and action accurately. Its opaque nature may also result in hazardous driving conditions. In this paper, we introduce a hybrid autopilot framework that amalgamates three modules: (i) DRL is employed to build a smart, learnable, and scalable driving policy across various motorway scenarios; (ii) a kinematic-based co-pilot strategy is devised to bolster training efficiency and provide flexible decision-making guidance; and (iii) a rule-based system assesses and determines the final action outputs in real-time between itself and the DRL policy to further enhance safety. Extensive simulations are conducted under different complex motorway scenarios. The results indicate that the proposed framework surpasses the baseline DRL policy in terms of training efficiency, intelligence, safety, and reliability.},

To this end, a time-homogeneous preset-time algorithm is presented to coordinate multiple vehicles within an identical time window, where arrival time delays are used to characterize the arrival time of the vehicles. Consequently, the considered package delivery problem is formulated by two phases: “Active phase” and “Sleeping phase”, over which vehicles use the neighboring information to achieve coordination. For the proposed algorithm, we use Lyapunov based method to derive condition guaranteeing the coordination of vehicles, under a very mild communication topology condition. As an extension, a time-heterogeneous preset-time algorithm is designed. We demonstrate that coordination among vehicles is determined by the maximal preset-time. Built upon this observation, we further show that there is an equivalence between the proposed formulation and the dynamical equation of the interacting vehicles. Finally, a numerical example for a package delivery problem, comprised of two coordination phases, is carried out to illustrate the proposed preset-time coordination formulation, and the time-heterogeneous case is further discussed as well.},

  abstract     = {In urban areas, roads with dedicated cycle lanes play a vital role in cyclist safety. However, accidents can still occur when vehicles cross the cycle lane at intersections. Accidents mostly occur due to failure of the driver to see a cyclist on the cycle lane, particularly when the cyclist is going straight through the intersection, and the vehicle is turning. For safe driving, it is critical that the drivers visually scan the area in the vicinity of the junction and the car, particularly using the wing-mirror, prior to making turns. This paper describes results from a set of test drives using in-vehicle non-invasive eye-tracking and in-vehicle CAN bus sensors to determine driver behaviour. In total, 20 drivers were monitored through 5 different intersections with cycle lanes. The study found that approximately 83% of drivers did not check their wing mirror prior to, or during their turning manoeuvre, potentially putting pedestrian, cyclists, scooter and hoverboard users in danger. An algorithm was developed to analyse driver gaze during the turning manoeuvre to identify cases where they failed to look at the wing mirror. The gaze pattern and gaze concentration on the mirror helps to identify safe and unsafe driving behaviour. This information can then be used to improve Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems (ADAS) to create a safer environment for all road users.},

Currently, the optimization of multimodal transport solutions and the allocation of capacity are planned as two separate parts, and the research on customer classification of multimodal transport is insufficient. The current bottleneck in multimodal transportation systems is optimizing multimodal customer classification and transportation solutions. Additionally, such an optimization can significantly improve the system’s overall revenue. Based on the customer classification theory of revenue management, we classified and managed multimodal transport customers and allocated and priced the transportation capacity according to the demand characteristics and price sensitivities of different customers. Furthermore, we considered the impact of transportation scheme planning on the profit of multimodal transport. Accordingly, we developed a joint optimization model for multimodal transport schemes, capacity allocation, and pricing by considering the customer classification. We solved the model using a hybrid particle swarm algorithm and validated it using arithmetic examples. The results indicate that a customer classification strategy can significantly improve the profit of multimodal transport operators when customer demand is unstable, and the total profit of the transportation system is increased by 7%. Moreover, these results suggest combining transportation solution optimization with customer classification can lead to more profitable multimodal revenue management solutions. Thus, our results can guide multimodal operators for systematically dealing with the customer classification problem and optimizing transportation schemes while improving their profits. Moreover, this study offers a reference for decision-making in multimodal operation management.},

  abstract     = {Edge collaboration is expected to effectively relieve the load of base stations and enhance the driving experience of autonomous vehicles (AVs). However, in existing edge collaboration schemes, the frequent information exchange between AVs will consume a significant amount of resources. In addition, the existing schemes ignore the types of services, where services with different types may be combined into a composite service which affects the utility of AVs. To this end, we consider various types of services in autonomous vehicular networks (AVNs) and propose a digital twin (DT)-enabled edge collaboration scheme for composite services. Specifically, we first divide the DTs of service requesters (DT-SRs) into service request groups (SRGs) based on the same basic service requests and propose an architecture to facilitate the edge collaboration between the DTs of the leaders of SRGs (DT-L-SRGs) and the DTs of the service providers (DT-SPs). In this architecture, different service composition forms will result in different resource purchase strategies for DT-L-SRGs and different resource pricing strategies for DT-SPs. Therefore, we model the process of service composition as a coalition game to determine the optimal service composition form for each basic service. In the process of the coalition game, in order to obtain the optimal resource purchase strategy for each DT-L-SRG and the optimal resource pricing strategy for each DT-SP under different coalition structures, the interaction between the DT-L-SRGs and the DT-SPs is formulated as a Stackelberg game. By obtaining the game equilibrium, the optimal strategies of each DT-L-SRG and each DT-SP can be determined to measure the performance of the given coalition structure until a stable and optimal composite service structure is finally formed through multiple rounds of iterations. Compared with traditional schemes, the simulation results demonstrate that our scheme can bring the highest utilities to both the SRs and the SPs.},

  abstract     = {Automated Vehicle (AV) safety is a critical issue and appeals to worldwide focus. To ensure AV safety, AV functions should be tested and evaluated in an enormous number of scenarios. Since such AV testing is time-consuming, scenario filters have been developed to identify safety-critical scenarios and omit ordinary ones. However, the scenarios identified by these filters do not uniquely match the AV function to be tested and are most likely not critical for the AV function. Therefore, an enhanced scenario filter is proposed in this paper. It bears the following features: 1) Automated-driving-function-specific scenario identification; 2) High coverage of critical scenarios; 3) Enhanced identification efficiency by avoiding adopting a surrogate model; 4) High reliability of critical scenario identification. To enable the above features, the proposed filter formulates the identification problem into an optimization problem and solves it with a model-free approach. Experiments have been conducted to evaluate and validate the proposed filter. The results confirm that the proposed filter is able to improve coverage of critical scenarios, efficiency of identification, and reliability of identification compared to the state-of-the-art filter. Specifically, the proposed filter improves coverage by up to 70 percent, efficiency by up to 97 percent, and reliability by up to 22 percent. The results also reveal that the proposed filter shows an increasing advantage for testing AV functions with higher complexity.},

This method is applied to calibrate two car-following control models: linear control and model predictive control (MPC). The method is likelihood-function-free, where the likelihood function is replaced by simulation to approximate the posterior distribution of model parameters. This structure affords flexibility to calibrate posterior joint distributions of complex models, even those without analytical closed forms such as MPC. Two experiments were conducted to evaluate how well the proposed method reproduces: (i) marginal and joint distributions of model parameters, using synthetic data and (ii) vehicle trajectories (acceleration, speed, and position), using field data involving two commercial adaptive cruise control (ACC) systems. The results showed that the ABC method can reproduce marginal and joint distributions reasonably well for the linear controller as well as the non-analytical MPC-based controller, which was previously infeasible. The method can also robustly characterize the commercial ACC behavior at the trajectory level, which suggests that the simple linear controller better describes their behavior.},

  abstract     = {VSLAM is one of the key technologies for indoor mobile robots, used to perceive the surrounding environment, achieve accurate positioning and mapping. However, traditional VSLAM algorithms based on the assumption of a static environment still face certain challenges. The movement, occlusion, and appearance changes of dynamic objects can lead to feature point-matching errors, making data association difficult and causing biases in motion estimation. In order to address this challenge, this paper proposes a dynamic feature point removal method and a closed-loop detection method for high dynamic scenes, aiming to effectively improve the robustness and positioning accuracy in dynamic environments. First, the YOLOv7-tiny object detection network and LK optical flow algorithm are combined to detect the dynamic area, and the adaptive threshold keyframe selection method is adopted to solve the problem of poor quality of keyframe caused by the existing heuristic threshold selection method. Then, this paper proposes a dynamic keyframe sequence creation method based on the angle difference between keyframes, which reduces the workload of loop back detection and accelerates the efficiency of loop back detection in the system. Next, the ParC_NetVLAD image matching algorithm is proposed. In this paper, ConvNeXt-Tiny network is used for feature extraction of images, and ParC-Net network and CBAM attention mechanism are added to the feature extraction network. Finally, NetVLAD is used to cluster the extracted local features to obtain global features that can represent images. Experiments are conducted on public TUM RGB-D datasets and in real-world situations. The proposed algorithm reduces the ATE (Absolute Trajectory Error) by 96.4% and the RPE (Relative Trajectory Error) by 82.8% on average in highly dynamic scenarios. In the Pittsburgh30k dataset, the average accuracy of loop closure detection has been improved by 2.6%.},

  abstract     = {Traffic state prediction, a classical task for traffic management, is a central component of intelligent transport systems to maintain safe and efficient operation. While extensive and intensive research has been conducted on traffic state prediction, most studies have concentrated on enhancing the accuracy of specific traffic state parameters. However, traffic state is a co-evolutionary multivariate time series with various parameters such as flow, velocity, occupancy, etc. At the same time, traffic state data will inevitably be lost during collection. So accurate traffic prediction still faces the following challenges: First, how to deal with the complex missing situations in observational data? Second, how to learn the co-evolutionary relationships between different traffic state parameters while mining the high-dimensional spatio-temporal traffic state patterns? In this paper, we propose a mechanism-data blending-driven co-evolving traffic state parameter prediction method: multi-parameter hybrid tensor deep learning networks (MHT-Net), which consists of a multi-parameter tensor graph convolutional network (MTGCN) and a tensor recurrent neural network (T-RNN). MTGCN implements knowledge embedding of synergistic mechanisms between traffic parameters, ensuring that the road network spatial dependency and the synergistic influence relationship of the parameters can be obtained simultaneously; T-RNN is used to learn high-dimensional temporal features of traffic states. Experiment results on a real-world dataset from Jiangsu province outperform the state-of-the-art baselines, demonstrating the efficacy of the proposed method and providing an effective tool for traffic state prediction with missing values. A mechanism-data blending driven co-evolving traffic state parameter prediction method, multi-parameters hybrid tensor deep learning networks (MHT-Net) is proposed, which implements knowledge embedding of synergistic mechanisms between traffic parameters and learn the road network spatial dependency and the synergistic influence relationship of the parameters simultaneously.

However, existing methods generally ignore the impact of ground points. Although some traditional ground segmentation algorithms are available to remove ground point clouds, they usually suffer from over-segmentation, which leads to a sub-optimal and even worse performance for the downstream 3D detection task. We conduct an in-depth analysis and attribute this phenomenon to the reason that some crucial foreground points attached to the ground (e.g., the wheels of Cars, or the feet of Pedestrians) are directly removed due to over-segmentation. To this end, we propose a new Attached Point Restoring (APR) module to recover these discarded foreground points. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization of APR by integrating it into various ground segmentation algorithms to boost the performance or the running time of 3D detection on KITTI and Waymo datasets. Finally, we hope this paper can serve as a new guide to inspire future research in this field. Code is available at https://github.com/yhc2021/GPR.},

It models multi-agent trajectory interactions from both temporal and spatial perspectives using hypergraph structures, and optimizes the spatio-temporal hypergraph structure to enable fine-grained analysis of multi-agent trajectory motion intentions and high-order interactions. We employ OST-HGCN to a CVAE-based prediction framework, and use the optimized hypergraph structure to predict multi-agent plausible trajectories. We conduct extensive experiments on four real trajectory prediction datasets of NBA, NFL, SDD and ETH-UCY, and verify the effectiveness of the proposed OST-HGCN.},

  abstract     = {Collective spatial keyword query (CoSKQ) is an important variant of spatial keyword queries and has become a research hotspot. In real life, user behavior usually has a certain directionality, so they may want to obtain the result object that conforms to a specific direction, which is what the direction-constrained query studies. In addition, query time information also plays an important role in location-based query processing. To this end, this paper takes the lead in studying the Time-aware and Direction-constrained Collective Spatial Keyword Query (TDCoSKQ). To facilitate direction-related operations, space objects are organized using the polar coordinate system. Firstly, an efficient space partition method is designed, and on this basis, a new hybrid index structure KRPQT is designed. Based on KRPQT, several pruning strategies are proposed to prune irrelevant regions and objects from the perspective of keyword, time, and direction, and the basic algorithm KRPQB is proposed. To further improve the efficiency of query processing, the possible areas of the result objects are analyzed and shrunk to greatly reduce the number of candidate objects, and three optimization algorithms KRPSW, KRPSW+LFO, and KRPSW+KRPQB are proposed. Then, we discuss how to extend the proposed methods to deal with TDCoSKQ queries with other distance functions and TDCoSKQ queries with weight objects. Finally, the efficiency of the proposed algorithm is verified by simulation experiments.},

  abstract     = {Binocular stereo matching is a crucial task in autonomous driving for accurately estimating the depth information of objects and scenes. This task, however, is challenging due to various ill-posed regions within binocular image pairs, such as repeated textures and weak textures which present complex correspondences between the points. Existing methods extract features from binocular input images mainly by relying on deep convolutional neural networks with a substantial number of convolutional layers, which may incur high memory and computation costs, thus making it hard to deploy in real-world applications. Additionally, previous methods do not consider the correlation between view unary features during the construction of the cost volume, thus leading to inferior results. To address these issues, a novel lightweight binocular-separated feature extraction module is proposed that includes a view-shared multi-dilation fusion module and a view-specific feature extractor. Our method leverages a shallow neural network with a multi-dilation modeling module to provide similar receptive fields as deep neural networks but with fewer parameters and better computational efficiency. Furthermore, we propose incorporating the correlations of view-shared features to dynamically select view-specific features during the construction of the cost volume. Extensive experiments conducted on two public benchmark datasets show that our proposed method outperforms the deep model-based baseline method (i.e., 13.6% improvement on Scene Flow and 2.0% on KITTI 2015) while using 29.7% fewer parameters. Ablation experiments show that our method achieves superior matching performance in weak texture and edge regions. The source code will be made publicly available.},

  abstract     = {Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) aims to reconstruct the reward function from expert demonstrations to facilitate policy learning, and has demonstrated its remarkable success in imitation learning. To promote expert-like behavior, existing IRL methods mainly focus on learning global reward functions to minimize the trajectory difference between the imitator and the expert. However, these global designs are still limited by the redundant noise and error propagation problems, leading to the unsuitable reward assignment and thus downgrading the agent capability in complex multi-stage tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel Curricular Subgoal-based Inverse Reinforcement Learning (CSIRL) framework, that explicitly disentangles one task with several local subgoals to guide agent imitation. Specifically, CSIRL firstly introduces decision uncertainty of the trained agent over expert trajectories to dynamically select specific states as subgoals, which directly determines the exploration boundary of different task stages. To further acquire local reward functions for each stage, we customize a meta-imitation objective based on these curricular subgoals to train an intrinsic reward generator. Experiments on the D4RL and autonomous driving benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed methods yields results superior to the state-of-the-art counterparts, as well as better interpretability.

Firstly, the construction of the physical model of the vehicle system is carried out to obtain the coupling relationship between the components. Secondly, the coupling relationship between the components is embedded into the loss function of the deep neural network as physics-informed constraints. Further, the network parameters satisfying certain physical laws are obtained by minimizing the loss function. Finally, the proposed lightweight 3D convolutional neural network is used to predict the vibration state of the vehicle system. The dynamic response resulting from both the data-driven simulation model and the multi-body simulation model are investigated and compared. The simulation results show that the data-driven dynamics simulation model can accurately predict the vibration state of the vehicle system.

In the experimental study, a custom vehicle trajectory dataset extracted from roadside LiDAR data, along with the V2X-Seq-TFD dataset, was utilized for network training and testing. The optimal LSTM network obtained through Bayesian optimization was compared against two benchmark models: a handcrafted LSTM network and a Kalman filter with a 2D constant velocity motion model. The results demonstrate that the proposed deep learning-based framework, with robust hyperparameter selection through Bayesian optimization, yields more accurate and consistent prediction performance than the benchmark models.},

An expert driver model based on a multi-layer feed-forward neural network (MLFN) is developed to generate the reference steering angle for haptic assistance design. The individual driver’s arm characteristics are identified and incorporated into the adaptive haptic assistance controller design to generate personalized torque assistance, facilitating a typical driver to achieve the same trajectory-tracking performance as experts. The nonsingular fast terminal sliding mode (NFTSM) is applied to calculate the assistance torque to ensure the fast finite-time convergence and robustness of the system.

The process of generating the holograms so that they appear in a specific position in the world is also known as image registration. Since AR devices employ see-through Head-Mounted Displays, realistic image registration requires high-accuracy head tracking. Solutions exist in static environments where state-of-the-art simultaneous localization and mapping algorithms suffice. Vehicles are more challenging. In aerospace, costly optical-inertial tracking systems are regularly employed. This paper focuses instead on low-cost ground vehicles and proposes a solution that does not require aerospace-grade Inertial Measurement Units and is easily integrable on cars. The proposed solution, tested on a racing circuit, is based on passive markers and on the stereoscopic detection of the road plane on which the AR features are anchored.},

  abstract     = {Drowsy driving is one of the greatest threats to road safety, which increases the importance of intelligent systems that can monitor driver drowsiness. Electroencephalogram (EEG)–based monitoring systems have gained attention because EEG is known to directly measure brain activities that reflect the mental state of the driver. However, calibration is necessary before using the system because EEG signals vary between and within subjects. Therefore, generalized EEG-based drowsiness estimation has become challenging. In this paper, we propose an EEG-based driver drowsiness classification framework without the need for calibration, which can be generalized to unseen subjects. We augment the features of unseen domains (i.e., subjects) with a Dirichlet mixup between prototypes of source domains to complement other domain knowledge. The parameter $\boldsymbol {\alpha }$ vector of the Dirichlet distribution adjusts the intensity of the mixup, allowing for diverse enhancement. Furthermore, we utilize an auxiliary batch normalization module for augmented samples to avoid inaccurate estimation by the difference in distribution. The experiments were carried out using two EEG datasets, each measured using different drowsiness indicators, the Karolinska sleepiness scale, and reaction time. In leave-one-subject-out cross-validation, the proposed framework achieved outstanding performance in both datasets, an ${F}1$ -score of 62.69% and 70.33% and an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 71.73% and 73.80%, respectively. The experimental results demonstrate the potential for practical applications of brain-computer interfaces without calibration.},

If an AV can predict its surrounding vehicles’ future trajectories, it can make safe and efficient manoeuvre decisions. In this paper, we present a Deep Spatio-Temporal Context-Aware decision Network (DST-CAN) for predictive manoeuvre decisions for AVs on highways. DST-CAN has two main components, namely spatio-temporal context-aware map generator and predictive manoeuvre decisions engine. DST-CAN employ a memory neuron network to predict the future trajectories of its surrounding vehicles. Using look-ahead prediction and past actual trajectories, a spatio-temporal context-aware probability occupancy map is generated. These context-aware maps as input to a decision engine generate a safe and efficient manoeuvre decision. Here, CNN helps extract feature space, and two fully connected network generates longitudinal and lateral manoeuvre decisions. Performance evaluation of DST-CAN has been carried out using two publicly available NGSIM US-101 and I-80 highway datasets. A traffic rule is defined to generate ground truths for these datasets in addition to human decisions. Two DST-CAN models are trained using imitation learning with human driving decisions from actual traffic data and rule-based ground truth decisions. The performances of the DST-CAN models are compared with the state-of-the-art Convolutional Social-LSTM (CS-LSTM) models for manoeuvre prediction. The results clearly indicate that the context-aware maps help DST-CAN to predict the decision accurately over CS-LSTM. Further, an ablation study has been carried out to understand the effect of prediction horizons of performance and a robustness study to understand the near collision scenarios over actual traffic observations. The context-aware map with a 3 second prediction horizon is robust against near collision.},

  abstract     = {In the past decade, deep learning has been widely applied across various fields. However, its applicability in open-world scenarios is often limited due to the lack of quantifying uncertainty in both data and models. In recent years, a multitude of uncertainty quantification (UQ) approaches for neural networks have emerged and found applications in safety-critical domains such as autonomous vehicles and medical analysis. This paper aims to review the latest advancements in UQ methods and investigate their application specifically in the field of computer vision and autonomous vehicles. Initially, we identify several key qualifications, namely practicability, robustness, accuracy, scalability, and efficiency (referred to as PRASE), and employ them as evaluation criteria throughout this study. By considering these criteria as uniform measurements, we meticulously evaluate and compare the performance of different types of UQ methods, including Bayesian methods, ensemble methods, and single deterministic methods. Furthermore, we delve into the discussion of their application in diverse tasks within the autonomous vehicle domain, such as semantic segmentation, object detection, depth estimation, and end-to-end control. Through comprehensive analysis and comparison, we identify a range of challenges and propose future research directions in this field. Our findings shed light on the importance of addressing uncertainty quantification in deep learning models and provide insights into enhancing the reliability and performance of autonomous vehicles in real-world scenarios.},

  abstract     = {Detecting small objects in optical images and videos is a significant challenge in numerous intelligent transportation and autonomous systems. State-of-the-art generic object detection methods fail to accurately localize and identify such small objects (e.g., pedestrians, small vehicles, obstacles). Because small objects occupy only a small area in the input image (e.g., $32 \times 32$ pixels or less), the information extracted from such a small area is not always rich enough to support decision-making. Multidisciplinary strategies are being developed by researchers working at the interface of deep learning and computer vision to enhance the performance of Small Object Detection (SOD). In this paper, we provide a comprehensive review of over 160 research papers published between 2017 and 2022 in order to survey this growing subject. This paper summarizes the existing literature and provides a taxonomy that illustrates the broad picture of current research. We further explore methods to boost the performance of small object detection in maritime settings, where enhanced performance is crucial for ensuring safety and managing traffic. Detecting small objects in the maritime environment requires additional considerations and the current survey aims to review the advanced techniques addressing those aspects. In addition, the popular SOD datasets for generic and maritime applications are discussed, and also well-known evaluation metrics for the state-of-the-art methods on some of the datasets are provided.

  abstract     = {Providing various infotainment services is essential for improving road safety and the overall driving experience in vehicular networks. However, supporting such services in vehicular named data networking (VNDN) environments poses significant challenges due to data broadcast phenomenon, vehicle mobility, and diverse Quality of Service (QoS) requirements. This paper proposes a first comprehensive framework covering data packet format/infotainment service categorization, queuing policy, adaptive forwarding, and mobility management in order to offer overall insight into infotainment services in VNDN. We introduce a class identifier in the data packet format to indicate the class of infotainment data into critical information, non-critical information, and entertainment categories. Advanced push-based data forwarding and Enhanced pull-based data forwarding schemes are proposed to adaptively serve information and entertainment data, respectively. For better seamless mobility and handover support, an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) based vehicle location estimation technique is proposed. Enhanced Weighted Fair Queuing (EWFQ) is adapted for priority-based data forwarding. Extensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly improves infotainment delivery in highly dynamic VNDN environments compared to legacy fragment schemes. Our proposed framework demonstrates performance improvements in various key metrics compared to legacy fragment VNDN schemes. Specifically, our framework reduced the redundant data packets by 15-25%, latency by 7-10%, and increased data delivery by 15-18% under dynamic vehicular scenarios. Lastly, the paper systematically addresses issues for comprehensive infotainment services in the VNDN environment, based on lessons learned mostly from our framework design, and their challenges for better infotainment services.},

  abstract     = {Multiple federated learning (FL) methods are proposed for traffic flow forecasting (TFF) to avoid heavy-transmission and privacy-leaking concerns resulting from the disclosure of raw data in centralized methods. However, these FL methods adopt offline learning which may yield subpar performance, when concept drift occurs, i.e., distributions of historical and future data vary. Online learning can detect concept drift during model training, thus more applicable to TFF. Nevertheless, the existing federated online learning method for TFF fails to efficiently solve the concept drift problem and causes tremendous computing and communication overhead. Therefore, we propose a novel method named Resource-Efficient Federated Online Learning (REFOL) for TFF, which guarantees prediction performance in a communication-lightweight and computation-efficient way. Specifically, we design a data-driven client participation mechanism to detect the occurrence of concept drift and determine clients’ participation necessity. Subsequently, we propose an adaptive online optimization strategy, which guarantees prediction performance and meanwhile avoids meaningless model updates. Then, a graph convolution-based model aggregation mechanism is designed, aiming to assess participants’ contribution based on spatial correlation without importing extra communication and computing consumption on clients. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on real-world datasets to demonstrate the superiority of REFOL in terms of prediction improvement and resource economization.},

  abstract     = {Treating each intersection as basic agent, multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) methods have emerged as the predominant approach for distributed adaptive traffic signal control (ATSC) in multi-intersection scenarios, such as arterial coordination. MARL-based ATSC currently faces two challenges: disturbances from the control policies of other intersections may impair the learning and control stability of the agents; and the heterogeneous features across intersections may complicate coordination efforts. To address these challenges, this study proposes a novel MARL method for distributed ATSC in arterials, termed the Distributed Controller for Heterogeneous Intersections (DCHI). The DCHI method introduces a Neighborhood Experience Sharing (NES) framework, wherein each agent utilizes both local data and shared experiences from adjacent intersections to improve its control policy. Within this framework, the neural networks of each agent are partitioned into two parts following the Knowledge Homogenizing Encapsulation (KHE) mechanism. The first part manages heterogeneous intersection features and transforms the control experiences, while the second part optimizes homogeneous control logic. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed DCHI achieves efficiency improvements in average travel time of over 30% compared to traditional methods and yields similar performance to the centralized sharing method. Furthermore, vehicle trajectories reveal that DCHI can adaptively establish green wave bands in a distributed manner. Given its superior control performance, accommodation of heterogeneous intersections, and low reliance on information networks, DCHI could significantly advance the application of MARL-based ATSC methods in practice.},

  abstract     = {Traffic flow analysis is revolutionising traffic management. By leveraging traffic flow data, traffic control bureaus could provide drivers with real-time alerts, advising the fastest routes and therefore optimising transportation logistics and reducing congestion. The existing traffic flow datasets have two major limitations. They feature a limited number of classes, usually limited to one type of vehicle, and the scarcity of unlabelled data. In this paper, we introduce a new benchmark traffic flow image dataset called TrafficCAM. Our dataset distinguishes itself by two major highlights. Firstly, TrafficCAM provides both pixel-level and instance-level semantic labelling along with a large range of types of vehicles and pedestrians. It is composed of a large and diverse set of video sequences recorded in streets from eight Indian cities with stationary cameras. Secondly, TrafficCAM aims to establish a new benchmark for developing fully-supervised tasks, and importantly, semi-supervised learning techniques. It is the first dataset that provides a vast amount of unlabelled data, helping to better capture traffic flow qualification under a low-cost annotation requirement. More precisely, our dataset has 4,364 image frames with semantic and instance annotations along with 58,689 unlabelled image frames. We validate our new dataset through a large and comprehensive range of experiments on several state-of-the-art approaches under four different settings: fully-supervised semantic and instance segmentation, and semi-supervised semantic and instance segmentation tasks.

A large service coverage and fast accident information diffusion RSU deployment solution can reliably ensure the ITS’ quality of service. Simultaneously, with the development of the city and the ITS, changes in traffic flow lead to RSU load imbalance, which will reduce the benefit of the original RSU deployment, and it is necessary to adjust RSU locations with minimal cost. Besides, due to the high visibility of the ITS, RSUs are highly susceptible to external attacks, which is commonly overlooked in existing RSU deployment work. Specifically, Sybil attack is one of the most dangerous attacks against ITS, and it can reshape the network state by forging multiple identities, interfering with risk sensing, etc. Motivated by these, we respectively propose the PSO-meme joint heuristic deployment algorithm (PJHDA) and the heuristic RSU multi-objective adaptation adjustment algorithm (HRMA3) to carry out deployment and adaptation adjustment of the city’s RSUs, taking into account the constraint of Sybil attack detection. Numerical results demonstrate that the multi-attribute performance of PJHDA is superior to the existing schemes. Compared with benchmark schemes, the HRMA3 excels in achieving advanced service coverage and load balancing while controlling costs, and both proposed schemes exhibit higher Sybil attack detection rate.},

Recent video-based taillight recognition methods outperform earlier image-based approaches. However, they face challenges in efficiently integrating spatiotemporal information and managing high computational costs. In this paper, we introduce ETR, an accurate and efficient Transformer-based video classification model designed to enhance taillight recognition. Specifically, we first design a lightweight backbone to extract temporal and spatial features from videos and generate queries with prior information. Next, we develop a hierarchical progressive Transformer decoder that integrates feature maps from different levels of the backbone to enhance the model’s global information. Finally, we employ a classification head to predict the taillight state of the video. Additionally, we introduce a public dataset, ETR-Taillights, to address the current lack of open datasets for vehicle taillight recognition. The dataset contains 28,799 dashcam video clips, making it the largest public taillight recognition dataset. Experiments show that our method achieves a 91.69% F-measure on the ETR-Taillights dataset, surpassing the latest taillight recognition methods, VIF by 6.94% and CNN-LSTM by 10.82%. Additionally, it achieves an inference speed of 45.06 FPS, being 3.6 times faster than VIF. Furthermore, we conduct real-world road tests to demonstrate our method’s robustness and effectiveness in practical scenarios.

This widespread use has spurred significant research interest in the integrated production and transportation scheduling problem, particularly in job shop environments. However, current research often fails to adequately leverage domain knowledge, leading to algorithms that struggle to find high-quality solutions for large-scale problems. To address this issue, this paper proposes a knowledge-driven hybrid algorithm (KDHA). The domain knowledge incorporated in the KDHA includes: 1) three critical path-based neighborhood structures for comprehensive neighborhood solution searches, 2) three neighborhood cropping methods to avoid ineffective searches for poor solutions, and 3) a new fast evaluation method to enhance the efficiency of neighborhood solution searching. Additionally, a new encoding method is introduced to achieve a one-to-one mapping between the chromosome and the disjunctive graph, allowing valuable information from neighborhood solutions to contribute to the algorithm’s evolution. Comparative experiments between the proposed algorithm and other state-of-the-art approaches are conducted on the small-scale EX and large-scale SWV benchmarks. The results demonstrate that the proposed KDHA is able to output better solutions efficiently and consistently, and updates the best solutions of all 20 SWV instances.},

Nevertheless, dealing with missing data poses a significant challenge for the intelligent traffic system (ITS). To address this issue, this study employs a nonconvex smoothly clipped absolute deviation (SCAD) penalty customized for tensors to surrogate tensor rank and incorporates the deep plug-and-play (PnP) prior into the low-rank tensor completion (LRTC) model. An efficient iterative framework is formulated to integrate these penalties into the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) method. Moreover, two imputation methods, namely LRTC-SCAD and LRTC-SCAD-DeepPnP, are developed, affirming that the LRTC-SCAD method ensures convergence to the global optimum. We conduct simulated experiments using real-world traffic datasets, and our proposed methods outperform state-of-the-art imputation methods. For instance, on the Portland dataset, LRTC-SCAD achieves a noteworthy 9.86% improvement in mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) compared to the cutting-edge LRTC method while consuming only 28.26% of its total running time. Similarly, on the PeMS dataset, LRTC-SCAD-DeepPnP achieves an average 11.59% enhancement in MAPE, with visually compelling improvements in imputation results, further validating its efficacy in maintaining local consistency.

  abstract     = {Accurately predicting the actions of vulnerable road users (VRUs) is crucial for improving traffic flow and enhancing VRU safety. The unpredictable nature of VRU trajectories poses a significant challenge. To address this, we introduce the Probabilistic Multimodal Trajectory Prediction Network (PMTPN), which effectively forecasts multimodal trajectories and their corresponding probabilities by utilizing a multitask learning framework that integrates trajectory and probability predictions. The network processes diverse input modalities, including bounding boxes, pedestrian pose, and ego-vehicle motion information. We enhance prediction performance by employing specialized encoders to extract distinct features from these inputs and a fusion module to integrate the data efficiently. To manage the variability in pedestrian actions, our model incorporates learnable motion queries that serve as reference points for predicting various potential outcomes. These queries are iteratively refined through attention operations with historical context in a multi-layer decoder. Additionally, a multi-gate mixture-of-experts (MMoE) module within the decoder helps mitigate the challenges of multitask learning. Our method significantly enhances trajectory prediction accuracy and provides probabilities for each predicted trajectory, demonstrating state-of-the-art results on the JAAD and PIE datasets.},

  abstract     = {Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks (VANETs) play a critical role in enabling communication among intelligent vehicles, yet their dynamic and decentralized nature makes them highly vulnerable to cyber-attacks. Traditional Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) provide limited defense against these evolving threats, as they rely on static rules or machine learning (ML) models that lack the capacity for real-time updates. The Incremental Lifetime Learning IDS (ILL-IDS) was introduced to address this limitation by enabling adaptive learning of new attack types. However, ILL-IDS depends heavily on large volumes of high-quality labeled data, making the model update process costly and labor-intensive. In response, this study proposes the Automatic Incremental Lifetime Learning IDS (AILL-IDS), a novel IDS framework that significantly reduces the need for labeled data through incremental semi-supervised learning. This approach not only enables AILL-IDS to detect unknown attacks and adapt its model dynamically with minimal labeled data but also ensures continuous detection during the model update process, enhancing both speed and accuracy in threat detection. Experimental results demonstrate that AILL-IDS achieves a high detection rate of 0.97 and an average F1 score of 0.90, using only 5.5% labeled data, thereby offering an efficient and scalable solution for securing VANETs against emerging cyber threats.},

  abstract     = {The analysis of traffic situations under abnormal conditions is one of the bottleneck issues in Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). Influenced by the suddenness, randomness, and uncertainty, this issue is challenging to achieve through existing deep learning methods. It needs to be assisted by traffic simulation models for analysis. However, simulation models always require extensive scene modeling and calibration, making it difficult to meet the demands of natural human-machine interaction in the AIGC (Artificial Intelligence Generated Content) era, as well as the need for rapid and flexible implementation of situation analysis. With the accumulation of traffic data, the emergence of diffusion models offers a new entry point for the core method of data-driven analysis, namely Text-to-Traffic Generation (TTG). In this work, we explore how generative models combined with text describing the traffic system can be applied for traffic situation generation, and propose ChatTraffic, the first diffusion model for TTG. To guarantee the consistency between synthetic and real data, we augment a diffusion model with the Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) to extract spatial correlations of traffic data. In addition, we construct a large-scale dataset containing text-traffic pairs for TTG. We benchmarked ChatTraffic qualitatively and quantitatively on the released dataset. The experimental results indicate that ChatTraffic can rapidly and flexibly generate realistic traffic situations from text, which have practical significance in addressing bottlenecks in ITS.

  abstract     = {The rapid expansion and intelligent development of railway infrastructure are driving significant growth in railway engineering data. For the dispersed users across railway networks’ complex topology, traditional centralized storage systems are insufficient for their low-latency, cost-efficient data retrieval. Existing edge caching solutions based on multi-agent reinforcement learning fail to address the asymmetric relationships among railway nodes, such as data centers, stations, and sections, etc. Besides, the complexity of computing Nash equilibrium points also gets higher as the number of agents (edge caching servers) increases. This study introduces a Hierarchical Game model-based MADRL-driven Collaborative Edge Caching method(HG-MCEC) tailored for railway engineering data. By considering the distribution characteristics and caching strategy games among railway nodes, a hierarchical game model for collaborative edge caching is constructed. This model treats the railway edge caching as a multi-agent system, in which each railway node server is regarded as an agent. HG-MCEC utilizes deep learning to mitigate computational complexity and recognize agents’ asymmetry. Upper-level agents adjust cache replacement strategies according to environmental changes and decisionmaking experience. Lower-level agents, under the guidance of upper-level decisions, optimize collaborative caching strategies toward achieving hierarchical game equilibrium. Using a highspeed railway building information modeling data for validation, the method significantly outperforms existing approaches by enhancing content hit rates and reducing latency at edge caching servers while decreasing system content transmission costs.},

The binary interactions of CAVs with each capability are examined in detail. This paper analyzes nudging strategies, social coordination games, and full cooperation, deriving the corresponding evolution equations for average speed. Additionally, this paper studies the hydrodynamic model incorporating nudging force and its efficiency relative to traffic density. The impact of social value orientation on equilibrium speed at varying densities is also analyzed. Finally, this paper compares the equilibrium speed of CAV traffic flow under new capabilities with conventional traffic flow, finding that CAVs with these new capabilities exhibit higher equilibrium speeds, with nudging force yielding the highest speeds.

For inherent contradiction between body vibration and suspension chatter space, nonlinear filtering coordinated strategy with variable cut-off frequency is tailored to synthesize controlled variable composed of body and filtered tire displacements to realize smooth switch between hard and soft suspension under large/small suspension deformation. For the transmission congestion of control signals, event-triggered scheme relying on active force is designed to flexibly regulate command release interval to save communication resource and guarantee vibration suppression capability under abrupt road disturbance. To further improve convergence abilities of encapsulated variable and mitigate deterioration of performances from sparse control command, finite-time prescribed performance control is proposed to ensure transient and steady-state performance by accelerating convergence of controlled error to small region within preset time. For reconstructed active suspension system with unknown body weight, step control inputs with estimated weight are generated by employing event-based adaptive sliding-mode control to improve ride comfort and enhance handling properties. Additionally, global stability of networked active suspension system is proved by Lyapunov theory. Finally, the effectiveness and benefits of the proposed control method in real leaf spring suspension system are demonstrated by the simulation and hardware-in-the-loop tests.},

Initially, the fuzzy Q-learning method is proposed to select suitable reference signals for oxygen excess ratio (OER) and pressure to maximize net power. Additionally, to coordinate the air compressor and flow valve, an adaptive neural network control scheme is suggested for the multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) air management system. Furthermore, a prescribed performance function is devised to ensure minimal overshoot and rapid convergence for OER and pressure tracking. Through a sequence of simulations and hardware-in-loop (HIL) tests, the proposed control strategy is shown to effectively optimize net power under diverse operating conditions, exhibiting superior transient and steady-state performance compared to conventional methods. Quantitative comparisons further demonstrate the superiority of reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms and adaptive control techniques in enhancing both power and control system performance.},

  abstract     = {Existing domain generalization semantic segmentation (DGSS) methods have achieved remarkable performance on unseen domains by generating stylized images to increase the diversity of training data. However, since the training data is usually class-imbalanced, uniform style randomization is unable to generate diverse minority classes. This means that models may overfit to the minority classes, resulting in suboptimal performance on the minority classes. In addition, the image-level style randomization may also corrupt the class-discriminative regions of objects, leading to a loss of the class-discriminative representation. To address these issues, a novel class-balanced sampling and discriminative stylization (CSDS) approach is proposed for DGSS. Specifically, first, a pixel-level class-balanced sampling (PCS) strategy is proposed to adaptively sample patches of the minority classes from the source domain images and paste the sampled patches on the input images. Unlike existing class sampling strategies that fix the minority classes, the PCS strategy dynamically determines the minority classes by estimating the class distribution after each sampling. Then, a class-discriminative style randomization (CSR) strategy is proposed to increase the style diversity of the sampled patches while preserving the class-discriminative regions. Finally, since the pasting positions of the sampled patches are uncertain, which may confuse the semantic relations between the classes, a semantic consistency constraint is proposed to ensure the learning of reliable semantic relations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves superior performance compared to existing DGSS methods on multiple benchmarks.

Additionally, a Swin Transformer extracts the relative positional relationships in the BEV projection, facilitating a comprehensive understanding of the scene. The fusion of data from both branches via a multisource feature fusion module, which employs a context aggregation mechanism based on a residual structure, allows for robust local to global contextual understanding.

This indicates that more states are involved in the synchronization regulation, which thus provides the ability of enhancing synchronous performance. Meanwhile, a novel fast finite-time observation approach is proposed and designed for each actuator to compensate the uncertainties of forces and flow rates, and eliminate the load variation caused by different loads and disturbances of two actuators. The proposed observer converges faster than traditional ones with exponential or asymptotic rates benefiting from the homogeneity technique. It is also proved that the proposed control scheme can ensure both synchronizing and tracking errors to exponentially converge to an adjustable compact set or zero when the system is only subject to constant disturbances.

This paper proposes INF-PCA, an interactive point cloud semantic annotation method based on implicit neural field, which allows users to achieve high-quality, large-scene and fast-response semantic annotation with only a few dozen mouse clicks. Firstly, the appearance, geometry and semantics of the point clouds are jointly represented by an implicit neural field, which maps a 3D spatial coordinate to its corresponding attributes. Secondly, an uncertainty-based semantic entropy loss and a supervoxel-based local consistency loss are designed to force the network to produce deterministic predictions with local consistency, thus generating smoother and more accurate boundaries. Furthermore, an active learning-based strategy for click-free annotation is proposed and analyzed to further reduce annotation pressure. Comprehensive experiments on multiple datasets including the road scene dataset Toronto3D revealed that INF-PCA can achieve more accurate annotations with faster response speed and only half of the clicks employed by the state-of-the-art methods, and that INF-PCA can be directly applied to intelligent transportation applications such as interactive segmentation of road scenes, inventory of transportation infrastructure assets, and production of high-definition map.},

Conventionally, urban mobility data has been structured as spatiotemporal videos, treating longitude and latitude grids as fundamental pixels. Consequently, video prediction methods, relying on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs), have been instrumental in this domain. In our research, we introduce a fresh perspective on urban mobility prediction. Instead of oversimplifying urban mobility data as traditional video data, we regard it as a complex multivariate time series. This perspective involves treating the time-varying values of each grid in each channel as individual time series. To tackle the prediction of these time series, we present the Super-Multivariate Urban Mobility Transformer (SUMformer), which utilizes a specially designed attention mechanism to calculate temporal and cross-variable correlations and reduce computational costs stemming from a large number of time series. SUMformer also employs low-frequency filters to extract essential information for long-term predictions. Furthermore, SUMformer is structured with a temporal patch merge mechanism, forming a hierarchical framework that enables the capture of multi-scale correlations. Consequently, it excels in urban mobility pattern modeling and long-term prediction, outperforming current state-of-the-art methods across five real-world datasets.

Current approaches primarily focus on minimizing background interference in images, often overlooking the importance of edge information. In response, this paper introduces the edge-guided multi-loss network (EdgeUNet) designed for drivable area and lane segmentation. EdgeUNet employs an encoder for feature extraction and a decoder specifically tailored for the segmentation tasks. The decoder incorporates a novel feature fusion module (FFM), multi-scale feature aggregation module (MFSA), edge extraction module (EEM), and edge-aware optimization module (EAO), facilitating efficient extraction and supervision through edge information. Our model demonstrates superior performance on the Berkeley deep drive (BDD100K) dataset, achieving state-of-the-art results with 99.3% mean pixel accuracy (mPA) and 54.8% mean intersection-over-union (MIoU) in the lane detection task. Additionally, ablation studies conducted on the TuSimple and KITTI datasets further validate the effectiveness and generalizability of EdgeUNet.},

  abstract     = {As the adoption of electric vehicles continues to grow, the demand for extensive charging infrastructure in urban areas is concurrently rising. In response to the evolving charging infrastructure shortage, private charging piles have emerged as crucial supplementary energy sources, especially in areas lacking public charging infrastructure. The sharing of private charging piles, however, introduces several challenges. Notably, the variable availability time and extremely limited usage space of private charging piles pose scheduling complexities for charging pile owners. Furthermore, the completely peer-to-peer operation of private charging piles may lead to suboptimal solutions for fulfilling overall charging demand. To comprehensively address these challenges, we explore the potential for cooperation among geographically proximate charging piles. We introduce a novel online booking mechanism paired with specialized scheduling algorithms designed for scenarios involving both multiple private charging piles and single private charging piles. Our objective is to maximize the attained revenue of charging pile owners under fully dynamic conditions on both the supply and demand sides. Through meticulous theoretical proofs, we show that our mechanism achieves advantageous competitive ratios for both scenarios when compared to the offline optimal solutions. Numerous experiments, conducted with real charging sessions, consistently demonstrate that the proposed mechanism achieves the highest revenue, providing substantial evidence for its superior performance.},

  abstract     = {In conventional vehicular edge computing (VEC), vehicles at edge nodes often face issues such as congestion and overhead, particularly when numerous vehicles offload their tasks to a single edge node. This scenario results in heightened processing delays and increased energy consumption. Additionally, the unpredictability of the task offloading process at the edge node presents a major challenge for vehicles in determining their offloading strategies within a dynamic environment. In this paper, we propose a jointed approach for task offloading and resource allocation aimed at minimizing the overall latency and energy consumption of all vehicles. This is accomplished through task profiling, channel allocation, and resource distribution for both vehicles and roadside units (RSUs). We introduce a framework for partial task offloading and resource allocation based on a decentralized learning algorithm known as the Distributed Partial Task Offloading and Resource Allocation (DPTORA) scheme. This approach provides flexibility in task processing, allowing each vehicle to choose whether to execute its task locally, partially offload it, or distribute it among multiple RSUs using vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) connections in a dense network. We develop algorithms based on the Generalist Pursuit Learning Algorithm (GPLA) and the Distributed Partial Task Offloading (DPTO) scheme to effectively address the optimization problem. Additionally, we provide a sub-optimal solution with low computational complexity. Extensive simulations validate the effectiveness of our proposed scheme in decreasing time latency and energy consumption while facilitating partial task offloading and resource allocation through a decentralized learning Approach in dynamic VEC networks.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, a microscopic right-of-way trading mechanism (Micro-ROWTM) is developed to encourage cooperative behavior in mixed traffic, which consists of cooperative vehicles (CoVs) and non-cooperative vehicles (NCoVs). Micro-ROWTM encompasses the following functions: (i) detection of traffic conflicts and system-improving opportunities; (ii) participants reporting their attributes; (iii) right-of-way trade proposed by the system; and (iv) trade settlement and cooperative control. In the experiments, the proposed mechanism is tested using an illustrative ramp-merging example, in which each right-of-way trade proposal is offered to a group of participants comprised of a mainline leader, a mainline follower, and a ramp vehicle. Upon the acceptance of a proposal, the mainline leader and/or mainline follower agrees to behave cooperatively (yield) to the ramp vehicle, and receive monetary compensation from the ramp vehicle in return. To help design the trading mechanism, six important definitions are introduced and discussed, including (i) strong individual rationality, (ii) system efficiency and group efficiency, (iii) dominant-strategy incentive compatibility, (iv) social welfare maximization, (v) utilitarian envy minimization and (vi) payoff difference minimization. A linear programming-based trading and taxation model which satisfies the above definitions is then developed and solved. Using the Micro-ROWTM, when the flow rate is 1000veh/h for both the mainline and ramp traffic, the ramp vehicles can save 6.8% travel time and 27.4% fuel consumption on average, and the mainline vehicles can eventually obtain a positive payoff by compensation. From a system perspective, the ramp-merging section can save 107.5s of travel time and 2450.3g of fuel consumption per hour.},

First, a mathematical model of fuel cell hybrid electric vehicles and their power systems is constructed, and convolutional neural networks are used to classify road surfaces. Next, a Markov decision process that matches the obstacle avoidance decision scenarios is systematically established, and a deep reinforcement learning approach is employed to design the decision threshold for obstacle avoidance decisions. Finally, the quadratic programming algorithm is introduced to optimize a coarse velocity profile based on light decision-making, and the original energy management system cost function is convex optimized. Simulation results show that compared with the 3-second rule method, the proposed eco-driving approach not only ensures vehicle safety in obstacle avoidance but also provides more stable state of charge under varying road conditions. Additionally, hydrogen consumption savings improved by 2.16% to 9.67% across different test scenarios.},

  abstract     = {Current literature has identified several issues with centralized mobility management in 5G-based Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), where 5G-enabled vehicles are expected to exhibit varying mobility patterns. So, distributed mobility management (DMM), where control plane mobility anchors work in a distributed fashion, is of keen interest to current researchers. Although existing DMM solutions, such as distributed mobile IPv6 (DMIPv6), distributed proxy MIPv6 (DPMIPv6), distributed mobility management software defined networking (SDN-DMM), distributed routing (D-Routing), and their derivatives appear to work fine in evolving 5G-based ITS, they cannot be applied directly. Further, to gauge their adaptability to different ITS scenarios, a thorough investigation of their performances is very much needed. Our key contributions in this paper include investigating DMM issues in 5G-based ITS scenarios, porting DMM schemes in 5G ITS, and developing a Markov model to evaluate handoff performance. The results show that DMIPv6 and DPMIPv6 outperform SDN-DMM and D-Routing in terms of end-to-end delay and signaling cost, with the latter increasing delay by 6-23% and signaling cost by 135% and 78%, respectively. However, SDN-DMM and D-Routing excel in packet loss ratio (15-20% lower), throughput (20-25% higher), and packet delivery cost (40% lower). In edge cloud flow mobility, SDN-DMM and D-Routing show better packet loss ratio as packet loss is caused by servers’ sensitive application delays rather than handoffs.},

However, in most existing studies, trained agents exhibit poor transferability in scenarios with varying vehicle turning ratios, and the switching rules for the signal stage sequence do not align with the actual traffic demands. To address these issues, this paper presents action masking based proximal policy optimization with the dual-ring phase structure (AMPPO-DR), a novel ATSC model based on DRL that can simultaneously optimize the stage sequence and duration. Specifically, we consider the correlation between states and actions and utilize intersection channelization to predict vehicle turning directions. Moreover, we define the action as selecting the next green stage and establish variable-stage-sequence constraint rules on the basis of the dual-ring phase structure. To satisfy the constraints on the stage sequence, we propose the AMPPO algorithm, which dynamically adjusts the policy network outputs to mask invalid stages in real time. The simulation experiments demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively adapt to changing turning flows, enabling flexible and rational stage switching and ultimately increasing traffic efficiency.},

This study addresses the need for personalized path planning by introducing a multi-source off-road potential field (MOPF) method that quantifies risk and impediments in off-road settings based on internal and external characteristics. Specifically, Vehicle capability boundaries are defined by longitudinal dynamics analysis of the ego-vehicle to prevent instability due to insufficient driving force and limited adhesion conditions. A novel Non-Uniform Safety Margin Expression (NSME) is proposed to adjust the MOPF, allowing it to consider the vehicle’s state to enhance travel efficiency and minimize detours. The MOPF can be adapted according to the characteristics of the ego vehicle, drivers, and cargo. To incorporate driving styles, the Driving Style Probabilistic Roadmap (DSPRM) algorithm is developed, leading to smoother and more personalized paths. Comparative tests demonstrate that our method enables personalized path planning, achieving an average reduction of 10.29% in path length and 30.83% in path slope compared to traditional planning methods, while maintaining a safe distance from obstacles.},

Considering the simultaneous route-and-departure-time choice dynamic user equilibrium (DUE), this paper presents a noncooperative framework targeting the economic-emission coordinated operation of the transportation-microgrid coupled system. This framework is a Nash-Stackelberg-Nash game, where the leader problem is an economic-emission scheduling model of MGs and the follower problem is a DUE model of DTA for the TN. The best response algorithm is adopted to solve this framework. The DUE model is converted into an equivalent fixed-point problem, while the economic-emission scheduling model of each MG is reformulated as a multi-objective mixed-integer nonlinear program (MOMINLP). Moreover, we develop an alternating operator evolutionary algorithm (AOEA) to handle this MOMINLP.

SD-SMC consists of dual-layer sliding mode controllers, a delay-compensated low-pass filter, and a forgetting least-squares estimator. Compared with existing control systems, SD-SMC can achieve high performance under large model uncertainties and disturbances with relatively low control voltages, and meanwhile, the control chattering and overshooting issues can be well mitigated. Both numerical and experimental examples are investigated to validate the proposed control system.},

The problem formulation includes a convenient approach for the linearization and discretization of the path system dynamics. Unlike most state-of-the-art approaches, the proposed method does not need to constrain the path shape to pre-defined polynomial primitives and does not perform inefficient grid searches over sets of candidate maneuvers. Instead, it can directly optimize path curvature, while fulfilling path smoothness and trajectory constraints. We tested the proposed methods in a racing simulation environment, and compared its results with a benchmark algorithm. The results show the algorithm’s ability to return nearly curvature-optimal solutions while maintaining real-time feasibility.

However, due to the inability to determine the location of NLoS vehicles in previous studies, it has not been possible to construct a sound-based active emergency braking system. This paper introduces a novel approach for localization of vehicles approaching in NLoS regions through sound. Specifically, a new particle filter method incorporating Acoustic-Spatial Pseudo-Likelihood (ASPLE) has been proposed to track objects using both acoustic and spatial information from the ego vehicle. Also, the Acoustic Recognition based Invisible-target Localization (ARIL) dataset, which is the firstly providing the location of the NLoS vehicle as ground truth using Bird’s Eye View camera, is proposed. The proposed method is validated using two datasets: the ARIL dataset and the Occluded Vehicle Acoustic Detection Dataset (OVAD) dataset. The proposed method exhibited remarkable performance in localizing NLoS targets in both datasets, predicting the location of the vehicle in the NLoS region. Lastly, the analysis of how the reflection of sound affects to the proposed method, highlighting variations based on the spatial situations, and demonstrate the empirical convergence of the method is described.

Additionally, the original SE in traffic flow measurement exhibits low-frequency characteristics due to computational complexity. Considering these limitations, this paper proposes a fast and efficient anomaly detection framework for SE in traffic flow measurement. Initially, an attention-based spatiotemporal graph convolutional network (ASTGCN) model is utilized to extract both temporal and spatial features of SE. The ASTGCN model is trained using quantile regression, relying solely on normal samples during training. This approach eliminates the need for collecting anomalous samples and reduces computational demands. The model establishes a safe interval for SE that significantly improves anomaly detection capabilities. Furthermore, a teacher-student network is implemented, where the teacher network, trained offline, distills its ability to convert low-frequency SE data into high-frequency representations into a simpler student network. The student network executes real-time reconstruction of high-frequency SE, thus enhancing the precision of anomaly detection without substantial resource expenditure. Finally, the analysis conducted on the California’s 7th district highway measurement system demonstrates the proposed method’s ability to accurately detect anomalous SE in traffic flow measurement.},

  abstract     = {As an emerging technology, Digital Twin (DT) can provide a virtual representation of transportation infrastructures to achieve efficient and precise management of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). However, a mixed traffic scenario of coexisting intelligent connected vehicles (ICVs) and non-intelligent connected vehicles (N-ICVs) increases challenges for digital ITS. N-ICVs are unable to generate and update their DT models independently due to constrained communication and computing capabilities. It is crucial to achieve real-time DT model update and migration of N-ICVs. In this paper, we propose a cooperative perception aided DT model update and migration approach, which dispatches ICVs to cooperatively sense and transmit information of nearby N-ICVs to assist in generating N-ICVs’ DT models. In particular, with the objective of minimizing the average maximum weighted age of information (AMWAoI), we jointly optimize the cooperative ICV selection as well as the bandwidth and computation allocations while guaranteeing the perception performance. We then propose a sensing data weighted size maximization matching algorithm to achieve an optimal ICV selection strategy, and the bandwidth and computation allocations are optimized by the gradient descent algorithm. Considering the dynamic nature of vehicular networks, a deep reinforcement learning-based access selection and DT model migration algorithm is further proposed to achieve continuous service provisioning. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves the lowest AMWAoI while meeting the perception performance requirement.},

  abstract     = {Autonomous vehicles are equipped with numerous electronic control units (ECUs). These ECUs are interconnected via in-vehicle networks to ensure safety, assist drivers, and perform various functions. A controller area network (CAN) facilitates real-time data transmission between ECUs. CAN provides sufficient reliability for communication within vehicles. Modern vehicles also utilize vehicle-to-everything (V2X) technologies. V2X enables vehicles to link to external networks, facilitating communication with other vehicles, infrastructures, and electronic devices. Modern vehicles’ enhanced functionality and connections make them more susceptible to cyberattacks on both in-vehicle and external networks because of their extensive attack surfaces. To address this issue, this research presents a novel data-driven intrusion detection system (IDS) designed for in-vehicle and external communication networks. The proposed IDS can effectively detect many types of intrusions beyond the constraints of binary classifications. This system underwent a comprehensive evaluation using three in-vehicle datasets: car-hacking, car-hacking: attack & defense Challenge, and the ROAD datasets. Additionally, it was evaluated on two external communication network datasets: CICIDS2017 and CSE-CIC-IDS2018. The evaluation results demonstrated the IDS’s adaptability, achieving significant accuracy, recall, and F1 scores. It attained up to 99.99% accuracy with the in-vehicle datasets. Moreover, it exhibited an exceptionally low false-positive rate, as low as 0, in the Car-Hacking dataset. The proposed IDS architecture is a lightweight approach compared to state-of-the-art models. It significantly reduced complexity in terms of Floating-Point Operations per Second (FLOPs), memory usage, and learning parameters, all without compromising performance.},

For heterogeneous agents, it is imperative to account for the gap in feature distribution differences between agents in different categories. Besides, exploring the reference relationship between the future motions of agents is crucial yet overlooked in previous trajectory prediction methods. To tackle these challenges, we propose an edge-enhanced heterogeneous graph Transformer with priority-based feature aggregation for multi-modal trajectory prediction. Specifically, a new edge-enhanced heterogeneous interaction module that carries relative position information via edges is proposed to explore the complex interaction among agents. Additionally, we propose the concept of priority during the decoding phase and the corresponding measuring method, based on which a priority-based feature aggregation module is presented to enable referencing between agents, allowing for a more reasonable trajectory generation process. Additionally, we design an effective feature fusion method based on state refinement LSTM so that temporal and social features can be well integrated while accounting for their roles in trajectory prediction. Extensive experimental results on public datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art baseline methods, confirming the effectiveness of our proposed method.

Current researches on RSU deployment optimization overlooks the inequal supply-demand relationship of vehicular communications caused by unbalanced vehicular density. In addition, the impact of traffic safety risks on RSU optimization is not considered. To cope with these challenges, this paper presents a data-driven and multi-factor RSU deployment strategy, which can be divided into two stages. The first stage adopts a data-driven approach to analyze vehicular density using realistic vehicle trajectory data, which helps identify preliminary deployment positions based on unbalanced vehicular density. In the second stage, an RSU deployment model is constructed that considers RSU deployment costs, geographical environment constraints, road coverage, and traffic safety risks. This model calculates the cumulative Poisson probability of simple and general traffic crashes to evaluate the traffic safety risks within the RSU coverage range. Afterward, this paper proposes an improved genetic algorithm to obtain the optimal position of RSUs within the deployment area. The algorithm employs a new method for population initialization and adopts a linear ranking-based selection mechanism. Finally, we conduct a joint simulation of transportation and communication networks by linking SUMO with OMNET++ through the TraCI interface and Veins framework. The results evaluate and demonstrate the performance of the proposed method in vehicle coverage, traffic safety risk coverage, and average notification time in comparison with the existing schemes.},

Although prevalent machine learning-based methods have gained tremendous progress on PTR, Mixed Logit Model (MXL), as a mathematical method, is attracting much attention from industry and academia to analyze refined individual behavior for PTR. Since MXL is still in its infancy in PTR, it encounters three challenges that need to be resolved jointly, namely 1) how to use personal data to describe user preferences without violating user privacy, 2) how to utilize the idle computing resources at the edge to improve the estimation efficiency, and 3) how to coordinate devices whose capability and availability may change over time and space. To fill the gap, we propose an asynchronous and privacy-preserving mixed logit model (APMXL), which aims to integrate MXL with asynchronous federated learning (AFL), which can 1) non-intrusively exchange model parameters between the clients and the server without exposing the raw data, 2) separately perform local and global estimation at the client and server to optimize the load, and 3) collaboratively approximate the posterior of the standard MXL through a continuous asynchronous interaction mechanism. Moreover, based on a standard dataset, APMXL is evaluated, showing that the model accuracy is about 13% higher compared to a flat logit model. Meanwhile, the estimation time has been reduced by about 60% compared to a centralized MXL model, and the robustness of the model has been improved compared with the synchronous and privacy-preserving mixed logit model (SPMXL).},

In this study, we introduce an interpretable action prediction model, denoted as the Prediction-Driven Attention Network (PDANet), designed to undertake action decisions and provide corresponding interpretations cohesively. The PDANet is inspired by the perceptual mechanisms inherent in human drivers, who allocate attention according to their driving intentions. Specifically, we elaborate a prediction module to generate vehicle prospective trajectories to characterize driving intentions. Subsequently, the features of this predicted trajectory are utilized to modulate the attention distribution among agents through the top-down attention module, yielding an attention map. Finally, two distinct task tokens are applied to aggregate agent features and generate the final output according to the derived attention map. Extensive experiments conducted on the publicly available BDD-OIA and nu-AR datasets demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms all prior works in terms of both action prediction and behavior interpretation tasks. Remarkably, our method attains a noteworthy enhancement in the behavior interpretation task, surpassing the previous state-of-the-art by a substantial margin of +10.8% in terms of F1-score on the nu-AR dataset. We also validate our algorithm on Carla Town05 long in a closed-loop decision-making scenario, highlighting the generality and robustness of our approach.

This article introduces a novel risk assessment methodology that periodically computes weekly insurance premiums by incorporating ADAS risk indicators and contextualized geolocation data. Using a naturalistic dataset from a fleet of 354 commercial drivers over a year, we modeled the relationship between past claims and driving data, and use that to compute weekly premiums that penalize risky driving situations. Risk predictions are modeled through claims frequency using Poisson regression and claims occurrence probability using machine learning models, including XGBoost and TabNet, and interpreted with SHAP. The dataset is divided into weekly profiles containing aggregated driving behavior, ADAS events, and contextual attributes. Results indicate that both modeling approaches show consistent attribute impacts on driver risk. For claims occurrence probability, XGBoost achieved the lowest Log Loss, reducing it from 0.59 to 0.51 with the inclusion of all attributes; for claims frequency, no statistically significant differences were observed when including all attributes. However, adding ADAS and contextual attributes allows for a comprehensive and disaggregated interpretation of the resulting weekly premium. This dynamic pricing can be incorporated into the insurance lifecycle, enabling bespoke risk assessment based on emerging technologies, the driving context, and driver behavior.},

  abstract     = {On-road wireless charging is an emerging charging method, in addition to plug-in charging, that is a promising application in the future smart grid. Hence, in this paper, a competitive pricing strategy for the wireless charging lane (WCL) is proposed to maximize the economic benefits of the WCL operator. First, the competitive pricing strategy is formulated based on a non-cooperative game between the WCL operator and the charging station (CS). An iterative optimal pricing searching algorithm is developed to find the Nash equilibrium of the game. Second, a tri-level framework is established to derive the optimal competitive price considering the interaction among the WCL operator, the power distribution network (PDN) operator, and EV users. Third, the range anxiety of EV users is mathematically modeled based on Prospect theory. Numerical results indicate that the pricing strategy is effective in enhancing the attractiveness and profitability of the WCL operator. In addition, the utility of EV users is increased as well. Moreover, the PDN loss cost can be reduced, and downward voltage violation can be avoided.},

  abstract     = {Enforcing safety while preventing overly conservative behaviors is essential for autonomous vehicles to achieve high task performance. In this paper, we propose a barrier-enhanced parallel homotopic trajectory optimization (BPHTO) approach with the over-relaxed alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) for real-time integrated decision-making and planning. To facilitate safety interactions between the ego vehicle (EV) and surrounding vehicles, a spatiotemporal safety module exhibiting bi-convexity is developed on the basis of barrier function. Varying barrier coefficients are adopted for different time steps in a planning horizon to account for the motion uncertainties of surrounding HVs and mitigate conservative behaviors. Additionally, we exploit the discrete characteristics of driving maneuvers to initialize nominal behavior-oriented free-end homotopic trajectories based on reachability analysis, and each trajectory is locally constrained to a specific driving maneuver while sharing the same task objectives. By leveraging the bi-convexity of the safety module and the kinematics of the EV, we formulate the BPHTO as a bi-convex optimization problem. Then constraint transcription and the over-relaxed ADMM are employed to streamline the optimization process, such that multiple trajectories are generated in real time with feasibility guarantees. Through a series of experiments, the proposed development demonstrates improved task accuracy, stability, and consistency in various traffic scenarios using synthetic and real-world traffic datasets.},

  abstract     = {The excessively high temperature poses a significant risk to battery health, accelerating degradation and causing damage. Despite the recognized importance of battery thermal management (BTM), numerous studies in this domain often overlook the distinct timescales associated with vehicle and battery thermal dynamics. This oversight can compromise the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of BTM strategies in efficiently controlling battery temperature. This study proposes a novel predictive battery thermal and energy management (p-BTEM) strategy for connected and automated electric vehicles. The p-BTEM leverages a cloud-enabled predictive control framework to synthesize the look-ahead constant and time-varying factors, e.g., vehicle, road, and traffic information. This synthesis aims to achieve global optimization of battery temperature in the Cloud while enabling local adaptations for vehicle acceleration and compressor power on the Vehicle End. This approach ensures proactive and economical regulation of battery temperature, especially in high temperature conditions, thereby maintaining the battery within optimal temperature ranges and reducing energy consumption in dynamic traffic scenarios. To assess the effectiveness of the p-BTEM, representative route simulations are conducted utilizing real-world data. The results reveal the exceptional performance of the p-BTEM in reducing battery cooling energy when compared to two benchmark strategies, with a minimum improvement of 8.58% and 10.31%, respectively. Moreover, the sensitivity analysis is performed to elaborate on the p-BTEM under the influence of traffic, communication, and algorithmic factors.},

To address this issue, we propose a novel privacy-preserving sequential recommendation method for intelligent transportation systems (named Grapeseed) based on split learning and variational autoencoder (VAE). Specifically, the vehicular client first inputs raw data into an encoder to produce latent variables locally and uploads these variables to the vehicular cloud server. Then, the vehicular cloud server generates and returns intermediate variables derived from these latent variables. Upon receiving these intermediate variables, the vehicular client calculates the final recommendation results. Extensive experiment results and analyses demonstrate that the proposed method improves both performance and communication efficiency between vehicular cloud servers and clients while preserving privacy.},

  abstract     = {Trajectory similarity is a fundamental operation in spatial-temporal data mining with wide-ranging applications. However, trajectories inherently exhibit diversity due to varied sampling and distribution of trajectory points, influenced by different motion patterns, sampling methods, and route constraints. This diversity leads to varying results in trajectory similarity measures, including DTW, LCSS, ED, Hausdorff, EDR, etc. In this paper, we argue for a comprehensive consideration of various distance metrics to enhance accuracy. To address this, this paper proposes a Multi-source Deep Trajectory Representation Learning method for accurate and efficient similarity queries. In particular, MDTRL comprises two key modules: (1) A novel trajectory representation module that incorporates an attention-based embedding mechanism and a deep metric learning network aggregating multiple measures. (2) A continuous metric learning strategy that adaptively updates similarity, thereby enhancing the accuracy of similarity queries. We employ the locality sensitive hashing index to further improve the similarity query. Extensive experiments conducted on real trajectory datasets reveal that MDTRL has state-of-the-art solutions, in terms of both effectiveness and efficiency across multi-source trajectories. It achieves 5x-15x speedup and 10%-15% accuracy improvement over Euclidean, Hausdorff, DTW, and Discrete Fréchet measures.},

Extensive simulations demonstrate DRL-APG outperforms existing schemes in different kinds of VANET situations including peak/off-peak hours and varying speed limits. In traffic congestion scenario across three simulation typical road networks, average accident zone speed increases 21.7%, 25.6% and 27.8% respectively after data sharing with the policy generated by our proposed DRL-APG, compared to existing schemes.},

On the other hand, deeper networks impose an extra computing strain on robots and greatly impede the development of real-time robot applications. Most groundbreaking studies either focus on learning from only one teacher in their distilled approach to learning, ignoring the possibility of students learning from multiple teachers, or failing to reveal teachers place varying importance on specific examples. To cope with the above issues, we propose a novel adaptive soft-hard label teaching feature-level knowledge distillation learning framework, namely ASHT-KD, for all-day mobile robot VPR tasks. This framework learns a compact and quick all-day place recognizer through knowledge transfer from several teachers to a limited number of students. Specifically, depending on the complexity of the environments, teachers can impart knowledge to two types of students in two teaching modes: soft-label teaching and hard-label teaching, which corresponds to one type of student being required to learn a new and uncomplicated environment (query image), while the other type of students are forced to learn a more complex environment (database images). To balance computational memory and performance, the teacher network is designed to be a two-level sampling ViT pipeline, while the Siamese student network is constructed to be a lightweight pipeline consisting only of one-level down-sampling ViT for place matching. In addition, a cross-entropy loss network is introduced to further improve the VPR performance by strengthening the correlation of feature representations from the Siamese network. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of ASHT-KD. The practicability of ASHT-KD is also verified through outdoor testing.},

In this paper, we propose a decentralized robust DeeP-LCC (Data-EnablEd Predictive Leading Cruise Control) approach for CAVs to smooth mixed traffic. In particular, each CAV computes its control input based on locally available data from its involved subsystem. Meanwhile, the interaction between neighboring subsystems is modeled as a bounded disturbance, for which appropriate estimation methods are proposed. Then, we formulate a robust optimization problem and present its tractable computational solutions. Compared with the centralized formulation, our method greatly reduces computation complexity with better safety performance, while naturally preserving data privacy.

Vehicular communication and platoon coordination are two aspects of enabling technologies for mobile edge computing (MEC)-enabled cooperative vehicle-infrastructure systems (CVIS), while few efforts have incorporated these two dimensions into a joint implementation framework. In this paper, we investigate the problem of joint car-following coordination and data transmission scheduling of vehicle platoons. We develop a two-tier hierarchical framework for vehicle platooning: a fuel-efficient mobility optimization layer for car-following coordination and a reliable vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication layer for data transmission scheduling. Specifically, we present a platoon-based fuel consumption minimization model and a car-following control protocol to derive fuel-efficient control inputs. We also propose a reliability-oriented and delay-constrained data transmission scheduling model that is driven by upper-layer car-following coordination. We derived a closed-form expression for the reliability-optimal data transmission scheduling solution, which incorporates platoon mobility, channel characteristics, and application requirements. With simulations, we show that our joint method improves fuel efficiency and communication reliability for platooning vehicles. In particular, the proposed method reduces the platoon’s fuel consumption per time slot by 16.4%, meanwhile making the communication reliability 1.31 times higher than other traditional methods.},

This often results in impractical predictions of train operational states and optimization outcomes. To facilitate planning in such operational conditions, this paper proposes a dynamic modeling method to assess energy consumption and the voltage of traction power supply system (TPSS), and a large-scale adaptive multi-strategy multi-objective competitive swarm optimization algorithm (LA-MOCSO) for solving dynamic optimization challenges. Specific, a mechanistic “train-track-power grid” (TTP) model is first built to calculate power flow and TPSS voltage during multiple train operations. Second, a hybrid modeling approach that combines the mechanistic model and data-driven models is proposed to account for variations in train and environmental characteristics, and a multi-objective optimization model is established aimed at improving energy-efficiency and voltage stability of TPSS. Then, to tackle the complexities of the multi-objective optimization problem, an LA-MOCSO algorithm is proposed, which can be applied to solve the large-scale optimization problem of multi-train long-distance routes. Finally, the high accuracy of the dynamic model was validated with measurement data; the performance and computational efficiency of LA-MOCSO was verified through five algorithms; the comprehensive optimization method can, through the allocation and utilization of regenerative braking energy, further reduce substation energy consumption and maintain grid voltage stability.},

  abstract     = {Multi-modal place recognition aims to grasp diversified information implied in different modalities to bring vitality to place recognition tasks. The key challenge is rooted in the representation gap in modalities, the feature fusion method, and their relationships. The majority of existing methods are based on uni-modal, leaving these challenges unsolved effectively. To address the problems, encouraged by double-split experiments in physics and cooperation modes, in this paper, we introduce a leader-servant multi-modal framework inspired by quantum theory for large-scale place recognition. Two key modules are designed, a quantum representation module and an interference-aware fusion module. The former is designed for multi-modal data to capture their diversity and bridge the gap, while the latter is proposed to effectively fuse the multi-modal feature with the guidance of the quantum theory. Besides, we propose a leader-servant training strategy for stable training, where three cases are considered with the multi-modal loss as the leader to preserve overall characteristics and other uni-modal losses as the servants to lighten the modality influence of the leader. Furthermore, The framework is compatible with uni-modal place recognition. At last, The experiments on three datasets witness the efficiency, generalization, and robustness of the proposed method in contrast to the other existing methods.},

  abstract     = {Efficient and secure data sharing in the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) is critical for the advancement of intelligent transportation, particularly in the context of emerging 5G/6G networks and driverless technology. This has prompted researchers to explore Blockchain-based Internet of Vehicles (BIoV) solutions to address common issues in intelligent transportation systems (ITS). However, at the edge layer, existing reputation and consensus mechanisms in the BIoV model face challenges such as significant energy consumption, limited scalability, and pronounced centralization. To tackle these issues, we introduce TRCO, a Permissioned Blockchain-based Trusted and Robust Consensus Optimization orienting ITS. TRCO is a three-layer BIoV architecture applicable to any BIoV scenario, offering robust scalability with the addition of new sub-regions. To improve the quality of data sharing for edge layer, we propose a decentralized reputation evaluation mechanism and integrate PoS and PBFT consensus algorithms to enhance performance by evaluating the communication behavior of edge servers. Security analysis and simulation experiments demonstrate that TRCO achieves high scalability and reliability, effectively filters Byzantine edge servers, and enhances the decentralization and consensus efficiency of the system.},

  abstract     = {Real-time sea state information plays a pivotal role in guiding decisions-making for various marine operations. Utilizing the wave buoy analogy (WBA) enables a cost-effective approach to estimating the wave spectrum through ship motion responses, providing an almost real-time estimation of the sea state. However, non-uniformly distributed response amplitude operators (RAOs) bring about performance deterioration in specific sea states, potentially leading to erroneous estimations that could misguide decision-making and result in severe consequences. Nevertheless, it is possible to combine multiple estimates in a rational manner to improve the robustness and accuracy of the WBA. In this study, the restricted isometry property is introduced to evaluate WBA performance. An RAO-driven assessment criterion is proposed to ascertain the reliability of estimates based solely on RAO input. Building upon this assessment criterion, we propose a multispectral fusion algorithm to amalgamate multiple estimates obtained from ships with different geometries and headings, ultimately generating a comprehensive fused result. Numerical experiments are described to demonstrate the proposed algorithm’s effectiveness.},

Accurate detection of crack defects has far-reaching significance in maintaining the health condition of roads. Although many excellent crack defect detection algorithms have emerged, the detection effect on the edge details of the crack defects is still not ideal. In this paper, we propose a novel global-local fusion network based on edge enhancement and Transformer for pavement crack defect segmentation. Aiming at the structural characteristics of the pavement crack defects, combined with the edge detection algorithm (Sobel), an edge feature enhancement (EFE) module is presented to realize the accurate extraction of local detail information of the pavement crack defects. Meanwhile, a Transformer-based encoding path is also built to extract rich global information. Faced with the two different types of feature information, an adaptive fusion (AF) module is proposed to realize the efficient fusion of the two types of feature information. Furthermore, an attention-based local feature enhancement (ALFE) module and an edge refinement module (ER) are proposed to further suppress the interference in the local feature maps and refine the edge features of the pavement crack defects. Finally, a multi-scale feature enhancement (MFE) module is presented for multi-scale attention feature representation, by which we can provide high-quality input features for the decoding side. After extensive experimental validation, our proposed model has demonstrated a superior performance over existing mainstream models on multiple pavement crack defect segmentation datasets.

  abstract     = {Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) is a method for monitoring pulse signal by utilizing a camera sensor to capture a facial video including variations in blood flow beneath the skin. Recently, rPPG advancements have enabled the measurement of an individual’s heart rate with a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of approximately 1.0 in controlled indoor environments. However, when applied in car dataset including driving environments, the RMSE of rPPG measurements significantly increases to over 9.07. This limitation, caused by motion-related artifacts and fluctuations in ambient illumination, becomes particularly noticeable while driving, resulting in a Percentage of Time that Error is less than 6 beats per minute (PTE6) of up to 65.1%. To address these limitations, we focus on the assessment of rPPG noise, with an emphasis on evaluating noise components within facial video and quantifying quality of the rPPG measurement. In this paper, we propose a deep learning framework that infers rPPG signal and quality based on video vision transformer. the proposed method demonstrates that the top 10% quality measurements yield PTE6 of 91.98% and 99.59% in driving and garage environments, respectively. Additionally, we introduce a quality-based rPPG compensation method that improves accuracy in driving environments by predicting rPPG quality based on noise assessment. This compensation method demonstrates superior accuracy compared to the current state-of-the-art, achieving a PTE6 of 68.24% in driving scenarios.},

Existing methods often overlook traffic rules and vehicle interactions in their reconstruction process, a research gap that becomes critical for fine-grained reconstruction of incomplete and irregular microscopic traffic data. To address this limitation, this paper introduces a novel fine-grained trajectory reconstruction (FTR) framework, particularly for urban signalized intersections, considering both traffic rules and vehicle interactions through a microscopic traffic simulation (MTS) model. This is motivated by challenging missing patterns in real-world data from Alibaba City Brain Lab and limitations in existing reconstruction approaches. To this end, the FTR problem is first formulated as an MTS-based optimization problem. Then, to solve this problem effectively under a limited computing budget, an advanced dynamic data-driven evolutionary optimization technique, D3GA++, is proposed. Through the validation involving two real-world datasets, D3GA++ has demonstrated superior performance under various missing data scenarios consistently surpassing baselines such as brute-force random search and standard evolutionary algorithm in terms of reconstruction accuracy.

We developed a simulator, MOTEL, that simulates the different functions of the proposed schemes and all the necessary components. Using MOTEL and data sets from real transport companies, the proposed approach is tested and evaluated using various experiments. The results demonstrate that, compared to existing solutions, the proposed approach significantly reduces processing costs and delays while maintaining an appropriate level of security in transport services.},

Most existing RGBT trackers do not achieve high precision and real-time tracking speed simultaneously. To address this challenge, we propose an innovative RGBT tracker, the Siamese Triple-stream Feature Aggregation Network (SiamTFA). Firstly, a triple-stream backbone is presented to implement multi-modal feature extraction and fusion, which contains two parallel Swin Transformer feature extraction streams, and one feature fusion stream composed of joint-complementary feature aggregation (JCFA) modules. Secondly, our proposed JCFA module utilizes a joint-complementary attention to guide the aggregation of multi-modal features. Specifically, the joint attention can focus on spatial location information and semantic information of the target by combining the features of two modalities. Considering the complementarity between RGB and TIR modalities, the complementary attention is introduced to enhance the information of beneficial modality and suppress the information of ineffective modality. Thirdly, in order to reduce the computational complexity of the joint-complementary attention, we propose a depthwise shared attention structure, which utilizes depthwise convolution and shared features to achieve lightweight attention. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on four official RGBT test datasets and the experimental results demonstrate that our proposed tracker outperforms some state-of-the-art trackers and the tracking speed reaches 37 frames per second (FPS).

For this, three algorithms are developed and tested, each with different levels of information availability: the first solely uses current state information for conflict solving, the second includes additional information about the urban environment within the CD&R process, and the last also incorporates trajectory intent data to solve conflicts. These methods are tested within simulations of urban air traffic scenarios at various demand and wind levels to determine their safety and efficiency performance.

  abstract     = {Panic behaviors in a pedestrian flow often lead to a state of chaos or disorder among the pedestrian crowd, resulting in a crowd accident with high possibility. To investigate the panic pedestrian dynamics and further prevent serious crowd accidents, simulation based on dynamics modeling and accident video data is a popular solution to date. Thereby, it is challenging but significant to improve the crowd dynamics model more consistent with the ground truth of real pedestrian movement scenarios, with consideration of both physical contact force and panic emotional propagation in a crowd. Therefore, this study proposed an extended social force model (ESFM) by applying the physical contact-force estimation during pedestrian collision based on non-smooth contact dynamics. Subsequently, the ESFM was integrated with an improved panic propagation model (IPPM) considering obstacle and promotion factors. Finally, taking the crowd panic accident happened in Nepal in 2015 as an experiment case, the simulation of panic crowd dynamics was conducted within Anylogic software. Four cases of SFM, ESFM, SFM+IPPM, and ESFM+IPPM were compared quantitatively and graphically. The experimental results showed that the pedestrian distribution obtained from the proposed ESFM+IPPM was the closest to the ground truth during the panic response period, with 28.8% lower of Hausdorff distance than the original SFM, and 21.6% lower the well-known BHSFM, respectively. This approach can help improve the panic crowd modeling and pedestrian distribution prediction in real scenarios.},

  abstract     = {Traffic congestion has become an inevitable challenge in large cities due to population increases and the expansion of urban areas. Various approaches are introduced to mitigate traffic issues, encompassing from expanding the road infrastructure to employing demand management. Congestion pricing and incentive schemes are extensively studied for traffic control in traditional networks where each driver/rider is a network “player”. In this setup, drivers’/riders’ “selfish” behavior hinders the network from reaching a socially optimal state. In future mobility services, on the other hand, a large portion of drivers/vehicles may be controlled by a small number of companies/organizations. In such a system, offering incentives to organizations can potentially be much more effective in reducing traffic congestion rather than offering incentives directly to drivers. This paper studies the problem of offering incentives to organizations to change the behavior of their individual drivers (or individuals relying on the organization’s services). We developed a model where incentives are offered to each organization based on their aggregated travel time loss across all drivers/riders in that organization. Such an incentive offering mechanism requires solving a large-scale optimization problem to minimize the system-level travel time. We propose an efficient algorithm for solving this optimization problem. Numerous experiments on Los Angeles County traffic data reveal the ability of our method to reduce system-level travel time by up to 7.15%. Moreover, our experiments show that incentivizing organizations can be up to 7 times more cost-effective than incentivizing individual drivers when aiming for maximum travel time reduction.},

  abstract     = {Carbon emissions caused by passenger cars in cities are essentially responsible for severe climate change and serious environmental problems. Exploring carbon emissions from passenger cars helps to control urban pollution and achieve urban sustainability. However, it is a challenging task to foresee the spatio-temporal distribution of carbon emission from passenger cars, as the following technical issues remain. i) Vehicle carbon emissions contain complex spatial interactions and temporal dynamics. How to collaboratively integrate such spatial-temporal correlations for carbon emission prediction is not yet resolved. ii) Given the mobility of passenger cars, the hidden dependencies inherent in traffic density are not properly addressed in predicting carbon emissions from passenger cars. To tackle these issues, we propose a Collaborative Spatial-temporal Network (CSTNet) for implementing carbon emissions prediction by using passenger car trajectory data. Within the proposed method, we devote to extract collaborative properties that stem from a multi-view graph structure together with parallel input of carbon emission and traffic density. Then, we design a spatial-temporal convolutional block for both carbon emission and traffic density, which constitutes of temporal gate convolution, spatial convolution and temporal attention mechanism. Following that, an interaction layer between carbon emission and traffic density is proposed to handle their internal dependencies, and further model spatial relationships between the features. Besides, we identify several global factors and embed them for final prediction with a collaborative fusion. Experimental results on the real-world passenger car trajectory dataset demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the baselines with a roughly 7%-11% improvement.},

  abstract     = {Gradient-based trajectory optimization with B-spline curves is widely used for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) due to its fast convergence and continuous trajectory generation. However, the application of B-spline curves for path-velocity coupled trajectory planning in autonomous vehicles (AVs) has been highly limited because it is challenging to reduce the over-approximation of the vehicle shape and to create a collision-free trajectory using B-spline curves while satisfying kinodynamic constraints. To address these challenges, this paper proposes novel disc-type swept volume (SV), incremental path flattening (IPF), and kinodynamic feasibility penalty methods. The disc-type SV estimation method is a new technique to reduce SV over-approximation and is used to find collision points for IPF. In IPF, the collision points are used to push the trajectory away from obstacles and to iteratively increase the curvature weight, thereby reducing SV and generating a collision-free trajectory. Additionally, to satisfy kinodynamic constraints for AVs using B-spline curves, we apply a clamped B-spline curvature penalty along with longitudinal and lateral velocity and acceleration penalties. Our experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in various simulated environments. We also conducted a real-world experiment using an AV, and our results validate the simulated tracking performance of the proposed approach.},

To address these challenges, we propose a unified domain generalization framework to be utilized during the training and inference stages of collaborative perception. In the training phase, we introduce an Amplitude Augmentation (AmpAug) method to augment low-frequency image variations, broadening the model’s ability to learn across multiple domains. We also employ a meta-consistency training scheme to simulate domain shifts, optimizing the model with a carefully designed consistency loss to acquire domain-invariant representations. In the inference phase, we introduce an intra-system domain alignment mechanism to reduce or potentially eliminate the domain discrepancy among CAVs prior to inference.

Collision avoidance is a critical and challenging issue for distributed flocking control with a UAV fleet, especially in dynamic environments with varying numbers of non-cooperative intruders. However, existing reinforcement learning based methods mainly focus on flocking with collision avoidance tasks with static obstacles and a fixed number of UAVs. In this article, we propose a scalable multi-agent reinforcement learning based method to solve the distributed flocking with collision avoidance problem for a scalable fleet of fixed-wing UAVs in dynamic environments. Specifically, we cast this problem in a decentralized partially observable Markov decision process framework and propose a scalable multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm called spatial-temporal attention multi-agent actor-critic (STAAC). In this algorithm, we design a spatial-temporal attention based population-invariant network architecture to facilitate the representation learning of dynamic dimensional observations. By integrating the local spatial attention and global temporal attention mechanisms, STAAC is able to adapt to the changes in the scale of UAV fleets and the number of intruders. Finally, we empirically demonstrate the effectiveness, scalability, and adaptability of the proposed approach in numerical simulations and hardware-in-the-loop experiments.},

  abstract     = {Proper planning of charging infrastructure can significantly facilitate the popularization of electric vehicles and alleviate users’ mileage anxiety. Charging station siting and sizing are two key challenges in the planning with each of them being a complex optimization problem. In this paper, a multi-objective optimization approach is proposed to solve them together. First, considering that accurate charging demand estimation is crucial for planning, a traffic road network is established for this purpose. A Monte Carlo method is used to estimate the spatiotemporal distribution of charging demand in a region based on the probabilistic characteristics of user trips. Since uncoordinated charging not only increases the load but also leads to unstable operation of the local power system, a heuristic algorithm is proposed to coordinate charging scheduling. Then, based on the scheduled demand, this paper proposes a framework for the siting and sizing of charging stations to optimize the benefits for both operators and users by minimizing the construction, operation and maintenance costs, and the user’s detour time. As the given problem is a complex multi-objective combinatorial optimization problem, it is easy to fall into local optimum if traditional evolutionary algorithms are employed. Therefore, a multi-objective dynamic binary particle swarm optimization method is designed to solve this problem effectively. Finally, experimental simulations show that the proposed method outperforms the other comparative algorithms in terms of solution quality. A case study is presented to demonstrate the applicability and effectiveness of the proposed method in optimizing the location and capacity of charging stations.},

Accurate and robust trajectory estimation is especially challenging in indoor environments due to the presence of feature-poor or repetitive scenes, limited visibility, and dynamic objects. Obtaining highly accurate machine platform odometry is also an important basis for solving the “last mile” problem in intelligent transportation. This paper proposes a novel algorithm that combines LiDAR-based SLAM, total station measurements, and graph optimization to optimize the robot’s trajectory in indoor environments. By integrating highly accurate positional data from total station measurements as additional constraints, the proposed method enhances the performance of indoor LiDAR SLAM, effectively addressing the challenges of drift and trajectory offsets. Moreover, the proposed algorithm can provide trajectory optimization even in the absence of loop closure detection, making it more robust and suitable for a broader range of indoor environments. Experimental results validated the effectiveness of the proposed approach in reducing drift and improving trajectory estimation for low-cost indoor LiDAR devices, demonstrating its potential in various applications such as autonomous navigation, facility management, and augmented reality.

This index combines VO-based time-varying collision risk and network-based complexity measurement of ship encounter situations to estimate the collision risk for single ships. Finally, aiming at assessing the collision risk from multiple perspectives, the Shapley value method is introduced to obtain the macro-regional collision risk by measuring the collision risk contribution of each ship and cluster. To test the performance and feasibility of the proposed approach, a case study was conducted in Zhoushan, China using historical AIS data. The results show that the proposed approach can accurately identify ships with high collision risk and evaluate the spatiotemporal distribution characteristics of collision risk in selected regions, thereby improving the safety management capabilities of maritime surveillance operators.},

This study tended to create a new homogeneity-related zone system from the basic grid cells and examining if the improved system outperforms than traditional zone systems when conducting aggregate analysis in transportation. Within ride-hailing schemes, the selection process of drop-off locations of each trip is fully recorded by the mobile transportation platform, which offers a promising way in addressing the spatial aggregation issue. Specifically, on the basis of destination retrieval record (DRR) data, this study explored the potential relevance among them and built homogeneity pairs. Based on the improved cluster algorithm, homogeneity pairs are used to aggregate basic grid cells into the homogeneous traffic analysis zones (HTAZs) that are high in inter-zone consistency. The third ring area of Chengdu City as a case study was divided into 260 HTAZs using the proposed partition approach. Newly developed homogeneity-related zone system performs better than traditional systems in terms of geometry and internal consistency. Findings from this study also suggest that the zone partition should maintain internal consistency, namely homogeneity, as much as possible so that the aggregate-level spatial units can reflect and summarize the features of intra-zone individuals. This study demonstrates the mining potential of trip record data within transport systems, and provides a more reliable spatial structure to reveal travel patterns and conduct transportation design.},

Specifically, we focus on Adaptive Traffic Control Systems (ATCS) as a critical use case, where designing effective traffic controllers parallels the cognitive tasks of reasoning and planning. This paper introduces a novel LLM-based agent development framework to create two types of traffic controllers: a Zero-Shot Chain of Thought approach and a Generally Capable Agent (GCA) approach. The latter integrates new knowledge from environmental interactions to enhance reasoning and planning capabilities. We implement and compare these controllers within a simulated traffic flow scenario at a single intersection using the Simulation of Urban Mobility (SUMO) against conventional traffic control methods, including fixed-time, gap-based, and delay-based controllers. Our results demonstrate that GCA-based controllers notably outperform traditional systems, reducing halted vehicle numbers by 48.03% and increasing average vehicle speed by 25.29%. These controllers also exhibit superior flexibility, generating diverse phase patterns that adapt dynamically to changing traffic conditions. This study underscores the transformative potential of LLMs in traffic management, promising significant enhancements in efficiency, responsiveness, and versatility in urban traffic control, ultimately improving urban life by mitigating traffic congestion’s economic and environmental impacts.},

  abstract     = {Cycling is critical for cities to transition to more sustainable transport modes. Yet, safety concerns remain a critical deterrent for individuals to cycle. If individuals perceive an environment as unsafe for cycling, it is likely that they will prefer other means of transportation. Yet, capturing and understanding how individuals perceive cycling risk is complex and often slow, with researchers defaulting to traditional surveys and in-loco interviews. In this study, we tackle this problem. We base our approach on using pairwise comparisons of real-world images, repeatedly presenting respondents with pairs of road environments and asking them to select the one they perceive as safer for cycling, if any. Using the collected data, we train a siamese-convolutional neural network using a multi-loss framework that learns from individuals’ responses, learns preferences directly from images, and includes ties (often discarded in the literature).

  abstract     = {With increasing emphasis on vehicular automation and traffic efficiency, the management and coordination of platoon-based systems have become important. This research introduces a unique control framework based on a behavioral stability strategy, designed to enhance the cohesion of vehicle platoons and improve their ability to resist disturbances. Our approach integrates a vehicle scheduling system with a real-time platoon control mechanism to enhance the behavioral stability, robustness, and safety of the platoon. Given the heterogeneous nature of vehicles, we propose an optimal platoon formation model. This model strategically determines the number of platoons, arranges the sequence of vehicles within each platoon, and selects optimal cruising speeds to maximize platoon cohesion. To further enhance system robustness, a centralized robust model predictive controller is deployed for each platoon, ensuring stability against stochastic perturbations in vehicle dynamics and guaranteeing platoon safety. Finally, we conduct a simulation study involving multiple platoons with 20 heterogeneous vehicles to validate the effectiveness of the multi-layer optimization model.},

  abstract     = {The application of cooperative adaptive cruise control (CACC) in vehicle platoons with vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication has received significant interest. CACC systems ensure string stability, enabling vehicles to maintain close inter-vehicle distances, thereby mitigating traffic jams and reducing fuel consumption. However, in realistic scenarios, vehicle platoons are typically heterogeneous, featuring diverse powertrain dynamics and uncertain parameters. To extend linear CACC systems that assume prior knowledge of vehicle parameters, novel adaptive controllers are developed. These controllers accommodate nonlinear and heterogeneous vehicle platoons with parametric uncertainties. To guarantee uniformly global asymptotic stability in nonlinear CACC systems, two innovative parameter updating laws are proposed and validated using Lyapunov’s method. Additionally, a data selection and updating algorithm is implemented to construct a positive definite matrix and enhance the convergence rate of CACC controllers. Subsequently, examining transient behavior provides insights into tuning the adaptive controller gains. Finally, simulation and experimental results illustrate that both the baseline adaptive and novel adaptive controller exhibit superior state tracking compared to the feedback linearizing PD controller with nominal parameters. In addition, the novel adaptive controller presents enhanced estimation accuracy for unknown parameters, ensuring improved robustness in practical vehicle platoon applications. String stability evaluation in the frequency domain for a nonlinear CACC system is realized through the innovative adaptive control scheme.},

To address the limitations of a single sensor based perception method and the inefficiency of multi-modal semantic networks, a progressive multi-modal network is designed to efficiently extract multi-sensor semantic information in a segmentation network. This approach progressively enhances the subsequent point cloud segmentation network with calibration and image semantics prior, thereby improving the accuracy and efficiency of perception. Additionally, we propose semantic information enhanced tightly-coupled LiDAR-visual-inertial odometry, which employs the semantic trimmed iterative closest point method to enhance the robustness and accuracy of multi-modal odometry. Finally, the effectiveness of the PM2S2-SALM is verified by real-world experiments through the public datasets, which reduces the Absolute Trajectory Error by 25.1% compared with the state-of-the-art performance method.},

For instance, strategically locating fire stations or electric vehicle (EV) charging stations along a road network can greatly enhance public safety and support the adoption of clean transportation technologies. However, determining these optimal placements is computationally challenging, particularly when accounting for factors like road network distances and coverage radius. Traditional methods, such as greedy algorithms, offer a reasonable approximation but are limited by high computational complexity, making them less suitable for large-scale transportation networks. In response, our research introduces two novel algorithms designed to improve both the efficiency and scalability of the k-radius coverage problem. The first algorithm achieves a strong approximation with significantly reduced time complexity, while the second employs a sketch-based approach, offering a nearly linear time complexity relative to the number of edges. Although the second algorithm sacrifices some approximation accuracy, it offers substantial gains in computational speed, making it particularly valuable for large-scale transportation networks.

  abstract     = {With the advancements in deep learning, detecting occluded pedestrians has become a focal point of research. Extracting pedestrian parts has proven to be an effective solution for handling occlusion. However, existing methods mainly rely on Region Proposal Networks (RPNs) for the part feature extraction. These RPNs-based methods suffer from limitations such as complex structures and limited receptive fields, which hinder their ability to capture global dependency information. To overcome these challenges, we propose a simple but effective Occlusion-Aware Dual-Branch Network (OADB-Net) based on an anchor-free framework for pedestrian detection in crowded scenes. Specifically, we design a dual-branch occlusion-aware detection head, consisting of a full-body detection branch and a head-shoulder detection branch, to address the occlusion issue in crowded scenes. The head-shoulder detection branch to handle heavily occluded instances and the full-body branch to focus on non-heavily occluded instances. Furthermore, we propose a Cross-Layer Non-Local Module (CLNL-Module), which captures long-range dependencies across feature layers, to effectively differentiate the relationship between pedestrian body and body parts while integrating essential features for more accurate and discriminative pedestrian representation. This strengthens the connections between the dual detection branches and enhances the responses of their respective center heatmaps. Our OADB-Net leverages part and full-body features to handle pedestrians with varying degrees of occlusion, while avoiding the limitations of RPNs-based methods. In heavy occlusion settings, OADB-Net achieves the average miss rates of 39.9%, 26.8%, and 43.1% on the Citypersons, Caltech, and CrowdHuman datasets, respectively, and demonstrates superior performance in traffic scenes.},

  abstract     = {Human mobility prediction is a fundamental task essential for various applications in urban planning, location-based services and intelligent transportation systems. Existing methods often ignore activity information crucial for reasoning human preferences and routines, or adopt a simplified representation of the dependencies between time, activities and locations. To address these issues, we present Hierarchical Graph Attention Recurrent Network (Hgarn) for human mobility prediction. Specifically, we construct a hierarchical graph based on past mobility records and employ a Hierarchical Graph Attention Module to capture complex time-activity-location dependencies. This way, Hgarn can learn representations with rich human travel semantics to model user preferences at the global level. We also propose a model-agnostic history-enhanced confidence (MaHec) label to incorporate each user’s individual-level preferences. Finally, we introduce a Temporal Module, which employs recurrent structures to jointly predict users’ next activities and their associated locations, with the former used as an auxiliary task to enhance the latter prediction. For model evaluation, we test the performance of Hgarn against existing state-of-the-art methods in both the recurring (i.e., returning to a previously visited location) and explorative (i.e., visiting a new location) settings. Overall, Hgarn outperforms other baselines significantly in all settings based on two real-world human mobility data benchmarks. These findings confirm the important role that human activities play in determining mobility decisions, illustrating the need to develop activity-aware intelligent transportation systems.

The tested surfaces include dry and wet asphalt, asphalt covered with thin/thick ice and packed/unpacked snow patches. The measured surface emissivity varies between the surfaces (dry, snow, liquid water, or ice) because of differences in the dielectric properties of the materials and roughness’s. Using field measurements, we compare the emissivity of the surfaces and show that the corresponding emissivity of each road condition is distinct and well-defined.

The uncertainty exists in terms of the diverse social driving preferences and unpredictable driving behavior of human drivers. To address these challenges, the decision-making process for changing lanes is represented as an incomplete information game, where the driver characteristics of surrounding vehicles are unknown during the interaction. To eliminate the uncertainty of the driving environment, the concept of driver aggressiveness is proposed to quantify the social driving preferences based on the Risk-Response (R-R) diagram in an explainable manner. Then the predicted trajectory is utilized to calculate the driving risks using Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) that is trained by the naturalistic driving data in the interactive lane change scenarios extracted from the highD dataset. To make the simulation environment more diverse and realistic, the data-driven motion model social Intelligent Driver Model (SIDM) is constructed based on car-following data obtained from cut-in scenarios in the highD dataset. The simulations are conducted by setting up the environment vehicles equipped with SIDM model with diverse social driving preferences. The findings indicate that the proposed decision-making model can recognize the category of surrounding vehicles, and in realistic interactive driving scenarios, it can produce adaptive and human-like driving decisions.},

We rely on a multi-scale approach to model mixed traffic of CAVs in the bulk flow. In particular, CAVs are individually tracked and they are allowed to overtake (if on distinct lanes) or queuing (if on the same lane). Controlling CAVs desired speeds allows to act on the system to minimize the selected cost function. For the proposed control strategies, we apply both global optimization and a Model Predictive Control approach. In particular, we perform numerical tests to investigate how the CAVs number and positions impact the result, showing that few, optimally chosen vehicles are sufficient to significantly improve the selected performance indexes, even using a decentralized control policy. Simulation results support the attractive perspective of exploiting a very small number of vehicles as endogenous control actuators to regulate traffic flow on road networks, providing a flexible alternative to traditional control methods.},

  abstract     = {To make the proper planning of bus public transportation systems, especially with the introduction of electric buses to the fleets, it is essential to characterize the routes, patterns of traffic, speed, constraints, and presence of high slopes. Currently, GPS (Global Position System) is available worldwide in the fleet. However, they often produce datasets of poor quality, with low data rates, loss of information, noisy samples, and eventual paths not belonging to regular bus routes. Therefore, extracting useful information from these poor data is a challenging task. The current paper proposes a novel method based on an unsupervised competitive density clustering algorithm to obtain hot spot clusters of any density. The clusters are a result of their competition for the GPS samples. Each cluster attracts GPS samples until a maximum radius from its centroid and thereafter moves toward the most density areas. The winning clusters are sorted using a novel distance metric with the support of a visual interface, forming a sequence of points that outline the bus trajectory. Finally, indicators are correlated to the clusters making a trajectory characterization and allowing extensive assessments. According to the actual case studies, the method performs well with noisy GPS samples and the loss of information. The proposed method presents quite a fixed parameter, allowing fair performance for most GPS datasets without needing custom adjustments. It also proposes a framework for preparing the input GPS dataset, clustering, sorting the clusters to outline the trajectory, and making the trajectory characterization.},

  abstract     = {Queue length is one of the most commonly used indicators to evaluate traffic operation at signalized intersections. Many studies aim to estimate queue length using trajectory data, but this remains a challenge with spatially sparse trajectories. This paper introduces a probabilistic-based method for cycle-by-cycle estimation of queue length distribution and the point estimate in closed form using connected vehicle (CV) trajectories. The method is applicable to isolated signalized intersections with under-saturated traffic. It works well in a low CV penetration rate environment by exploiting the trajectories of both queued and non-queued CVs. Vehicle arrival rates and CV penetration rates are first estimated to capture the vehicle arrival pattern within a time of day (TOD) using the maximum likelihood estimation approach. The closed forms of the probability distribution of queue length are derived for each cycle, which are attractive for applications such as adaptive signal timing considering traffic uncertainty. The queue length with the highest probability is taken as the point estimate. Numerical and empirical studies demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the benchmark method in estimating CV penetration rates, particularly at low penetration rates. In term of queue length estimation, the proposed method is also superior to existing methods in most scenarios and is especially effective for cycles with observed trajectories. Sensitivity analysis reveals that the method is robust to different demand levels, signal timings, and variability in arrival patterns with under-saturated traffic. Additionally, the suggested requirements for the number of collected trajectories are investigated to provide practical guidance.},

  abstract     = {Generating adversarial scenes that potentially fail autonomous driving systems provides an effective way to improve their robustness. Extending purely data-driven generative models, recent specialized models satisfy additional controllable requirements such as embedding a traffic sign in a driving scene by manipulating patterns implicitly at the neuron level. In this paper, we introduce a method to incorporate domain knowledge explicitly in the generation process to achieve Semantically Adversarial Generation (SAG). To be consistent with the composition of driving scenes, we first categorize the knowledge into two types, the property of objects and the relationship among objects. We then propose a tree-structured variational auto-encoder (T-VAE) to learn hierarchical scene representation. By imposing semantic rules on the properties of nodes and edges into the tree structure, explicit knowledge integration enables controllable generation. To demonstrate the advantage of structural representation, we construct a synthetic example to illustrate the controllability and explainability of our method in a succinct setting. We further extend to realistic environments for autonomous vehicles, showing that our method efficiently identifies adversarial driving scenes against different state-of-the-art 3D point cloud segmentation models and satisfies the constraints specified as explicit knowledge.},

  abstract     = {Recently, there have been certain important advances in the field of driver attention prediction in dynamic scenarios for the bionic perception of intelligent vehicles. Given the visual characteristics of experienced and skilled drivers, who can rapidly and accurately perceive their environment and effectively identify the significance of environmental stimuli, it is believed that an effective driver attention prediction model should not only extract temporal-spatial features comprehensively but also flexibly highlight the importance of these features. In light of this challenge, this paper proposing an improved multi-scale temporal-spatial fusion network model, which adopts an encoder-fusion-decoder architecture and can fully use the scale, spatial, and temporal information in video. First, two independent feature extraction backbones, one 2D and another 3D, are used to extract four temporal-spatial features of different scales from the input video clip and align them in the feature dimension. Then, features from different levels are added to the channel and fused using an attention mechanism to achieve the 3D-2D soft combination effect guided by spatial features. Finally, hierarchical decoding and prediction are performed on temporal-spatial features of different branches, and the results of multiple branches are fused to generate saliency maps. Experiments on three challenging datasets show that the proposed method is superior to the state- of-the-art methods regarding several saliency evaluation metrics and can predict driver attention more accurately. By using an effective temporal-spatial fusion strategy based on attention mechanism, the proposed method can detect important targets and identify risk areas for a human-like autonomous driving system.},

  abstract     = {Despite significant progress in RGB-D based road segmentation in recent years, the latest methods cannot achieve both state-of-the-art accuracy and real time due to the high-performance reliance on heavy structures. We argue that this reliance is due to unsuitable multimodal fusion. To be specific, RGB and depth data in road scenes are each sensitive to different regions, but current RGB-D based road segmentation methods generally combine features within sensitive regions which preserves false road representation from one of the data. Based on such findings, we design an Evidence-based Road Segmentation Method (Evi-RoadSeg), which incorporates prior knowledge of the modal-specific characteristics. Firstly, we abandon the cross-modal fusion operation commonly used in existing multimodal based methods. Instead, we collect the road evidence from RGB and depth inputs separately via two low-latency subnetworks, and fuse the road representation of the two subnetworks by taking both modalities’ evidence as a measure of confidence. Secondly, we propose an RGB-D data augmentation scheme tailored to road scenes to enhance the unique properties of RGB and depth data. It facilitates learning by adding more sensitive regions to the samples. Finally, the proposed method is evaluated on the widely used KITTI-road, ORFD, and R2D datasets. Our method achieves state-of-the-art accuracy at over 70 FPS, $5\times $ faster than comparable RGB-D methods. Furthermore, extensive experiments illustrate that our method can be deployed on a Jetson Nano 2GB with a speed of 8+ FPS. The code will be released in https://github.com/xuefeng-cvr/Evi-RoadSeg.},

  abstract     = {Lane detection is a critical part of autonomous driving technology. When difficult situations are encountered (i.e., adverse light, severe occlusion), the lane detection task is still challenging. However, previous methods strongly depend on the extracted image features and ignore other features. It is necessary to consider the information from other modalities to assist the model for lane detection, especially in the task of curved lane detection. In this paper, considering that the vehicle steering angle is closely related to the visual feature of lane lines, we propose a novel model named Image-Angle Fusion Network (IAFNet) to solve the lane detection problem by fusing vehicle steering angle features with image features. To make the steering angle features better match the image features, we use the tensor outer product to extend the dimensionality of the steering angle information. A lightweight Image-Angle cross-attention module (LIA-CAM) is proposed to learn the implicit relationship between steering angles and visual features of lane lines, aimed at improving the performance of our model in difficult situations. To guide the network to retain the correct steering angle information, we introduced regression prediction loss of steering angle. Besides, we also released a new dataset based on the Udacity dataset: ImageAngle-Udacity (IA-Udacity) dataset. Extensive experiments on the IA-Udacity dataset show that our method outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods showing both higher efficiency and accuracy.

  abstract     = {We consider the problem of minimizing emission of a heavy-duty truck transporting freight between two locations subject to a hard deadline constraint. The truck is equipped with a multi-speed transmission and a modern combustion engine that intelligently switches among multiple fuel injection strategies at certain engine speeds (called switching speeds) to achieve lower emission profiles. Our objective is to minimize the emission by optimizing both path and speed planning for heavy-duty trucks with multi-speed transmission and multiple injection strategies in the engine. This emission minimization problem, while pervasive in practice, has two challenges: i) the emission rate function is discontinuous and non-convex due to switching of the fuel injections and gear ratios, which makes the common practice of driving at a constant speed on a road segment not eco-friendly; ii) the problem is NP-hard due to the combinatorial nature of the simultaneous path and speed planning. We tackle the first challenge by considering the case where the truck can travel at a heterogeneous speed profile over a road segment and then formulate the speed planning problem as a convex problem. We further identify special structures in this problem and provide an efficient method for computing the optimal speed profile. We then tackle the second challenge by developing an efficient heuristic for both path planning and speed planning to solve the emission minimization problem on the scale of national highway systems. Our extensive simulations on the US highway system show that our solution reduces up to 46% NOx emission as compared to the commonly-adopted fastest path approach. We also find that optimizing heterogeneous speed profiles reduce up to 32% emission as compared to their homogeneous counterpart, thus are necessary to be considered in eco-friendly truck operations.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we propose an accurate and robust multi-modal sensor fusion framework, MetroLoc, towards one of the most extreme scenarios, the large-scale metro environments. MetroLoc is built atop an IMU-centric state estimator that tightly couples light detection and ranging (LiDAR), visual, and inertial information with the convenience of loosely coupled methods. The proposed framework is composed of three submodules: IMU odometry, LiDAR-inertial odometry (LIO), and Visual-inertial odometry (VIO). The IMU is treated as the primary sensor, which achieves the observations from LIO and VIO to constrain the accelerometer and gyroscope biases. Compared to previous point-only LIO methods, our approach leverages more geometry information by introducing both line and plane features into motion estimation. The VIO also utilizes the environmental structure information by employing both lines and points. Our proposed method has been tested in the long-during metro environments with a maintenance vehicle. Experimental results show the system more accurate and robust than the state-of-the-art approaches with real-time performance. The proposed method can reach 0.278% maximum drift in translation even in the highly degenerated tunnels.

Defects in the SRSs will bring great risk to the success of railway engineering projects. Therefore, formal modeling and verification methods are introduced to ensure the correctness of TCS. However, there is a huge gap between the formal computer executable model and the SRSs of TCS described in natural language. To solve this problem, a complete conversion process of ‘TCS requirement specification $\rightarrow $ semi-formal models (UML/SysML) $\rightarrow $ formal models (safety verification model and reliability evaluation model)’ should be created to ensure full coverage and consistency of semi-formal models and formal models to the SRSs of TCS. With the continuous development of wireless communication, artificial intelligence, and control technology, the future advanced TCS is developing towards a more intelligent and autonomous direction. Online safety monitoring and operational state-based maintenance approaches are critical technologies for developing the future advanced TCS. However, the traditional model-checking approach is time-consuming and susceptible to state space explosion problems. To reduce the difficulty of online safety monitoring and reliability evaluation, machine learning algorithms should be combined with the traditional model checking approaches to improve the verification efficiency during train operation.

To this end, many Unmanned Aircraft Traffic Management systems (UTM) have been designed. These systems use various methods for managing UAV conflicts. Several surveys have reviewed conflict resolution methods for UAVs. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is no survey specifically addressing conflict detection and resolution methods in UTM, particularly those using AI-based methods. Therefore, this article serves as a comprehensive survey of all UAVs conflicts detection and resolution methods proposed in the literature and their use in the UTM systems. This survey classifies the methods into two categories: classical (non-learning) methods and learning-based methods. Classical methods typically rely on pre-defined algorithms or rules for UAVs to avoid collisions, whereas Artificial Intelligence-based methods, including Machine Learning (ML) and especially Reinforcement Learning (RL), enable UAVs to adapt to their environment, autonomously resolve conflicts, and exhibit intelligent behavior based on their experiences. It also presents their application in the conflict resolution service for UTMs. Additionally, the challenges and issues associated with each type of methods are discussed. This article can serve as a foundational resource for researchers in guiding their selection of methods for conflict resolution, particularly those relevant to UTM systems.},

  abstract     = {Vehicular Edge Computing (VEC) is an emerging computing paradigm that serves as a specific application of Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) in intelligent transportation systems. As a core technology of VEC, task offloading improves computing efficiency and service quality by offloading computing tasks from vehicular devices to edge nodes. However, the high mobility of vehicles, heterogeneity of resources, and real-time requirements present significant challenges for task offloading. To address the issue of reducing overall system latency and increasing the offloading success rate in multi-task offloading, we propose a task offloading scheme combining Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) and Kuhn-Munkres (KM) Matching algorithm, named the PDQKM offloading scheme. Firstly, to mitigate the delay caused by frequent Roadside Unit (RSU) handovers, we propose a method to detect whether a vehicle is within the coverage area of the RSU. This method filters out unreasonable offloading decisions, avoiding the overhead associated with frequent RSU handovers. Secondly, the combination of DRL and the KM matching algorithm leverages the strengths of both approaches. DRL provides initial offloading strategies in highly dynamic and high-dimensional decision environment. Although DRL may get stuck in local optima, it can quickly adapt to environmental changes. The KM matching algorithm, a classic solution for perfect task-resource matching, performs global optimization on the initial strategies provided by DRL. This integration overcomes the limitations that a single algorithm might have. Finally, to effectively coordinate and manage the heterogeneous resources of RSU, we utilize an improved KM matching algorithm to update computational resources in real time, enhancing matching efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that PDQKM outperforms comparable offloading schemes in terms of overall system latency and offloading success rate optimization.},

  abstract     = {Traffic flow prediction plays a pivotal role in intelligent transportation systems. While previous efforts have made significant advances in modeling spatio-temporal dependencies, the traffic data collected by sensors in real-world scenarios is inherently limited, and the scarcity of data impedes model optimization. Moreover, it is difficult for existing models to capture the dynamic properties caused by changes in traffic patterns because they often use shared parameterization to model the time correlations of all time periods. To address these challenges, we propose a Spatio-Temporal Contrastive Learning-based Adaptive Graph Augmentation (STCL-AGA) framework for traffic flow prediction, which captures and adapts to evolving traffic patterns by employing dynamic graph adjustments and flow data masking. Specifically, our approach leverages spatio-temporal correlations captured through convolution operations. It improves adaptability through adaptive graph augmentation, which dynamically adjusts the graph structure and incorporates nodes flow masking based on traffic conditions. This approach achieves accurate traffic predictions by effectively integrating temporal and spatial data transformations. Experiments on five benchmark datasets demonstrate that STCL-AGA consistently outperforms various state-of-the-art baselines.},

  abstract     = {This paper focuses on improving autonomous driving safety via task offloading from cellular vehicles (CVs), using vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) links, to a multi-access edge computing (MEC) server. Considering that the V2I links sometimes can be reused by vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications to improve spectrum utilization, the receiver of the V2I link may suffer from severe interference, causing outages during the task offloading. To tackle this issue, we propose the deployment of a reconfigurable intelligent computational surface (RICS) to enable, not only V2I reflective links but also interference cancellation at the V2V links exploiting the computational capability of its metamaterials. We devise a joint optimization formulation for the task offloading ratio between the CVs and the MEC server, the spectrum sharing strategy between V2V and V2I communications, as well as the RICS reflection and refraction matrices, to maximize a safety-based autonomous driving task. Due to the non-convexity of the problem and the coupling among its free variables, we transform it into a more tractable equivalent form, which is then decomposed into three sub-problems and solved via an alternate approximation method. Simulation results show that the proposed RICS-assisted offloading framework significantly improves the safety of the autonomous driving network, in which the safety coefficient of the CVs is improved by nearly 34%. The V2V data rate is improved by around 60%, which indicates that the RICS’s adjustment of the signals can effectively mitigate the interference of the V2V link.},

Wherein, secure data transmission is a prerequisite for realizing the above benefits of VCS. Unfortunately, although many works on secure data sharing have been proposed, these schemes suffer from practical weaknesses such as data source authentication, malicious identity traceability, and inefficiency. In this paper, we propose a practical conditional anonymization and leakage-resilient authentication solution for vehicular crowdsensing communication (CALRA). Our proposal not only resists the leakage of sensitive information about vehicles but also realizes the authentication of data senders, while guaranteeing the integrity, authenticity, and confidentiality of data. Besides, CALRA exploits traceability technology to pursue malicious/illegal participants, thus avoiding participants’ accountability evasion caused by absolute anonymity. Furthermore, our CALRA solution delegates complex computational processes into an offline formulation to reduce computational and communication overheads. Finally, our scheme is proved to be secure and unforgeable through the random oracle model, and the performance evaluation illustrates that our CALRA proposal is superior and practical.},

  abstract     = {Integrating energy storage systems (ESSs) into the railway power flow controller (RPFC) offers a promising path to enhance the interaction capability and connection compatibility between the railway power systems (RPSs) and the utility. Despite its technical advantages, full consideration must be given to the media-type & configuration of ESS, the rating of RPFC, and the control framework that can compatibly integrate the control & planning for cost-efficiency improvement. For this problem, a novel concept that takes the real-time control and off-line configuration approach in a unified framework is proposed for hybrid ESS-integrated RPFC (HESS-RPFC) in this paper, in which the comprehensive techno-economic performances of the whole system are taken into account. First, a unified analytical power regulation framework is established for HESS-RPFC, in which the functions of energy management (EM) and power quality control are seamlessly integrated. To realize EM, improve RPS’s grid-connection compatibility, and reduce the rating of RPFC, a double-layer power regulation strategy of HESS-RPFC is developed on the proposed framework. Subsequently, a lifetime net benefit-oriented optimization model is formulated and solved, through which, the optimal rating configuration of the whole system and HESS’s mode-triggering thresholds can be obtained. Finally, a comprehensive performance evaluation based on real-measured data is conducted, revealing that HESS-RPFC with the proposed method provides superior economic benefits over single-media ESS schemes, ensures satisfactory grid-connection compatibility for the RPS, and reduces the RPFC’s rating by nearly 46%. Additionally, the real-time execution feasibility of the proposal is demonstrated by hardware-in-the-loop tests.},

However, because STTD is often massive in scale, practitioners need to strike a balance between effectiveness and efficiency using computationally efficient models. An alternative paradigm based on multilayer perceptron (MLP) called MLP-Mixer has the potential for both simplicity and effectiveness. Taking inspiration from its success in other domains, we propose an adapted version, named NexuSQN, for STTD forecast at scale. We first identify the challenges faced when directly applying MLP-Mixers as series- and window-wise multivaluedness. To distinguish between spatial and temporal patterns, the concept of ST-contextualization is then proposed. Our results surprisingly show that this simple-yet-effective solution can rival SOTA baselines when tested on several traffic benchmarks. Furthermore, NexuSQN has demonstrated its versatility across different domains, including energy and environment data, and has been deployed in a collaborative project with Baidu to predict congestion in megacities like Beijing and Shanghai. Our findings contribute to the exploration of simple-yet-effective models for real-world STTD forecasting.},

To address this issue, we propose the Ultra-Fast Deraining Plugin (UFDP), a model-efficient deraining solution specifically designed to realign the distribution of rainy images and their rain-free counterparts. UFDP not only effectively removes rain from images but also seamlessly integrates into existing visual perception models, significantly enhancing their robustness and stability under rainy conditions. Through a detailed analysis of single-image color histograms and dataset-level distribution, we demonstrate how UFDP improves the similarity between rainy and non-rainy image distributions. Additionally, qualitative and quantitative results highlight UFDP’s superiority over state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, showing a 5.4% improvement in SSIM and 8.1% in PSNR. UFDP also excels in terms of efficiency, achieving 7 times higher FPS than the slowest method, reducing FLOPs by 53.7 times, and using 28.8 times fewer MACs, with 6.2 times fewer parameters. This makes UFDP an ideal solution for ensuring reliable performance in autonomous driving visual perception systems, particularly in challenging rainy environments.},

  abstract     = {The recent surge in the development of autonomous vehicles has increased the need for reliable dynamic positioning of road agents in urban areas. Doppler frequency measurement of the global navigation satellite system (GNSS) can provide dynamic information and be used to estimate velocity. However, similar to pseudorange, the accuracy of Doppler frequency is degraded in dense urban areas, due to signal reflections from obstacles, resulting in substantial velocity errors. Existing methods tend to directly exclude non-line-of-sight (NLOS) Doppler frequency, which in turn leads to insufficient measurement numbers. 3D mapping aided (3DMA) GNSS ray-tracing method is commonly used to estimate extra delay from NLOS. The angle of arrival (AOA) of the reflected signal is obtained while tracing the propagation path, which can also be used to simulate NLOS Doppler frequency. Thus, this paper investigates the potential of using NLOS Doppler frequency as a feature for estimating velocity. A novel candidate-based 3DMA GNSS velocity estimation framework is proposed using Doppler frequency to examine the consistency between simulation on each candidate and measurement. Experimental results show NLOS Doppler frequency feature can enhance velocity estimation accuracy, reducing the root-mean-square error of velocity estimation by 46% from 1.06 m/s to 0.57 m/s in dense urban areas.},

However, the power of PV and traction loads (TL) has multi-directional, large amplitude, and high-frequency fluctuation characteristics in the FTPSS. Thus, realizing efficient and high-quality dispatch for FTPSS has become a pressing challenge under the real-time energy management requirements. To this end, a real-time hierarchical energy management strategy (EMS) for FTPSS to improve the PV/RBE utilization and power supply quality is designed. First, a cooperative mechanism for energy hierarchical management is developed. That is, the multi-station level carries out cluster management in 10s, and the substation level carries out autonomy management in 1s. Secondly, a unified active-reactive power flow model for FTPSS is established at the multi-station cluster management level, determining the optimal power flow for the FTPSS and the line power losses. Meanwhile, a combined rule-based and optimization EMS is proposed at the substation autonomy management level, which combines the advantages of high timeliness of rule-based EMS with the multi-objective synchronization gain of optimization EMS. Finally, the performance of the proposed strategy is verified on the MATLAB simulation platform and RT-LAB semi-physical platform based on measured data.},

  abstract     = {Maritime surveillance plays a vital role in reducing maritime accidents and improving maritime safety. To enhance situational awareness for maritime movements, deep learning-based visual object detection has become an important part of maritime surveillance. However, the detection results are highly dependent on the training datasets collected from different departments (i.e., clients). If the sub-datasets from departments are sensitive and private in cross-department maritime surveillance, it will be intractable to directly combine these sub-datasets to train the learning-based object detection method. To solve this issue, we propose a federated learning-driven cross-spatial vessel detection model, called FLCSDet, for maritime surveillance with privacy preservation. In particular, an efficient multi-scale attention module is integrated into our FLCSDet to achieve local cross-spatial feature learning. To improve the federated-learning aggregation method, we propose an optimized algorithm based on the proportion of valid data on departments to adaptively select the allocating weights and preserve the specific characteristics of client data. In addition, we employ transfer learning to further improve the robustness and convergence of our FLCSDet under different experimental scenarios. Compared with several representative federated learning-based detection methods, our FLCSDet could achieve superior detection performance in terms of both quantitative and qualitative results. Moreover, comprehensive experiments conducted on real datasets from both inland waterways and open seas demonstrate the robustness and generalization of our method in intelligent transportation systems.

Yet, the validity of these assumptions is dubious given the heterogeneous nature of traffic flow and existence of abnormal driving behaviors. These limitations impede the efficacy of conventional microscopic models in crucial tasks like constructing AV test scenarios with specified risk levels, analyzing abnormal behaviors, etc. To address these challenges, this study contributes by proposing a model tailored to accommodate two-dimensional abnormal driving behaviors in microscopic traffic framework. The proposed approach have the following innovations: 1) it incorporates assumptions concerning abnormal behaviors in both the longitudinal and lateral dimensions; 2) abnormality at each dimension is captured by a combination of certain terms; 3) stochastic control barrier method is applied to customize the risk levels of the resulting traffic flow dynamics. Additionally, we present a method for retrieving vehicular maneuver information, enabling the extraction of detailed vehicle body gestures and driver control inputs, which would benefit the analysis of abnormal behavior. Our findings demonstrate that the proposed model yields longitudinal and lateral dynamics consistent with empirical observations, and various abnormal behavior patterns can be simulated.},

  abstract     = {Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) dwell on Vehicular Ad-hoc NETworks (VANETs) for message dissemination to achieve the goal of traffic safety and efficiency. VANETs achieve communication among vehicles and roadside units via wireless communication. Hence, security and privacy are significant concerns to be addressed for an effective application of secure VANETs in any ITS. Researchers have addressed these issues with trust management-based schemes or cryptography-based schemes. While these schemes can secure VANETs, they have various limitations presenting hindrances in their deployment. In this context, we have proposed a Blockchain-assisted Trust Computation with a Conditional Privacy-preserving Authentication (BTC2PA) scheme for connected vehicles. The BTC2PA scheme uses a blockchain (Ethereum) assisted PKI infrastructure with digital signatures to achieve authentication for secure communication. Furthermore, it integrates a trust score computation scheme based on a reward and punishment mechanism to provide resistance against internal attacks. The feasibility and validity of the proposed BTC2PA scheme have been studied by implementation work in Rinkeby (Ethereum test network) and extensive simulations using NS-3. The results obtained show that the proposed BTC2PA scheme meets the security and privacy requirements while significantly improving the performance metrics such as communication, storage, computation cost, and end-to-end delay when compared to existing schemes.},

Illegal fishing poses a significant threat to conservation and economic fishing zones, and its detection is often hindered by tactics such as the disabling or manipulation of Automatic Identification System (AIS) transponders. While convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown promise in ship detection from optical imagery, the fine-grained classification of fishing vessels is limited by the scarcity of detailed datasets, as these vessels are often underrepresented in existing databases. POSEIDON-SAT addresses this gap by augmenting datasets with synthesized fishing vessel instances, improving the performance of ship detection models, particularly in low-resource scenarios. This approach is tailored for use on low-power, edge computing platforms aboard small satellites, such as CubeSats, where computational resources are highly constrained. By comparing POSEIDON-SAT to traditional class-weighting techniques, we evaluate its impact on lightweight YOLO models optimized for real-time detection aboard such satellites. Our experimental results demonstrate that POSEIDON-SAT significantly improves detection accuracy while reducing false positives, making it an effective tool for enhancing the capabilities of remote sensing platforms in monitoring illegal fishing. This method holds promise for addressing the global challenge of illegal fishing through scalable, efficient satellite-based monitoring systems.},

Then, an adaptive auxiliary dynamic system is designed to solve the problem of input saturation caused by actuator constraints.

This paper presents a global-local framework to address these issues, which includes a prompt-guided grounding module, a trained local tracking module, and a memory-based switcher module. The prompt-guided grounding module uses noun prompts to guide the CLIP model in focusing more on target regions and aligning visual features semantically with linguistic features, avoiding being misled by distractors and background. The memory-based switch module stores historical information with higher-quality memory, allowing the model to make more accurate decisions based on reliable data, thus improving the overall performance.

This study presents an evaluation system for PSHs along high-speed railroad tracks. First, a novel hybrid learning architecture named UYOLO (U-shape You Only Look Once) is designed, which integrate the CSP-based backbone and detection branch to produce three scale high-level features for the object detection. Then, an innovative parsing branch inserted behind high-level layer of the structure progressively transmits context information to the shallow layer to accurately accomplish the pixel-level parsing task. Second, a new loss function using minimum point distance IoU (MPD-IoU) is designed and incorporated into the architecture to optimize the coordinate regression process of the predicted bounding boxes. Conveniently, an image-based hazard evaluation model is also developed and integrated to rate the hazard level of the detected PSHs. Finally, extensive experiments conducted on the track environment dataset established with UAV imagery indicate the proposed system can achieve a high detection rate yet remains efficient and convenient.},

  abstract     = {Haze severely degrades the visual quality of remote sensing images and hampers the performance of road extraction, vehicle detection, and traffic flow monitoring. The emerging denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) exhibits the significant potential for dense haze removal with its strong generation ability. Since remote sensing images contain extensive small-scale texture structures, it is important to effectively restore image details from hazy images. However, current wisdom of DDPM fails to preserve image details and color fidelity well, limiting its dehazing capacity for remote sensing images. In this paper, we propose a novel unified Fourier-aware diffusion model for remote sensing image dehazing, termed RSHazeDiff. From a new perspective, RSHazeDiff explores the conditional DDPM to improve image quality in dense hazy scenarios, and it makes three key contributions. First, RSHazeDiff refines the training phase of diffusion process by performing noise estimation and reconstruction constraints in a coarse-to-fine fashion. Thus, it remedies the unpleasing results caused by the simple noise estimation constraint in DDPM. Second, by taking the frequency information as important prior knowledge during iterative sampling steps, RSHazeDiff can preserve more texture details and color fidelity in dehazed images. Third, we design a global compensated learning module to utilize the Fourier transform to capture the global dependency features of input images, which can effectively mitigate the effects of boundary artifacts when processing fixed-size patches. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks validate the favorable performance of RSHazeDiff over state-of-the-art methods.

However, cracks can not be extracted completely and accurately due to problems such as low contrast, high noise, and complex topology of pavement cracks. To address these issues, we propose a directional connectivity feature enhancement network for pavement crack detection. In this network, we build multi-directional enhanced convolution to capture the complex topology of cracks, which is more sensitive to long cracks. To leverage both low-level detail information and high-level semantic information in the network, a novel multi-scale fusion attention is constructed to strengthen the mutual guidance of crack information between channels. The directional connectivity is introducted to establish loss module, which enhances the position and direction information between neighbouring pixels and further refines the crack edge features. To validate the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed method, we experiment on six publicly available crack datasets, DeepCrack, Crack500, CFD, DCD, EdmCrack600 and DCCE. Compared to other networks, our network achieves 2.2% improvement in ODS and 1.8% improvement in MIoU on the DeepCrack dataset, and 1.2% improvement in ODS and 0.9% improvement in MIoU on the Crack500 dataset.

This approach hinders the efficient utilization of abundant but focused data. Furthermore, stacking multiple expert networks to address these perception objectives inevitably introduces additional computational overhead. To address this limitation, we propose Uni-EPM (Unified Extensible Perception Model), with a novel training framework for multi-task perception using task prompt selection to decouple tasks, which enables perceiving traffic signs and traffic lights in addition to lane lines and traffic elements from existing task-specific datasets without re-labeling. To the best of our knowledge, Uni-EPM is the first model can do this in the field of autonomous driving. By introducing the parameter-sharing decoder among tasks, we alleviate the problems of stacking task heads, including significant parameter increase, etc. Uni-EPM achieves state-of-the-art results in multi-task algorithms without substantial increase in parameters, which also demonstrates comparable performance to existing standalone models.

  abstract     = {Monocular 3D lane detection plays a crucial role in autonomous driving, assisting vehicles in safe navigation. Existing methods primarily utilize calibrated camera parameters in the dataset to conduct 3D lane detection from a single image. However, errors or sudden absence of camera parameters can pose significant challenges to safe driving. On one hand, this can lead to incorrect feature acquisition, which further affects the precision of lane detection. On the other hand, it renders methods relying on transformation matrices for temporal fusion ineffective. To address the above issue and achieve accurate 3D lane detection, we propose CaliFree3DLane, a calibration-free method for spatio-temporal 3D lane detection based on Transformer structure. Instead of using geometric projections to obtain static reference points on images, we propose a reference point refinement strategy that dynamically updates the reference points and finally generates appropriate sampling points for image feature extraction. To integrate multi-frame features, we generate sub-queries from the current scene query to focus on the image features of each frame independently. We then aggregate these sub-queries to form a more comprehensive scene query for 3D lane detection. Using these operations, CaliFree3DLane accurately transforms multi-frame image features into the current bird’s-eye view (BEV) space, enabling precise 3D lane detection. Experimental results show that our CaliFree3DLane achieves state-of-the-art 3D lane detection performance in various datasets. Compared to the Transformer-based methods of the same type, we have also improved $ {6.0\%}\sim {10.5\%}$ at the F1 score. Code is available at https://github.com/Ciisrlab/CaliFree3DLane.},

  abstract     = {3D multi-object tracking is an important component of autonomous driving technology. Recent 3D multi-object tracking methods still suffer from issues such as information loss during the fusion of multimodal features, weak discriminative power of the association matrix, and poor robustness of single similarity measure. To address these problems, this paper proposes a Multimodal Collaboration-guided Cascade Association network for 3D multi-object tracking (MCCA-MOT). We design a point cloud feature adaptive diffusion fusion module. This module utilizes inverse distance weighting aggregation diffusion technology to address the issue of information loss during the feature fusion process. This enhances the tracking performance of small objects. Secondly, we propose a dynamic sampling feature cooperative fusion module. This module performs fine-grained local-global feature cooperative fusion based on dynamic sampling, enhancing the distinctiveness of object features. It improves the tracking capability of occluded objects. Finally, in the multi-similarity measure-driven cascading association module, we construct a more discriminative association matrix using multiple types of information and design a cascading strategy. This strategy applies different similarity measures at different association stages for objects with ambiguous features. This reduces identity switches and trajectory fragmentation. Extensive experiments on the KITTI dataset demonstrate the superiority of our method in various performance metrics. Our detailed implementations can be obtained at https://github.com/yuanfuture/MCCA-MOT.},

  abstract     = {Communication connectivity is the main factor that affects networked unmanned surface vehicles’ (NUSVs) formation maneuverability. When vehicles are maneuvered for obstacle avoidance, distances between neighbors may exceed the limits of allowable communication ranges, causing communication interruption. Within this context, this paper proposes an event-driven fully distributed affine formation maneuver control (FDAFMC) scheme for NUSVs undergoing intermittent network connectivity. Firstly, a distributed observer is developed to divide the whole system into the cooperative localization subsystem and the tracking subsystem. A node-based adaptive gain is then developed in the cooperative localization layer to synthesize the intermittent event-triggered mechanism. Based on this framework, communication interruption occurring both in position and yaw channels can be considered integrally. Furthermore, by resorting to a preset ${\mathcal { L}}_{2}$ gain in the tracking layer, system stability, and robustness are tactfully ensured. The prominent feature of the proposed method lies in ensuring maneuver flexibility without assuming a constantly maintained network connectivity. Simulation results show the efficacy of the FDAFMC strategy.},

To address the above issues, a Specificity-guided Cross-modal Feature Reconstruction(SCFR) algorithm is proposed to establish modality-specific correlation for RGB-Infrared object detection. Specifically, the proposed SCFR involves the modality-specific cross-modal feature reconstruction network and two modality-specific losses.

The modality-specific losses guide the direction of feature learning for reconstructing the expressive modality-specific features.

  abstract     = {The development of Electric Vehicles (EVs) in smart city infrastructure has ushered in new opportunities for vehicle automation but poses challenges to the electricity load (EL) and computational load (CL) on the smart grid. While existing studies utilized Fog/Edge computing as a decentralized solution to mitigate the EL and CL on the smart grid, these often overlook the idle computational resources of EVs. Therefore, Electric Vehicle Edge Computing (EVEC) leverages EVs as the extended computational resources of edge compute nodes called edge servers. Our proposed architecture strategically schedules EVs to targeted electric vehicle parking lots (EVPLs), to minimize the EL and CL of all EVPLs, EVs based on EV preference within the smart grid as a whole. To handle the EV scheduling, we develop a greedy-based algorithm to tackle the complexity of the optimization problem. While the greedy algorithm ensures computational efficiency and effective local optimization, it does not always guarantee global optimality. Upon EV arrival at an EVPL, we develop an algorithm based upon the convex-concave procedure (CCP) and derive the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions to determine the optimal devoted computational resources of EVs. Furthermore, our model introduces an incentive mechanism that encourages EVs as vehicular fog computing (VFC) nodes to fully devote their computational resources, while ensuring the profitability of the Edge Computing Orchestrator (ECO). Through comprehensive simulations, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by completely utilizing the charging time of EVs for computation at EVPLs, which brings benefits to EVs, edge servers, and ECO by optimizing the devoted computational resources based upon the CL of edge servers.},

  abstract     = {Obtaining accurate data on bus ridership is a challenge for public transport operators. Wi-Fi data, collected from sensors placed on buses, seem promising for generating O-D matrices over a network. However, the large amount of passive data obtained does not necessarily lead to a more accurate understanding of mobility patterns. Problems of completeness remain, as Wi-Fi sensors do not detect all signals emitted by connected devices in their vicinity, and some people do not own these devices. Data correction is therefore a crucial step in the process of building O-D matrices from Wi-Fi data. In recent years, the democratization of machine learning and artificial intelligence has provided interesting methodological avenues. In this work, machine learning algorithms (Random Forest, Light Gradient Boosting Machine and Multilayer Perceptron) are used to estimate the absolute values of passengers boarding and alighting at a bus stop based on Wi-Fi data. The main advantage of these models is their ability to use spatial and temporal features, which are necessary to overcome the problem of data completeness. The results show that LGBM is the most relevant algorithm for generating accurate data on the number of passengers boarding and alighting at each bus stop, taking into account their spatio-temporal variability.},

Estimating vehicle motion from a very slow speed to beyond the limits of handling under various conditions not only on asphalt but also on snow with sufficient accuracy using automotive level sensors is a significant challenge. This paper presents a robust vehicle state estimation algorithm that covers full-range vehicle motion under various road and maneuvering conditions. An inertial measurement unit (IMU) is used as the main sensor, whereas an adaptive vehicle model is used as a stochastic constraint to enhance the accuracy and resilience of the algorithm. Furthermore, unknown sensor delays are estimated for sensors that are not time-synchronized, thereby resulting in a zero-delay vehicle state output. Four real car experiments were conducted: urban driving, racetrack sports driving, drift driving, and snow/ice driving with large sliding motions. The position, velocity, and attitude errors were less than 0.1 m, 0.1 m/s, and 0.1 deg, respectively, under all conditions. Furthermore, the position errors during 8 and 96 s of dead-reckoning were below 0.1 and 0.66 m, respectively.

  abstract     = {Texts on the intelligent transportation scene include mass information. Fully harnessing this information is one of the critical drivers for advancing intelligent transportation. Unlike the general scene, detecting text in transportation has extra demand, such as a fast inference speed, except for high accuracy. Most existing real-time text detection methods are based on the shrink mask, which loses some geometry semantic information and needs complex post-processing. In addition, the previous method usually focuses on correct output, which ignores feature correction and lacks guidance during the intermediate process. To this end, we propose an efficient multi-scene text detector that contains an effective text representation similar mask (SM) and a feature correction module (FCM). Unlike previous methods, the former aims to preserve the geometric information of the instances as much as possible. Its post-progressing saves 50% of the time, accurately and efficiently reconstructing text contours. The latter encourages false positive features to move away from the positive feature center, optimizing the predictions from the feature level. Some ablation studies demonstrate the efficiency of the SM and the effectiveness of the FCM. Moreover, the deficiency of existing traffic datasets (such as the low-quality annotation or closed source data unavailability) motivated us to collect and annotate a traffic text dataset, which introduces motion blur. In addition, to validate the scene robustness of the SM-Net, we conduct experiments on traffic, industrial, and natural scene datasets. Extensive experiments verify it achieves (SOTA) performance on several benchmarks. The code and dataset are available at: https://github.com/fengmulin/SMNet.},

So, the extracted vehicle features contained vehicle view information, and the impact of view differences on model performance can be reduced. Since ensemble training with different methods will affect each other, it is difficult for these methods to train models together with other non view-aware methods. In order to address this challenge, in this paper, we propose a view-aware-based post-processing method (VABPP), which uses vehicle view information to re-rank the re-identification results during testing. According to vehicle views, VABPP method divide the distances between vehicle id features into several groups. During testing, multiply the distances of each different group by different coefficients. So, it treats different views equally. In order to achieve better implementation of this post-processing method, in this paper, we also propose a scheme that unifies the feature distance distributions of the training set and the test set. This scheme can enable some properties of the training set to be directly used in the test set. As the properties of the training set are trained under the guidance of correctly labeled labels, which enhances the robustness of the test set properties. The mAP in VeRi-776 dataset and in the three test sets of VERI-Wild dataset are 83.7%, 88.7%, 84.6% and 78.5%, respectively.

Unlike existing works that only look at fundamental modules in isolation, this work enhances AV safety in mixed-traffic high-speed cruising scenarios by proposing an integrated framework that synthesizes three fundamental modules, i.e., behavioral decision-making, path-planning, and motion-control modules. Considering that the integrated framework would increase the system complexity, a bootstrapped deep Q-Network (DQN) is employed to enhance the deep exploration of the reinforcement learning method and achieve adaptive decision making of AVs. Moreover, to make AV behavior understandable by surrounding HDVs to prevent unexpected operations caused by misinterpretations, we derive an inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) approach to learn the reward function of skilled drivers for the path planning of lane-changing maneuvers.

  abstract     = {With the increasing demand for dynamic behaviors in automotive use cases, Software Defined Vehicles (SDVs) have emerged as a promising solution by bringing dynamic onboard service management capabilities. While users may request a wide range of services during vehicle operation, background tasks such as cooperative Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) services can activate on-the-fly in response to real-time road conditions. In this dynamic environment, the efficient allocation of onboard resources becomes a complex challenge, in order to meet mixed-criticality onboard Quality-of-Service (QoS) network requirements while ensuring an optimal user experience (UX). Additionally, the ever-evolving real-time network connectivity and computational availability conditions further complicate the process. In this context, first we introduce the concept of Automotive eXperience Integrity Level (AXIL) which expresses a runtime priority for non-safety-critical applications to enable dynamic orchestration. Second, we present a dynamic resource-based onboard service orchestration algorithm that considers real-time in-vehicle and V2X network health, along with onboard resource constraints, to select degraded modes for onboard applications and maximize user experience. Third, we show by simulation that our algorithm produces near-optimal solutions while significantly reducing execution time: it satisfies approximately 90% of the onboard UX compared to the optimal while reducing the execution time of one to two orders of magnitude compared to an exact solver. With this approach, we aim to enable efficient onboard execution for a UX-focused service orchestration.},

  abstract     = {Metro networks necessitate continuous expansion, either extending existing lines or constructing new ones. Optimizing this process, however, presents multifaceted challenges due to complex spatial and demographic relationships, dynamic travel patterns, and a vast solution space with non-linearities and multiple objectives. Existing approaches often fall short, either relying heavily on subjective expert knowledge or limiting their scope to isolated corridors. This paper introduces MetroZero, a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework designed to overcome these limitations. We formulate the optimization as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and leverage a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm guided by an actor-critic agent. This powerful combination identifies the optimal sequence of expansion stations within budgetary constraints. To effectively learn network representations, we develop a multiplex graph encoder powered by attentive message passing. A graph attention network (GAT) and a feasibility mask are employed to prioritize high-potential expansion locations and navigate the search space. Inspired by AlphaZero, we train MetroZero through simulated self-play expansion games. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets from Beijing and Changsha demonstrate MetroZero’s effectiveness and superiority. In a complex expansion scenario, it achieves remarkable improvements of 19.6% and 20.4% over the second-best model. Further experiments across varied urban contexts underscore MetorZero’s scalability and adaptability.},

  abstract     = {In this work, the problem of predicting a pedestrian’s intention to cross the road is addressed using visual data from a camera. The proposed ROS-based modular architecture consists of four modules: Visual-Perception, Intention Prediction, and Planning and Control Modules. The Visual Perception module is divided into three sub-modules. The pedestrian detection is responsible for detecting the pedestrian and analyzing his motion and looking states. The lane detection is responsible for analyzing the structured environment which helps in the road state classifiers. The third sub-module aims to extract some curvilinear localization states that are essential for the vehicle’s motion planning and control. The intention prediction module captures the pedestrian’s intention to cross the road. A comparative study is conducted between three different data-driven sequential models. Each model is trained on the JAAD dataset and different extracted features from the visual perception module. The proposed GRU model obtained an 86% average f1-score, anticipating the pedestrian’s intention two seconds in advance when the pedestrian is standing, and three seconds in advance when the pedestrian is walking to the crossing area. To control the maneuver of the vehicle, longitudinal velocity and lateral controllers are implemented to control the motion of the vehicle while avoid collision with the pedestrian based on the intention prediction. Finally, this work is verified on a 1:4 scaled real vehicle to ensure the applicability of implementing this work in real hardware.},

  abstract     = {Uncertainty in climate change poses challenges in obtaining accurate and reliable prediction models for future pavement performance. This study aimed to develop an advanced prediction model specifically for flexible pavements, incorporating uncertainty quantification through a Bayesian Neural Network (BNN). Focusing on predicting the International Roughness Index (IRI) and rut depth of asphalt pavement, BNN model was applied to different climate regions, using long-term pavement performance (LTPP) data from 1989 to 2021. The Tree-structured Parzen Estimators (TPE) algorithm was used to optimize model hyperparameters. The impact of climate change on IRI and rut depth was analyzed. Results showed that the proposed BNN model surpasses Artificial Neural Network (ANN), providing predictions with confidence intervals that account for uncertainty in climate data and model parameters. Compared to historical climate data, increases in IRI and rut depth were more significant when based on projected climate data. Relying only on historical climate data would underestimate pavement deterioration. Climate change appeared to have a more significant impact on rut depth than on IRI. Rut depth was particularly sensitive to climate change, increasing by more than 40%. Considering the uncertainty, rutting depth could increase by up to 85.6%. This highlights the importance of considering regional differences in climate change when developing reliable prediction models. The main contributions of this study include the quantification of uncertainty, the impact analysis of climate change and regional sensitivity analysis. It helps adapt to future climate change and supports informed decision-making in transportation infrastructure management.},

  abstract     = {LiDAR-based 3D object detection is essential for autonomous driving. In order to extract information from sparse and unordered point cloud data, pillar-based methods make the data compact and orderly by converting point cloud into pseudo images. However, these methods suffer from limited feature extraction capabilities, and tend to lose key information during the conversion, leading to inferior detection accuracy than voxel-based or point-based methods especially for small objects. In this paper, we propose SCNet3D, a novel pillar-based method that tackles the challenges of feature enhancement, information preservation, and small target detection from the perspectives of features and data. We first introduce a Feature Enhancement Module (FEM), which uses the attention mechanism to weight features in three dimensions, and enhances 3D features from local to global layer by layer. Then, a STMod-Convolution Network (SCNet) is designed, which achieves sufficient feature extraction and fusion of BEV pseudo images through two channels, one for basic feature and one for advanced feature. Moreover, a Shape and Distance Aware Data Augmentation (SDAA) approach is proposed to add more samples to the point cloud while maintaining the original shape and distance of the samples during the training process. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our SCNet3D has superior performance and excellent robustness. Remarkably, SCNet3D achieves the AP of 82.35% in the moderate Car category, 44.64% in the moderate Pedestrian category and 67.55% in the moderate Cyclist category on the KITTI test split in 3D detection benchmark, outperforming many state-of-the-art 3D detectors.},

Furthermore, accurate tracking of surrounding objects is crucial for emerging applications, such as autonomous driving and multi-robot collaboration. To this end, we present LIO-LOT, a tightly coupled LiDAR-inertial and multi-object tracking (MOT) system. In our system, each movable object is represented by a 3-D bounding box, derived from an object detector. Subsequently, these objects are associated with historical trajectories through a hybrid information matching strategy that integrates detections and geometric feature information. Considering tracking continuity and motion consistency, the associated objects are further categorized into high-confidence ones and low-confidence ones. Building upon this foundation, these two categories of objects are flexibly coupled with inertial measurement unit (IMU) pre-integration measurements and static scene structures to optimize the poses of both tracked objects and ego-vehicle under a factor graph optimization framework. For implementation, the aggregated information of high- and low-confidence objects are fully leveraged to form the object-related factors, which are hierarchically optimized with LIO, enhancing system stability in cases of poor object detections. The system’s performance is extensively evaluated using the KITTI and nuScenes datasets. Experimental results explicitly demonstrate that the proposed system outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in terms of ego-localization and multi-object tracking, particularly in highly dynamic scenarios with situations of occlusion and truncation.},

However, the challenge lies in obtaining complete and accurate traffic data because of various factors. Therefore, many models have been studied for traffic data imputation. Most studies overlook the extreme case where the missing rate of observed traffic data exceeds 90%, causing the existing traffic data imputation models to struggle in achieving satisfactory results. To address this extreme case, this paper proposes a novel Latent Factor Analysis model with Temporal Regularized Constraint (LFA-TRC) for handling road traffic data imputation. The proposed model is built on three main parts: a) Enhancing the stability of the training process through spatio-temporal linear biases, b) Capturing information in the traffic data time series by the first-order temporal difference constraint, and c) Accelerating convergence during the training process by incorporating generalized momentum. Experimental results on seven real-world traffic datasets demonstrate that the proposed LFA-TRC model outperforms eight state-of-the-art models in traffic data imputation and reduces the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) by an average of 20.81%.},

Multi-frame fusion of point clouds is a promising technique to enhance 3D object detection for autonomous driving systems. However, most existing multi-frame detection methods focus primarily on utilizing vehicle-side lidar data. Infrastructure-side detection remains relatively unexplored, yet can enhance vital vehicle-road coordination capabilities. To help with this coordination, we propose an efficient multi-frame aggregation multi-scale fusion network specifically for infrastructure-side 3D object detection. First, our key innovation is a novel multi-frame feature aggregation module that effectively integrates information from multiple past point cloud frames to improve detection accuracy. This module comprises a feature pyramid network to fuse multi-scale features, as well as a cross-attention mechanism to learn semantic correlations between different frames over time. Next, we incorporate deformable attention, which reduces the computational overhead of aggregation by sampling locations. We designed Multi-frame and Multi-scale modules, thereby we named the model MAMF-Net. Finally, through extensive experiments on two infrastructure-side datasets including the V2X-Seq-SPD dataset which was released by Baidu corporation, we demonstrate that MAMF-Net delivers consistent accuracy improvements over single frame detectors such as PointPillars, PV-RCNN and TED-S, especially boosting pedestrian detection by 5%. Our approach also surpasses other multi-frame methods designed for vehicle-side point clouds such as MPPNet.},

Recognizing and accounting for the impact of learning-based algorithm uncertainties on other functional modules can be crucial for making more dependable driving behavior decisions and for selecting more appropriate driving precaution measures, as opposed to directly executing safety fallback strategies like emergency braking. With the motivation of optimizing the safety without unnecessary disruption to the driving experience, this paper proposes an uncertainty-aware, dual-tiered decision making method named DBNID, which is based on dynamic Bayesian network (DBN) and influence diagram (ID). To begin, the paper formulates the effects of uncertainty propagation stemming from perception and prediction modules using a DBN model. The effects are then solved by an expectation maximum (EM) algorithm. Furthermore, how the uncertainty propagation effects are considered in the decision making process is then presented in an ID model with the introduction of the utility function formulation. Finally, the proposed DBNID method is evaluated on a simulation platform tailored for real-world autonomous driving testing. By considering uncertainty propagation, the results demonstrate that the proposed method can significantly reduce the likelihood of violating critical safe stop requirements, while simultaneously enhancing the minimum time-to-collision (TTC) performance. DBNID method offers valuable insights of integrating learning-based algorithm uncertainties into autonomous vehicle decision making process.},

Currently, there are two challenges with traffic data prediction as follows: a) Most of the existing models are designed for a full set of data, but traffic data are unavoidably missing. b) Most of the existing models often suffer from excessive complexity due to long sequences. To address these issues, we propose a novel 3D Convolution-Incorporated Dimension Preserved Decomposition (3DCIDP) model for traffic data prediction with three main fold ideas: a) enhancing the low-rank property of traffic data to accurately capture its structure, b) learning the constraints of historical sequences to predict sequences through representation modelling and c) capturing spatio-temporal interaction information in traffic data through multidimensional interaction features. To evaluate the performance of the proposed 3DCIDP, we conduct extensive experiments using five publicly available datasets with three different missing rates. When the proposed 3DCIDP is compared to state-of-the-art models, experimental results show that the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) is reduced by an average of 4.22% and the training time is reduced by an average of 89.76% on the large-scale traffic datasets.},

  abstract     = {The acquisition of real-time and accurate traffic arrival information is of vital importance for proactive traffic control systems, especially in partially connected vehicle environments. License plate recognition (LPR) data that record both vehicle departures and identities are proven to be desirable in reconstructing lane-based arrival curves in previous works. Existing LPR data-based methods are predominantly designed for reconstructing historical arrival curves. For real-time reconstruction of multi-lane urban roads, it is pivotal to determine the lane choice of real-time link-based arrivals, which has not been exploited in previous studies. In this study, we propose a Bayesian deep learning approach for real-time lane-based arrival curve reconstruction, in which the lane choice patterns and uncertainties of link-based arrivals are both characterized. Specifically, the learning process is designed to effectively capture the relationship between partially observed link-based arrivals and lane-based arrivals, which can be physically interpreted as lane choice proportion. Moreover, the lane choice uncertainties are characterized using Bayesian parameter inference techniques, minimizing arrival curve reconstruction uncertainties, especially in low LPR data matching rate conditions. Real-world experiment results conducted in multiple matching rate scenarios demonstrate the superiority and necessity of lane choice modeling in reconstructing arrival curves.},

  abstract     = {Traffic flow Forecasting is essential in intelligent transportation systems. Although graph neural networks perform well with non-Euclidean traffic data, they exhibit limits in accurately capturing complex spatio-temporal dependencies. Most current methodologies assume instantaneous propagation of traffic flow information, neglecting the delay in information propagation between nodes. Moreover, traditional graph convolutional models capture spatial dependencies using static adjacency matrices, overlooking the dynamic correlations among nodes over time. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a delay propagation spatio-temporal graph convolutional network (DPSTGC) for traffic prediction. By incorporating the delay propagation of traffic flow information into a directed graph of the road network, this model accurately captures the spatio-temporal dependencies of traffic flows. To refine the relationships between nodes, adaptive graph convolution network is employed to learn the dynamic correlation between nodes. The alternating application of temporal gated convolutions and spatial structure significantly enhances the model’s capacity to interpret spatio-temporal information. Furthermore, the effectiveness of the Delay-aware Directed Graph Attention (DDGA) is further interpreted from a causality perspective. Finally, the proposed model is evaluated on four real-world traffic datasets for experimental validation. Experimental results demonstrate that DPSTGC proficiently captures spatio-temporal information and achieves excellent performance.},

Moreover, a double flux control strategy is introduced in our model. The influences of time-varying delay, double flux control strategy and the angle of curved road on traffic stability are investigated by theoretical analysis and stability criterion is acquired by linear matrix inequality. Through numerical simulation, the propagation characteristics of disturbance and the state of final traffic density wave under the influence of time-varying delay, double flux control strategy and the angle of curved road are intuitively displayed.

This paper introduces TUN-DAS, a novel Time-series analysis and Unsupervised learning-based Driving behavior Assessment System, designed to systematically evaluate drivers’ behavior and identify potential risks. Unlike conventional in-cabin driver monitoring systems, which generally rely on rule-based or supervised methods, TUN-DAS utilizes a unique time-series clustering approach. This method combines a k-means algorithm with Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) and DTW Barycenter Averaging (DBA), enabling a more nuanced and comprehensive assessment of driving behavior. The modification of conventional DTW in our system allows for effective computation of temporal differences between driving data. TUN-DAS stands out in its ability to detect both sporadic human errors and consistent unsafe driving patterns by analyzing anomalies within individual drivers and across a broader driver dataset. Our validation with bus driver data shows TUN-DAS’s effectiveness in driving behavior assessment, significantly achieving better accuracy than traditional rule-based evaluation methods and allowing for quantitative and temporal analysis of a series of driving behavior. This system holds promise for enhancing road safety by facilitating the early identification of high-risk drivers, thereby contributing to the development of safer driving environments.},

An incentive-based trip pricing problem considering the strategic choices of users who aim to maximize the traveling utility is formulated to optimize the incentives. A bi-level mixed-integer programming model is developed and reformulated into a single-level one, with a valid inequality introduced to improve computational efficiency. An improved particle swarm optimization algorithm is designed because the problem is proved to be NP-hard. Extensive numerical results validate the mathematical formulations and the solution method. Results also indicate that the relocation strategy improves both the operating profit and the number of served users in the configuration of the experiments.

A novel partial form dynamic linearization (PFDL) technique is then employed to transform the vehicle dynamic models into a discrete-time data model with a time-varying pseudogradient (PG), and the proposed controller (PFDL-EMFAC) is designed based on this data model. Moreover, a compensation mechanism is designed for the system time delay by combining the Smith predictor and tracking differentiator (TD). Notably, implementing the controller does not involve any model information; it is a purely data-driven control method. Furthermore, the convergence of the proposed controller is proven via mathematical analysis. The validity of the proposed controller was validated through CarSim-MATLAB cosimulation, and its applicability was verified via the Ankai HFF6668GEV1 autonomous driving platform on a test road in Hefei, China.},

  abstract     = {Coordinating the motion profiles of fully automated vehicles in confined sites presents a challenge, particularly in avoiding conflicts in MUTually EXclusive (MUTEX) zones like intersections, merge-splits, and narrow roads. Prior methods have utilized optimization-based formulations, where the scheduling (order) of vehicles in MUTEX zones is found using a heuristic, followed by solving a nonlinear program (NLP) to determine the optimal state and control trajectories of each vehicle given the schedule. This paper presents a method that reduces the computational demand in the second step by decomposing the NLP into multiple smaller, parallelly solvable, NLPs. The method uses the confined area’s road network geometry and the vehicle positions to identify non-significant MUTEX relations and leverage results from graph theory to use this information to identify independent subproblems. We demonstrate that the solution obtained using this approach is equivalent to that obtained by solving the original NLP. Furthermore, by utilizing the dual variables connected to the MUTEX enforcing constraints, the method is capable of a further, sub-optimality-inducing, subdivision of the problem, enabling a trade-off between optimality and computation. We show how the method can be utilized, both when the plan needs to be initially computed and when there is a need for updating an existing motion plan. Simulation examples demonstrate the computational improvement with respect to the non-decomposed problem.},

To address these challenges, a Bayesian optimization framework was proposed herein as a solution. Surrogate models, including two Gaussian process-based and five non-Gaussian process-based models, are employed to replace part of the costly simulation models, to overcome the challenge of high dimensionality. The Jackknife and Bootstrap methods are used to estimate variance and calculate the acquisition function. Additionally, a differential evolutionary algorithm is employed to achieve efficient solutions while balancing exploration and exploitation, to overcome the challenge of output uncertainty. The proposed framework is validated through experimental results. It successfully identifies the worst-case scenarios in all three cases and the average number of tests for the optimal model in the most complex 9-dimensional scenario is less than 400. Notably, the approach using the Random Forest (RF) surrogate model achieves the highest search success rate in all three cases.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a three-step validation approach for subjective rating predictions of driving simulator motion incongruences based on objective mismatches between reference vehicle and simulator motion. This approach relies on using high-resolution rating predictions of open-loop driving (participants being driven) for ratings of motion in closed-loop driving (participants driving themselves). A driving simulator experiment in an urban scenario is described, of which the rating data of 36 participants was recorded and analyzed. In the experiment’s first phase, participants actively drove themselves (i.e., closed-loop). By recording the drives of the participants and playing these back to themselves (open-loop) in the second phase, participants experienced the same motion in both phases. Participants rated the motion after each maneuver and at the end of each drive. In the third phase they again drove open-loop, but rated the motion continuously, only possible in open-loop driving. Results show that a rating model, acquired through a different experiment, can well predict the measured continuous ratings. Second, the maximum of the measured continuous ratings correlates to both the maneuver-based ( $\rho =0.94$ ) and overall ( $\rho =0.69$ ) ratings, allowing for predictions of both rating types based on the continuous rating model. Third, using Bayesian statistics it is then shown that both the maneuver-based and overall ratings between the closed-loop and open-loop drives are equivalent. This allows for predictions of maneuver-based and overall ratings using the high-resolution continuous rating models. These predictions can be used as an accurate trade-off method of motion cueing settings of future closed-loop driving simulator experiments.},

  abstract     = {Road ponding, a prevalent traffic hazard, poses a serious threat to road safety by causing vehicles to lose control and leading to accidents ranging from minor fender benders to severe collisions. Existing technologies struggle to accurately identify road ponding due to complex road textures and variable ponding coloration influenced by reflection characteristics. To address this challenge, we propose a novel approach called Self-Attention-based Global Saliency-Enhanced Network (AGSENet) for proactive road ponding detection and traffic safety improvement. AGSENet incorporates saliency detection techniques through the Channel Saliency Information Focus (CSIF) and Spatial Saliency Information Enhancement (SSIE) modules. The CSIF module, integrated into the encoder, employs self-attention to highlight similar features by fusing spatial and channel information. The SSIE module, embedded in the decoder, refines edge features and reduces noise by leveraging correlations across different feature levels. To ensure accurate and reliable evaluation, we corrected significant mislabeling and missing annotations in the Puddle-1000 dataset. Additionally, we constructed the Foggy-Puddle and Night-Puddle datasets for road ponding detection in low-light and foggy conditions, respectively. Experimental results demonstrate that AGSENet outperforms existing methods, achieving IoU improvements of 2.03%, 0.62%, and 1.06% on the Puddle-1000, Foggy-Puddle, and Night-Puddle datasets, respectively, setting a new state-of-the-art in this field. Finally, we verified the algorithm’s reliability on edge computing devices. This work provides a valuable reference for proactive warning research in road traffic safety.

  abstract     = {Pavement disease is a key factor affecting road safety, and regular inspection and maintenance play an important role in maintaining the performance of asphalt pavement. Manual crack detection is subjective and inefficient. Even with the rapid development of pavement detection technology in recent years, it is still a challenging task to detect asphalt pavement cracks from images due to the complex environment. Crack classification and identification based on deep learning have achieved many results, but there are still deficiencies in terms of parameters and model efficiency. Aiming at the above problems, this paper proposes a new crack identification and analysis system guided by the structured information in the intelligent asphalt pavement disease image. First, the pavement crack types are classified by applying the convolutional neural network (CNN) algorithm to mine images containing 4,000 pavement breakage images and using the sparrow search algorithm (SSA) to improve the accuracy of the model. Aiming at the common problems of low contrast, serious noise pollution, and uneven illumination in the special environment of the tunnel, the improved Retinex enhancement algorithm is used to enrich the image details. Affected by the different textures of pavement materials, imaging conditions, etc., it is proposed for the first time to calculate the crack width through the skeleton boundary refinement algorithm. The results of experimental tests and case studies show that the proposed approach demonstrates the potential of innovative deep learning methods in automatically calculating pavement quality indices to optimize the repair and maintenance of asphalt pavements.},

  abstract     = {As urbanization accelerates, the rise in private car usage has become a double-edged sword, symbolizing economic growth while exacerbating urban air pollution due to increased carbon emissions. This paper studies the problem of carbon emission prediction of private cars in urban environments, enabling effective carbon emissions reduction and energy conservation guidance. Existing methods struggle with costly carbon emission collection and rely on precise emission factors, inaccuracies in modeling spatial similarities across urban regions, and complexities in modeling global temporal variations. To solve these issues, the Multi-View CollAboRative graph network (MVCAR) framework is proposed for private car carbon emission prediction. MVCAR employs a trajectory-based method to estimate carbon emissions from private car mobility to represent the spatial-temporal carbon emissions effectively. To capture the geo-spatial and semantic regional similarities of the carbon emissions, MVCAR constructs multi-view graphs and utilizes multi-view graph convolution networks. Furthermore, MVCAR integrates collaborative gated recurrent networks to model the spatial-temporal correlations of carbon emissions. The collaborative gated recurrent networks include a multi-view gated recurrent unit (GRU) and a sequential GRU. The multi-view GRU models the multiple spatial-temporal correlations of carbon emissions. A learnable temporal module embeds various temporal features, and further feeds these features into sequential GRU to capture the temporal variations of carbon emissions. Finally, a collaborative strategy that synergistically combines multi-view and sequential GRUs through stacked training. Extensive experiments on real datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed MVCAR.},

  abstract     = {Pedestrian kinematics is one of the important influence factors in pedestrian-vehicle collision accidents. The degree of pedestrian injury after collision is related to the initial pre-impact posture. The current research on pedestrian injury is based on the simulation collision of numerical pedestrian model, whose pre-impact posture comes from fixed gait sequence or manual construction. However, the former cannot represent the pedestrian posture of real accidents, and the latter takes a lot of time. This paper proposes an end-to-end framework to reconstruct pedestrian pre-impact posture from real-world accident images or videos for collision damage assessment. In order to obtain the most realistic pedestrian pre-impact posture, we first construct a video dataset of pedestrian-vehicle collision accidents. Then we use a human body 3D pose reconstruction method based on deep learning, SPIN (SMPL oPtimization IN the loop), which extracts the pose and body shape parameters of pedestrians in the image to generate SMPL (Skinned Multi-Person Linear) model. We exploit its similarity to the multi-body model to reconstruct the pre-impact pose of pedestrians. Experimental results show that our method can shorten the reconstruction time from minutes (327.25s) to milliseconds (0.260s), and the average error of joint angle is less than 3%. Through the computational simulation collision test, the collision damage results of the dummy constructed by our method is consistent with that of the real posture and the manually constructed posture. The proposed method is simple and easy to implement, which is helpful to enhance the performance of active and passive protection for pedestrians.},

  abstract     = {The development of autonomous vehicles has shown great potential to enhance the efficiency and safety of transportation systems. However, the decision-making issue in complex human-machine mixed traffic scenarios, such as unsignalized intersections, remains a challenge for autonomous vehicles. While reinforcement learning (RL) has been used to solve complex decision-making problems, existing RL methods still have limitations in dealing with cooperative decision-making of multiple connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs), ensuring safety during exploration, and simulating realistic human driver behaviors. In this paper, a novel and efficient algorithm, Multi-Agent Game-prior Attention Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (MA-GA-DDPG), is proposed to address these limitations. Our proposed algorithm formulates the decision-making problem of CAVs at unsignalized intersections as a decentralized multi-agent reinforcement learning problem and incorporates an attention mechanism to capture interaction dependencies between ego CAV and other agents. The attention weights between the ego vehicle and other agents are then used to screen interaction objects and obtain prior hierarchical game relations, based on which a safety inspector module is designed to improve the traffic safety. Furthermore, both simulation and hardware-in-the-loop experiments were conducted, demonstrating that our method outperforms other baseline approaches in terms of driving safety, efficiency, and comfort.},

In this paper, we propose a location-aware reliable task cooperative-computation scheme under fog computing-based IoVs. In comparison to many existing vehicular cooperative computing schemes, our scheme introduces a dual-layer (single-hop and multi-hop) cooperative vehicle assessment and selection mechanism based on the location-aware principle (such as proximity). The proposed mechanism involves a detailed evaluation for cooperative vehicles from three perspectives: the reliability of cooperative vehicle nodes, the reliability of communication links, and the availability of idle computing resources. The comprehensive evaluation is designed to further facilitate the task allocation between the required tasks and the cooperative vehicles. Under the condition of meeting task requirements, the fog server can select closer (single-hop), more reliable vehicles with greater available computing resources to accomplish related sub-tasks for customer vehicles. Additionally, we further propose an enhanced Hungarian algorithm for task allocation among required sub-tasks and selected cooperative vehicles, which can effectively assign corresponding sub-tasks to suitable cooperative vehicles to reduce the fragmentation of vehicular resources and enhance the utilization of vehicular resources. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our location-aware reliable task cooperative-computation scheme under fog computing-based IoVs.},

  abstract     = {We propose a two-level hierarchical architecture for controlling an autonomous vehicle (ego) in complex urban driving environments. This approach ensures both collision avoidance and adherence to traffic rules while maintaining real-time performance. At the top level of our framework, we use a simple dynamic model for ego and a simplified representation of the environment to formulate a Model Predictive Control (MPC) problem. The traffic rules are represented by Signal Temporal Logic (STL) formulas and incorporated as mixed integer-linear constraints within the MPC optimization. The top level MPC solution is then simulated at the bottom level, which employs detailed models of both ego dynamics and the environment. If a collision or traffic rule violation occurs, the bottom level provides feedback to the top level in the form of correction constraints, which are mixed integer-linear constraints affecting the state and control input of ego. This closed-loop feedback from the bottom level helps address discrepancies between the simplified models used in the MPC and the complex real-world models. We assess the effectiveness and runtime performance of our method by comparing it with existing approaches, through simulations of various urban driving scenarios in the CARLA simulator.},

Universal barrier functions are used to deal with path-dependent constraint requirements, including constraints on distances with desired paths and inter-vehicle distances. Furthermore, unknown quadrotor’s mass, inertia, and disturbances are addressed using an adaptive robust formation algorithm. The newly proposed path-dependent constrained formation architecture can ensure formation tracking errors converge exponentially to small neighborhoods near the equilibrium, with all path-dependent constraint requirements met.

FL-based resource allocation for V2X communications is proposed, referred to as FL-RA-V2X, which optimizes and maximizes the throughput of all vehicle users within the constraints of maximum power and the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR). It ensures fairness in resource allocation, meeting the minimum SINR requirements for cellular users and outage probability constraints for vehicle users. An approximate expression for vehicle users’ throughput is derived, eliminating the non-convexity associated with the SINR expression through iterative calculations of auxiliary variables. The resource allocation is designed to allow each vehicle user to share uplink resources with cellular users, maximizing the number of vehicle users while utilizing their maximum power transmission capability. Simulation results demonstrate the fairness and enhanced throughput efficiency of the proposed approach compared to contemporary algorithms, considering vehicle outage ratio, computational complexity, computing time, maximum transmitting power, cumulative distribution function of achievable sum rates, and convergence metrics. Furthermore, the proposed approach addresses critical aspects, including high mobility and distributed V2V communications, asynchronous training issues in cellular V2X networks, and the convergence analysis under different conditions such as varied vehicle densities and mobility patterns. These considerations broaden the applicability and robustness of the FL-RA-V2X method across diverse scenarios. The analysis also explores the impact of vehicle speed, auxiliary variables, interference effects of cellular users, and the dependence of throughput on FL iterations.},

With the integrity of internet of things (IoT) and connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs), it has been a research challenge to find a safe, reliable, and optimal strategy that not only minimizes the CEV’s travel time but also lessens the undesirable side-effects on other road users. This article introduces multiple intelligent control strategies in one framework to boost the potential of CEVs traveling via multiple traffic intersections. The framework includes a path-planning mechanism adapting to sudden traffic delays, traffic signal preemption controller adapting to the urgency level associated with the emergency event, and a deep-learning model for CAVs to predict the time required for giving way to the CEV. All modules are implemented through a microscopic traffic simulation environment (PTV-VISSIM). This article holds significant implications for various scenarios involving CEVs and intelligent transportation systems (ITS). The path planning approach showcased notable improvements, reducing average path travel time by 9% when compared to existing benchmarks. The regression error for predicting the merging time of CAVs is minimized to be 0.4 second. Furthermore, the signal preemption controller demonstrated an important trade-off analysis between the level of intrusive preemption signal control and the undesired impacts on the traffic network. This finding enables traffic management authorities to make informed decisions regarding signal preemption strategies, considering both the travel time optimization for CEVs and the potential network-wide traffic impacts.},

  abstract     = {This paper tackles the challenge of Clothes-Changing person Re-Identification (CC-ReID) through the dual lenses of model development and dataset creation. Unlike conventional person ReID, which presumes that individuals maintain consistent clothing, CC-ReID acknowledges the frequent changes in attire encountered in real-world scenarios. This task is particularly difficult due to the substantial variations in visual cues such as colors and textures that accompany changes in clothing. We propose a Multi-modal Assisted feature Learning Framework (MAL-F) designed to learn representations that are invariant to color and texture by utilizing RGB, grayscale, and contour images. MAL-F is a versatile framework that can be seamlessly integrated with existing CC-ReID models, significantly enhancing their accuracy. To further reduce the impact of clothing variations, we introduce a novel CC-ReID backbone named ResTNet, which combines ResNet with a Transformer. ResTNet features a Non-Clothing Salient Region (NC-SR) reinforcement transformer module that employs random clothing block drop and spatial activation mapping. These methods direct the model to emphasize key regions unrelated to clothing, enhancing these features with minimal computational overhead. This strategy substantially enhances CC-ReID performance and supports real-time video processing. Furthermore, recognizing the limitations of current small-scale CC-ReID datasets, we have developed two larger datasets: FBCC and Market1501-CC. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our proposed methodology surpasses existing state-of-the-art methods for CC-ReID in terms of accuracy, robustness, and efficiency.},

  abstract     = {The demand for hazardous materials (HazMat) logistics is on the rise, and the importance of safety engineering of HazMat logistics is clear. Freight services based on intelligent transportation systems (ITS) offer a more secure, efficient, and environmentally-friendly method of HazMat logistics. At the same time, the voice of digital transformation (DX) in logistics continues to grow. However, there are currently some barriers to the digital transformation of the HazMat logistics industry, in which safety is always prioritized. One of the issues is how to promote the use of information technology in the logistics business process in a reasonable and orderly manner, given limited funds and technology, while also ensuring safety and improving the business process. Existing safety analysis methods, such as the Functional Resonance Analysis Method (FRAM) and its quantitative expansion, can be used to identify safety risks and make safety recommendations for business process improvement, but they cannot assist us with the rationale for DX decision making. To close the gap, we present in this article an optimization method of HazMat transportation safety engineering based on FRAM, which will assist HazMat logistics companies in making decisions regarding the implementation of ITS. We use the HazMat transportation of a Japanese logistics company as an example to verify and validate the proposed decision support scheme.},

Attribution explanation is a primary research direction for interpreting neural network decisions. However, in the context of autonomous driving, numerical attributions fail to interpret the complex semantic information and often result in explanations that are difficult to understand. This paper introduces a novel semantic attribution approach that both identifies where important features appear and provides intuitive information about what they represent. To establish the semantic correspondences for attributions, we propose an interpreting framework that integrates unsupervised differentiable semantic representations with the attribution computational model. To further enhance the accuracy of the attribution computation while ensuring strong semantic correspondence, we design a Semantic-Informed Aumann-Shapley (SIAS) method, which defines a novel integration path solution using constraints from semantic scores and discrete gradients. Extensive experiments confirm that our method outperforms state-of-the-art explanation techniques both qualitatively and quantitatively in autonomous driving scenarios.},

  abstract     = {To address the problem of traditional pedestrian detection methods being subject to random interference from the external environment and insufficient utilization of pedestrian feature information, a novel multi-modal pedestrian detection network called MDFOaNet is proposed. The proposed detection network consists of two key components: a marine predator-based multi-scale image fusion module and a pedestrian detection module with an enhanced target visual accuracy attention model. In the fusion module, a contrast-based layered enhancement method for infrared images and a sharpness-based enhancement method for visible images are proposed for the problem of blurred pedestrian features in images. Moreover, to control the trade-off between fusion sub-layers, a dynamic image reconstruction model that relies on adaptive optimization based on marine predators is designed. Meanwhile, in the pedestrian detection module, to pay more attention to the main information in image and ignore some irrelevant information, an EVAM attention model is designed under the framework of YOLOv5s detection network, which improves the saliency of pedestrian targets and suppress the background interference. The experimental results show that compared with nine typical algorithms, the proposed algorithm can achieve accurate detection of multi-scale targets in complex environments, and is significantly superior to the compared detection algorithms in both subjective and objective evaluation indicators. The mAP and recall rates of the proposed network can reach 88.9% and 87.5%, respectively.},

  abstract     = {Video surveillance and crowd analysis are essential for urban public safety, particularly for accurate crowd counting and density estimation. Existing methods primarily use RGB modality, which limits their effectiveness in complex environments. With advancements in thermal sensors, some studies have combined RGB and thermal images to improve crowd counting accuracy. However, the existing studies face the risk of introducing redundant information during modality interaction and exacerbating the influence of non-uniform crowd density for modality fusion. Therefore, further advancements are needed to bridge the gap in crowd density estimation by RGB and thermal image interaction. To adequately capture information from both RGB and thermal crowd images and alleviate the above difficulties, we propose a Modality Interaction Attention Network (MIANet). Specifically, Modality Interaction Attention (MIA) module consists of two Multi-Scale Attention (MSA) and a Channel Direction Attention (CDA), which serve to remove redundant information and amplify modality attributes. The MSA incorporates multi-scale kernel factors, enabling its application to still images to solve non-uniform crowd density in one image. To combine modality-specific attributes, the Tri-level MIA modules are connected to the front-end network in a stacked manner. Polished fusion features are further extracted using the Grid Block that combine level-by-level features. On two real-world datasets, we conducted in-depth experiments. Results of the evaluation reveal that our MIANet works better than cutting-edge baseline methodologies and MIANet variants in relation to a variety of prediction inaccuracies, highlighting the efficiency of MIANet and each of its essential modules in crowd density estimation.

For cybernetically connected vehicles (CVs) with dynamics heterogeneities subject to actuator uncertainties, a dynamic event-triggered platoon control protocol is proposed in this paper to significantly reduce communication overheads. By considering the platoon problem of CVs as an output tracking consensus problem of heterogeneous multi-agent systems (MASs), a hierarchical control framework composed of an upper-level interactive event-triggered observer layer and a lower-level local tracking controller layer is established. Within the proposed framework, considering a virtual dynamic leader with non-zero inputs and external disturbances, a distributed observer is first designed for each following vehicle to observe the leader in an event-triggered manner. An internal dynamic variable is introduced to construct the dynamic triggering law, which not only relaxes the requirement on continuous state transmission in triggering detection but also benefits the exclusion of the Zeno behavior. Then, the solutions of a set of regulator equations associated with the proposed observer and the observer itself are integrated into the local tracking controller design to guarantee the tracking ability of each follower agent to its own observer. As thus, an event-triggered platoon control mechanism of heterogeneous CVs is proposed. Simulations and experiments on unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) are conducted, which validate the effectiveness of the proposed platoon control method.},

However, current broadcast relay strategies easily cause serious message loss and larger broadcast costs due to the poor environmental adaptability. In this paper, to handle the above problems, we propose an Adaptive Connectivity-Aware Relay (ACAR) strategy, which has two striking features: multiple network connectivity states and dynamic broadcast relay policies. We design four network connectivity states and their corresponding four broadcast relay policies. In disconnected networks, only the vehicle with the same movement direction as the message propagation direction acts as the relay, so as to relieve the message loss. Moreover, different broadcast periods are allocated for different applications, so as to reduce the broadcast costs. In connected networks, the link quality and transmission distance are adopted to select the relay in the sender-based relay pattern, so as to address the relay invalidation problem. Further, different candidate relays are assigned different broadcast priorities and different broadcast waiting time in the receiver-based relay pattern, so as to address the transmission conflict problem. Simulation results show that ACAR outperforms existing competing schemes in terms of end-to-end delay, broadcast success rate, and packet overhead.},

Even if both vehicles are rational players, the existence of multiple Nash equilibira in this dynamic game may result in no consensus between them during the interaction. This may lead to unsmooth rides with late emergency brakes. This paper proposes a conflict-aware game theoretic decision-making framework for autonomous vehicles at uncontrolled intersections considering the Nash equilibrium selection. Combining dynamic programming and iterative best response, a dynamic closed-loop Nash equilibrium calculating method is proposed. The issue of multiple equilibria is analyzed. An equilibrium selection mechanism is designed based on sequentially-constructed Conflict-Aware Bimatrix Games (CAB-Games) and the idea of risk dominant equilibria. The proposed policy provides a relatively smooth drive without being too aggressive or conservative. It is demonstrated in simulations and driving simulator experiments that the policy can interact well with other autonomous driving policies as well as human drivers.},

Overall, we found that the presence of multiple pedestrians significantly influenced pedestrian movement dynamics during road crossing. Additionally, the relative standing position had a significant impact on the distant pedestrians regarding time before crossing and vehicle-gazing behavior.

However, for a vehicle which is simultaneously covered by a group of heterogeneous network infrastructures, the DT of the vehicle (DT-V) can connect with the DTs of infrastructures (DT-Is) in different infrastructure groups across regions in the virtual networks so that each DT-V may deceive the DT-Is by interacting with multiple DT-I groups and selecting the optimal one to synchronize data. To this end, we propose an on-demand data synchronization scheme for DT-Vs and DT-Is. In the scheme, infrastructures and vehicles are grouped based on their geographical locations and the arrival time of each vehicle through which the DT-Vs and DT-Is can interact with each other to make decisions in groups. Then, the requirements of DT-Vs (i.e., minimize synchronization cost and maximize synchronization satisfaction) and DT-Is (i.e., maximize profits) are considered to design their utility functions and the decision-making process between the DT-Vs in each group and the DT-Is in each group is formulated as a Stackelberg game to obtain their optimal strategies. After that, considering the deceptive behavior of vehicles, a joint optimization algorithm that integrates the Stackelberg game and the selection of each DT-V is designed to obtain the real equilibrium solution for DT-Vs and DT-Is to maximize their utilities.

However, the existing research seldom consider the interference of human-driven vehicles on multi-platoon stability and the following strategy of multi-platoon leader in mixed traffic. In this paper, a robust distributed model predictive control method for multi-platoon leader in mixed traffic is proposed to reduce the impact of human-driven vehicles on multi-platoon control performance. The following control strategy of multi-platoon leader is proposed firstly, which flexibly determines the following control targets according to the states of leader and HDV to avoid unnecessary frequent acceleration and deceleration. Then, the robust model prediction controller of multi-platoon leader is designed, where the states of sub-platoon leader are added to the objective function in the nominal system optimization problem to reduce the states change of the following vehicles under the influence of HDV from both forward and backward traffic. Furthermore, the auxiliary control law is designed to eliminate the error between the actual states and the nominal states to achieve the suppression of HDV interference. The simulation results show that the multi-platoon leader following control strategy can effectively reduce the speed variation of the multi-platoon to suppress the impact of HDV motion uncertainty on multi-platoon. Moreover, compared with the robust model prediction method of single-platoon leader without considering the state of the rear vehicle, the proposed method can reduce the control errors and improve the stability of multi-platoon.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a cognitive model designed to reproduce human drivers’ errors in predicting the motion of nearby vulnerable road users. We aim to define a computational model that, given both the trajectory of the eye gaze of a human driver and the trajectory of a bicycle, can compute the probability distribution of where the human driver believes the bicycle will be in the near future. For the design and validation of the proposed cognitive model, we tested 51 subjects in immersive virtual reality scenarios. The results indicate that the proposed model can generate probability distributions of the human drivers’ beliefs about the future bicycle position that are very similar, though not statistically equivalent, to those obtained experimentally. Such models could easily be generalized to describe how drivers misjudge the motion of other road users. This may enable ADAS to evaluate and improve drivers’ situational awareness. In the future, these models could also be used by autonomous cars to evaluate situational awareness of nearby humans, enabling a safer coexistence of autonomous vehicles and vulnerable road users.},

  abstract     = {Achieving higher accuracy in positioning at lower cost in urban environments is a fundamental requirement in modern intelligent transportation, autonomous driving, etc. The integration of low-cost inertial navigation system (INS) and global navigation satellite system (GNSS) is a promising choice to meet this objective, however, it still requires a suitable fault detection and correction method. Inspired by the structure of multi-channel parallelism in vector tracking, this paper introduces a multi-channel parallel processing (MCPP) method for identifying and eliminating GNSS faulty signals in the measurement domain in tightly integrated structure, aided by the principle of multiple model interaction. At each positioning epoch in each channel, the MCPP method individually compares the difference between each satellite’s measurement and its INS estimation version. These differences are normalized by a multiple model interaction process to derive the probability that each satellite is error free. These probabilities, linked to each satellite, can be used as weights for the optimal output or as indicators to identify false signals. The road test results in the Zhongguancun area of Beijing demonstrate that the method’s performance is comparable to that of state-of-the-art methods and avoids the unwanted outcome of selecting a fixed error elimination threshold that leads the system to diverge in a distinct environment or positioning mode. The results were valid in both tightly coupled (TC) and weighted least square (WLS) navigation modes, suggesting that the method can be utilized for single vehicle as well as vehicle-to-vehicle or vehicle-to-road cooperative positioning.},

  abstract     = {This paper studies the multi-port berth allocation and time-invariant quay crane assignment problem with speed optimization (MBACAP). In the MBACAP, each vessel visits multiple ports, while the port operators allocate berths and quay cranes (QCs) to the arriving vessels. The objective of the MBACAP is to minimize the sum of vessel fuel consumption cost, waiting cost, delay cost and QC handling cost while meeting the constraints related to vessel sailing, berth allocation and QC assignment. A mixed integer liner programming (MILP) model for the MBACAP is formulated for the first time, and an improved adaptive large neighborhood search (IALNS) algorithm is developed to solve it. In the IALNS, an initial solution generation strategy is proposed, while modified removal and insertion operators combined with the MBACAP features are devised. Moreover, several speed decision operators are proposed to optimize vessel speed during insertion operations. The proposed MILP and IALNS are tested on the MBACAP instances based on real data. The numerical experimental results show that the MILP can be solved by CPLEX optimally for some small scaled instances, while the IALNS can efficiently solve instances of all scales. The importance of considering QC assignment in MBACAP and the influence of vessel fuel consumption in ports are analyzed by comparing the numerical results of different models. In addition, the impact of different fuel prices on the MBACAP is investigated through sensitivity analysis with management insights provided.},

However, challenges such as training instability and dynamical inaccuracy limit their utility in high-speed rail (HSR) bogie fault diagnosis. To address these challenges, we introduce the Pulse Voltage-Guided Conditional Diffusion Model (VGCDM). Unlike traditional implicit GANs, VGCDM adopts a sequential U-Net architecture, facilitating multi-steps denoising diffusion for generation, which bolsters training stability and mitigate convergence issues. VGCDM also incorporates control pulse voltage by cross-attention mechanism to ensure the alignment of vibration with voltage signals, enhancing the Conditional Diffusion Model’s progressive controlablity. Consequently, solely straightforward sampling of control voltages, ensuring the efficient transformation from Gaussian Noise to vibration signals. This adaptability remains robust even in scenarios with time-varying speeds. To validate the effectiveness, we conducted two case studies using SQ dataset and high-simulation HSR bogie dataset. The results of our experiments unequivocally confirm that VGCDM outperforms other generative models, achieving the best RSME, PSNR, and FSCS, showing its superiority in conditional HSR bogie vibration signal generation. For access, our code is available at https://github.com/xuanliu2000/VGCDM.},

  abstract     = {The recovery of coarsely sampled trajectories considering the road network topology characteristics is a crucial task for many downstream applications in intelligent transportation systems. Existing approaches in this domain primarily focus on extracting spatio-temporal correlations for the observed trajectory points but neglect the critical role of road network topology characteristics in making the recovery results more accurate and realistic. In addition, too many road segments in cities undermine the model inference performance. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Map-informed Adaptive Spatio-Temporal Autoencoder, which follows an encoder-decoder architecture for trajectory recovery. Specifically, we utilize a pre-trained attributed network embedding module to incorporate the road segment characteristics into the input data to make it easier for the model to extract the spatio-temporal dependencies from coarse trajectories. Furthermore, we construct a novel adaptive mask inference module that contains a distance-based mask matrix and a learnable adaptive mask matrix to assist the model in making segment inferences by weighting each candidate segment adaptively in the recovery process. To evaluate the performance of the proposed model, we conduct a series of comprehensive case studies on two representative real-world trajectory datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches.},

However, many existing works focus on academic research to address individual problems rather than overall real-world applications, which are more generalizable and applicable to daily life. To address this gap, this paper presents a lightweight and efficient 3D object understanding framework for real-life autonomous vehicles from scratch. We introduce PHE3D, a new large-scale, complex Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) dataset that captures Vietnamese streets, notable for its distinct characteristics and wide variety of object classes. Additionally, this study discusses the entire process for 3D object understanding, from data collection to data handling to 3DMODT. To address the computational demands, we propose a suitable lightweight and informative Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture for 3D Multi-Object Detection (3DMOD) and a mathematical-based approach for 3D Multi-Object Tracking (3DMOT). Extensive experiments on the dataset show that the system can precisely detect and track attributes of multiple objects while running at up to 100, and 2000 Frames Per Second (FPS), respectively.},

  abstract     = {Due to limited mileage and high schedule constraints, electric buses need to maximize not only energy efficiency but also mobility flexibility, especially in lanes where multiple bus lines merge. Connected-autonomous electric buses (CAEBs) indeed reduce inter-vehicle gaps to minimize the impact of bus stops on road capacity, but lead to frequent acceleration and deceleration to ensure safety. Therefore, this paper regards the CAEBs in the merged lane of bus lines as a whole platoon to study the cooperative control algorithm aiming at the tradeoff between energy saving and mobility. Model predictive control and optimal control are combined to design CAEB control inputs where saturation inputs, safe inter-vehicle spacing constraints, and external disturbances are integrated. This paper finds sufficient conditions for the unique solution of the non-convex optimization objective caused by the higher-order energy terms. In addition, this paper proves the semi-negative characterization of the symmetry matrix of higher-order energy terms to realize the asymptotic stability of CAEB platoons. Comparative simulations show that the cooperative control algorithm effectively trades off mobility and energy consumption even in emergency scenarios, and achieves a 25% reduction in energy consumption with only a 2.2% reduction in mobility.},

  abstract     = {Vehicle trajectory data is essential for analyzing and modeling complex traffic behaviors. Although extraction of vehicle trajectory from aerial video data is not a new problem, obtaining trajectories with heading information across various road types, such as intersections or long road segments, requires further research. In this paper, we propose OpenVTER, a generalized Open-source Vehicle Trajectory Extraction framework based on Rotated bounding boxes (RBBs). This framework includes several key components: video stabilization, image division, vehicle detection, vehicle tracking, and data post-processing. Specifically, the rotated vehicle detection model, named YOLOX-R, is applied to detect the small and rotated vehicles using RBBs that provide vehicle heading information. A base-frame video stabilization method is proposed to reduce error accumulation in the transformation matrix and improve the computational efficiency. The rotated vehicle tracking model, named SORT-R, is proposed to enable real-time tracking of RBBs. The performance of YOLOX-R is evaluated on two datasets, showing that vehicle detection challenges are well addressed. Ablation experiments were also conducted to analyze the effectiveness of different modules. Subsequently, we evaluate the completeness of the extracted trajectories under various road types and lighting conditions. The extracted trajectories are also compared with the NGSIM dataset, focusing on internal and platoon consistency. These evaluations demonstrate both the effectiveness and practicality of the proposed framework. Additionally, the visualization analyses of different road types demonstrate the advantages of the trajectories extracted by OpenVTER in various road scenarios for traffic research. The code and dataset are available online for non-commercial research purposes.},

The initial database search identified 2,160 articles, of which 203 were included in this review after rigorous screening and assessment. This study revealed that the most commonly used anomaly detection techniques employed are deep learning networks such as LSTM, CNN, and autoencoders, alongside one-class SVM. Most detection models were trained using real-world operational vehicle data, although anomalies, such as attacks and faults, were often injected artificially into the datasets. The models were evaluated primarily using five key evaluation metrics: recall, accuracy, precision, F1-score, and false positive rate. The most frequently used set of evaluation metrics for detection models were accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The review makes several recommendations to improve future work related to anomaly detection models. It recommends providing comprehensive assessment of the anomaly detection models and emphasise the importance to share models publicly to facilitate collaboration within the research community and enable further validation. Recommendations also include the need for benchmarking datasets with predefined anomalies or cyberattacks (with comprehensive threat modelling) to test and improve the effectiveness of the proposed anomaly detection models. Future research should focus on the deployment of anomaly based detection in vehicles to evaluate their performance in real-world driving conditions, and explore systems using communication protocols beyond CAN, such as Ethernet and FlexRay.},
