This article proposes a novel multimodal, multilingual, and multiclass sentiment analysis method for social media content, aimed at improving content moderation for child safety. Our approach integrates textual, visual, and audio data from videos, categorizing sentiment into four levels: positive, slightly negative, negative, and strongly negative, enabling granular detection of harmful content. To enhance explainability and trust, we also leverage interpretable mechanisms to analyze the contributions of each modality. Evaluation of our method demonstrates strong generalization across diverse video types, and demonstrated that most misclassifications arise from annotation inconsistencies or ambiguities, highlighting the model’s reliability in real-world scenarios. Notably, when compared to lightweight multimodal language models, our method achieves higher accuracy and robustness. Overall, the evaluation confirms its effectiveness for video sentiment analysis and content moderation, particularly for child safety.},

The agent uses a pretrained LLM to interpret a text description of the challenge and choose the best defensive action given a network observation. Its performance is on par with the most successful reinforcement learning agent submitted to CAGE-2 with the advantages of explainability and avoiding training episodes, but with the cost of requiring LLM prompt engineering. Finally, we test the LLM agent experimentally to explore how LLM temperature and prompt complexity affect performance. We show that higher complexity prompts significantly improve performance, while LLM temperature has only a minor effect.},

However, much less work has been done on the drone threat prediction problem (DTPP): Predicting which drone trajectories are threatening and which ones are not. We propose the drone early warning system (DEWS), a framework to solve this problem. Solving DTPP early is key. Once a drone starts on its trajectory, we show that DEWS can make accurate predictions within 20–30 s of the flight with an F1-score of over 80% on data about a major European city. We study the tradeoff between earliness of predictions and accuracy. We identify the key features that ensure good predictions.},

This paper proposes a novel algorithm called FL4SDN, using weighted averaging stochastic gradient descent updates for the federated optimization problem. In FL4SDN, the weight given to each controller is determined based on the relationship between the local and global gradients. Theoretically, it has been proven that faster convergence can be achieved if the loss function is convex and has a bounded first derivative. The effectiveness of FL4SDN is confirmed by experiments carried out on different network topologies. We demonstrate that such an algorithm can give a reduction of at least 24.4% in terms of communication rounds as compared to the state-of-the-art Gaia, FedAvg, Deep Gradient Compression, and Bulk-Synchronous Parallel. It also provides high prediction accuracy and low communication costs.},

Hardware obfuscation by IC logic gate camouflaging results in logic gates with unknown functionalities in an extracted netlist, protecting manufactured ICs from circuit extraction. Logic gate decamouflaging attacks have been proposed. Conventional attacks are not suitable for large-scale camouflaging due to infeasible computation cost. Existing graph neural network (GNN)-based methods are efficient, but they are less effective in differentiating between fan-in and fan-out structures, which hampers their effectiveness. In this article, we propose a novel GNN-based attack method, namely, GNNReveal, for logic gate decamouflaging. Our proposed GNNReveal performs separate fan-in/fan-out aggregations to generate unique node embeddings for logic gates with different functionalities, allowing for direct node classification for logic gate decamouflaging. Our experiments show that our proposed GNNReveal achieved high decamouflaging accuracy and significantly outperformed competing methods by, at most, 20%.},

High-dimensional space’s sparsity makes classical learning and knowledge extraction algorithms ineffective and error-prone. Dimension reduction methods like feature selection (FS) seem to address this problem. This study addresses these challenges by conducting a comparative analysis on a real laser assembly industrial case of high dimensions. We explore five stand-alone methods, NCFS, RReliefF, minimum redundancy maximum relevance (MRMR), recursive feature elimination (RFE), and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) [applied to datasets from two laser modules (d-serie and s-serie)]. Additionally, two hybrid methods, RReliefF-RFE and MRMR-RFE, are evaluated, broadening the scope of FS strategies. Time efficiency prioritizes RReliefF, NCFS, and LASSO, while RReliefF-RFE, NCFS, and LASSO excel in interpretability, achieving significant predictor reduction without compromising accuracy. The study thus provides insights into the selection of FS methods in a challenging industrial laser assembly setting.},

However, significant concerns have been raised over the fairness of such models. While various aspects of algorithmic fairness have been studied, the effect of missing data on fairness remains understudied. This is a significant problem since data in real-world settings is almost never complete and may often suffer from systemic missingness. This article systematically evaluates how missing data, particularly when correlated with protected classes and outcome variables, affects the fairness of classifiers. Utilizing a comprehensive framework covering various missing data patterns, rates, and mitigation methods, we analyze 150 experimental dataset variants derived from real-world scenarios and find that missing data correlated with sensitive attributes and outcomes can exacerbate disparities, even for little missingness, making it crucial to address missingness in fairness evaluations.},

However, traditional statistical approaches often yield opaque, correlation-driven predictions, making it difficult for experts to interpret results and take meaningful actions. To address these limitations, we propose a cognitive neurosymbolic artificial intelligence (AI) framework by combining multimodal perception, neurosymbolic reasoning (with symbolic controls), and knowledge, this paradigm enhances accuracy and robustness in complex decision-making environments. This integrated framework ensures that every recommendation follows human-like decision-making, while being grounded in verifiable, expert knowledge, a crucial attribute for critical application scenarios such as health care. We demonstrate this approach through a mental health support system, showcasing how cognitive neurosymbolic AI can improve decision-making outcomes, personalized interventions, longitudinal tracking, and actionable insights for critical applications.},

However, existing approaches are either computation- or communication-intensive. Limited by the constrained resources of industrial systems, they usually suffer from a high end-to-end (E2E) latency, and cannot be directly applied to latency-sensitive applications. In this article, we present a light-weight edge–cloud collaborative branchy DNN, CombiNet, and customize an intelligent edge device, Edge–Vbox, to construct an effective real-time video object detection solution. In our case study of intelligent smart grid substation operation and maintenance, experimental results using real-world data demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in E2E latency, and manages to achieve real-time video object detection with negligible accuracy loss.},

Our results show that when the volume of vehicles increases by 1000 from the training volume, the average delay increases by 103%, while a 0.1 increase in KL divergence increases the delay by 58%.

Existing methods usually ignore the classification of detailed pixels, such as boundaries, resulting in degraded segmentation performance. To overcome this challenge, we propose a new multibranch SSS framework, BoundaryMatch, which combines image- and feature-level perturbation branches with a boundary detail guidance branch, all utilizing a shared encoder. Specifically, this boundary module enhances segmentation by integrating the learning of spatial information into low-level layers in a single-stream manner. Finally, the low-level features and deeper features are fused together to predict the final segmentation result and achieve accurate correction of boundary pixels. This multibranch approach improves on the shortcomings of consistency regularization that focus only on maintaining the global consistency of the image. Extensive experiments conducted on the Cityscapes and PASCAL VOC 2012 datasets demonstrate that the method proposed in this article effectively enhances the performance of SSS.},

Despite this, the interplay and potential synergies between these two methods remain largely unexplored. This study presents a notable leap forward by introducing a retrieval-augmented multiagent system (RAMAS) to enhance LLM-based FSA performance. An RAMAS is specifically designed to deepen understanding of the critical factors that are inherent in FSA and mimic human-like consensus-making processes by adaptively learning from semantically similar few-shot samples and engaging in conversations among the generator, discriminator, and arbitrator agents.

To address this issue, we explore the potential of data augmentation using ChatGPT, a well-performing large language model, to enhance the sentiment classification performance toward aspect terms. Specifically, we explore three data augmentation strategies based on ChatGPT: context-focused, aspect-focused, and context–aspect data augmentation techniques. Context-focused data augmentation focuses on changing the word expression of context words in the sentence while keeping aspect terms unchanged. In contrast, aspect-focused data augmentation aims to change aspect terms but keep context words unchanged. Context–aspect data augmentation integrates these two data augmentations to generate augmented samples. Furthermore, we incorporate contrastive learning into the ABSA tasks to improve performance. Extensive experiments show that all three data augmentation techniques lead to performance improvements, with the context–aspect data augmentation strategy performing best and surpassing the performance of the baseline models.},

We present an innovative, practical package-delivery model wherein multiple UAVs deliver multiple packages to customers, who are compensated for late deliveries. Further, we propose a novel methodology that combines a new plan-generation algorithm with a collective-learning heuristic to quickly determine cost-effective paths of UAVs, even for large-scale deliveries up to 10,000 customers. To demonstrate our methodology, we applied our highly flexible approach to a depot in Heathrow Airport, London.

  abstract     = {We explore how large language models (LLMs) can expedite and automate the learning process for autonomous driving tasks. This involves harnessing LLM knowledge to shape a learning framework and utilizing LLMs to guide the learning process. We conduct a case study to demonstrate LLMs’ ability to export driving rules. LLM outputs may not be entirely reliable for the direct handling of driving decisions due to potential inaccuracies and inconsistencies. To address these issues, we propose integrating LLM knowledge with statistical learning. This enables LLMs to export task-specific knowledge as symbolic rules, forming the initial learning structure. Rule weights are calculated based on statistical salience derived from training data, resulting in a set of weighted rules for robust decision making. Furthermore, this set of weighted rules preserves strong semantics, allowing LLMs to comprehend and make modifications based on varying needs. Simulations using a highway driving simulator validate the effectiveness of our approach.},

  abstract     = {With mobile and Internet of Things devices becoming pervasive in our lives and recent advances in edge computational intelligence [e.g., edge artificial intelligence/machine learning (AI/ML)], it became evident that the traditional methods for training AI/ML models are becoming obsolete, especially with the growing concerns over privacy and security. This work highlights the key challenges that prevent edge AI/ML from seeing wide-range adoption in different sectors, especially for large-scale scenarios. We advocate a knowledge-centric design in which the produced knowledge in the network is discovered and routed to the knowledge requester. This work highlights the importance of knowledge routing for the proposed decentralized learning framework to be effective.},

  abstract     = {Large language models (LLMs), such as GPT and LLAMA, exhibit exceptional comprehension and reasoning capabilities across a wide range of tasks, which are a result of the extensive corpora and the enormous number of parameters in a model. However, their size can pose significant challenges for deployment, particularly on resource-constrained devices. For issues that degrade the user experience, such as efficiency, latency, safety, and privacy, small language models (SLMs) offer a solution. This article begins by outlining the key principles behind SLMs and the reasons for their importance in the field. Subsequently, we discuss the methods used to develop SLMs and explore the collaboration between SLMs and LLMs. By exploring the pathways for harnessing the unique capabilities of SLMs and optimizing their integration with LLMs, it contributes to the ongoing discussion on their application and collaboration in natural language processing and offers insights for advancement and innovation in the field.},
