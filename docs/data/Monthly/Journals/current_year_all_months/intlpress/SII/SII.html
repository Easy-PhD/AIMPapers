  abstract     = {This paper addresses the issue of zero-inflated longitudinal data in the presence of non-ignorable missingness. To account for the presence of additional zeros, a zero-inflated power series mixed effects model is utilized. This model incorporates spline functions, such as B-spline, to capture the non-linear impact of time on the longitudinal outcome. Also, missing data is a common problem in longitudinal studies. To address this issue, a shared random effects model is utilized. Further, the proposed model addresses a variable selection technique using Dirac spike priors. The MCMC method is used for posterior sampling, which involves the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm within Gibbs sampling. Some simulation studies are performed to investigate the performance of the proposed approach, and it is also applied to analyze a real dataset in a RAND health insurance experiment.},

Although several multivariate test procedures have been proposed for the problem in the literature, most of them apply only to the situation where the error follows a multivariate normal distribution. In other words, they cannot detect the pleiotropy if the data contain outliers or the error follows a heavy-tailed distribution. To overcome these difficulties, we propose a new multivariate robust integrated test and establish its theoretical properties.

While subsampling techniques have been extensively developed to downsize the data volume, there is a notable gap in addressing the unique challenge of handling extensive reliability data, in which a common situation is that a large proportion of data is censored. In this article, we propose an efficient subsampling method for reliability analysis in the presence of censoring data, intending to estimate the parameters of lifetime distribution. Moreover, a novel subsampling method for subsampling from severely censored data is proposed, i.e., only a tiny proportion of data is complete. The subsamplingbased estimators are given, and their asymptotic properties are derived. The optimal subsampling probabilities are derived through the L-optimality criterion, which minimizes the trace of the product of the asymptotic covariance matrix and a constant matrix. Efficient algorithms are proposed to implement the proposed subsampling methods to address the challenge that optimal subsampling strategy depends on unknown parameter estimation from full data. Real-world hard drive dataset case and simulative empirical studies are employed to demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed methods.},

  abstract     = {The mediation analysis method is used to investigate effects of mediators that intervene in the pathways between an exposure variable and an outcome variable. Bayesian methods are naturally used in mediation analysis due to the hierarchical structure of Bayesian models. This paper introduces an innovative adaptive Bayesian mediation analysis method that incorporates adaptive Laplace priors into the predictive model to account for high-dimensional mediators. This approach introduces a penalization function on the estimated direct and indirect effects rather than solely on the coefficients of predictive models. Consequently, estimated effects that lack statistical significance may shrink to zero, facilitating a more robust analysis. We demonstrate the efficacy of our adaptive mediation analysis method on simulations and on a Louisiana triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) dataset to examine racial disparity in diagnosed stage among TNBC patients diagnosed between 2010 and 2017. The dataset is linked to the 2017 hazardous air pollutant emissions burden estimation database using patients' residential address. We effectively explain a portion of the disparity using currently collected variables. The analysis identifies crucial mediators and confounders, highlighting the significance of variables such as age of diagnosis, insurance status, tumor grades, and the concentration of Naphtha in the air.},

The asymptotic null distribution of this automatic test is established without assuming any moment condition of HDTS, so this automatic test has a large application scope covering the commonly observed heavy-tailed data. To account for the possible scaling effect, another standardized norm-rankbased automatic test is further proposed. Simulations and one real example are given to demonstrate the advantage of these two automatic tests over the portmanteau tests, which seek the rejection evidence only from the L 1 -norm of HDTS, perform unstably across the user-chosen value of m , and have unsatisfactory power for small sample sizes.},

We assess the heterogeneous causal effect of treatment on RMST through a nonparametric regression with dimension reduction. This approach allows simultaneous identification of the “baseline score”, a linear combination of baseline characteristics that determines the potential benefit an individual can receive from the treatment as compared to the control, and the estimation of treatment benefit. In the motivating example of antiretroviral regimens against HIV, the proposed estimation indicates the experimental regimen is not universally more effective than the standard regimen in speeding up viral suppression but its benefit depends on a patient’s baseline medical condition.

We propose a novel algorithm called sequential stepwise screening procedure (SeSS) for sparse recovery. This algorithm encourages the grouping effect on both responses and predictors and each response group is allowed to relate to multiple predictor groups. To obtain a correct model under the complex group structures, the proposed procedure first chooses the nonzero block and the nonzero row by the canonical correlation measure (CC) and then selects the relevant entries by the extended Bayesian information Criterion (EBIC).We show that this method obtains accurate estimates in extremely sparse models and greatly reduces the computational cost. The theoretical property of SeSS is established. We conduct simulation studies and consider a real example to compare its performance with existing methods.},

In this paper, we propose an alternative conditional approach, which is more attractive and natural if the non-terminal event is of main interest. In the proposed method, a class of flexible additive and multiplicative models and the additive hazards model are employed to model the non-terminal and terminal events, respectively. For inference, an estimating equation-based procedure is developed and the asymptotic properties of the resulting estimators are established. In addition, a model checking procedure is provided. The numerical results indicate that the proposed methodology works well in practical situations and it is applied to a real set of data that motivated this study.},

  abstract     = {Minimum average variance estimation (MAVE) is a powerful method to estimate the dimension reduction directions of the central mean subspace. However, when analyzing the Boeing 737 data with more than 600000 samples, the classical MAVE method would suffer from significant computational burden. To address this issue, we introduce a distributed minimum average variance estimation (distMAVE) methodology for sufficient dimension reduction by adopting a distributed computing system. The proposed distMAVE method is able to handle large datasets and make a balance between estimation accuracy and computation efficiency. The asymptotic properties of the distributed estimators are proved, and a practical algorithm is provided for implementation. In addition to the theoretical results, we also demonstrate the effectiveness of the distMAVE method through simulation studies and Boeing 737 dataset.},

  abstract     = {The stochastic block model is a popular tool for detecting community structures in network data. Detecting the difference between two community structures is an important issue for stochastic block models. However, the two-sample test has been a largely under-explored domain, and too little work has been devoted to it. In this article, based on the maximum entry-wise deviation of the two centered and rescaled adjacency matrices, we propose a novel test statistic to test two samples of stochastic block models. We prove that the null distribution of the proposed test statistic converges in distribution to a Gumbel distribution, and we show the change of the two samples from stochastic block models can be tested via the proposed method. Then, we show that the proposed test has an asymptotic power guarantee against alternative models. One noticeable advantage of the proposed test statistic is that the number of communities can be allowed to grow linearly up to a logarithmic factor. Further, we extend the proposed method to the degreecorrected stochastic block model. Both simulation studies and real-world data examples indicate that the proposed method works well.},

  abstract     = {The main objective of this work is to bring to light the generalized Gamcon distributions from different perspectives. We first suggest them as a new family of conjugate priors to the Wishart shape parameter. The law of the first kind presents the conjugate prior for the Wishart distribution with a known scale parameter. The generalized Gamcon distribution of the second kind confers the conjugate prior for the Wishart distribution with an unknown scale parameter. A conjugate prior to the Wishart scale parameter is also investigated to deal with the latter case. Then, we provide the Bayes estimators of the Wishart parameters. Simulation studies are devoted to the accuracy evaluation of these estimators. We finally prove that the generalized Gamcon distributions could be closely investigated to fit the Covid-19 data. The model reveals interesting results that exceed the widely considered Gaussian model on the studied data sets within this work.},
