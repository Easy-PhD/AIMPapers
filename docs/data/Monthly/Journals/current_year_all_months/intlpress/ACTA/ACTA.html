  abstract     = {We consider solutions to the space-homogeneous Landau equation with a general family of interaction potentials. We prove that their Fisher information is monotone decreasing in time. The class of interaction potentials covered by our result includes the case of the Landau equation with Coulomb interactions. As a consequence of the global boundedness of the Fisher information, we deduce that solutions to the space-homogeneous Landau equation never blow up.},

  abstract     = {The formation of codimension- 1 interfaces for multi-well gradient-driven problems is well known and established in the scalar case, where the equation is often referred to as the Allen-Cahn equation . The proof relies for a large part on a monotonicity formula for the energy density, which is itself related to the vanishing of the so-called discrepancy function. The vectorial case in contrast is quite open. This lack of results and insight is to a large extent related to the absence of known appropriate monotonicity formulas. In this paper, we focus on the elliptic case in two dimensions , and introduce methods, relying on the analysis of the partial differential equation, which allow us to circumvent the lack of monotonicity formula for the energy density. In the last part of the paper, we recover a new monotonicity formula which relies on a new discrepancy relation . These tools allow us to extend to the vectorial case in two dimensions most of the results obtained for the scalar case. We also emphasize some specific features of the vectorial case.},

  abstract     = {The multi-bubble isoperimetric conjectures in n -dimensional Euclidean and spherical spaces from the 1990s assert that standard bubbles uniquely minimize total perimeter among all q − 1 bubbles enclosing prescribed volume, for any q ⩽ n + 2 . The double-bubble conjecture on R 3 was confirmed in 2000 by Hutchings-Morgan-Ritoré-Ros, and is nowadays fully resolved on R n for all n ⩾ 2 . The double-bubble and triple-bubble conjectures on R 2 and S 2 have also been resolved, but all other cases are in general open. We confirm the conjectures on R n and on S n for all q ⩽ min { 5 , n + 1 } , namely, the double-bubble conjectures for n ⩾ 2 , the triple-bubble conjectures for n ⩾ 3 and the quadruple-bubble conjectures for n ⩾ 4 . In fact, we show that for all q ⩽ n + 1 , a minimizing cluster necessarily has spherical interfaces, and after stereographic projection to S n , its cells are obtained as the Voronoi cells of q affine-functions, or equivalently, as the intersection with S n of convex polyhedra in R n + 1 . Moreover, the cells (including the unbounded one) are necessarily connected and intersect a common hyperplane of symmetry, resolving a conjecture of Heppes. We also show for all q ⩽ n + 1 that a minimizer with non-empty interfaces between all pairs of cells is necessarily a standard bubble. The proof makes crucial use of considering R n and S n in tandem and of Möbius geometry and conformal Killing fields; it does not rely on establishing a PDI for the isoperimetric profile as in the Gaussian setting, which seems out of reach in the present one.},

  abstract     = {We study the interaction between Fourier-Mukai transforms and perverse filtrations for a certain class of dualizable abelian fibrations. Multiplicativity of the perverse filtration and the "Perverse ⊃ Chern" phenomenon for these abelian fibrations are immediate consequences of our theory. We also show that our class of fibrations include families of compactified Jacobians of integral locally planar curves. Applications include the following: (a) we prove the motivic decomposition conjecture for this class (including compactified Jacobian fibrations), which generalizes Deninger-Murre's theorem for abelian schemes; (b) we provide a new proof of the P = W conjecture for GL r ; (c) we prove half of the P = C conjecture concerning refined BPS invariants for the local P 2 ; ( d ) we show that the perverse filtration for the compactified Jacobian associated with an integral locally planar curve is multiplicative, which generalizes a result of Oblomkov-Yun for homogeneous singularities. Our techniques combine Arinkin's autoduality for coherent categories, Ngô's support theorem for the decomposition theorem, Adams operations in operational K -theory, and Corti-Hanamura's theory of relative Chow motives.},
