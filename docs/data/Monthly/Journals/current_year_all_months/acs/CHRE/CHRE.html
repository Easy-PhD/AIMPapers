  abstract     = {Self-regulating hydrogels represent the next generation in the development of soft materials with active, adaptive, autonomous, and intelligent behavior inspired by sophisticated biological systems. Nature provides exemplary demonstrations of such self-regulating behaviors, including muscle tissue’s precise biochemical and mechanical feedback mechanisms, and coordinated cellular chemotaxis driven by dynamic biochemical signaling. Building upon these natural examples, self-regulating hydrogels are capable of spontaneously modulating their structural and functional states through integrated negative feedback loops. In this review, the key design principles and implementation strategies for self-regulating hydrogel actuators are comprehensively summarized. We first systematically classify self-regulating hydrogels into sustained regulation, involving continuous modulation cycles under constant stimuli and one-cycle regulation, characterized by transient transitions driven by specific chemical fuels. Thereafter, the underlying mechanisms, types of hydrogels used, fuels, oscillation periods, amplitudes, and potential applications are highlighted. Finally, current scientific challenges and future opportunities for enhancing the robustness, modularity, and practical applicability of self-regulating hydrogel actuators are discussed. This review aims to provide structured guidelines and inspire interdisciplinary research to further develop advanced hydrogel-based regulatory systems for applications such as soft robotics, autonomous sensors, responsive biomedical devices, and adaptive functional materials.},

  abstract     = {Tumor heterogeneity and complex morphologies pose significant challenges to achieving efficient therapeutic outcomes. However, the recent advent of remote-controlled transformable nanostructures has introduced a novel approach to cancer therapy, enabling precise size, shape, and phase changes in nanoparticles in response to external stimuli, such as light, ultrasound, and magnetic fields. These materials offer noninvasive strategies to effectively navigate the dynamic and complex morphologies of tumors, providing unprecedented control over therapeutic targeting and precision in patient-tailored treatments. The real-time modulation of nanomaterial structures optimizes interactions with the tumor microenvironment, improving circulation, endothelial permeation, deep tumor penetration, and subcellular targeting. This review discusses cutting-edge strategies to remotely control the morphology of nanomaterials, emphasizing their integration into modular cancer theranostic platforms. These systems are engineered to target cancer cell membrane receptors and cytoplasm, subcellular organelles, immune cells, and difficult-to-reach areas including the blood–brain barrier and deep-seated tumors. We also explore the potential of multimodal theranostics including dual-triggered, combinatorial, and synergistic therapies that combine therapeutic action with real-time imaging guidance. This review presents a clear and insightful roadmap, unveiling how these cutting-edge advancements open new horizons for adaptive, personalized therapies with exceptional potential to overcome the complexities of metastatic tumor treatment and advance clinical translation.},

  abstract     = {Fluorine, due to its unique ability to modify the physicochemical and biological properties of parent molecules, has found wide applications as pharmacological modulators in drug development research. Consequently, the portion of fluorine-containing drugs has increased to about 20% in recent years. Among these, fluorine-containing drugs with aromatic fluoro-substitutions are more common than those with fluoro-substitutions at stereogenic centers. In fact, in the past decade, out of 116 fluorine-containing drugs approved by the FDA only 16 drugs are enantiomerically pure, featuring fluorine-containing stereogenic carbon centers. Asymmetric induction during building these drug molecules is largely achieved through either the “chiral pool” or “chiral resolution” approach, while the “asymmetric catalysis” approach remains underexplored. In order to draw the attention of the scientific community to this disparity, this review highlights the innovations (2015–2024) in asymmetric methodologies for creating molecules bearing a fluorine-containing stereogenic carbon center in the presence of organo- or organometallic catalysts. The synthetic strategies are divided into two sections based on fluorine-containing building blocks and fluorine-containing reagents, which are further classified by the reaction types. Special attention has been paid to synthetic challenges, types of substrates, products and catalysts, functional group compatibility, transition states, mechanistic insights, as well as synthetic applications.},

The function is normally performed by transmembrane transport proteins, but several diseases have been linked to malfunctioning or malregulation of these proteins (so-called “channelopathies”). As a consequence, supramolecular chemists have tried to develop synthetic molecules that can transport anions across biological membranes. While the original goal of this endeavor was the development of potential therapeutics for channelopathies, it is now clear that there are several other potential medical and nonmedical applications for synthetic transmembrane anion transporters. The medical applications of synthetic anion transporters have been widely explored, especially their potential as anticancer agents. However, there are many other applications of synthetic anion transporters that are often overlooked. These range from antibacterial activity and drug delivery, to nonmedical applications such as biomimicry, the development of optical sensors, catalysis, organic synthesis and others. In this review, we aim to highlight the versatility of synthetic transmembrane anion transporters and to convince chemists to look beyond channelopathies and anticancer activity as applications of artificial anion transporters.},

The classic steric biasing approach in small-molecule catalysis employs steric destabilization of the undesired competing transition states to achieve energetic differentiation. In contrast, enzymes achieve high levels of rate acceleration and selectivity by accelerating the pathway leading to the major product, often through networks of attractive, stabilizing noncovalent interactions. This Review showcases selective noncovalent catalysis (NCC) with small organic molecules and transition-metal complexes. We collect and highlight examples whereby selectivity was documented experimentally to arise from selective stabilization of the transition state leading to the major product.

  abstract     = {Soft robots, with their exceptional compliance, adaptability, and ability to safely interact with delicate objects, are redefining human–machine interfaces and expanding robotic capabilities into environments inaccessible to rigid systems. However, creating intelligent, multifunctional soft robots demands navigating a complex, multiscale design landscape, ranging from molecular-level building blocks through multifunctional soft robotic materials to fully integrated systems. In this review, we present a structured roadmap that addresses key challenges at three critical scales. At the molecular level and nanoscale, we examine an extensive library of soft matter and functional nanomaterials that impart tunable mechanical, electrical, optical, and stimuli-responsive properties to soft robotic materials. At the microscale, we highlight effective assembly strategies, such as heterogeneous blending, bilayer integration, and additive manufacturing, enabling reconfigurable, multifunctional materials that combine rapid response, robust functionality, large deformation tolerance, and fatigue resistance. Finally, at the system level, we explore how integrating actuation mechanisms, sensing technologies, and computational tools with these advanced materials can yield intelligent, adaptive, and energy-efficient soft robotic systems. By bridging these multiscale gaps and fostering interdisciplinary collaborations, this review provides near-, mid-, and long-term perspectives to guide future research, ultimately driving the development of transformative soft robots that elevate human–machine interactions.},

Our in-depth understanding of the immune system has also been driving the blossoming development of biocompatible macroscale biomaterials designed to prevent and treat various immune-related disorders. Hydrogels, a class of water-swollen networks with extracellular matrix-mimic characteristics, have served as promising biomaterials for guiding the immune system in biological milieus. The convergence of hydrogels and immunotherapy represents an interdisciplinary field that has driven significant advancements in both materials science and immunology. In this review, we first introduce the immune system to establish a fundamental understanding of its structure and function and then elaborate on the rational principles of hydrogel design, with a focus on passive and active mechanisms. Next, we explore a range of “hitchhiking” strategies employed to develop immunomodulatory hydrogels. State-of-the-art strategies regarding recent progress in immunomodulatory hydrogels for defense against pathological abnormalities are systematically summarized. Furthermore, the key scientific issues encountered and the hurdles faced in the development of immunomodulatory hydrogels are highlighted, aiming to show a full picture of immunomodulatory hydrogels for optimized therapeutic efficacy.},

  abstract     = {The widespread use of radiofrequency (RF) communication has increased the exposure of organisms to electromagnetic fields, sparking a debate over the potential health effects of weak RF electromagnetic fields. While some experimental studies suggest that low-amplitude RF radiation may influence cellular metabolism or sleep patterns or even promote cancer, these claims remain controversial due to limited theoretical plausibility. Central to this debate is the radical pair mechanism (RPM), a quantum-mechanical framework proposed to mediate RF effects. Despite its role in magnetoreception and various magnetic field effects on chemical reactions, the RPM often fails to align with observations at low, nonthermal RF field strengths. This review examines these contrasting perspectives by discussing experimental findings and theoretical models that aim to explain putative biological effects of RF magnetic fields. Emphasis is placed on the challenges of reconciling theoretical predictions with empirical data, particularly in the context of weak RF exposure. Additionally, an overview of the theoretical framework used in current modeling efforts highlights the complexity of applying the RPM to biological systems and underscores the importance of critical interpretation. The goal is to clarify the state of understanding and inform future research on RPM-mediated biological effects under weak RF exposure.},

  abstract     = {Selective control of gene expression with small molecules has been a long-standing goal at the interface of chemistry and medicine. The ability to selectively regulate disease-driver genes with small molecules would transform the treatment of numerous human diseases. Small molecule modulators of proteins that enable gene transcription, including kinases, chromatin-modifying enzymes, and transcription factors (TFs) have proven invaluable as mechanistic probes and therapeutic agents. However, these molecules perturb gene regulatory processes broadly, often eliciting adverse outcomes and operating within narrow therapeutic ranges. Here, we describe the development of sequence-targeted synthetic gene regulators (SynGRs) that address these issues. Built with programmable DNA-binding polyamides, first-generation SynGRs were employed to inhibit gene expression by blocking the binding of TFs to regulatory sites. By contrast, gene-targeting chimeras that function as molecular glues to recruit the transcriptional machinery to targeted genes were developed to stimulate expression of desired gene(s). Since their advent in 2000, diverse classes of SynGRs have been reported, including artificial/synthetic TFs, protein–DNA dimerizers, and chromatin modifiers. Further integration of the principles of cooperative assembly and selectivity has yielded tunable SynGRs that regulate single disease-driver genes and are progressing as first-in-class therapeutic agents. The ability to rationally “drug” disease-driver genes is now within reach.},

In this paper, we review electrochemical pathways for the recovery of REEs from mining and unconventional feedstocks, including coal mining byproducts. Electrochemical separations offer a modular alternative to the traditional thermal and solvent-based extraction methods, by potentially combining both selectivity and a low chemical footprint. We review advances in various electrolysis and electrosorption-based separation processes for REE recovery and purification, and discuss opportunities for future materials development. Finally, we provide an overview of applications of REEs in clean energy conversion, especially their use as next-generation electrocatalysts. We conclude that electrochemical processes can play an important role in the recovery and utilization of REEs in clean energy technologies and provide perspectives for emerging areas of research and needs in rare-earth separation and utilization.},

Key aspects of the review include approaches for constructing measurement operators with reduced classical preprocessing and quantum implementation costs, techniques to minimize the number of measurements required for a given accuracy, and error mitigation strategies that leverage symmetries and other properties of the measurement operators. Furthermore, we explore measurement schemes rooted in Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE), which are expected to become viable with the advent of fault-tolerant quantum computing.

This natural bottom-up evolution inspired chemists to devise similarly organized processes for the creation of complex artificial matter. Similarly, the systematic design of customizable, complex nanocrystals has long been a fundamental goal. In this review, we present a comprehensive collection of chemical toolkits consisting of versatile, on-demand steps for the sequential synthesis of morphologically complex plasmonic nanoparticles (NPs). By integrating multistep synthetic routes, we introduce a list of chemical toolkits that enable combinable synthetic steps. This approach facilitates the controlled, multistep synthesis of shape-complex plasmonic NPs. We demonstrate how these designable chemical toolkits, when applied sequentially or in tailored combinations, enable the rational design of advanced plasmonic nanostructures with unprecedented complexity and structural hierarchy. This ultimately opens the door to an extensive, systematically expandable library of nanostructures with tailored functionalities. Through the advancement of this rationally designed synthetic approach, we aim to establish a “multiple stepwise synthesis” framework for fabricating shape-complex plasmonic building blocks, thus providing a roadmap for designing the next generation of plasmonic NPs.},

  abstract     = {Bioorthogonal reactions play a key role in controlled chemical transformations in living systems and are therefore applied to a diverse area of biological and medical applications. However, these applications can be limited by poor selectivity, slow kinetics under biological conditions, and intrinsic incompatibility between the introduced materials and the cellular environment. An emerging strategy for greater functional control over bioorthogonal transformations is the employment of supramolecular strategies or constructs. Herein, we focus on synthetic supramolecular systems that (i) improve biocompatibility by shielding reactive species within protective supramolecular constructs from harsh biological environments; (ii) allow for integration of subcellular targeting moieties; (iii) reduce toxicity; (iv) accelerate reaction rates through molecular preorganization; (v) explore entirely new tools, such as catalysis regulated by controlled stimuli at a functionalized surface. Through rational integration of these supramolecular strategies, bioorthogonal reactions could achieve enhanced precision, faster kinetics, and targeted reactivity within specific tissues, cells, or organelles, subsequently paving the way for further applications in chemical biology and therapeutic interventions.},

Electrolyte is considered as one of the most influential components of tremendous scientific and commercial interest in the performance of FESS. Electrolytes are undergoing tremendous structural variations from liquid to solid, rigid to flexible, and organic to aqueous to meet the evolving requirements for FESS. This review delineates the evolutionary trajectory of electrolyte development across three dimensions: transitioning from liquid to solid, from rigid to flexible, and from organic to aqueous formulations. Furthermore, it elucidates potential mechanisms influencing the electrochemical stability and interfacial properties of electrolytes, along with their impact on battery performance. Subsequently, various strategies are outlined to address these challenges and advance the development of FESS electrolytes. Lastly, the functionality and structural design, computation methods, compatibility (integration) of the FESS are evaluated, followed by a comprehensive summary and outlook. We believe this article will aid researchers in comprehending the underlying causes of these challenges and in designing cutting-edge flexible solid-state electrolytes for assembling FESS that exhibit compatibility and superior performance.},

  abstract     = {Accurate prediction of aqueous solubility for organic molecules is of great importance across a range of fields, from the design and manufacturing of energy materials, to assessing the environmental impact of potential pollutants. It is of particular significance to the pharmaceutical industry, in which problems with low aqueous solubility frequently hamper the development of new drugs. Experimental measurements of solubility are used extensively, but are often time-consuming, resource intensive and only applicable to already synthesized molecules. As such, there is a need for the development of computational approaches to predict solubility. In recent years, there have been considerable advances in physics-based methods, with several contrasting techniques able to give accurate predictions of solubility and a wealth of thermodynamic data for structural optimization. Here, we provide the reader with a thorough understanding of the theoretical background and practical applications of these physics-based methods to predict solubility. This includes discussions of the various advantages and disadvantages of each approach, and an indication of areas of continuing research. Experimental and data-driven methods to assess solubility are also discussed to provide context.},

The interaction network regulating the properties of biomolecular systems such as proteins and their media goes beyond a single sort of contribution, and instead it is characterized by the interplay between several forces of diverse nature.

  abstract     = {Photodetectors have become essential in modern technologies, yet traditional designs face challenges in many emerging applications owing to their fixed response characteristics, such as fixed responsivity, bandwidth, dynamic range, and spectral response. This limitation reduces their effectiveness when the target signal or ambient light varies in intensity, frequency, and wavelength, etc. Intelligent photodetectors, featuring postmanufacturing tunability, have emerged as a promising solution by allowing for real-time adaptability. These dynamic devices can adjust key performance metrics during operation, enhancing their versatility and applicability. Beyond basic photodetection, this adaptability lays fundamentals for various new functions, for instance, in-sensor computing and computational spectrum reconstruction. Some devices also offer switchable operation modes and integrated multisensory perception, minimizing the need for auxiliary components and simplifying the system architecture. This review aims to provide a comprehensive and holistic view of the diverse advances in intelligent photodetectors under the concept of tunable mechanisms. Beginning with foundational principles, we explore how postmanufacturing tunability enhances basic photodetection performance and enables advanced functions through tunable temporal response dynamics, spectral response, and multiple operational modes.

  abstract     = {Hydrogen is a green and sustainable energy vector that can facilitate the large-scale integration of intermittent renewable energy, renewable fuels for heavy transport, and deep decarbonization of hard-to-abate industries. Anion-exchange-membrane water electrolyzers (AEM-WEs) have several achieved or expected competitive advantages over other electrolysis technologies, including the use of precious metal-free electrocatalysts at both electrodes, fluorine-free hydrocarbon-based ionomeric membranes and bipolar plates based on inexpensive materials. Contrasting the analogous proton-exchange-membrane system (PEM-WE), where pure water is circulated (no support electrolyte), the current generation of AEM-WEs necessitates the circulation of a dilute aqueous alkaline electrolyte for reaching high energy efficiency and durability. For several reasons, including but not limited to lower cost of balance-of-plant, lower operating cost and improved device’s lifetime, achieving high cell efficiency and performance using an alkali-free water feed is highly desirable. In this review, we develop and build a foundational understanding of AEM-WEs operating with pure water, as well as discuss the effects of operating with natural water feeds like seawater. After a discussion of the possible advantages of pure-water-fed AEM-WEs, we cover the thermodynamic and kinetic processes involved in AEM-WE, followed by a detailed review of materials and components and their integration in the device. We highlight the influence of electrolyte composition and alkali/electrolyte-free feed on the membrane-electrode assembly, ionomers, electrocatalysts, porous transport layer, bipolar plates and operating configuration. We provide evidence for how the pure water feed engenders several issues related to the degradation of device components and propose mitigation strategies.},

We begin by assessing what makes a protein surface more tractable than others with a focus on the recent success in targeting Ras, which has long served as a poster child of a therapeutically important yet undruggable target. We discuss computational approaches to dissect protein surfaces to design macrocycles and miniprotein ligands. Traditional drug discovery has benefitted from leveraging natural products but this benefit has not extended to the design of ligands for protein surfaces because few natural products have been characterized as inhibitors of protein complexes. However, nature does provide a template in the form of binding epitopes of partner proteins. We review design of protein structure mimics that enable rational design of inhibitors through multiple weak contacts. Lastly, we focus on contemporary screening methods that are being merged with constrained peptides to offer unprecedented side chain diversity on conformationally defined scaffolds.

In this review, we delve into the comprehensive information that facilitates the transformation of layered crystals into continuous thin-film architectures boasting well-defined nanopores. We trace the evolutionary history of these technologies, engage in debates on their underlying principles, and reveal obstacles that demand attention. Starting with the preparation of “single-layer carbon,” we explore an array of protocols designed for the sizable production of 2D nanosheets. Our focus then shifts toward unveiling the solutions available for membrane fabrication and control, specifically focusing on the chemical and structural properties of 2D membranes that dictate their mass transportation behaviors in various scenarios. This is followed by a brief comparative discussion on the development of atomically thin and 2D-based mixed matrix membranes.

  abstract     = {Fluorescence emitters with a multiple-resonant (MR) effect have become a research hotspot. These MR emitters mainly consist of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons with boron/nitrogen, nitrogen/carbonyl, and indolocarbazole frameworks. The staggered arrangement of the highest occupied molecular orbital and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital facilitates MR, resulting in smaller internal reorganization energy and a narrower emission bandwidth. Optimal charge separation suppresses the energy gap between singlet and triplet excited states, favoring thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF). These MR-TADF materials, due to color purity and high emission efficiency, are excellent candidates for organic light-emitting diodes. Nevertheless, significant challenges remain; in particular, the limitation imposed by the alternated core configuration hinders their diversity and versatility. Most existing MR-TADF materials are concentrated in the blue-green range, with only a few in red and near-infrared spectra. This review provides a timely and comprehensive screening of MR emitters from their pioneering work to the present. Our goal is to gain understandings of the MR-TADF structure–performance relationship from both basic and advanced perspectives. Special emphasis is placed on exploring the correlations between chemical structure, photophysical properties and electroluminescent performance in both depth and breadth with an aim to promote the future development of MR emitters.},

  abstract     = {Targeting intractable proteins remains a key challenge in drug discovery, as these proteins often lack well-defined binding pockets or possess shallow surfaces not readily addressed by traditional drug design. Covalent chemistry has emerged as a powerful solution for accessing protein sites in difficult to ligand regions. By leveraging activity-based protein profiling (ABPP) and LC-MS/MS technologies, academic groups and industry have identified cysteine-reactive ligands that enable selective targeting of challenging protein sites to modulate previously inaccessible biological pathways. Cysteines within a protein are rare, however, and developing covalent ligands that target additional residues hold great promise for further expanding the ligandable proteome. This review highlights recent advancements in targeting amino acids beyond cysteine binding with an emphasis on tyrosine- and lysine-directed covalent ligands and their applications in chemical biology and therapeutic development. We outline the process of developing covalent ligands using chemical proteomic methodology, highlighting recent successful examples and discuss considerations for future expansion to additional amino acid sites on proteins.},

  abstract     = {Ultracold atoms and molecules provide an unprecedented view into the role of quantum effects in chemical reactions. However, these same quantum effects make ultracold chemical reactions notoriously difficult to simulate. Contrary to conventional wisdom that ultracold systems necessitate quantum approaches, with classical mechanics offering a rough approximation at best, the past three decades have seen an explosion in classical, quasiclassical, and semiclassical approaches that yield near-exact results for ultracold systems─including in cases where today’s quantum methods would be computationally intractable. This review illustrates the power of these approaches with 30 years’ worth of numerical and experimental evidence. The review provides a comprehensive account of the successes of universal classical post-threshold laws for low-energy atomic and molecular scattering systems, as well as the cutting edge in quasiclassical approaches that unravel the ongoing controversy surrounding long-lived collision complex lifetimes in ultracold collisions. Special attention is placed on atomic systems where classical scaling laws hold directly at zero Kelvin, which underline the predictive power classical methods can offer even in the most extreme quantum chemical environments. The review culminates with a discussion of broader implications for classically inspired approaches to prototypically quantum chemistry in the second quantum revolution.},

Such targets often exhibit unique features, including highly dynamic structures, a lack of well-defined ligand-binding pockets, the presence of highly conserved active sites, and functional modulation by protein–protein interactions. Recent advances in computational simulations and artificial intelligence have revolutionized the drug design landscape, giving rise to innovative strategies for overcoming these obstacles. In this review, we highlight the latest progress in computational approaches for drug design against undruggable targets, present several successful case studies, and discuss remaining challenges and future directions. Special emphasis is placed on four primary target categories: intrinsically disordered proteins, protein allosteric regulation, protein–protein interactions, and protein degradation, along with discussion of emerging target types. We also examine how AI-driven methodologies have transformed the field, from applications in protein–ligand complex structure prediction and virtual screening to de novo ligand generation for undruggable targets. Integration of computational methods with experimental techniques is expected to bring further breakthroughs to overcome the hurdles of undruggable targets. As the field continues to evolve, these advancements hold great promise to expand the druggable space, offering new therapeutic opportunities for previously untreatable diseases.},

  abstract     = {Semiconductors form the foundational bedrock of modern electronics and numerous cutting-edge technologies. Particularly, semiconductors crafted from organic building blocks hold immense promise as next-generation pioneers, thanks to their vast array of chemical structures, customizable frontier orbital energy levels and bandgap structures, and easily adjustable π electronic properties. Over the past 50 years, advancements in chemistry and materials science have facilitated extensive investigations into small organic π compounds, oligomers, and polymers, resulting in a rich library of organic semiconductors. However, a longstanding challenge persists: how to organize π building units or chains into well-defined π structures, which are crucial for the performance of organic semiconductors. Consequently, the pursuit of methodologies capable of synthesizing and/or fabricating organic semiconductors with ordered structures has emerged as a frontier in organic and polymeric semiconductor research. In this context, covalent organic frameworks (COFs) stand out as unique platforms allowing for the covalent integration of organic π units into periodically ordered π structures, thus facilitating the development of semiconductors with extended yet precisely defined π architectures. Since their initial report in 2008, significant strides have been made in exploring various chemistries to develop semiconducting COFs, resulting in a rich library of structures, properties, functions, and applications. This review provides a comprehensive yet focused exploration of the general structural features of semiconducting COFs, outlining the basic principles of structural design, illustrating the linkage chemistry and synthetic strategies based on typical one-pot polymerization reactions to demonstrate the growth of bulk materials, nanosheets, films, and membranes. By elucidating the interactions between COFs and various entities such as photons, phonons, electrons, holes, ions, molecules, and spins, this review categorizes semiconducting COFs into nine distinct sections: semiconductors, photoconductors, light emitters, sensors, photocatalysts, photothermal conversion materials, electrocatalysts, energy storage electrodes, and radical spin materials, focusing on disclosing structure-originated properties and functions. Furthermore, this review scrutinizes structure–function correlations and highlights the unique features, breakthroughs, and challenges associated with semiconducting COFs. Furnished with foundational knowledges and state-of-the-art insights, this review predicts the fundamental issues to be addressed and outlines future directions for semiconducting COFs, offering a comprehensive overview of this rapidly evolving and remarkable field.},

  abstract     = {The unique physicochemical properties of ionic liquids (ILs) make them be widely applied in many areas. Especially, in chemical reaction processes ILs are capable of serving as solvents, catalysts, additives, electrolytes, and display high performances. In the past few decades, the carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) emission issue has caused worldwide attention, and various strategies has been developed to solve the problems caused by CO 2 emission. As an accessible, renewable, and environmentally friendly C1 feedstock, CO 2 has been intensively investigated for synthesis of value-added chemicals, fuels, and materials via thermocatalysis, electrocatalysis, and photocatalysis. As a kind of efficient catalysts or promoters, various ILs have been employed in the chemical transformation of CO 2 . Especially, the CO 2 -reactive ILs can chemically capture and activate CO 2 , and further catalyze the CO 2 transformation under metal-free and mild conditions, which provide novel protocols to produce value-added chemicals. The catalytic systems comprising IL and metal catalysts combine the advantages of ILs and metal catalysts, and can achieve the reductive transformation of CO 2 coupled with hydrogenation, providing green routes to access fuel and chemicals. Besides, the IL-based electrolytes have been applied in electrocatalytic reduction of CO 2 , which cooperate with electrodes to achieve electrocatalytic transformation of CO 2 into different products. In this review article various CO 2 -reactive ILs are first introduced focusing on activation mechanism of CO 2 . Then, the IL-catalyzed CO 2 transformation under metal-free conditions, reductive transformation of CO 2 over IL-metal catalytic systems, and electrocatalytic transformation of CO 2 in IL-based electrolytes are summarized concentrating on the roles of ILs in chemical reactions. The final section extends the scope of this review to prospects and challenges in IL-catalyzed or promoted CO 2 transformation.},

Therefore, the development of functional HFs that closely mimic biofunction ability is highly desirable. HFs are characterized by their high water content and have a fibrous shape with a cross-linking network in condensed structures. They combine the functional characteristics of hydrogel materials (soft, wet, environmentally, responsive, biocompatible) with the structural advantages of fiber materials (high aspect ratio, anisotropy, flexibility). Therefore, a systematic understanding of the development and current challenges of HFs is of great significance for their functionalization and structural construction, potentially leading to the realization of bionic functions similar to those found in the human body. This paper discussing the development of HFs, focusing on material composition, structural design, functional construction, and applications, while also addressing the limitations and challenges associated with HFs in detail.

  abstract     = {Sensorimotor functions, the seamless integration of sensing, decision-making, and actuation, are fundamental for robots to interact with their environments. Inspired by biological systems, the incorporation of soft materials and devices into robotics holds significant promise for enhancing these functions. However, current robotics systems often lack the autonomy and intelligence observed in nature due to limited sensorimotor integration, particularly in flexible sensing and actuation. As the field progresses toward soft, flexible, and stretchable materials, developing such materials and devices becomes increasingly critical for advanced robotics. Despite rapid advancements individually in soft materials and flexible devices, their combined applications to enable sensorimotor capabilities in robots are emerging. This review addresses this emerging field by providing a comprehensive overview of soft materials and devices that enable sensorimotor functions in robots. We delve into the latest development in soft sensing technologies, actuation mechanism, structural designs, and fabrication techniques. Additionally, we explore strategies for sensorimotor control, the integration of artificial intelligence (AI), and practical application across various domains such as healthcare, augmented and virtual reality, and exploration. By drawing parallels with biological systems, this review aims to guide future research and development in soft robots, ultimately enhancing the autonomy and adaptability of robots in unstructured environments.},

Controlling the charge state of individual molecules provides a powerful tool for exploring fundamental processes, such as redox reactions, selective bond rearrangements, molecular excitations, charge transfer, and modulation of reaction pathways at the single-molecule level. Recent advancements in scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) have enabled precise and stable manipulation of molecular charge states, allowing for detailed, high-resolution studies of charge-state-dependent phenomena. In this review, we discuss the principles and methodologies for charge-state control in STM and AFM, with a focus on strategies for stabilizing charge states in a controlled experimental environment. We also examine key advancements in the ability to detect and manipulate intra- and intermolecular charge transfer, providing insights into charge-mediated processes, such as structural rearrangements, electronic states, and reactivity at the atomic scale. Finally, we highlight the potential of charge-state control to probe electronic excited states and resolve spin-coherence in individual molecules.},

  abstract     = {Noncovalent interactions (NCIs) is an umbrella term for a multitude of typically weak interactions within and between molecules. Despite the low individual energy contributions, their collective effect significantly influences molecular behavior. Accordingly, understanding these interactions is crucial across fields like catalysis, drug design, materials science, and environmental chemistry. However, predicting NCIs is challenging, requiring at least molecular mechanics-level pairwise energy contributions or efficient quantum mechanical electron correlation treatment. In this review, we investigate the application of machine learning (ML) to study NCIs in molecular systems, an emerging research field. ML excels at modeling complex nonlinear relationships, and is capable of integrating vast data sets from experimental and theoretical sources. It offers a powerful approach for analyzing interactions across scales, from small molecules to large biomolecular assemblies. Specifically, we examine data sets characterizing NCIs, compare molecular featurization techniques, assess ML models predicting NCIs explicitly, and explore inverse design approaches. ML enhances predictive accuracy, reduces computational costs, and reveals overlooked interaction patterns. By identifying current challenges and future opportunities, we highlight how ML-driven insights could revolutionize this field. Overall, we believe that recent proof-of-concept studies foreshadow exciting developments for the study of NCIs in the years to come.},

We evaluate each method’s complexities, the resources they require, and their effectiveness in addressing coherent, incoherent, and state preparation and measurement (SPAM) errors. Furthermore, we introduce Deterministic Benchmarking (DB), a novel protocol that minimizes the number of experimental runs, exhibits resilience to SPAM errors, and effectively characterizes both coherent and incoherent errors. The implementation of DB is experimentally validated using a superconducting transmon qubit, and the results are substantiated with a simple analytical model and master equation simulations.

In this scenario, memory devices must evolve significantly to provide the necessary bit capacity, performance, and energy efficiency needed in computation. In particular, novel computing paradigms have emerged to minimize data movement, which is known to contribute the largest amount of energy consumption in conventional computing systems based on the von Neumann architecture. In-memory computing (IMC) provides a means to compute within data with minimum data movement and excellent energy efficiency and performance. To meet these goals, resistive-switching random-access memory (RRAM) appears to be an ideal candidate thanks to its excellent scalability and nonvolatile storage. However, circuit implementations of modern artificial intelligence (AI) models require highly specialized device properties that need careful RRAM device engineering. This work addresses the RRAM concept from materials, device, circuit, and application viewpoints, focusing on the physical device properties and the requirements for storage and computing applications. Memory applications, such as embedded nonvolatile memory (eNVM) in novel microcontroller units (MCUs) and storage class memory (SCM), are highlighted. Applications in IMC, such as hardware accelerators of neural networks, data query, and algebra functions, are illustrated by referring to the reported demonstrators with RRAM technology, evidencing the remaining challenges for the development of a low-power, sustainable AI.},

In particular, lignocellulose-based biorefineries, utilizing the most abundant renewable feedstock on Earth, have significant potential to supply sustainable energy, chemicals and materials. Ionic liquids (ILs, organic salts with low melting temperatures) and deep eutectic solvents (DESs, mixtures with eutectic points lower than the ideal mixture) are capable of dissolving some of the key lignocellulose polymers, and even the whole biomass. Furthermore, they have intrinsic advantages over molecular solvents, including safer usage profiles and high tunability, which allow tailored physicochemical properties. Such properties provide unique opportunities for the development of new processes that could unlock the full potential of future biorefineries.

  abstract     = {Small thiolate-protected gold molecular clusters have gained significant interest in research due to their unique size-dependent properties. Their molecular to nanoscale sizes lead to distinctive quantum confinement effects, resulting in a discrete electronic energy band gap structure and molecule-like properties, including HOMO–LUMO electronic transitions, enhanced photoluminescence, and intrinsic magnetism and chirality. Near-infrared II (NIR-II, 1000–3000 nm) emissive gold clusters have emerged as a fascinating class of nanomaterials that are well-suited for biomedical applications. The unique combination of stability, biocompatibility, and tunable emission properties position them as valuable tools for high-resolution and deep-tissue imaging, with potential real-world applications ranging from disease diagnostics and prognosis to therapeutics. In this review, we focus on the NIR-II photoluminescence properties of gold molecular clusters for preclinical in vivo NIR-II imaging of vasculature, brain, kidney, liver, and gastrointestinal organs, and molecular targeted tumor imaging and theranostic treatment. The imaging capabilities combined with fast excretion and a high safety profile make molecular gold clusters highly promising for clinical translation.},

This Review summarizes recent advancements in the application of metal halide perovskite materials for PSC and PeLED devices to address the efficiency, stability and scalability issues. Emphasis is placed on material chemistry strategies used to control and engineer the composition, deposition process, interface and micro-nanostructure in solution-processed perovskite films, leading to high-quality crystalline thin films for optimal device performance. Furthermore, we retrospectively compare the device physics of PSCs and PeLEDs, their working principles and their energy loss mechanisms, examining the similarities and differences between the two types of devices. The reciprocity relationship suggests that a great PSC should also be a great PeLED, motivating the search for interconverting photoelectric bifunctional devices with maximum radiative recombination and negligible non-radiative recombination. Specific requirements of PSCs and PeLEDs in terms of bandgap, thickness, band alignment and charge transport to achieve this target are discussed in detail. Further challenges and issues are also illustrated, together with prospects for future development. Understanding these fundamentals, embracing recent breakthroughs and exploring future prospects pave the way toward the rational design and development of high-performance PSC and PeLED devices.},

  abstract     = {The study of interfacial properties in liquid–liquid and liquid–vapor systems has a history of nearly 200 years, with significant contributions from scientific luminaries such as Thomas Young and Willard Gibbs. However, a similar level of understanding of solid–liquid interfaces has emerged only more recently, largely because of the numerous complications associated with the thermodynamics needed to describe them. The accurate calculation of the interfacial free energy of solid–liquid systems is central to determining which interfaces will be observed and their properties. However, designing and analyzing the molecular dynamics simulations required to do this remains challenging, unlike the liquid–liquid or liquid–vapor cases, because of the unique complications associated with solid–liquid systems. Specifically, the lattice structure of solids introduces spatial directionality, and atomic configurations in solids can be altered by stretching. The primary aim of this review is to provide an overview of the numerical approaches developed to address the challenge of calculating the interfacial free energy in solid–liquid systems. These approaches are classified as (i) direct methods, which compute interfacial free energies explicitly, albeit often through convoluted procedures, and (ii) indirect methods, which derive these free energies as secondary results obtained from the analysis of simulations of an idealized experimental configuration. We also discuss two key topics related to the calculation of the interfacial free energy of solid–liquid systems: nucleation theory and curved interfaces, which represent important problems where research remains highly active.},

This Review examines key studies to highlight the strengths and weaknesses of each strategy. Two DPL methods, in particular, show great promise: organic azide/diazirine cross-linkers (Z-cross-linkers) and UV-cross-linkable organic semiconducting blends (X-blends). These methods not only simplify the photolithography process significantly but also enhance the chemical and physical resistance of patterned organic semiconductors against photolithographic chemicals and tandem solution-depositions. Consequently, these advancements enable the fabrication of organic integrated circuits entirely through solution processes. In conclusion, photolithography of organic semiconductors serves a dual purpose: it facilitates the patterning of active layers for OFETs and acts as an enabling technology for fabricating sophisticated and cost-effective organic integrated circuits.},

We give an overview of the application of the method for artificial post-translational protein modifications and the selective functionalization and directed immobilization of proteins.

We open by briefly discussing fundamental photoelectrochemical concepts and implications for photoelectrode function. We next review a broad range of semiconductor photoelectrodes broken down by material class (oxides, nitrides, chalcogenides, and mature photovoltaic semiconductors), identifying intrinsic properties and discussing their influence on performance. We then identify innovative in situ and operando techniques to directly probe the photoelectrode|electrolyte interface, enabling direct assessment of structure–property relationships for catalytic surfaces in active reaction environments. We close by considering more complex photoelectrochemical fuel-forming reactions (carbon dioxide and nitrogen reduction, as well as alternative oxidation reactions), where product selectivity imposes additional criteria on electrochemical driving force and photoelectrode architecture. By contextualizing recent literature within a fundamental framework, we seek to provide direction for continued progress toward achieving efficient and stable fuel-forming photoelectrodes.},

  abstract     = {The exciton Bohr radius is a defining feature in conventional quantum dot physics. Three distinct confinement regimes are usually recognized: the weak, intermediate, and strong confinement regimes. Which of these is relevant depends on the relative size of the quantum dot in terms of the exciton Bohr radius. However, this classification is primarily based on the linear optical properties of the nanocrystal. During the transition from the molecule to the bulk crystal, structural, mechanical, thermal, and chemical properties change as well. In this review, we discuss the cluster regime, where the exciton experiences extreme confinement. In the cluster regime, not only do linear optical properties deviate significantly from the effective mass approximation, but other material properties also begin to deviate from their bulk values. These deviations are only observable in the size regime, where the intrinsic length scales are much smaller than the exciton Bohr radius. Crucially, computational methods allow chemists to explore this region far more quantitatively than in the past.},

Indeed, their highly varied chemical composition, structural diversity, and the resulting electronic properties provide a rich playground for imagining new applications in the field of energy. The anions and the chemical bonds they form with the 3d transition elements are at the heart of this review. Key parameters such as electronegativity, hardness, and polarizability are introduced and discussed to better understand the charge capacity of the anion and the bonds formed in the solid. Oxyfluorides represent the most studied family due to the size similarity of the two anions, and part of the review is dedicated to the specific synthesis of these materials by systematically adjusting the fluorine content within various structures and analyzing the electronic and electrochemical properties of these compositions. The final sections focus on materials with structures often exhibiting a two-dimensional character, where ionic blocks coexist with covalent layers, such as fluorochalcogenides, fluoropnictides, and fluorotetrelides. The compositions and structures are systematically correlated with the electronic properties.},

  abstract     = {Chiral phosphoric acids (CPAs) have emerged as highly effective Brønsted acid catalysts in an expanding range of asymmetric transformations, often through novel multifunctional substrate activation modes. Versatile and broadly appealing, these catalysts benefit from modular and tunable structures, and compatibility with additives. Given the unique types of noncovalent interactions (NCIs) that can be established between CPAs and various reactants─such as hydrogen bonding, aromatic interactions, and van der Waals forces─it is unsurprising that these catalyst systems have become a promising approach for accessing diverse chiral product outcomes. This review aims to provide an in-depth exploration of the mechanisms by which CPAs impart stereoselectivity, positioning NCIs as the central feature that connects a broad spectrum of catalytic reactions. Spanning literature from 2004 to 2024, it covers nucleophilic additions, radical transformations, and atroposelective bond formations, highlighting the applicability of CPA organocatalysis. Special emphasis is placed on the structural and mechanistic features that govern CPA–substrate interactions, as well as the tools and techniques developed to enhance our understanding of their catalytic behavior. In addition to emphasizing mechanistic details and stereocontrolling elements in individual reactions, we have carefully structured this review to provide a natural progression from these specifics to a broader, class-level perspective. Overall, these findings underscore the critical role of NCIs in CPA catalysis and their significant contributions to advancing asymmetric synthesis.},

Over the years of dedicated research, several types of chemiresistive gas sensors have been realized with appreciable sensitivities toward various gases. However, critical issues such as poor selectivity and sluggish response/recovery speeds continue to impede their widespread commercialization. Specifically, the mechanisms behind the selective response of some chemiresistive materials toward specific gas analytes remain unclear. In this review, we discuss state-of-the-art strategies employed to attain gas-selective chemiresistive materials, with particular emphasis on materials design, surface modification or functionalization with catalysts, defect engineering, material structure control, and integration with physical/chemical gas filtration media. The nature of material surface–gas interactions and the supporting mechanisms are elucidated, opening opportunities for optimizing the materials design, fine-tuning the gas sensing performance, and guiding the selection of the most appropriate materials for the accurate detection of specific gases.

Many disease-associated changes are hard-wired within the surfaceome, yet approved drugs target less than 50 cell surface proteins. In the past decade, the proteomics community has made significant strides in developing new technologies tailored for studying the surfaceome in all its complexity. In this review, we first dive into the unique characteristics and functions of the surfaceome, emphasizing the necessity for specialized labeling, enrichment, and proteomic approaches. An overview of surfaceomics methods is provided, detailing techniques to measure changes in protein expression and how this leads to novel target discovery. Next, we highlight advances in proximity labeling proteomics (PLP), showcasing how various enzymatic and photoaffinity proximity labeling techniques can map protein–protein interactions and membrane protein complexes on the cell surface. We then review the role of extracellular post-translational modifications, focusing on cell surface glycosylation, proteolytic remodeling, and the secretome. Finally, we discuss methods for identifying tumor-specific peptide MHC complexes and how they have shaped therapeutic development. This emerging field of neo-protein epitopes is constantly evolving, where targets are identified at the proteome level and encompass defined disease-associated PTMs, complexes, and dysregulated cellular and tissue locations. Given the functional importance of the surfaceome for biology and therapy, we view surfaceomics as a critical piece of this quest for neo-epitope target discovery.},

Over the past decade, the evolution of DNA- and RNA-based technologies combined with the innovation of state-of-the-art delivery vehicles for nucleic acids has brought rapid advancements to the biopharmaceutical field. Nucleic acid therapies have the potential to achieve long-lasting effects, or even cures, by inhibiting or editing genes, which is not possible with conventional small-molecule drugs. However, challenges and limitations must be addressed before these therapies can provide cures for chronic conditions and rare diseases, rather than only offering temporary relief. Nucleic acids and proteins face premature degradation in the acidic, enzyme-rich stomach environment and are rapidly cleared by the liver. To overcome these challenges, various delivery vehicles have been developed to transport therapeutic compounds to the intestines, where the active compounds are released and gut microbiota and mucosal immune system also play an important role. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the promises and pitfalls associated with the oral route of administration of biologics, current delivery systems, applications of orally delivered therapeutics, and the challenges and considerations for translation of nucleic acid and protein therapeutics into clinical practice.},

Doing so ethically and at scale─creating meter-scale tissue constructs from sustainable muscle progenitor cell lines─has inspired innovations in biomaterials and tissue culture methodology.

However, their commercialization is hindered by low efficiency, reliance on rare and expensive Te, and limited stability under operating conditions.

First, we discuss diverse innovative techniques aimed at substantially enhancing electrical transport properties. These methods encompass strategies such as charge carrier engineering, band convergence, band inversion, valley anisotropy, multiband synglisis, and the incorporation of resonant levels or midgap states. Then we focus on strategies to reduce lattice thermal conductivity, including phonon scattering induced by multidimensional defects, off-center doping, resonance scattering, and lattice softening. Additionally, this review presents strategies for decoupling electron and phonon transport to enhance the thermoelectric performance of materials further. The strategies include interface engineering, crystal symmetry manipulation, high-entropy engineering and nanostructuring, high-pressure technology, and magnetically enhanced thermoelectrics. Moreover, we highlight novel strategies for improving the chemical and thermal stability of materials under operating conditions. Last, we discuss current controversies and challenges and suggest future directions for further research to improve the thermoelectric performance of Te-free bulk materials.},

Strategies employing polarizable force fields also facilitate field detection. The vibrational Stark effect connects computational simulations to experimental Stark spectroscopy, enabling direct comparisons. We highlight how protein dynamics induce fluctuations in local fields, influencing enzyme activity. Recent techniques assess electric fields throughout the active site volume rather than only at specific bonds, and machine learning helps relate these global fields to reactivity. Quantum theory of atoms in molecules captures the entire electron density landscape, providing a chemically intuitive perspective on field-driven catalysis. Overall, these methodologies show protein-generated fields are highly dynamic and heterogeneous, and understanding both aspects is critical for elucidating enzyme mechanisms.

However, the challenge lies in finding a ductile solid electrolyte that can simultaneously serve as catholyte, bulk electrolyte, and anolyte. Fortunately, due to the immobility of solid electrolytes, combining multiple types of solid electrolytes allows for leveraging their respective advantages. In this review, we discuss five types of solid electrolytes, sulfides, halides, nitrides, antiperovskite-type, and complex hydrides, and the challenges and superiorities for these electrolytes are also addressed. The impact of pressure on ASSBs has been systematically discussed. Furthermore, the suitability of electrolytes as the catholyte, bulk electrolyte, and anolyte is discussed based on their functional characteristics and physicochemical properties.

  abstract     = {This review focuses on the sintering of liquid metal particles (LMPs). Here, sintering means the partial merging or connecting of particles (or droplets) to form a network of percolated and, thus, conductive electrical pathways. LMPs are attractive materials because they can be suspended in a carrier fluid to create printable inks or distributed in an elastomer to create soft, stretchable composites. However, films and traces of LMPs are not typically conductive as fabricated due to the native oxide that forms on the surface of the particles. In the case of composites, polymers can also get between particles, making sintering more challenging. Sintering can be done via a variety of ways, such as mechanical, thermal, and chemical processing. This review discusses the mechanisms to sinter these particles, patterning techniques that use sintering, unique properties of sintered LMPs, and their practical applications in fields such as stretchable electronics, soft robotics, and active materials.},

  abstract     = {Constructing chemical bonds under green sustainable conditions has drawn attention from environmental and economic perspectives. The dissociation of (hetero)aryl–halide bonds is a crucial step of most arylations affording (hetero)arene derivatives. Herein, we summarize the (hetero)aryl halides activation enabling the direct (hetero)arylation of trapping reagents and construction of highly functionalized (hetero)arenes under benign conditions. The strategies for the activation of aryl iodides are classified into (a) hypervalent iodoarene activation followed by functionalization under thermal/photochemical conditions, (b) aryl–I bond dissociation in the presence of bases with/without organic catalysts and promoters, (c) photoinduced aryl–I bond dissociation in the presence/absence of organophotocatalysts, (d) electrochemical activation of aryl iodides by direct/indirect electrolysis mediated by organocatalysts and mediators acting as electron shuttles, and (e) electrophotochemical activation of aryl iodides mediated by redox-active organocatalysts. These activation modes result in aryl iodides exhibiting diverse reactivity as formal aryl cations/radicals/anions and aryne precursors. The coupling of these reactive intermediates with trapping reagents leads to the facile and selective formation of C–C and C–heteroatom bonds. These ecofriendly, inexpensive, and functional group-tolerant activation strategies offer green alternatives to transition metal-based catalysis.},

  abstract     = {Solvent co-intercalation is a process in which ions and solvents jointly intercalate into a layered electrode material during battery charging/discharging. It typically leads to rapid electrode degradation, but new findings show that it can be highly reversible, lasting several thousand cycles. Solvent co-intercalation has two important characteristics: (1) the charge transfer resistance is minimized as stripping of the solvation shell is eliminated and (2) the fact that solvents become part of the electrode reaction provides another means of designing electrode materials. The concept of solvent co-intercalation is chemically very diverse, as a single electrode material can host different types and numbers of solvents and ions. It is likely that many undiscovered combinations of electrode materials, solvents, and ions capable of solvent co-intercalation reactions exist, offering a largely unexplored chemical space for new materials. Co-intercalation can expand the crystal lattice (>1 nm) to the extent that free solvents are present in the structure, forming a layered, “porous” material. This indicates that the concept has a much broader impact and relates to other research fields such as supercapacitors, layered nanostructures, and nanocatalysis. This Review covers the concept and current understanding of solvent co-intercalation reactions, characterization methods, advantages, limitations, and future research directions.},

The influence of the applied potential on reactivity has developed from the first-order predictions based on the Nernst equation to the implicit inclusion of second-order effects including the interaction of reacting species with the interfacial electric field. In this review, we explore these non-Nernstian field effects in electrocatalysis, aiming to both understand and exploit them through theory and computation. We summarize the critical distinction between Nernstian and non-Nernstian effects and outline strategies to address the latter in theoretical studies. Subsequently, we examine the specific energetic contributions of the latter on capacitive and faradaic processes separately. We also underscore the importance of considering non-Nernstian effects in catalyst screening and mechanistic analysis. Finally, we provide suggestions on how to experimentally unravel these effects, offering insights into practical approaches for advancing the field.},

Consequently, the synthesis of these compounds has constituted a significant research topic, as evidenced by the abundant published synthetic methods.

Enzymes make extensive use of ionic interactions alongside a variety of other noncovalent interactions; recent years have seen synthetic chemists begin to seriously explore these interactions in catalyst designs that also incorporate a reactive transition metal. In isolation, a single ionic interaction exhibits low directionality, but in many successful systems they exist alongside additional interactions which can provide a high degree of organization at the selectivity-determining transition state. Even in situations with a single key interaction, low directionality is not always detrimental, and can even be advantageous, conferring generality to a single catalyst. This Review explores design approaches that utilize ionic interactions to control selectivity in transition metal catalysis. It is divided into two halves: in the first, the ionic interaction occurs in the outer sphere of the metal complex, using a ligand which is charged or bound to an anion; in the second, the metal bears a formal charge, and the ionic interaction is with an associated counterion.},

Our silver anniversary review focuses on the structures and reactions of all well characterized corrole-chelated d- and p-block metal complexes, including discussions of their electronic excited-state physics and chemistry. Emphasis is placed on electronic structure of the trinegative N4 coordination core, which stabilizes high-valent metals and activates low-valent ones, and, importantly, profoundly influences ground- and excited-state reactivity. Our story highlights the unique properties of corroles that have made them the molecular components of choice in a plethora of applications. These include their utility for sensing gases and anions, rescue of vital biomolecules from oxidative damage, destruction of cancerous cells, and catalysis of reactions critical for organic synthesis, as well as those involved in clean energy processes such as production of hydrogen and reduction of oxygen.

  abstract     = {The electrocatalytic technique, as an efficient energy storage and conversion technology, has attracted significant attention to address energy exhaustion and environmental pollution. Usually, the activity and selectivity of electrocatalytic reactions are largely dominated by the dynamic process occurring on electrocatalysts. Therefore, high-performance electrocatalysts, which can dominate the pathway and energy barrier of reactions, are of great significance for the advancement of the electrocatalytic technique. Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs), as emerging crystalline porous materials, present structural and component advantages including well-defined structure, high surface area, large porosity, diverse components, and easy tailorability, demonstrating fantastic potential for the precise fabrication of electrocatalysts. In this Review, the emerging strategies in the precise fabrication of electrocatalysts based on MOF-related materials are specifically introduced from the aspects of catalytic site design and microenvironment modulation around catalytic sites. Furthermore, representative progress achieved in various electrocatalytic applications employing MOF-based electrocatalysts is systematically summarized, with special emphasis on the structural design of MOFs for catalytic performance optimization. Finally, the remaining challenges and future perspectives of MOF-based electrocatalysts are further highlighted.},

  abstract     = {Neuromorphic electronics are inspired by the human brain’s compact, energy-efficient nature and its parallel-processing capabilities. Beyond the brain, the entire human nervous system, with its hierarchical structure, efficiently preprocesses complex sensory information to support high-level neural functions such as perception and memory. Emulating these biological processes, artificial nerve electronics have been developed to replicate the energy-efficient preprocessing observed in human nerves. These systems integrate sensors, artificial neurons, artificial synapses, and actuators to mimic sensory and motor functions, surpassing conventional circuits in sensor-integrated electronics. Organic synaptic transistors (OSTs) are key components in constructing artificial nerves, offering tunable synaptic plasticity for complex sensory processing and the mechanical flexibility required for applications in soft robotics and bioelectronics. Compared to traditional sensor-integrated electronics, early implementations of organic artificial nerves (OANs) incorporating OSTs have demonstrated a higher signal-to-noise ratio, lower power consumption, and simpler circuit designs along with on-device processing capabilities and precise control of actuators and biological limbs, driving progress in neuromorphic robotics and bioelectronics. This paper reviews the materials, device engineering, and system integration of the OAN design, highlights recent advancements in neuromorphic robotics and bioelectronics utilizing the OANs, and discusses current challenges and future research directions.},

We present different atomistic and mesoscopic methods as well as available theoretical formalisms to describe such a complex problem. Attention is given to the investigation of different molecular transport coefficients─including the self, collective and transport diffusivities─but also to the determination of free energy barriers and their role in overall adsorption/separation process rates. We further introduce other available approaches such as hierarchical simulations and upscaling strategies. This review focuses on simple fluids in prototypical nanoporous materials. While the phenomena covered here capture the main physical mechanisms in such systems, complex molecules will exhibit additional specific features. For the sake of clarity and brevity, we also omit multicomponent systems (e.g., fluid mixtures, electrolytes, etc.) and electrokinetic effects arising when charged systems are considered (ionic species, charged surfaces, etc.), both of which add to the complexity.},

Their rapid and redundant metabolism, dynamic movement, and many interactions with other biomolecules have justly earned lipids a reputation as a vexing class of molecules to understand. Further, as the cell’s hydrophobic metabolites, lipids assemble into supramolecular structures─most commonly bilayers, or membranes─from which they carry out myriad biological functions. Motivated by this daunting complexity, researchers across disciplines are bringing order to the seeming chaos of biological lipids and membranes. Here, we formalize these efforts as “synthetic lipid biology”. Inspired by the idea, central to synthetic biology, that our abilities to understand and build biological systems are intimately connected, we organize studies and approaches across numerous fields to create, manipulate, and analyze lipids and biomembranes. These include construction of lipids and membranes from scratch using chemical and chemoenzymatic synthesis, editing of pre-existing membranes using optogenetics and protein engineering, detection of lipid metabolism and transport using bioorthogonal chemistry, and probing of lipid–protein interactions and membrane biophysical properties. What emerges is a portrait of an incipient field where chemists, biologists, physicists, and engineers work together in proximity─like lipids themselves─to build a clearer description of the properties, behaviors, and functions of lipids and membranes.},

Recent advances in synthetic methods, characterization technologies, and reaction kinetics studies have provided atomic-scale insights into these critical interfaces. Achieving atomic precision in interfacial engineering allows for the manipulation of electronic profiles, adsorption patterns, and surface motifs, deepening our understanding of reaction mechanisms at the atomic or molecular level.

Optimization of SOFC systems at the system/stack/cell/electrode scale via experimentation is expensive and challenging, whereas numerical modeling can be fast and cost-effective. Although many excellent reviews on SOFCs have been published, the previous articles lack practical problem-oriented literature classification and do not cover new emerging models, such as artificial intelligence (AI) assisted models, heterogeneous models, and so on. These models are important for accelerating the solution of large-scale multiphysics models and describing mesoscopic electrode behaviors. In this review, a top-down approach is adopted that can truly guide SOFC system/stack/cell/electrode design to meet targeted applications. Another distinct feature of this review is the inclusion of the latest developments in SOFC modeling. This review offers a thorough summary and in-depth analysis of an extensive collection of research on SOFC simulations, classifying the models into distinct categories based on their varying scales, and serves as a valuable tool to assist researchers in selecting the most suitable models for diverse research objects.},

A key limitation to the broad application of TPD is its dependence on small-molecule ligands to target proteins of interest. This leaves unstructured proteins or those lacking defined cavities for small-molecule binding out of the scope of many TPD technologies. The use of proteins, peptides, and nucleic acids (otherwise known as “biologics”) as the protein-targeting moieties in degraders addresses this limitation. In the following sections, we provide a comprehensive and critical review of studies that have used proteins and peptides to mediate the degradation and hence the functional control of otherwise challenging disease-relevant protein targets. We describe existing platforms for protein/peptide-based ligand identification and the drug delivery systems that might be exploited for the delivery of biologic-based degraders.

  abstract     = {Non-von Neumann computing using neuromorphic systems based on analogue synaptic and neuronal elements has emerged as a potential solution to tackle the growing need for more efficient data processing, but progress toward practical systems has been stymied due to a lack of materials and devices with the appropriate attributes. Recently, solid state electrochemical ion-insertion, also known as electrochemical random access memory (ECRAM) has emerged as a promising approach to realize the needed device characteristics. ECRAM is a three terminal device that operates by tuning electronic conductance in functional materials through solid-state electrochemical redox reactions. This mechanism can be considered as a gate-controlled bulk modulation of dopants and/or phases in the channel. Early work demonstrating that ECRAM can achieve nearly ideal analogue synaptic characteristics has sparked tremendous interest in this approach. More recently, the realization that electrochemical ion insertion can be used to tune the electronic properties of many types of materials including transition metal oxides, layered two-dimensional materials, organic and coordination polymers, and that the changes in conductance can span orders of magnitude has further attracted interest in ECRAM as the basis for analogue synaptic elements for inference accelerators as well as for dynamical devices that can emulate a wide range of neuronal characteristics for implementation in analogue spiking neural networks. At its core, ECRAM shares many fundamental aspects with rechargeable batteries, where ion insertion materials are used extensively for their ability to reversibly store charge and energy. Computing applications, however, present drastically different requirements: systems will require many millions of devices, scaled down to tens of nanometers, all while achieving reliable electronic-state tuning at scaled-up rates and endurances, and with minimal energy dissipation and noise. In this review, we discuss the history, basic concepts, recent progress, as well as the challenges and opportunities for different types of ECRAM, broadly grouped by their primary mobile ionic charge carrier, including Li, protons, and oxygen vacancies.},

  abstract     = {Ferroptosis, an iron-dependent form of regulatory cell death, has garnered significant interest as a therapeutic target in cancer treatment due to its distinct characteristics, including lipid peroxide generation and redox imbalance. However, its clinical application in oncology is currently limited by issues such as suboptimal efficacy and potential off-target effects. The advent of nanotechnology has provided a new way for overcoming these challenges through the development of activatable magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs). These innovative MNPs are designed to improve the specificity and efficacy of ferroptosis induction. This Review delves into the chemical and biological principles guiding the design of MNPs for ferroptosis-based cancer therapies and imaging-guided therapies. It discusses the regulatory mechanisms and biological attributes of ferroptosis, the chemical composition of MNPs, their mechanism of action as ferroptosis inducers, and their integration with advanced imaging techniques for therapeutic monitoring. Additionally, we examine the convergence of ferroptosis with other therapeutic strategies, including chemodynamic therapy, photothermal therapy, photodynamic therapy, sonodynamic therapy, and immunotherapy, within the context of nanomedicine strategies utilizing MNPs. This Review highlights the potential of these multifunctional MNPs to surpass the limitations of conventional treatments, envisioning a future of drug-resistance-free, precision diagnostics and ferroptosis-based therapies for treating recalcitrant cancers.},

We provide a comprehensive review on in situ TEM studies of battery materials for lithium batteries and beyond (e.g., sodium batteries and other battery chemistries) via open-cell and closed-cell in situ TEM approaches.

This review aims to summarize the whole history of synthetic and biosynthetic studies of fungal BCDO indole alkaloids, by covering the discovery, biomimetic syntheses, total syntheses, biosynthetic pathway elucidation, and biological activities of representative compounds.

  abstract     = {Conditional control of protein activity is important in order to elucidate the particular functions and interactions of proteins, their regulators, and their substrates, as well as their impact on the behavior of a cell or organism. Optical control provides a perhaps optimal means of introducing spatiotemporal control over protein function as it allows for tunable, rapid, and noninvasive activation of protein activity in its native environment. One method of introducing optical control over protein activity is through the introduction of photocaged and photoswitchable noncanonical amino acids (ncAAs) through genetic code expansion in cells and animals. Genetic incorporation of photoactive ncAAs at key residues in a protein provides a tool for optical activation, or sometimes deactivation, of protein activity. Importantly, the incorporation site can typically be rationally selected based on structural, mechanistic, or computational information. In this review, we comprehensively summarize the applications of photocaged lysine, tyrosine, cysteine, serine, histidine, glutamate, and aspartate derivatives, as well as photoswitchable phenylalanine analogues. The extensive and diverse list of proteins that have been placed under optical control demonstrates the broad applicability of this methodology.},

Therefore, the wide-ranging chemistry of confined water can provide tremendous opportunities to tune the reaction kinetics. In this review, we focus on drawing the connection between confined water properties and reaction kinetics for heterogeneous (electro)catalysis. First, the properties of confined water are presented, where the enthalpy, entropy, and dielectric properties of water can be regulated by tuning the geometry and hydrophobicity of the cavities. Second, experimental and computational studies that investigate the interactions between water and inorganic materials, such as carbon nanotubes (1D confinement), charged metal or metal oxide surfaces (2D), zeolites and metal–organic frameworks (3D) and ions/solvent molecules (0D), are reviewed to demonstrate the opportunity to create confined water structures with unique H-bonding network properties. Third, the role of H-bonding structure and dynamics in governing the activation free energy, reorganization energy and pre-exponential factor for (electro)catalysis are discussed. We highlight emerging opportunities to enhance proton-coupled electron transfer by optimizing interfacial H-bond networks to regulate reaction kinetics for the decarbonization of chemicals and fuels.},

Practical devices introduce high levels of complexity where surface roughness, structure, composition, and morphology combine with electrolyte, pH, diffusion, and system level limitations to challenge our ability to deconvolute underlying phenomena. To make significant strides in materials design, a structured approach based on well-defined surfaces is necessary to selectively control distinct parameters, while complexity is added sequentially through careful application of nanostructured surfaces. In this review, we cover advances made through this approach for key elements in the field, beginning with the simplest hydrogen oxidation and evolution reactions and concluding with more complex organic molecules.

  abstract     = {Hydrogen produced with no greenhouse gas emissions is termed “green hydrogen” and will be essential to reaching decarbonization targets set forth by nearly every country as per the Paris Agreement. Proton exchange membrane water electrolyzers (PEMWEs) are expected to contribute substantially to the green hydrogen market. However, PEMWE market penetration is insignificant, accounting for less than a gigawatt of global capacity. Achieving substantive decarbonization via green hydrogen will require PEMWEs to reach capacities of hundreds of gigawatts by 2030. This paper serves as an overarching roadmap for cell-level improvements necessary for gigawatt-scale PEMWE deployment, with insights from three well-established hydrogen technology companies included. Analyses will be presented for economies of scale, renewable energy prices, government policies, accelerated stress tests, and component-specific improvements.},

  abstract     = {The term “undruggable” refers to proteins or other biological targets that have been historically challenging to target with conventional drugs or therapeutic strategies because of their structural, functional, or dynamic properties. Drugging such undruggable targets is essential to develop new therapies for diseases where current treatment options are limited or nonexistent. Thus, investigating methods to achieve such drugging is an important challenge in medicinal chemistry. Among the numerous methodologies for drug discovery, covalent modification of therapeutic targets has emerged as a transformative strategy. The covalent attachment of diverse functional molecules to targets provides a powerful platform for creating highly potent drugs and chemical tools as well the ability to provide valuable information on the structures and dynamics of undruggable targets. In this review, we summarize recent examples of chemical methods for the covalent modification of proteins and other biomolecules for the development of new therapeutics and to overcome drug discovery challenges and highlight how such methods contribute toward the drugging of undruggable targets. In particular, we focus on the use of covalent chemistry methods for the development of covalent drugs, target identification, drug screening, artificial modulation of post-translational modifications, cancer specific chemotherapies, and nucleic acid-based therapeutics.},

Many carbene transfer reactions of N -sulfonyl hydrazones are unique and cannot be achieved by any alternative methods. The discovery of novel N -sulfonyl hydrazones and the development of highly enantioselective new reactions and skeletal editing reactions represent the notable recent achievements in the carbene chemistry of N -sulfonyl hydrazones. This review describes the overall progress made in the carbene chemistry of N -sulfonyl hydrazones, organized based on reaction types, spotlighting the current state-of-the-art and remaining challenges to be addressed in the future.

  abstract     = {Core–shell magnetic particles consisting of magnetic core and functional shells have aroused widespread attention in multidisciplinary fields spanning chemistry, materials science, physics, biomedicine, and bioengineering due to their distinctive magnetic properties, tunable interface features, and elaborately designed compositions. In recent decades, various surface engineering strategies have been developed to endow them desired properties (e.g., surface hydrophilicity, roughness, acidity, target recognition) for efficient applications in catalysis, optical modulation, environmental remediation, biomedicine, etc. Moreover, precise control over the shell structure features like thickness, porosity, crystallinity and compositions including metal oxides, carbon, silica, polymers, and metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) has been developed as the major method to exploit new functional materials. In this review, we highlight the synthesis methods, regulating strategies, interface engineering, and applications of core–shell magnetic particles over the past half-century. The fundamental methodologies for controllable synthesis of core–shell magnetic materials with diverse organic, inorganic, or hybrid compositions, surface morphology, and interface property are thoroughly elucidated and summarized. In addition, the influences of the synthesis conditions on the physicochemical properties (e.g., dispersibility, stability, stimulus-responsiveness, and surface functionality) are also discussed to provide constructive insight and guidelines for designing core–shell magnetic particles in specific applications. The brand-new concept of “core–shell assembly chemistry” holds great application potential in bioimaging, diagnosis, micro/nanorobots, and smart catalysis. Finally, the remaining challenges, future research directions and new applications for the core–shell magnetic particles are predicted and proposed.},

Fighting multidrug-resistant bacteria requires precise diagnosis of bacterial pathogens and specific cell-killing. Phages have several potential advantages over conventional antibacterial agents such as host specificity, self-amplification, easy production, low toxicity as well as biofilm degradation. However, the narrow host range, uncharacterized properties, as well as potential risks from exponential replication and evolution of natural phages, currently limit their applications. Engineering phages can not only enhance the host bacteria range and improve phage efficacy, but also confer new functions. This review first summarizes major phage engineering techniques including both chemical modification and genetic engineering. Subsequent sections discuss the applications of engineered phages for bacterial pathogen detection and ablation through interdisciplinary approaches of synthetic biology and nanotechnology. We discuss future directions and persistent challenges in the ongoing exploration of phage engineering for pathogen control.},

Furthermore, 2D materials achieve biorealistic synaptic and neuronal responses that extend beyond conventional logic and memory systems. Here, we provide a comprehensive review of the growth, fabrication, and integration of 2D materials and van der Waals heterojunctions for neuromorphic electronic and optoelectronic devices, circuits, and systems. For each case, the relationship between physical properties and device responses is emphasized followed by a critical comparison of technologies for different applications.

The key has been developments in ab initio theory, deep learning, molecular dynamics, high-throughput computations, and multiscale methods.

This calls for the development of novel computing units beyond transistors.

Ion-based memristive devices (IMDs), owing to the intrinsic functional similarities to their biological counterparts, hold significant promise for implementing emerging neuromorphic learning and computing algorithms. In this article, we review the fundamental mechanisms of IMDs based on ion drift and diffusion to elucidate the origins of their diverse dynamics. We then examine how these mechanisms operate within different materials to enable IMDs with various types of switching behaviors, leading to a wide range of applications, from emulating biological components to realizing specialized computing requirements. Furthermore, we explore the potential for IMDs to be modified and tuned to achieve customized dynamics, which positions them as one of the most promising hardware candidates for executing bioinspired algorithms with unique specifications. Finally, we identify the challenges currently facing IMDs that hinder their widespread usage and highlight emerging research directions that could significantly benefit from incorporating IMDs.},

  abstract     = {Complex multicellular organisms are composed of distinct tissues involving specialized cells that can perform specific functions, making such life forms possible. Species are defined by their genomes, and differences between individuals within a given species directly result from variations in their genetic codes. While genetic alterations can give rise to disease-causing acquisitions of distinct cell identities, it is now well-established that biochemical imbalances within a cell can also lead to cellular dysfunction and diseases. Specifically, nongenetic chemical events orchestrate cell metabolism and transcriptional programs that govern functional cell identity. Thus, imbalances in cell signaling, which broadly defines the conversion of extracellular signals into intracellular biochemical changes, can also contribute to the acquisition of diseased cell states. Metal ions exhibit unique chemical properties that can be exploited by the cell. For instance, metal ions maintain the ionic balance within the cell, coordinate amino acid residues or nucleobases altering folding and function of biomolecules, or directly catalyze specific chemical reactions. Thus, metals are essential cell signaling effectors in normal physiology and disease. Deciphering metal ion signaling is a challenging endeavor that can illuminate pathways to be targeted for therapeutic intervention. Here, we review key cellular processes where metal ions play essential roles and describe how targeting metal ion signaling pathways has been instrumental to dissecting the biochemistry of the cell and how this has led to the development of effective therapeutic strategies.},

Here, this review provides a comprehensive overview of the latest advancements in the chemical synthesis, structural characterization, and numerous applications of 2DOI-vdWhs. Firstly, we introduce the chemistry and the physical properties of the recently rising organic 2D crystals (O2DCs), which feature crystalline 2D nanostructures comprising carbon-rich repeated units linked by covalent/noncovalent bonds and exhibit strong in-plane extended π-conjugation and weak interlayer vdWs interaction. Simultaneously, representative inorganic 2D crystals (I2DCs) are briefly summarized. After that, the synthetic strategies will be systematically summarized, including synthesizing single-component O2DCs with dimensional control and their vdWhs with I2DCs. With these synthetic approaches, the control in the dimension, the stacking modes, and the composition of the 2DOI-vdWhs will be highlighted. Subsequently, a special focus will be given on the discussion of the optical and electronic properties of the single-component 2D materials and their vdWhs, which will be closely relevant to their structures, so that we can establish a general structure–property relationship of 2DOI-vdWhs. In addition to these physical properties, the (opto-)electronic devices such as transistors, photodetectors, sensors, spintronics, and neuromorphic devices as well as energy devices will be discussed. Finally, we provide an outlook to discuss the key challenges for the 2DOI-vdWhs and their future development. This review aims to provide a foundational understanding and inspire further innovation in the development of next-generation 2DOI-vdWhs with transformative technological potential.},

  abstract     = {Electrochemical batteries play a crucial role for powering portable electronics, electric vehicles, large-scale electric grids, and future electric aircraft. However, key performance metrics such as energy density, charging speed, lifespan, and safety raise significant consumer concerns. Enhancing battery performance hinges on a deep understanding of their operational and degradation mechanisms, from material composition and electrode structure to large-scale pack integration, necessitating advanced characterization methods. These methods not only enable improved battery performance but also facilitate early detection of substandard or potentially hazardous batteries before they cause serious incidents. This review comprehensively examines the operational principles, applications, challenges, and prospects of cutting-edge characterization techniques for commercial batteries, with a specific focus on in situ and operando methodologies. Furthermore, it explores how these powerful tools have elucidated the operational and degradation mechanisms of commercial batteries. By bridging the gap between advanced characterization techniques and commercial battery technologies, this review aims to guide the design of more sophisticated experiments and models for studying battery degradation and enhancement.},

  abstract     = {Since the early 2000s, the impending end of Moore’s scaling, as the physical limits to shrinking transistors have been approached, has fueled interest in improving the functionality and efficiency of integrated circuits by employing memristors or two-terminal resistive switches. Formation (or avoidance) of localized conducting channels in many memristors, often called “filaments”, has been established as the basis for their operation. While we understand some qualitative aspects of the physical and thermodynamic origins of conduction localization, there are not yet quantitative models that allow us to predict when they will form or how large they will be. Here we compile observations and explanations of channel formation that have appeared in the literature since the 1930s, show how many of these seemingly unrelated pieces fit together, and outline what is needed to complete the puzzle. This understanding will be a necessary predictive component for the design and fabrication of post-Moore’s-era electronics.},

  abstract     = {As a primary energy source, electricity drives broad fields from everyday electronic circuits to industrial chemical catalysis. From a chemistry viewpoint, studying electric field effects on chemical reactivity is highly important for revealing the intrinsic mechanisms of molecular behaviors and mastering chemical reactions. Recently, manipulating the molecular activity using electric fields has emerged as a new research field. In addition, because integration of molecules into electronic devices has the natural complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor compatibility, electric field-driven molecular devices meet the requirements for both electronic device miniaturization and precise regulation of chemical reactions. This Review provides a timely and comprehensive overview of recent state-of-the-art advances, including theoretical models and prototype devices for electric field-based manipulation of molecular activities. First, we summarize the main approaches to providing electric fields for molecules. Then, we introduce several methods to measure their strengths in different systems quantitatively. Subsequently, we provide detailed discussions of electric field-regulated photophysics, electron transport, molecular movements, and chemical reactions. This review intends to provide a technical manual for precise molecular control in devices via electric fields. This could lead to development of new optoelectronic functions, more efficient logic processing units, more precise bond-selective control, new catalytic paradigms, and new chemical reactions.},

  abstract     = {Human carbonic anhydrases (hCAs) are widespread zinc enzymes that catalyze the hydration of CO 2 to bicarbonate and a proton. Currently, 15 isoforms have been identified, of which only 12 are catalytically active. Given their involvement in numerous physiological and pathological processes, hCAs are recognized therapeutic targets for the development of inhibitors with biomedical applications. However, despite massive development efforts, very few of the presently available hCA inhibitors show selectivity for a specific isoform. X-ray crystallography is a very useful tool for the rational drug design of enzyme inhibitors. In 2012 we published in Chemical Reviews a highly cited review on hCA family ( Alterio, V. et al. Chem Rev. 2012 , 112 , 4421−4468), analyzing about 300 crystallographic structures of hCA/inhibitor complexes and describing the different CA inhibition mechanisms existing up to that date. However, in the period 2012–2023, almost 700 new hCA/inhibitor complex structures have been deposited in the PDB and a large number of new inhibitor classes have been discovered. Based on these considerations, the aim of this Review is to give a comprehensive update of the structural aspects of hCA/inhibitor interactions covering the period 2012–2023 and to recapitulate how this information can be used for the rational design of more selective versions of such inhibitors.},

  abstract     = {Cell-free gene expression (CFE) systems empower synthetic biologists to build biological molecules and processes outside of living intact cells. The foundational principle is that precise, complex biomolecular transformations can be conducted in purified enzyme or crude cell lysate systems. This concept circumvents mechanisms that have evolved to facilitate species survival, bypasses limitations on molecular transport across the cell wall, and provides a significant departure from traditional, cell-based processes that rely on microscopic cellular “reactors.” In addition, cell-free systems are inherently distributable through freeze-drying, which allows simple distribution before rehydration at the point-of-use. Furthermore, as cell-free systems are nonliving, they provide built-in safeguards for biocontainment without the constraints attendant on genetically modified organisms. These features have led to a significant increase in the development and use of CFE systems over the past two decades. Here, we discuss recent advances in CFE systems and highlight how they are transforming efforts to build cells, control genetic networks, and manufacture biobased products.},

  abstract     = {The octadecanoids are a broad class of lipids consisting of the oxygenated products of 18-carbon fatty acids. Originally referring to production of the phytohormone jasmonic acid, the octadecanoid pathway has been expanded to include products of all 18-carbon fatty acids. Octadecanoids are formed biosynthetically in mammals via cyclooxygenase (COX), lipoxygenase (LOX), and cytochrome P450 (CYP) activity, as well as nonenzymatically by photo- and autoxidation mechanisms. While octadecanoids are well-known mediators in plants, their role in the regulation of mammalian biological processes has been generally neglected. However, there have been significant advancements in recognizing the importance of these compounds in mammals and their involvement in the mediation of inflammation, nociception, and cell proliferation, as well as in immuno- and tissue modulation, coagulation processes, hormone regulation, and skin barrier formation. More recently, the gut microbiome has been shown to be a significant source of octadecanoid biosynthesis, providing additional biosynthetic routes including hydratase activity (e.g., CLA-HY, FA-HY1, FA-HY2). In this review, we summarize the current field of octadecanoids, propose standardized nomenclature, provide details of octadecanoid preparation and measurement, summarize the phase-I metabolic pathway of octadecanoid formation in mammals, bacteria, and fungi, and describe their biological activity in relation to mammalian pathophysiology as well as their potential use as biomarkers of health and disease.},
