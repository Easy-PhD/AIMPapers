Random discrete structures appear as fundamental objects of study in many scientific and mathematical fields including statistical physics, combinatorics, algorithms and complexity, social choice theory, coding theory, and statistics. While the models and properties of interest in these fields vary widely, much progress has been made through the development of general tools applicable to large families of models and properties all at once. Historically, these tools originated to solve or make progress on specific difficult conjectures in the areas mentioned above. We will survey recent progress on some of these hard problems and describe some challenges for the future.

This concrete problem motivates fundamental concepts such as moduli spaces and their properties, deformation theory, normal bundles, and more. Questions about smooth objects lead us to consider singular (nonsmooth) objects; and, in fact, these smooth objects are studied by instead focusing on somehow simpler “nonsmooth” objects and then deforming them.},

On the other hand it can be shown by a physical argument that this gives a curvature squared correction term to the gravitational action. This in paticular leads to an effective quantum gravity cutoff known as the species scale, which varies over moduli space of Calabi–Yau manifolds. This resolves some of the puzzles associated to the entropy of small black holes when there are a large number of light species of particles. Thus Ray–Singer torsion, via its connection to topological strings at genus one, provides a measure of light degrees of freedom of four dimensional $\mathcal {N}=2$ supergravity theories.},
