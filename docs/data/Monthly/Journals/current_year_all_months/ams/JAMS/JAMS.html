  abstract     = {We prove and extend the longest-standing conjecture in ‘$q,t$-Catalan combinatorics,’ namely, the combinatorial formula for $\nabla ^m s_{\mu }$ conjectured by Loehr and Warrington, where $s_{\mu }$ is a Schur function and $\nabla$ is an eigenoperator on Macdonald polynomials. Our approach is to establish a stronger identity of infinite series of $GL_l$ characters involving Schur Catalanimals ; these were recently shown by the authors to represent Schur functions $s_{\mu }[-MX^{m,n}]$ in subalgebras $\Lambda (X^{m,n})\subset \mathcal {E}$ isomorphic to the algebra of symmetric functions $\Lambda$ over $\mathbb {Q} (q,t)$, where $\mathcal {E}$ is the elliptic Hall algebra of Burban and Schiffmann. We establish a combinatorial formula for Schur Catalanimals as weighted sums of LLT polynomials, with terms indexed by configurations of nested lattice paths called nests , having endpoints and bounding constraints controlled by data called a den . The special case for $\Lambda (X^{m,1})$ proves the Loehr-Warrington conjecture, giving $\nabla ^m s_{\mu }$ as a weighted sum of LLT polynomials indexed by systems of nested Dyck paths. In general, for $\Lambda (X^{m,n})$ our formula implies a new $(m,n)$ version of the Loehr-Warrington conjecture. In the case where each nest consists of a single lattice path, the nests in a den formula reduce to our previous shuffle theorem for paths under any line. Both this and the $(m,n)$ Loehr-Warrington formula generalize the $(km,kn)$ shuffle theorem proven by Carlsson and Mellit (for $n=1$) and Mellit. Our formula here unifies these two generalizations.},

Specifically, we show Hecke functors are $t$-exact on the category of tempered $D$-modules, strengthening a classical result of Gaitsgory (with different hypotheses) for $GL_n$. We also show that Whittaker coefficient functors are $t$-exact for sheaves with nilpotent singular support. An additional consequence of our results is that the tempered, restricted geometric Langlands conjecture must be $t$-exact. We apply our results to show that for suitably irreducible local systems, Whittaker-normalized Hecke eigensheaves are perverse sheaves that are irreducible on each connected component of $\operatorname {Bun}_G$.},

Using this construction, we solve a number of open problems. We construct a counterexample to Eremenko’s conjecture , a central problem in transcendental dynamics that asks whether every connected component of the set of escaping points of a transcendental entire function is unbounded. We prove that there is a transcendental entire function for which infinitely many Fatou components share the same boundary. This resolves the long-standing problem whether Lakes of Wada continua can arise in complex dynamics, and answers the analogue of a question of Fatou from 1920 concerning Fatou components of rational functions. We answer a question of Rippon concerning the existence of non-escaping points on the boundary of a bounded escaping wandering domain, that is, a wandering Fatou component contained in the escaping set. In fact, we show that the set of such points can have positive Lebesgue measure. We give the first example of an entire function having a simply connected Fatou component whose closure has a disconnected complement, answering a question of Boc Thaler. In view of (3), we introduce the concept of maverick points : points on the boundary of a wandering domain whose accumulation behaviour differs from that of internal points. As noted in (3), the set of such points may have positive planar Lebesgue measure, so it may be rather large. On the other hand, we prove that this set has harmonic measure zero when viewed from the wandering domain.},

  abstract     = {In 1943, Hadwiger conjectured that every graph with no $K_t$ minor is $(t-1)$-colorable for every $t\ge 1$. In the 1980s, Kostochka and Thomason independently proved that every graph with no $K_t$ minor has average degree $O(t\sqrt {\log t})$ and hence is $O(t\sqrt {\log t})$-colorable. Recently, Norin, Song and the second author showed that every graph with no $K_t$ minor is $O(t(\log t)^{\beta })$-colorable for every $\beta > 1/4$, making the first improvement on the order of magnitude of the $O(t\sqrt {\log t})$ bound. The first main result of this paper is that every graph with no $K_t$ minor is $O(t\log \log t)$-colorable. This is actually a corollary of our main technical result that the chromatic number of a $K_t$-minor-free graph is bounded by $O(t(1+f(G,t)))$ where $f(G,t)$ is the maximum of $\frac {\chi (H)}{a}$ over all $a\ge \frac {t}{\sqrt {\log t}}$ and $K_a$-minor-free subgraphs $H$ of $G$ that are small (i.e. $O(a\log ^4 a)$ vertices). This has a number of interesting corollaries. First as mentioned, using the current best-known bounds on coloring small $K_t$-minor-free graphs, we show that $K_t$-minor-free graphs are $O(t\log \log t)$-colorable. Second, it shows that proving Linear Hadwiger’s Conjecture (that $K_t$-minor-free graphs are $O(t)$-colorable) reduces to proving it for small graphs. Third, we prove that $K_t$-minor-free graphs with clique number at most $\sqrt {\log t}/ (\log \log t)^2$ are $O(t)$-colorable. This implies our final corollary that Linear Hadwiger’s Conjecture holds for $K_r$-free graphs for every fixed $r$; more generally, we show there exists $C\ge 1$ such that for every $r\ge 1$, there exists $t_r$ such that for all $t\ge t_r$, every $K_r$-free $K_t$-minor-free graph is $Ct$-colorable. One key to proving the main theorem is building the minor in two new ways according to whether the chromatic number ‘separates’ in the graph: sequentially if the graph is the chromatic-inseparable and recursively if the graph is chromatic-separable. The other key is a new standalone result that every $K_t$-minor-free graph of average degree $d=\Omega (t)$ has a subgraph on $O(t \log ^3 t)$ vertices with average degree $\Omega (d)$.},

We do this by introducing a class of functions on the Turing degrees which we call “measure-preserving” and proving that part 1 of Martin’s Conjecture holds for all measure-preserving functions and also that all nontrivial order-preserving functions are measure-preserving. Our result on measure-preserving functions has several other consequences for Martin’s Conjecture, including an equivalence between part 1 of the conjecture and a statement about the structure of the Rudin-Keisler order on ultrafilters on the Turing degrees.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we construct Hölder maps to Carnot groups equipped with a Carnot metric, especially the first Heisenberg group $\mathbb {H}$. Pansu and Gromov [ Carnot-Carathéodory spaces seen from within , Birkhäuser, Basel, 1996] observed that any surface embedded in $\mathbb {H}$ has Hausdorff dimension at least $3$, so there is no $\alpha$-Hölder embedding of a surface into $\mathbb {H}$ when $\alpha >\frac {2}{3}$. Züst [Anal. Geom. Metr. Spaces 3 (2015), pp. 73–92] improved this result to show that when $\alpha >\frac {2}{3}$, any $\alpha$-Hölder map from a simply-connected Riemannian manifold to $\mathbb {H}$ factors through a metric tree. In the present paper, we show that Züst’s result is sharp by constructing $(\frac {2}{3}-\epsilon )$-Hölder maps from $D^2$ and $D^3$ to $\mathbb {H}$ that do not factor through a tree. We use these to show that if $0<\alpha < \frac {2}{3}$, then the set of $\alpha$-Hölder maps from a compact metric space to $\mathbb {H}$ is dense in the set of continuous maps and to construct proper degree-1 maps from $\mathbb {R}^3$ to $\mathbb {H}$ with Hölder exponents arbitrarily close to $\frac {2}{3}$.},

  abstract     = {We formulate and prove a Conner–Floyd isomorphism for the algebraic K-theory of arbitrary qcqs derived schemes. To that end, we study a stable $\infty$-category of non-$\mathbb {A}^1$-invariant motivic spectra, which turns out to be equivalent to the $\infty$-category of fundamental motivic spectra satisfying elementary blowup excision, previously introduced by the first and third authors. We prove that this $\infty$-category satisfies $\mathbb {P}^1$-homotopy invariance and weighted $\mathbb {A}^1$-homotopy invariance, which we use in place of $\mathbb {A}^1$-homotopy invariance to obtain analogues of several key results from $\mathbb {A}^1$-homotopy theory. These allow us in particular to define a universal oriented motivic $\mathbb {E}_\infty$-ring spectrum $\mathrm {MGL}$. We then prove that the algebraic K-theory of a qcqs derived scheme $X$ can be recovered from its $\mathrm {MGL}$-cohomology via a Conner–Floyd isomorphism \[ \mathrm {MGL}^{**}(X)\otimes _{\mathrm {L}{}}\mathbb {Z}[\beta ^{\pm 1}]\simeq \mathrm {K}{}^{**}(X), \] where $\mathrm {L}{}$ is the Lazard ring and $\mathrm {K}{}^{p,q}(X)=\mathrm {K}{}_{2q-p}(X)$. Finally, we prove a Snaith theorem for the periodized version of $\mathrm {MGL}$.},

  abstract     = {The infinite spin problem is an old problem concerning the rotational behavior of total collision orbits in the n -body problem. It has long been known that when a solution tends to total collision then its normalized configuration curve must converge to the set of normalized central configurations. In the planar n-body problem every normalized configuration determines a circle of rotationally equivalent normalized configurations and, in particular, there are circles of normalized central configurations. It’s conceivable that by means of an infinite spin , a total collision solution could converge to such a circle instead of to a particular point on it. Here we prove that this is not possible, at least if the limiting circle of central configurations is isolated from other circles of central configurations. (It is believed that all central configurations are isolated, but this is not known in general.) Our proof relies on combining the center manifold theorem with the Łojasiewicz gradient inequality.},

  abstract     = {Let $f$ be a dominant endomorphism of a smooth projective surface $X$ over an algebraically closed field $\mathbf {k}$ of characteristic $0$. We prove that if there is no rational function $H \in \mathbf {k}(X)$ such that $H \circ f = H$, then there exists a point $x \in X(\mathbf {k})$ such that the forward orbit of $x$ under $f$ is Zariski dense in $X$. This result gives us a positive answer to the Zariski dense orbit conjecture for endomorphisms of smooth projective surfaces. We also define a new topology on varieties over algebraically closed fields with finite transcendence degree over $\mathbb {Q}$, which we call “the adelic topology”. This topology is stronger than the Zariski topology, and an irreducible variety is still irreducible in this topology. Using the adelic topology, we propose an adelic version of the Zariski dense orbit conjecture that is stronger than the original one and quantifies how many such orbits there are. We also prove this adelic version for endomorphisms of smooth projective surfaces, for endomorphisms of abelian varieties, and for split polynomial maps. This yields new proofs of the original conjecture in the latter two cases. In Appendix A, we study endomorphisms of $k$-affinoid spaces. We show that for certain endomorphisms $f$ on a $k$-affinoid space $X$, the attractor $Y$ of $f$ is a Zariski closed subset and that the dynamics of $f$ is semi-conjugate to its restriction to $Y$. A special case of this result is used in the proof of the main theorem. In Appendix B, written in collaboration with Thomas Tucker, we prove the Zariski dense orbit conjecture for endomorphisms of $(\mathbb {P}^1)^N$.},
