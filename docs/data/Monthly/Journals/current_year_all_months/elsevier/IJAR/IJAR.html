  abstract     = {In pattern recognition with few or no labeled data, domain adaptation techniques are often used to transfer knowledge in the source domain to help build classification models in the target domain. The effective combination of complementary information in multiple source domains usually can further improve the classification accuracy. To this end, we present a Robust Multi-Source Transfer (RMST) classification method consisting of two-step fusion of classifiers to extract the useful information in each source domain as much as possible, and to effectively combine the complementary information using belief functions in different source domains. The first step is to accurately predict the pseudo labels when computing conditional distribution, in order to learn a robust new feature representation, which is used to fuse diverse classifiers learnt by patterns for reliable soft classification in the second step of our algorithm. Furthermore, the soft classification results yielded by the assistance of different source domains are combined by belief functions with the new weighting factors taking into account the distribution discrepancy and classifier’s performance. The effectiveness of RMST was evaluated with respect to a variety of advanced methods, and the experimental results show that RMST can significantly improve the classification accuracy.},

  abstract     = {We explore how the classical concordance measures–Kendall’s τ , Spearman’s rank correlation ρ , and Spearman’s footrule ϕ –relate to Chatterjee’s rank correlation ξ when restricted to lower semilinear copulas. First, we provide a complete characterization of the attainable τ − ρ region for this class, thus resolving the conjecture of Maislinger and Trutschnig [1]. Building on this result, we then derive the exact τ − ϕ and ϕ − ρ regions, obtain a closed-form relationship between ξ and τ , and establish the exact τ − ξ region. In particular, we prove that ξ never exceeds τ , ρ , or ϕ . Our results clarify the relationship between undirected and directed dependence measures and reveal novel insights into the dependence structures that result from lower semilinear copulas.},

  abstract     = {In Multiple Criteria Decision Aid (MCDA), preference disaggregation is used to derive aggregation functions that replicate the preference information provided by decision makers (DMs). A key research challenge is identifying the most representative aggregation function that aligns with the DMs’ behavioral preferences from all feasible functions. In the context of group decisions and negotiations, preference disaggregation faces two main barriers: Selecting representative aggregation functions and reducing the cognitive effort required from DMs. In this paper, we extend preference disaggregation to group decision-making by enabling DMs to increase the diversity of their decision matrices, and establish several representative aggregation function selection models that account for group behavioral preferences. Given the cognitive limitations of DMs, their preferences are often expressed as confidence levels, which inherently involve uncertainty. Therefore, we expand the scope of preference information required for preference disaggregation from deterministic preferences to uncertain preferences. By applying probability theory–specifically, chance constraints–we transform DMs’ uncertain preferences into constraints for selecting representative aggregation functions that align with their behavioral preferences. Notably, when the confidence level approaches 100 %, the uncertain preferences converge to their deterministic counterparts, demonstrating the extensiveness and inclusiveness of uncertain preference information. Finally, we illustrate the practical feasibility of our approach through a case study on the evaluation of medical pension institutions.},

  abstract     = {Covering-based rough sets (CBRS) offer a flexible extension of classical rough set theory, making them well-suited for analyzing diverse types of complex and possibly inconsistent data. A requirement for the effective use of CBRS is the availability of high-quality coverings of the dataset. A promising approach for generating such coverings is the Mapper algorithm, which builds on the underlying topological structure of the data. However, Mapper's performance depends heavily on the choice of its parameters. In this paper, we study how the structure of the parameter space is transferred to the structure of the coverings generated by these parameters, focusing on the weak and strong approximation operators. We prove important monotonicity results that give insights into the inner workings of the Mapper algorithm and how it can generate coverings. We give an overview of how each parameter influences the output covering and illustrate this using real-world datasets.},

Building on this foundation, Zhao and Liu extended this concept to the context of directionally monotone functions. In this paper, we propose a novel class of cone-monotone functions, referred to as the A -Sheffer stroke, by generalizing the monotonicity condition from fuzzy Sheffer strokes to cone monotonicity. We then systematically investigate their fundamental properties and explore their connections with both fuzzy Sheffer strokes and r → -Sheffer strokes. Moreover, we present a method to construct A -Sheffer strokes using A -conjunctions and fuzzy negations, along with a characterization of A -constant Sheffer strokes. In addition, we propose splicing construction techniques applicable to both r → -Sheffer strokes and A -Sheffer strokes. Finally, an ordinal sum construction method for A -Sheffer stroke operators is presented.},

This is an old question which relates to recent advances in copula modeling for discrete random vectors. In this work, we focus on multi-way binary tables and develop novel theory to show how the zero patterns affect the existence of the transformation as well as its statistical interpretability in terms of dependence structure. The implementation of the theory relies on combinatorial and linear programming techniques, which can also be applied to arbitrary multi-way tables. In addition, we investigate which odds ratios characterize the unique solution in relation to specific zero patterns. Several examples are described to illustrate the approach and point to interesting future research directions.},

  abstract     = {Set-valued data has traditionally been represented by considering non-empty compact and convex subsets of R d with the usual Minkowski addition. An alternative and flexible setting that admits a functional representation are the star-shaped sets. A framework based on a center-radial characterization has been introduced to treat these sets from a statistical point of view. The arithmetic is defined directionally, which is more natural for representing imprecision propagation in higher dimensions. Nevertheless, the problem of determining a center for star-shaped sets coherent with the arithmetic and sound for statistical purposes has not been fully addressed yet. The aim is to advance on the directional characterization for star-shaped sets by considering a measure-preserving arithmetic together with a center selection fully compatible with this arithmetic. The practicability of the new framework will be illustrated using a classical dataset in set-valued statistics.},
