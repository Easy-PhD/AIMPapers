  abstract     = {Covering-based rough sets (CBRS) offer a flexible extension of classical rough set theory, making them well-suited for analyzing diverse types of complex and possibly inconsistent data. A requirement for the effective use of CBRS is the availability of high-quality coverings of the dataset. A promising approach for generating such coverings is the Mapper algorithm, which builds on the underlying topological structure of the data. However, Mapper's performance depends heavily on the choice of its parameters. In this paper, we study how the structure of the parameter space is transferred to the structure of the coverings generated by these parameters, focusing on the weak and strong approximation operators. We prove important monotonicity results that give insights into the inner workings of the Mapper algorithm and how it can generate coverings. We give an overview of how each parameter influences the output covering and illustrate this using real-world datasets.},

  abstract     = {Recently, Baczyński et al. introduced an axiomatic framework for fuzzy Sheffer strokes within the realm of fuzzy logic. Building on this foundation, Zhao and Liu extended this concept to the context of directionally monotone functions. In this paper, we propose a novel class of cone-monotone functions, referred to as the A -Sheffer stroke, by generalizing the monotonicity condition from fuzzy Sheffer strokes to cone monotonicity. We then systematically investigate their fundamental properties and explore their connections with both fuzzy Sheffer strokes and r → -Sheffer strokes. Moreover, we present a method to construct A -Sheffer strokes using A -conjunctions and fuzzy negations, along with a characterization of A -constant Sheffer strokes. In addition, we propose splicing construction techniques applicable to both r → -Sheffer strokes and A -Sheffer strokes. Finally, an ordinal sum construction method for A -Sheffer stroke operators is presented.},

  abstract     = {We study the problem of transforming a multi-way contingency table into an equivalent table with uniform margins and same dependence structure. This is an old question which relates to recent advances in copula modeling for discrete random vectors. In this work, we focus on multi-way binary tables and develop novel theory to show how the zero patterns affect the existence of the transformation as well as its statistical interpretability in terms of dependence structure. The implementation of the theory relies on combinatorial and linear programming techniques, which can also be applied to arbitrary multi-way tables. In addition, we investigate which odds ratios characterize the unique solution in relation to specific zero patterns. Several examples are described to illustrate the approach and point to interesting future research directions.},

  abstract     = {Set-valued data has traditionally been represented by considering non-empty compact and convex subsets of R d with the usual Minkowski addition. An alternative and flexible setting that admits a functional representation are the star-shaped sets. A framework based on a center-radial characterization has been introduced to treat these sets from a statistical point of view. The arithmetic is defined directionally, which is more natural for representing imprecision propagation in higher dimensions. Nevertheless, the problem of determining a center for star-shaped sets coherent with the arithmetic and sound for statistical purposes has not been fully addressed yet. The aim is to advance on the directional characterization for star-shaped sets by considering a measure-preserving arithmetic together with a center selection fully compatible with this arithmetic. The practicability of the new framework will be illustrated using a classical dataset in set-valued statistics.},
