The tree T is strongly non-saturated if there exists a strongly almost disjoint family of ω 2 -many uncountable downwards closed subtrees of T . In this article we construct a Knaster forcing which adds a Suslin tree together with a family of ω 2 -many strongly almost disjoint automorphisms of it (and thus the square of the Suslin tree is strongly non-saturated). To achieve this goal, we introduce a new idea called ρ-separation , which is an adaptation to the finite context of the notion of separation which was recently introduced by Stejskalová and the first author for the purpose of adding automorphisms of a tree with a forcing with countable conditions.},

  abstract     = {This work presents an asymptotic stability result concerning the self-similar Blasius profiles [ u ¯ , v ¯ ] of the stationary Prandtl boundary layer equation. Initially demonstrated by Serrin [13] , the profiles [ u ¯ , v ¯ ] were shown to act as a self-similar attractor of solutions [ u , v ] to the Prandtl equation through the use of von Mises transform and maximal principle techniques. Specifically, as x → ∞ , ‖ u − u ¯ ‖ L y ∞ → 0 . Iyer [6] employed refined energy methods to derive an explicit convergence rate for initial data close to Blasius. Wang and Zhang [16] utilized barrier function methods, removing smallness assumptions but imposing stronger asymptotic conditions on the initial data. It was suggested that the optimal convergence rate should be ‖ u − u ¯ ‖ L y ∞ ≲ ( x + 1 ) − 1 2 , treating the stationary Prandtl equation as a 1-D parabolic equation in the entire space. In this study, we establish that ‖ u − u ¯ ‖ L y ∞ ≲ ( x + 1 ) − 1 . Our proof relies on discovering nearly conserved low-frequency quantities and inherent degenerate structures at the boundary, which enhance the convergence rate through iteration techniques. Notably, the convergence rate we have demonstrated is optimal. We can find special solutions of Prandtl's equation such that the convergence between the solutions and the Blasius profile is exact, represented as ( x + 1 ) − 1 .},

We then apply these results to Serre's conjecture II and to some variants for fields of any cohomological dimension that are inspired by conjectures of Kato and Kuzumaki.

  abstract     = {This work presents a generalization of derived blow-ups and of the derived deformation to the normal bundle from derived algebraic geometry to any geometric context. The latter is our proposed globalization of a derived algebraic context, itself a generalization of the theory of simplicial commutative rings and due to Bhatt–Mathew and Raksit. One key difference between a geometric context and ordinary derived algebraic geometry is that the coordinate ring of an affine object in the former is not necessarily connective. When constructing generalized blow-ups, this not only turns out to be remarkably convenient, but also leads to a wider existence result. Indeed, we show that the derived Rees algebra and the derived blow-up exist for any affine morphism of stacks in a given geometric context. However, in general the derived Rees algebra will no longer be connective, hence in general the derived blow-up will not live in the connective part of the theory. Unsurprisingly, this can be solved by restricting the input to closed immersions. The proof of the latter statement uses a derived deformation to the normal bundle in any given geometric context, which is also of independent interest. Besides the geometric context which extends algebraic geometry, the second main example of a geometric context is an extension of analytic geometry as based on categories of Ind-Banach spaces or modules. The latter is a recent construction, and includes many different flavors of analytic geometry, such as complex analytic geometry, non-Archimedean rigid analytic geometry and analytic geometry over the integers. The present work thus provides derived blow-ups and a derived deformation to the normal bundle in all of these, which is expected to have many applications.},

  abstract     = {For Hermitian connections on a Hermitian complex line bundle over a Riemannian manifold ( X , g ) , we can define the “volume”, which can be considered to be the “mirror” of the standard volume for submanifolds. We call the critical points minimal connections. In this paper, (1) we prove monotonicity formulas for minimal connections with respect to some versions of volume functionals under certain conditions on dim ⁡ X and the curvature of g . These formulas would be important in bubbling analysis. As a corollary, we obtain the vanishing theorem for minimal connections on the odd dimensional Euclidean space. (2) We see that the formal “large radius limit” of the defining equation of minimal connections is that of Yang–Mills connections. Then the existence theorem of minimal connections is proved for a “sufficiently large” metric. (3) We can consider deformed Donaldson–Thomas (dDT) connections on G 2 -manifolds as “mirrors” of calibrated (associative) submanifolds. We show that dDT connections are minimal connections, just as calibrated submanifolds are minimal submanifolds. By the argument specific to dDT connections, we obtain the stronger monotonicity formulas and vanishing theorem for dDT connections than in (1).},

We prove that if χ j 1 ≠ χ j 2 for 1 ≤ j 1 < j 2 ≤ d , and Φ j is exponentially separated for 1 ≤ j ≤ d , then the dimension of μ is the minimum of d and its Lyapunov dimension.

  abstract     = {We study random permutations corresponding to pipe dreams. Our main model is motivated by the Grothendieck polynomials with parameter β = 1 arising in the K -theory of the flag variety. The probability weight of a permutation is proportional to the principal specialization (setting all variables to 1) of the corresponding Grothendieck polynomial. By mapping this random permutation to a version of TASEP (Totally Asymmetric Simple Exclusion Process), we describe the limiting permuton and fluctuations around it as the order n of the permutation grows to infinity. The fluctuations are of order n 1 3 and have the Tracy–Widom GUE distribution, which places this algebraic ( K -theoretic) model into the Kardar–Parisi–Zhang universality class. As an application, we find the expected number of inversions in this random permutation, and contrast it with the case of non-reduced pipe dreams. Inspired by Stanley's question for the maximal value of principal specializations of Schubert polynomials, we resolve the analogous question for β = 1 Grothendieck polynomials, and provide bounds for general β . This analysis uses a correspondence with the free fermion six-vertex model, and the frozen boundary of the Aztec diamond.},

We compute the height filtration, successive minima, and the Boucksom-Chen concave transform of the height function h L λ : X ( K ‾ ) ⟶ R over the flag variety X = ( F / P ) K . An interesting application is that the height of X equals to a weighted average of successive minima, and one may view this as a refinement of Zhang's inequality of successive minima. Let f ∈ N 1 ( F / P ) be the numerical class of a vertical fiber. We compute the augmented base loci B + ( L λ − t f ) for any t ∈ R , and it turns out that they are almost the same as the height filtration.

The evidence for these conjectures is given by upgrading recent results of Chen–Vilonen–Xue, to obtain formulae for the Hodge numbers of these Fano schemes. This allows us to numerically verify the conjecture in the hyperelliptic case, and establish a combinatorial identity as evidence for the stacky case.},

  abstract     = {We study the typical structure and the number of triangle-free graphs with n vertices and m edges where m is large enough so that a typical triangle-free graph has a cut containing nearly all of its edges, but may not be bipartite. Erdős, Kleitman, and Rothschild showed that almost every triangle-free graph is bipartite, which leads to an asymptotic formula for the number of triangle-free graphs on n vertices. Osthus, Prömel, and Taraz later showed that for m ≥ ( 1 + ε ) 3 4 n 3 / 2 log ⁡ n , almost every triangle-free graph on n vertices and m edges is bipartite, which likewise leads to an asymptotic formula for their number. Here we give a precise characterization of the distribution of edges within each part of the max cut of a uniformly chosen triangle-free graph G on n vertices and m edges, for a larger range of densities with m = Θ ( n 3 / 2 log ⁡ n ) . Using this characterization, we describe the evolution of the structure of typical triangle-free graphs as the density changes. We show that as the number of edges decreases below 3 4 n 3 / 2 log ⁡ n , the following structural changes occur in G : • Isolated edges, then trees, then more complex subgraphs emerge as ‘defect edges’, the edges within the parts of a max cut of G . In fact, the distribution of defect edges is first that of independent Erdős-Rényi random graphs inside the parts, then that of independent exponential random graphs, conditioned on a small maximum degree and no triangles. • There is a sharp threshold for 3-colorability at m ∼ 2 4 n 3 / 2 log ⁡ n and a sharp threshold between 4-colorability and unbounded chromatic number at m ∼ 1 4 n 3 / 2 log ⁡ n . • Giant components emerge in the defect edges at m ∼ 1 4 n 3 / 2 log ⁡ n . We further use this structural characterization to prove asymptotic formulas for the number of triangle-free graphs with n vertices and m edges in this range of densities. The asymptotic formula exhibits a change in form around the threshold m ∼ 1 4 n 3 / 2 log ⁡ n at which giant components emerge among the defect edges. We likewise prove the analogous results for the random graph G ( n , p ) conditioned on triangle-freeness.},

We prove the existence of the N -best approximation problem for H 2 functions which requires considering multiple parameters of the slice Takenaka-Malmquist system simultaneously. In the non-commutative quaternion field our proof relies on the limit behavior for the slice Takenaka-Malmquist system which is obtained through separating quaternionic Blaschke factors from elements of the system, that is quite different to the complex variable and several complex variables cases. Technically, it is more subtle for the right half space H + .},

We use this description to prove that the even parts of the equivariant cohomology algebras are weakly isomorphic and the odd groups have the same ranks if and only if the labeled graphs obtained from the decorated graphs by forgetting the height and area labels are isomorphic. As a consequence, we give an example of an isomorphism of equivariant cohomology algebras that cannot be induced by an equivariant diffeomorphism of manifolds preserving a compatible almost complex structure.

We prove the existence of a smooth complete hypersurface of constant scalar curvature with a prescribed asymptotic boundary at infinity. The desired hypersurface is constructed as the limit of constant scalar curvature graphs (with respect to vertical geodesics) over a fixed compact domain in a horosphere, and the problem is thus reduced to solving a Dirichlet problem for a fully nonlinear elliptic partial differential equation which is degenerate along the boundary. Previously, the result was known only for a restricted range of curvature values. Now, in this article, by introducing some new techniques, we are able to solve the Dirichlet problem for all possible curvature values. The main ingredient is the establishment of the crucial second order a priori estimates for admissible solutions.},

This exact triangle is different from the one which appeared in Ozsváth and Szabó's original proof. This exact triangle simplifies a number of technical aspects in their proofs and also allows us to prove several new results. A first application is an extension of the link surgery formula to arbitrary links in closed 3-manifolds, with no restrictions on the link being null-homologous. A second application is a proof that the modules for bordered manifolds with torus boundaries, defined by the author in a previous paper, are invariants. Another application is a simple proof of a version of the surgery formula which computes knot and link Floer complexes in terms of subcubes of the link surgery hypercube. As a final application, we show that the knot surgery algebra is homotopy equivalent to an endomorphism algebra of a sum of two decorated Lagrangians in the torus, mirroring a result of Auroux concerning the algebras of Lipshitz, Ozsváth and Thurston.},

The improvement is based on two types of new estimates. One is the refined estimate of the semi-norm ⌊ G ⌋ 2 using a new way of integration by parts. The other is a family of refined pointwise estimates ( Lemma 3.7 , Lemma 3.9 ) on Gegenbauer coefficients, which is established by the decaying estimates and cancellation property of Gegenbauer polynomials ( Lemma 3.10 , Proposition 3.11 , Corollary 3.12 ).

The notions of Cesàro and Abel convergence for the quaternionic Banach-valued locally integrable functions are introduced and the corresponding Tauberian conditions are established. Moreover, the Cesàro convergence is studied based on the slice hyperholomorphic extension and the relations between Cesàro and Abel convergence are formulated. We weaken the boundary condition of the slice hypercomplex domain of Cauchy integral via the geometric techniques of cutting rectifiable Jordan curves by finite circles and prove the quaternionic Cesàro mean ergodic theorem. Furthermore, the Tauberian theorems for the quaternionic power series are deduced. On the other hand, the notions of Cesàro and Abel ergodicity of the continuous and discrete quaternionic semigroups are proposed and the S -resolvent and spectral conditions for Cesàro ergodicity of these semigroups are obtained. In addition, some basic properties of Cesàro and Abel-ergodic projections are derived and Abel ergodic and Cesàro mean ergodic theorems are established. Besides, some equivalent characterizations of the quaternionic operator matrix as the semigroup generator are formulated and proved and the ergodic theorems of the quaternionic semigroup generated by quaternionic operator matrix are demonstrated. Finally, the ergodicity of solutions for the inhomogeneous Cauchy problem with periodic inhomogeneity in quaternionic setting is achieved.},

According to the work of [44] , the toric degeneration associated with each Newton–Okounkov polytope Δ in the family produces a completely integrable system of X over Δ. We investigate circumstances in which each completely integrable system possesses a monotone Lagrangian torus fiber. We provide a sufficient condition, based on the data of tropical integer points and exchange matrices, for the family of constructed monotone Lagrangian tori to contain infinitely many monotone Lagrangian tori, no two of which are related by any symplectomorphism. By employing this criterion and exploiting the correspondence between the tropical integer points and the dual canonical basis elements, we generate infinitely many distinct monotone Lagrangian tori on flag manifolds of arbitrary type except in a few cases.},

One typical example is given by the class of two-step nilpotent Lie algebras obtained from simple directed graphs. In this paper, however, we focus on the use of quivers to construct nilpotent Lie algebras. A quiver is a directed graph that allows loops and multiple arrows between two vertices. Utilizing the concept of paths within quivers, we introduce a method for constructing nilpotent Lie algebras from finite quivers without cycles. We prove that for all these Lie algebras, the corresponding simply-connected nilpotent Lie groups admit left-invariant Ricci solitons. The method we introduce constructs a broad family of Ricci soliton nilmanifolds with arbitrarily high degrees of nilpotency.},

In the extremal case where κ ( X ) = dim ⁡ X − g and X is minimal, we prove that X admits a smooth morphism to an abelian variety, and classify all such X by showing they arise as diagonal quotients of the product of an abelian variety with a variety of general type. The case g = 1 was first proved by the third author, and classification results about surfaces and threefolds carrying nowhere vanishing forms have appeared in work of Schreieder and subsequent joint work with the third author. We also prove a birational version of this classification which holds without the minimal assumption, and establish additional cases of a conjecture of the third author.},

We show an invariance principle for low-degree functions over the multi-slice, to functions over the product space ( [ m ] n , μ n ) in which μ ( i ) = k i / n . This answers a question raised by [23] . As applications of the invariance principle, we show: 1. An analogue of the “dictatorship test implies computational hardness” paradigm for problems with perfect completeness, for a certain class of dictatorship tests. Our computational hardness is proved assuming a recent strengthening of the Unique-Games Conjecture, called the Rich 2-to-1 Games Conjecture. Using this analogue, we show that assuming the Rich 2-to-1 Games Conjecture, (a) there is an r -ary CSP P r for which it is NP-hard to distinguish satisfiable instances of the CSP and instances that are at most 2 r + 1 2 r + o ( 1 ) satisfiable, and (b) hardness of distinguishing 3-colorable graphs, and graphs that do not contain an independent set of size o ( 1 ) . 2. A reduction of the problem of studying expectations of products of functions on the multi-slice to studying expectations of products of functions on correlated, product spaces. In particular, we are able to deduce analogues of the Gaussian bounds from [42] for the multi-slice. 3. In a companion paper, we show further applications of our invariance principle in extremal combinatorics, and more specifically to proving removal lemmas of a wide family of hypergraphs H called ζ -forests, which is a natural extension of the well-studied case of matchings.},

In applied mathematics, the Grassmannian is usually embedded as projection matrices Gr ( k , R n ) ≅ { P ∈ R n × n : P T = P = P 2 , tr ( P ) = k } or as involution matrices Gr ( k , R n ) ≅ { X ∈ R n × n : X T = X , X 2 = I , tr ( X ) = 2 k − n } . We will determine an explicit expression for the degree of the Grassmannian with respect to these embeddings. In so doing, we resolved a conjecture of Devriendt, Friedman, Reinke, and Sturmfels about the degree of Gr ( 2 , R n ) and in fact generalized it to Gr ( k , R n ) . We also proved a set-theoretic variant of another conjecture of theirs about the limit of Gr ( k , R n ) in the sense of Gröbner degeneration.},

These solutions are uniformly far from vacuum, suggesting that weak turbulence in quantum hydrodynamics is not necessarily related to the occurrence of vortex structures. In view of possible connections with instability mechanisms for the classical compressible Euler equations, we also keep track of the dependence on the semiclassical parameter, showing that, at high regularity, the time at which the Sobolev norm inflations occur is uniform when approaching the semiclassical limit. Our construction relies on a novel result of Sobolev instability for the plane waves of the cubic nonlinear Schrödinger equation (NLS), which is connected to the quantum Euler equations through the Madelung transform. More precisely, we show the existence of smooth solutions to NLS, which are small-amplitude perturbations of a plane wave and undergo a polynomially fast H s -norm inflation for s > 1 . The proof is based on a partial Birkhoff normal form procedure, involving the normalization of non-homogeneous Hamiltonian terms.},

This prompted Hjorth to ask if this is in fact true for all CBERs classifiable by (uncountable) abelian Polish groups. We describe reductions involving free Banach spaces to show that every treeable CBER is classifiable by an abelian Polish group. As there exist treeable CBERs that are not hyperfinite, this answers Hjorth's question in the negative. On the other hand, we show that any CBER classifiable by a countable product of locally compact abelian Polish groups (such as R ω ) is indeed hyperfinite. We use a small fragment of the Hjorth analysis of Polish group actions, which is Hjorth's generalization of the Scott analysis of countable structures to Polish group actions.},

  abstract     = {In this article, we study the quantitative stability of the Poincaré-Sobolev equation on the hyperbolic space ( P ) − Δ B n u − λ u = | u | p − 1 u , u ∈ H 1 ( B n ) , where n ≥ 3 , 1 < p ≤ n + 2 n − 2 and λ ≤ ( n − 1 ) 2 4 . If we consider the upper half space model for the hyperbolic space, then the solutions to ( P ) have certain equivalence with the cylindrically symmetric solutions to the Hardy-Sobolev-Mazy'a equation on the Euclidean space. A classical result owing to Mancini and Sandeep [43] asserts that all positive solutions to ( P ) are unique up to hyperbolic isometries, which henceforth will be called the hyperbolic bubbles . In the spirit of Struwe, Bhakta-Sandeep [6] proved the following non-quantitative stability result: if u m ≥ 0 , and ‖ Δ B n u m + λ u m + u m p ‖ H − 1 → 0 , then δ ( u m ) : = dist ( u m , M λ ) → 0 , where dist ( u m , M λ ) denotes the H 1 -distance of u m from the manifold of sums of superpositions of hyperbolic bubbles and (localized) Aubin-Talenti bubbles. In this article, we study the quantitative stability of Struwe decomposition. We prove under certain bounds on ‖ ∇ u ‖ L 2 ( B n ) the inequality δ ( u ) ≲ ‖ Δ B n u + λ u + u p ‖ H − 1 , holds whenever p > 2 and hence forcing the dimensional restriction 3 ≤ n ≤ 5 . Moreover, it fails for any n ≥ 3 and p ∈ ( 1 , 2 ] and hence the dependence on the exponent p is sharp. In the critical case, our dimensional constraint coincides with the seminal result of Figalli and Glaudo [29] , which manifests as the dependence on dimension via the critical exponent 2 n n − 2 > 2 if and only if 3 ≤ n ≤ 5 . We derive several new and novel estimates on the interaction of hyperbolic bubbles and their derivatives. The interaction estimates are sharp and of paramount importance, among several other geometric arguments, to adopt the approach of Figalli and Glaudo in this context. The sharpness of the stability estimates requires improved eigenfunction integrability estimates, which we believe are new in this context.},

Tambara, the universal Hopf algebra of a given (co)module structure, as well as the universal group of a grading, introduced by J. Patera and H. Zassenhaus, find their applications in the classification of quantum symmetries. Typically, universal (co)acting objects are defined as initial or terminal in the corresponding categories and, as such, they do not always exist. In order to ensure their existence, we introduce the support of a given object, which generalizes the support of a grading and is used to restrict the class of objects under consideration. The existence problems for universal objects are formulated and studied in a purely categorical manner by seeing them as particular cases of the lifting problem for a locally initial object. We prove the existence of a lifting and, consequently, of the universal (co)acting objects under some assumptions on the base (braided or symmetric monoidal) category. In contrast to existing constructions, our approach is self-dual in the sense that we can use the same proof to obtain the existence of universal actions and coactions. In particular, when the base category is the category of vector spaces over a field, the category of sets or their duals, we recover known existence results for the aforementioned universal objects. The proposed approach allows us to apply our results not only to the classical categories of sets and vectors spaces and their duals but also to (co)modules over bi/Hopf algebras, differential graded vector spaces, G -sets and graded sets.},

It is shown that if S is piecewise syndetic in Z , then { ( m , n ) ∈ Z 2 : m + p 1 ( n ) , … , m + p d ( n ) ∈ S } is piecewise syndetic in Z 2 , which extends the result by Glasner and Furstenberg for linear polynomials. Our result is obtained by showing the density of minimal points of a dynamical system of a Z 2 action associated with the piecewise syndetic set S and the polynomials { p 1 , … , p d } . Moreover, it is proved that if ( X , T ) is minimal, then for each non-empty open subset U of X , there is x ∈ U with { n ∈ Z : T p 1 ( n ) x ∈ U , … , T p d ( n ) x ∈ U } piecewise syndetic.},

We prove that the optimal lower bound C n , s behaves asymptotically at the order of 1 n when n → + ∞ for any fixed s ∈ ( 0 , 1 ) . This extends the work by Dolbeault-Esteban-Figalli-Frank-Loss [22] on the stability of the first order Sobolev inequality (i.e., s = 1 ) and quantify the asymptotic behavior for lower bound of stability of fractional Sobolev inequality established by the current author's previous work in [15] in the case of s ∈ ( 0 , 1 ) . Moreover, C n , s behaves asymptotically at the order of s when s → 0 for any given dimension n . (See Theorem 1.1 for these asymptotic estimates.) As an important application of this asymptotic estimate as s → 0 , we derive the global stability for the log-Sobolev inequality on the sphere established by Beckner in [3] , [5] with the optimal asymptotic lower bound on the sphere through the stability of fractional Sobolev inequalities with optimal asymptotic lower bound and the end-point differentiation method (see Theorem 1.6 ). This sharpens the earlier work by the authors in [14] where only the local stability for the log-Sobolev inequality on the sphere was proved. We also obtain the asymptotically optimal lower bound for the Hardy-Littlewood-Sobolev inequality when s → 0 for fixed dimension n and n → ∞ for fixed s ∈ ( 0 , 1 ) (see Theorem 1.4 and the subsequent Remark 1.5 ).},

We point out that the formal properties of this immersion Φ : M → D are very similar to those of the period map defined on the moduli spaces of Calabi–Yau threefolds.

Secondly, we introduce an intrinsic definition of K-cowaist on odd-dimensional manifolds, making use of the odd Chern character of a smooth map from the manifold to a unitary group. It behaves just like the usual K-cowaist on even-dimensional manifolds. We then apply the notion of odd K-cowaist and the tool of spectral flow to investigate problems related to positive scalar curvature on spin manifolds. In particular, we prove infinite odd K-cowaist to be an obstruction to the existence of PSC metrics. We obtain quantitative scalar curvature estimates on complete non-compact manifolds and scalar-mean curvature estimates on compact manifolds with boundary. They extend several previous results optimally, which unfolds a major advantage of our method via spectral flow and odd K-cowaist.},

A classical theorem of McAdam shows that the analytic spread of an ideal I in a formally equidimensional local ring is equal to the dimension of the ring if and only if the maximal ideal is an associated prime of R / I n ‾ for some n . We show in Theorem 1.5 that McAdam's theorem holds for Q -divisorial filtrations in an equidimensional local ring which is essentially of finite type over an excellent local ring of dimension less than or equal to 3. This generalizes an earlier result for Q -divisorial filtrations in an equicharacteristic zero excellent local domain by the author. This theorem does not hold for more general filtrations. We consider the question of the asymptotic behavior of the function n ↦ λ R ( R / I n ) for a Q -divisorial filtration I = { I n } of m R -primary ideals on a d -dimensional normal excellent local ring. It is known from earlier work of the author that the multiplicity e ( I ) = d ! lim n → ∞ ⁡ λ R ( R / I n ) n d can be irrational. We show in Lemma 4.1 that the limsup of the first difference function lim sup n → ∞ λ R ( I n / I n + 1 ) n d − 1 is always finite for a Q -divisorial filtration. We then give an example in Section 4 showing that this limsup may not exist as a limit. In the final section, we give an example of a symbolic filtration { P ( n ) } of a prime ideal P in a normal two dimensional excellent local ring which has the property that the set of Rees valuations of all the symbolic powers P ( n ) of P is infinite.},

  abstract     = {Hochschild homology has proved to be an important invariant in algebra and homotopy theory, in particular due to its relevance in algebraic K -theory and fixed point theory, leading to the development of numerous variants of the original construction. Ponto introduced a bicategorical axiomatization of Hochschild homology-type invariants, called a shadow , which captures the essential common properties of all known variants of Hochschild homology, such as Morita invariance . In this paper we clarify the relationship between shadows and Hochschild homology. After extending the notion of Hochschild homology to bicategories in a natural manner, we prove the existence of a universal shadow on any bicategory B , taking values in the Hochschild homology of B , through which all other shadows on B factor. Shadows are thus co-represented by a bicategorical version of Hochschild homology. Using the universal shadow on the free adjunction bicategory, we can then establish a universal Morita invariance theorem, of which all known cases are immediate corollaries. Building on this understanding of shadows on bicategories, we propose an ∞-categorical generalization of shadows as functors out of Hochschild homology of an ( ∞ , 2 ) -category in the sense of Berman. As a first step towards constructing relevant examples of ∞-categorical shadows, we define the Hochschild homology of enriched ∞-categorical bimodules and prove that they assemble into a shadow. As part of this work we compute the Hochschild homology of several important 2-categories (such as the free adjunction), which can be of independent interest.},

For two-dimensional Lagrangians, local higher mutation is the same as performing a Lagrangian anti-surgery in the sense of [24] followed by a Lagrangian surgery. We prove that up to a change of local systems, the Lagrangian intersection Floer cohomology of a pair of Lagrangians is invariant under local mutation. This result generalizes the wall-crossing formula in [42] . For two-dimensional Lagrangians, this result agrees with the invariance result in [43] .},

As an illustration of the scope of this result, we deduce contractivity estimates for analytic functions on the Riemann sphere, the complex plane and the Poincaré disc, with a complete description of the extremal functions, hence providing a unified and illuminating perspective on a number of results and conjectures on this subject, in particular on the Wehrl entropy conjecture of Lieb and Solovej. In this connection, we completely prove that conjecture for the group S U ( 2 ) , by showing that the corresponding extremals are only the coherent states. Also, we show that the above (global) estimates admit a local counterpart and in all cases we characterize also the extremal subsets, among those of fixed assigned measure.},

We prove that the cylindrical profile function u of these flows have the asymptotics u ( y , ω , τ ) = ( y ⊤ Q y − 2 tr ( Q ) ) / | τ | + o ( | τ | − 1 ) as τ → − ∞ , where the cylindrical matrix Q is a constant symmetric k × k matrix whose eigenvalues are quantized to be either 0 or − 2 ( n − k ) 4 . Compared with the bubble-sheet quantization theorem in R 4 obtained by Haslhofer and the first author, this theorem has full generality in the sense of removing noncollapsing condition and being valid for all dimensions. In addition, we establish symmetry improvement theorem which generalizes the corresponding results of Brendle-Choi and the second author to all dimensions. Finally, we give some geometric applications of the two theorems. In particular, we obtain the asymptotics, compactness and O ( n − k + 1 ) symmetry of k -ovals in R n + 1 which are ancient noncollapsed flows in R n + 1 satisfying full rank condition that rk ( Q ) = k , and we also obtain the classification of ancient noncollapsed flows in R n + 1 satisfying vanishing rank condition that rk ( Q ) = 0 .},

This generalizes the recent work by Tevelev and Torres on the case with fixed odd determinant. Since S U C ( 2 ) is singular, we work with its noncommutative resolution of singularities constructed by Pădurariu and Špenko–Van den Bergh (in the more general setting of symmetric stacks). We show that this noncommutative resolution admits a semiorthogonal decomposition into derived categories of symmetric powers Sym 2 k C for 2 k ≤ g − 1 . In the case of even genus, each block appears four times. This is also true in the case of odd genus, except that the top symmetric power Sym g − 1 C appears twice. In the case of even genus, the noncommutative resolution is strongly crepant in the sense of Kuznetsov and categorifies the intersection cohomology of S U C ( 2 ) . Since all of its components are “geometric,” our semiorthogonal decomposition provides evidence for the expectation, which dates back to the work of Newstead and Tyurin, that S U C ( 2 ) is a rational variety. Finally, we study mutations of semiorthogonal decompositions on the Hecke correspondence, answering a question of Pădurariu and Toda.},

We are interested in the distribution of the random γ -flat arising as the intersection of E with L . In contrast to the Euclidean case, the intersection E ∩ L can be empty with strictly positive probability. We determine this probability and the full distribution of E ∩ L . Thereby, we elucidate crucial differences to the Euclidean case. Moreover, we study the limiting behavior as d ↑ ∞ and also K ↑ 0 . Thereby we obtain a phase transition with three different phases which we completely characterize, including a critical phase with distinctive behavior and a phase recovering the Euclidean results.

For example, particular values of truncated hypergeometric functions and hypergeometric character sums are often congruent or equal to Fourier coefficients of modular forms. In this series of papers, we develop and explore an explicit “Hypergeometric-Modularity” method for associating a modular form to a given hypergeometric datum. In particular, for certain length three and four hypergeometric data we give an explicit method for finding a modular form f such that the corresponding hypergeometric Galois representation has a subrepresentation isomorphic to the Deligne representation of f . Our method utilizes Ramanujan's theory of elliptic functions to alternative bases, commutative formal group laws, and supercongruences.

In the second paper, we discuss a number of applications, including explicit connections between hypergeometric values and periods of these explicit eta quotients as well as evaluation formulae for certain special L -values.},

Further, even in the isotropic case when δ 1 = … = δ R = δ , we obtain an asymptotic formula which holds beyond the range of distance to M established in [22] . Our result is also a generalization of the work of J.J. Huang [9] for hypersurfaces. As an application, we establish for the first time an upper bound for the Hausdorff dimension of the set of weighted simultaneously well approximable points on a manifold M satisfying the strong curvature condition, which agrees with the lower bound obtained by Allen-Wang in [2] . Moreover, for R > 1 , we obtain a new upper bound for the number of rational points on M , which goes beyond the bound in an analogue of Serre's dimension growth conjecture for submanifolds of R M .},

  abstract     = {The paper is concerned with the spectral properties of the boundary value problems (BVP) associated with the following n × n Dirac type equation: − i y ′ − i Q ( x ) y = λ B ( x ) y , y = col ( y 1 , … , y n ) , x ∈ [ 0 , ℓ ] , on a finite interval [ 0 , ℓ ] subject to the general two-point boundary conditions C y ( 0 ) + D y ( ℓ ) = 0 with C , D ∈ C n × n . Here Q = ( Q j k ) j , k = 1 n is an integrable potential matrix and B = diag ( β 1 , … , β n ) = B ⁎ is a diagonal integrable matrix “weight”. If n = 2 m and B ( ⋅ ) = diag ( − I m , I m ) , this equation turns into n × n Dirac equation. First, assuming that supp ( Q j k ) ⊂ supp ( β k − β j ) , we show that the deviation Φ Q ( ⋅ , λ ) − Φ 0 ( ⋅ , λ ) of the fundamental matrix solutions to the above perturbed and unperturbed ( Q = 0 ) equation is represented as a Fourier transform of a certain matrix kernel K Q ( ⋅ , ⋅ ) from a special Banach space. This result is used to prove our main result, the following formula for the deviation of the characteristic determinants Δ Q ( ⋅ ) and Δ 0 ( ⋅ ) of two (perturbed and unperturbed) BVPs as a Fourier transform, Δ Q ( λ ) = Δ 0 ( λ ) + ∫ b − b + g ( u ) e i λ u d u , g ∈ L 1 [ b − , b + ] , where b ± are explicitly expressed via entries of the matrix function B ( ⋅ ) . In turn, assuming that each function β k ( ⋅ ) is of fixed sign (so-called “fixed sign” condition), this representation yields asymptotic behavior of the spectrum in the case of regular boundary conditions. Namely, we show that λ m = λ m 0 + o ( 1 ) as m → ∞ , where { λ m } m ∈ Z and { λ m 0 } m ∈ Z are sequences of eigenvalues of perturbed and unperturbed BVP, respectively. It is also shown that for Q ∈ L p , p ∈ ( 1 , 2 ] , the following estimate holds under additional condition on B ( ⋅ ) : ∑ m ∈ Z | λ m − λ m 0 | p ′ + ∑ m ∈ Z ( 1 + | m | ) p − 2 | λ m − λ m 0 | p < ∞ , p ′ : = p / ( p − 1 ) . In the case of Dirac operator, we show that the sequence of the eigenvalues splits into the union of n branches asymptotically close to arithmetic progressions { 2 π k − i Log ( − μ s ) } k ∈ Z , s ∈ { 1 , … , n } , where μ 1 , … , μ n are the eigenvalues of a certain n × n matrix explicitly constructed via the matrices C and D .},

  abstract     = {We show that the universal homogeneous partial order has finite big Ramsey degrees and discuss several corollaries. Our proof relies on parameter spaces and the Carlson–Simpson theorem rather than on (a strengthening of) the Halpern–Läuchli theorem and the Milliken tree theorem, which are typically used to bound big Ramsey degrees in the existing literature (originating from the work of Laver and Milliken). This new technique has many additional applications. We show that the homogeneous universal triangle-free graph has finite big Ramsey degrees, providing a short proof of a recent result by Dobrinen. Moreover, generalizing an indivisibility (vertex partition) result of Nguyen van Thé and Sauer, we give an upper bound on big Ramsey degrees of metric spaces with finitely many distances. This leads to a new combinatorial argument for the oscillation stability of the Urysohn Sphere.},

  abstract     = {Building on [20] , this paper develops a unifying study on the boundedness properties of several representative classes of hybrid operators, i.e. operators that enjoy both zero and non-zero curvature features. Specifically, via the LGC-method, we provide suitable L p bounds for three classes of operators: (1) Carleson-type operators, (2) Hilbert transform along variable curves, and, taking the center stage, (3) Bilinear Hilbert transform and bilinear maximal operators along curves. All these classes of operators will be studied in the context of hybrid curves with no quadratic resonances. The above study is interposed between two naturally derived topics: i) A prologue providing a first rigorous account on how the presence/absence of a higher order modulation invariance property interacts with and determines the nature of the method employed for treating operators with such features. ii) An epilogue revealing how several key ingredients within our present study can blend and inspire a short, intuitive new proof of the smoothing inequality that plays the central role in the analysis of the curved version of the triangular Hilbert transform treated in [3] .},

Thus, the relative types to Zhou weights are valuations (Zhou valuations) on the ring of germs of holomorphic functions. We use Tian functions and Zhou numbers to measure the singularities of plurisubharmonic functions, involving jumping numbers and multiplier ideal sheaves. Especially, the relative types to Zhou weights characterize the division relations of the ring of germs of holomorphic functions. Finally, we consider a global version of Zhou weights on domains in C n , which is a generalization of the pluricomplex Green functions, and we obtain some properties of them, including continuity and some approximation results.},

  abstract     = {Let Γ ∞ be the set of all universally Baire sets of reals. Inspired by the work done in [22] and [21] , we introduce a new technique for establishing generic absoluteness results for models containing Γ ∞ . Our main technical tool is an iteration that realizes Γ ∞ as the sets of reals in a derived model of some iterate of V . We show, from a supercompact cardinal κ and a proper class of Woodin cardinals, that whenever g ⊆ Col ( ω , 2 2 κ ) is V -generic and h is V [ g ] -generic for some poset P ∈ V [ g ] , there is an elementary embedding j : V → M such that j ( κ ) = ω 1 V [ g ⁎ h ] and L ( Γ ∞ , R ) as computed in V [ g ⁎ h ] is a derived model of M at j ( κ ) . Here j is obtained by iteratively taking ultrapowers of V by extenders with critical point κ and its images. As a corollary we obtain that Sealing holds in V [ g ] , which was previously demonstrated by Woodin using the stationary tower forcing. Also, using a theorem of Woodin, we conclude that the derived model of V at κ satisfies AD R + “ Θ is a regular cardinal”. Inspired by core model induction, we introduce the definable powerset A ∞ of Γ ∞ and use our derived model representation mentioned above to show that the theory of L ( A ∞ ) cannot be changed by forcing (see Theorem 1.19 ). Working in a different direction, we also show that the theory of L ( Γ ∞ , R ) [ C ] , where C is the club filter on ℘ ω 1 ( Γ ∞ ) , cannot be changed by forcing (see Theorem 1.30 ). Proving the two aforementioned results is the first step towards showing that the theory of L ( Ord ω , Γ ∞ , R ) ( [ μ α : α ∈ Ord ] ) , where μ α is the club filter on ℘ ω 1 ( α ) , cannot be changed by forcing.},

Consequently we characterize the blocks of the category of modules. We also find a notion of (a)typicality similar to the one in the representation theory of Lie superalgebras. The typical simple modules turn out to be the simple and projective Verma modules. Moreover, we deduce a character formula for 1-atypical simple modules.},

In particular, intersections of 1-coisotropics are 0-shifted Poisson. We also show that 1-shifted coisotropic structures transfer through Morita equivalences, giving a well-defined notion for differentiable stacks. Most results are formulated with clean-intersection conditions weaker than transversality while avoiding derived geometry. Examples of 1-coisotropics that are not necessarily Lagrangians include Hamiltonian actions of quasi-symplectic groupoids on Dirac manifolds, and this recovers several generalizations of Marsden–Weinstein–Meyer's symplectic reduction via intersection and Morita transfer.},

Such a category comes with two monoidal structures ⊗ and which are related by non-invertible morphisms and which we treat on an equal footing. Quite generally, non-invertible structure morphisms play a dominant role in this theory. In any Grothendieck-Verdier module category M we find two distinguished subcategories and M ˆ ⊗ , which can be characterized by certain structure morphisms being actually invertible. The internal Hom A m : = Hom _ ( m , m ) of an object m in M ˆ ⊗ that is a C -generator is an algebra such that mod - A m is equivalent to M as a module category. Crucially, the subcategories and M ˆ ⊗ are precisely those on which a relative Serre functor can be defined. This relative Serre functor furnishes an equivalence , and any isomorphism m → ≅ S ( m ) endows the algebra A m with the structure of a Grothendieck-Verdier Frobenius algebra.},

It involves an interesting function, which we denote as F 1 ( x ) . In this paper, we show that F 1 ( x ) belongs to the category of period functions as it satisfies the period relations of Maass forms in the sense of Lewis and Zagier [11] . Hence, we refer to F 1 ( x ) as the Ramanujan period function . Moreover, one of the salient aspects of the Ramanujan period function F 1 ( x ) that we found out is that it is a Hecke eigenfunction under the action of Hecke operators on the space of periods. We also establish that it naturally appears in a Kronecker limit formula of a certain zeta function, revealing its connections to various topics. Finally, we generalize F 1 ( x ) to include a parameter s , connecting our work to the broader theory of period functions developed by Bettin and Conrey [4] and Lewis and Zagier [11] . We emphasize that Ramanujan was the first to study this function, marking the beginning of the study of period functions.},

We introduce two more statistics counting the all 0-columns on the left and right in an alternating sign triangle yielding objects we call alternating sign pentagons. We then show the equinumeracy of these alternating sign pentagons with Magog pentagons of a certain shape taking into account the statistic ρ . Furthermore we deduce a generating function of these alternating sign pentagons with respect to the statistic ρ in terms of a Pfaffian and consider the implications of our new results for some open conjectures.

These results yield the equivalence between étale Boolean range semigroups and Boolean birestriction semigroups and a characterization of when a Boolean restriction semigroup admits a compatible cosupport operation.

On particular smooth domains, such as R d or complete Riemannian manifolds, the quantization error is known to decay polynomially as the number of points is taken to infinity, provided the measure satisfies an integral condition which controls the amount of mass outside compact sets. On Riemannian manifolds, the existing integral condition involves a quantity measuring the growth of the exponential map, for which the only available estimates are in terms of lower bounds on sectional curvature. In this paper, we provide a more general integral condition for the asymptotics of the quantization error on Riemannian manifolds, given in terms of the growth of the covering numbers of spheres, which is purely metric in nature and concerns only the large-scale growth of the manifold. We further estimate the covering growth of manifolds in two particular cases, namely lower bounds on the Ricci curvature and geometric group actions by a discrete group of isometries.},

While these algebras are infinite dimensional, a connection to polyhedral combinatorics via a new theory of homological piecewise polynomials allows an effective study. A complete calculation is given in genus 0 via the algebra of piecewise polynomials on the cone stack of the associated Artin fan (lifting Keel's presentation of the Chow ring of M ‾ 0 , n ). Counterexamples to the simplest generalizations in genus 1 are presented. We show, however, that the structure of the log tautological rings is determined by the complete knowledge of all relations in the standard tautological rings of the moduli spaces of curves. In particular, Pixton's conjecture concerning relations in the standard tautological rings lifts to a complete conjecture for relations in the log tautological rings of the moduli spaces of curves. Several open questions are discussed. We develop the entire theory of logarithmic tautological classes in the context of arbitrary smooth normal crossings pairs ( X , D ) with explicit formulas for intersection products. As a special case, we give an explicit set of additive generators of the full logarithmic Chow ring of ( X , D ) in terms of Chow classes on the strata of X and piecewise polynomials on the cone stack.},

In fact, we show the stronger result that the Loewy length of a nonzero module of finite flat dimension is at least the regularity for strict Cohen-Macaulay rings, which significantly strengthens a theorem of Avramov–Buchweitz–Iyengar–Miller. As an application we simultaneously verify a Lech-like conjecture, comparing generalized Loewy length along flat local extensions, and a conjecture of Hanes for strict Cohen-Macaulay rings. Finally, we also give notable improvements to known lower bounds for Loewy lengths without the strict Cohen-Macaulay assumption.

  abstract     = {The Mordell-Tornheim zeta function and the Herglotz-Zagier function F ( x ) are two important functions in Mathematics. By generalizing a special case of the former, namely Θ ( z , x ) , we show that the theories of these functions are inextricably woven. We obtain a three-term functional equation for Θ ( z , x ) as well as decompose it in terms of the Herglotz-Hurwitz function Φ ( z , x ) . This decomposition can be conceived as a two-term functional equation for Φ ( z , x ) . Through this result, we are not only able to get Zagier's identity relating F ( x ) with F ( 1 / x ) but also a two-term functional equation for Ishibashi's generalization of F ( x ) , namely, Φ k ( x ) , which has been sought after for over twenty years. We further generalize Θ ( z , x ) by incorporating two Gauss sums, each associated to a Dirichlet character, and decompose it in terms of an interesting integral which involves the Fekete polynomial as well as the character polylogarithm. This result gives infinite families of functional equations of Herglotz-type integrals out of which only two, due to Choie and Kumar, were known so far. The first one among the two involves the integral J ( x ) whose special values have received a lot of attention, more recently, in the work of Muzzaffar and Williams, and in that of Radchenko and Zagier. Analytic continuation of our generalization of Θ ( z , x ) is also accomplished which allows us to obtain transformations between certain double series and Herglotz-type integrals or their explicit evaluations.},

This includes all Asplund spaces and all weakly Lindelöf determined Banach spaces of density not bigger than the continuum. However, we also show that this class includes some Banach spaces admitting ℓ ∞ as a quotient. This sheds some light on the question asked in the paper [2] of Argyros and Haydon whether all Banach spaces not containing ℓ ∞ embed in some indecomposable Banach spaces. Our method of constructing indecomposable Banach spaces above a given Banach space is a considerable modification of the method of constructing Banach spaces of continuous functions with few ⁎ operators developed before by the first-named author.},

  abstract     = {We study graphs of polynomial growth from the perspective of asymptotic geometry and descriptive set theory. The starting point of our investigation is a theorem of Krauthgamer and Lee who showed that every connected graph of polynomial growth admits an injective contraction mapping to ( Z n , ‖ ⋅ ‖ ∞ ) for some n ∈ N . We strengthen and generalize this result in a number of ways. In particular, answering a question of Papasoglu, we construct coarse embeddings from graphs of polynomial growth to Z n . Moreover, we only require n to be linear in the asymptotic polynomial growth rate of the graph; this confirms a conjecture of Levin and Linial, London, and Rabinovich “in the asymptotic sense.” (The exact form of the conjecture was refuted by Krauthgamer and Lee.) All our results are proved for Borel graphs, which allows us to settle a number of problems in descriptive combinatorics. Roughly, we prove that graphs generated by free Borel actions of Z n are universal for the class of Borel graphs of polynomial growth. This provides a general method for extending results about Z n -actions to all Borel graphs of polynomial growth. For example, an immediate consequence of our main result is that all Borel graphs of polynomial growth are hyperfinite, which answers a well-known question in the area. As another illustration, we show that Borel graphs of polynomial growth support a certain combinatorial structure called a toast. An important technical tool in our arguments is the notion of padded decomposition from computer science, which is closely related to the concept of asymptotic dimension due to Gromov. Along the way we find an alternative, probabilistic proof of a theorem of Papasoglu that graphs of asymptotic polynomial growth rate ρ < ∞ have asymptotic dimension at most ρ and establish the same bound in the Borel setting.},

  abstract     = {The purpose of this paper is to introduce a new family of semigroups—the free projection-generated regular ⁎-semigroups—and initiate their systematic study. Such a semigroup PG ( P ) is constructed from a projection algebra P , using the recent groupoid approach to regular ⁎-semigroups. The assignment P ↦ PG ( P ) is a left adjoint to the forgetful functor that maps a regular ⁎-semigroup S to its projection algebra P ( S ) . In fact, the category of projection algebras is coreflective in the category of regular ⁎-semigroups. The algebra P ( S ) uniquely determines the biordered structure of the idempotents E ( S ) , up to isomorphism, and this leads to a category equivalence between projection algebras and regular ⁎-biordered sets. As a consequence, PG ( P ) can be viewed as a quotient of the classical free idempotent-generated (regular) semigroups IG ( E ) and RIG ( E ) , where E = E ( PG ( P ) ) ; this is witnessed by a number of presentations in terms of generators and defining relations. The semigroup PG ( P ) can also be interpreted topologically, through a natural link to the fundamental groupoid of a simplicial complex explicitly constructed from P . The above theory is illustrated on a number of examples. In one direction, the free construction applied to the projection algebras of adjacency semigroups yields a new family of graph-based path semigroups. In another, it turns out that, remarkably, the Temperley–Lieb monoid T L n is the free regular ⁎-semigroup over its own projection algebra P ( T L n ) .},

This large family of inequalities unifies earlier results obtained for i = 1 and n − 1 . In these cases, isoperimetric inequalities for affine quermassintegrals, specifically the Blaschke–Santaló inequality for i = 1 and the Petty projection inequality for i = n − 1 , were proven to be the strongest inequalities. An analogous result for the intermediate degrees is established here. Finally, a new sufficient condition for the existence of maximizers for the polar volume of Minkowski valuations intertwining rigid motions reveals unexpected examples of volume inequalities having asymmetric extremizers.},

First, we show that the non-existence of 2-torsion in the framed instanton Floer homology I ♯ ( S n 3 ( K ) ; Z ) of any nonzero integral n -surgery along a knot K in S 3 would imply that K is fibered. Also, we show that I ♯ ( S r 3 ( K ) ; Z ) for any nontrivial K with r = 1 , 1 / 2 , 1 / 4 always has 2-torsion. These two results indicate that the existence of 2-torsion is expected to be a generic phenomenon for Dehn surgeries along knots. Second, we show that for genus-one knots with nontrivial Alexander polynomials and for unknotting-number-one knots, the unreduced singular instanton knot homology I ♯ ( S 3 , K ; Z ) always has 2-torsion. Finally, some crucial lemmas that help us demonstrate the existence of 2-torsion are motivated by analogous results in Heegaard Floer theory, which may be of independent interest. In particular, we show that, for a knot K in S 3 , if there is a nonzero rational number r such that the dual knot K ˜ r inside S r 3 ( K ) is Floer simple, then S r 3 ( K ) must be an L-space and K must be an L-space knot.},

A significant aspect of their continued fraction map is that the real number part of this map T is exactly the simple continued fraction map (Gauss map). In this paper we characterize the set of strictly periodic expansions of continued fraction expansions associated to this map in terms of quadratic extensions of Q ( − 3 ) in connection with the closure of { − q n q n − 1 : n ≥ 1 } , where q n , n ≥ 0 , is the denominator of the n th principal convergent of the continued fraction expansion. Moreover, we show that the closure of { − q n q n − 1 : n ≥ 1 } has positive Lebesgue measure on the complex plane C though it has infinitely many holes. This gives us that the construction of the natural extension of T on a subset of C 2 ∖ { diagonal } is equivalent to the geodesics over the hyperbolic space H 3 . Then the invariant measure for the natural extension map is given by the hyperbolic measure. Hence its projection to the complex plane is obviously the invariant measure for T .},

Here we solve this problem using the Farey complex of the ring of integers modulo N ; in fact, using more general Farey complexes we provide combinatorial models for frieze patterns over any rings whatsoever. Our strategy generalises that of the first author and of Morier-Genoud et al. for integers and that of Felikson et al. for Eisenstein integers. We also generalise results of Singerman and Strudwick on diameters of Farey graphs, we recover a theorem of Morier-Genoud on enumerating friezes over finite fields, and we classify those frieze patterns modulo N that lift to frieze patterns over the integers in terms of the topology of the corresponding Farey complexes.},

Over a field of characteristic zero or characteristic ℓ with ℓ ∤ q ( q − 1 ) , we deduce a categorical action of a Kac-Moody algebra s l I + ′ ⊕ s l I − ′ on the representation category of finite classical groups. We show that the colored weight functions O + ( u ) ( − ) , O − ( v ) ( − ) and uniform projection can distinguish all irreducible characters of finite classical groups. In particular, the colored weight functions are complete invariants of quadratic unipotent characters. We also show that using the theta correspondence and extra symmetries of categorical double quantum Heisenberg action, the Kac-Moody action on the Grothendieck group of the whole category can be determined explicitly.},

Building upon Burklund's result on the multiplicative structures of generalized Moore spectra, we prove that the module category over a K ( n ) -local commutative ring spectrum is equivalent to the limit of its base changes by a tower of generalized Moore spectra of type n . As a result, the K ( n ) -local Picard groups are endowed with a natural inverse limit topology. This topology allows us to identify the entire E 1 and E 2 -pages of a descent spectral sequence for Picard spaces of K ( n ) -local profinite Galois extensions. Our main examples are K ( n ) -local Picard groups of homotopy fixed points E n h G of the Morava E -theory E n for all closed subgroups G of the Morava stabilizer group G n . The G = G n case has been studied by Heard and Mor. At height 1, we compute Picard groups of E 1 h G for all closed subgroups G of G 1 = Z p × at all primes as a Mackey functor.},

One hence can define the associated radiation field on the future null infinity as the limit of ( r α _ , r ϕ ) along the out going null geodesics. In this paper, we show the existence of a global solution to the MKG system which scatters to any given sufficiently localized radiation field with arbitrarily large size and total charge. The result follows by studying the characteristic initial value problem for the MKG system with general large data by using gauge invariant vector field method. We in particular extend the small data result of He in [35] to a class of general large data.},

We follow the approach of [4] , where the analogue local-in-time result has been obtained for closed vortex filaments in R 3 . Next, we apply local energy weak solutions theory with a novel estimate for helical functions in non-helical domains to uniquely extend the solutions globally in time.

  abstract     = {The mass transference principle, discovered by Beresnevich and Velani (2006) [5] , is a landmark result in metric Diophantine approximation that allows us to obtain the Hausdorff measure theory of lim sup sets. Another important tool is the notion of a large intersection property, introduced and systematically studied by Falconer (1994) [9] . The former mainly focuses on passing between full (Lebesgue) measure and full Hausdorff measure statements, while the latter transfers full Hausdorff content statement to Hausdorff dimension. From this perspective, the proofs of the two results are similar but often treated in different ways. In this paper, we establish a general mass transference principle from the viewpoint of Hausdorff content, aiming to provide a unified proof for the aforementioned results. More precisely, this principle enables us to transfer the Hausdorff content bounds of a sequence of open sets E n to the full Hausdorff measure statement and the large intersection property for lim sup E n . One of the advantages of our approach is that the verification of the Hausdorff content bound does not require the construction of Cantor-like subset, resulting in a much simpler proof. As an application, we provide simpler proofs for several mass transference principles.},

We give experimental data on random such braids and find that the roots exhibit marked patterns, which we refine into precise conjectures. We then prove several results along those lines, for example that generically at least 69% of the roots are on the unit circle, which appears to be sharp. We also show there is a large root-free region near the origin. We further study the equidistribution properties of such roots by introducing a Lyapunov exponent of the Burau representation of random positive braids, and a corresponding bifurcation measure. In the spirit of Deroin and Dujardin, we conjecture that the bifurcation measure gives the limiting measure for such roots, and prove this on a region with positive limiting mass. We use tools including work of Gambaudo and Ghys on the signature function of links, for which we prove a central limit theorem.},

In this paper, we make the first significant steps towards implementing this program. Our first main result gives an explicit combinatorial formula for the Hodge numbers appearing in the composition series of a standard module in terms of the Lusztig-Vogan polynomials. Our second main result is a polarized version of the Jantzen conjecture, stating that the Jantzen forms on the composition factors are polarizations of the underlying Hodge modules. Our third main result states that, for regular Beilinson-Bernstein data, the minimal K -types of an irreducible Harish-Chandra module lie in the lowest piece of the Hodge filtration of the corresponding Hodge module. An immediate consequence of our results is a Hodge-theoretic proof of the signature multiplicity formula of [2] , which was the inspiration for this work.},

For instance, concerning the former, for τ > 0 , let S ( τ ) denote the set of ( x 1 , x 2 ) ∈ R 2 simultaneously satisfying the inequalities ‖ q x 1 ‖ < q − τ and ‖ q x 2 ‖ < e − q for infinitely many q ∈ N .

  abstract     = {Building on the notion of normed category as suggested by Lawvere, we introduce notions of Cauchy convergence and cocompleteness for such categories that differ from proposals in previous works. Key to our approach is to treat them consequentially as categories enriched in the monoidal-closed category of normed sets, i.e. , of sets which come with a norm function. Our notions lead to the anticipated outcomes for individual metric spaces or the additive groups of normed vector spaces considered as small normed categories. But they quickly become more challenging when we consider large categories, such as the categories of all semi-normed or normed vector spaces and all linear maps as morphisms, not just because norms of vectors need to be allowed to have value ∞ in order to guarantee the existence of colimits of (sufficiently many) infinite sequences. These categories, along with categories of generalized metric spaces, are the key example categories discussed in detail in this paper. Working with a general commutative quantale V as a value recipient for norms, rather than only with Lawvere's quantale R + of the extended real half-line, we observe that the categorically atypical, and perhaps even irritating, structure gap between objects and morphisms in the example categories is already present in the underlying normed category of the enriching category of V -normed sets. To show that the normed category and, in fact, all presheaf categories over it, are Cauchy cocomplete, we assume the quantale V to satisfy a couple of light alternative extra properties which, however, are satisfied in all instances of interest to us. Of utmost importance to the general theory is the fact that our notion of Cauchy convergence is subsumed by the notion of weighted colimit of enriched category theory. With this theory and, in particular, with results of Albert, Kelly and Schmitt, we are able to prove that all V -normed categories have correct-size Cauchy cocompletions, for V satisfying our light alternative assumptions. We also show that our notions are suitable to prove a Banach Fixed Point Theorem for contractive endofunctors of Cauchy cocomplete normed categories.},

This can be interpreted through an ergodic lens for Reeb flows transverse to a surface of section. Our results also allow us to deduce an upper bound on the mean action of periodic orbits of naturally associated classes of area preserving diffeomorphisms of the associated Seifert surfaces of genus ( p − 1 ) ( q − 1 ) / 2 in terms of the Calabi invariant, without the need for genericity or Hamiltonian hypotheses. Our proofs utilize knot filtered embedded contact homology, which was first introduced and computed by Hutchings for the standard transverse unknot in the irrational ellipsoids and further developed in our previous work. We continue our development of nontoric methods for embedded contact homology and establish the knot filtration on the embedded contact homology chain complex of the standard tight three-sphere with respect to positive T ( p , q ) torus knots, where there are nonvanishing differentials.

Our proofs follow a connection-oriented approach and also highlight the fact that in the low regularity regime, the regularity of the bundle and connection are intertwined.

As a consequence, we show that the equivariant stable motivic homotopy theory of a scheme with an action of a linearly reductive group is equivalent to that of the fixed locus, upon inverting appropriate maps, namely the Euler classes of representations without trivial summands. We also discuss consequences for equivariant cohomology theories obtained using Borel's construction. This recovers most known forms of the concentration theorem in algebraic geometry, and yields generalizations valid beyond the setting of actions of diagonalizable groups on one hand, and that of oriented cohomology theories on the other hand. Finally, we derive a version of Smith theory for motivic cohomology, following the approach of Dwyer–Wilkerson in topology.},

  abstract     = {In 1975, Erdős asked for the maximum number of edges that an n -vertex graph can have if it does not contain two edge-disjoint cycles on the same vertex set. It is known that Turán-type results can be used to prove an upper bound of n 3 / 2 + o ( 1 ) . However, this approach cannot give an upper bound better than Ω ( n 3 / 2 ) . We show that there is an absolute constant t and some constant c = c ( k ) such that for each k ≥ 2 , every n -vertex graph with at least c n ( log ⁡ n ) t edges contains k pairwise edge-disjoint cycles with the same vertex set, resolving this old problem in a strong form up to a polylogarithmic factor. The well-known construction of Pyber, Rödl and Szemerédi of graphs without 4-regular subgraphs shows that there are n -vertex graphs with Ω ( n log ⁡ log ⁡ n ) edges which do not contain two cycles with the same vertex set, so the polylogarithmic term in our result cannot be completely removed. Our proof combines a variety of techniques including sublinear expanders, absorption and a novel tool for regularisation, which is of independent interest. Among other applications, this tool can be used to regularise an expander while still preserving certain key expansion properties.},

According to the literature, the classification is complete apart from the question of whether M contains maximal subgroups that are almost simple with socle PSL 2 ( 13 ) . However, this conclusion relies on reported claims, with unpublished proofs, that M has no maximal subgroups that are almost simple with socle PSL 2 ( 8 ) , PSL 2 ( 16 ) , or PSU 3 ( 4 ) . The aim of this paper is to settle all of these questions, and thereby complete the solution to the maximal subgroup problem for M , and for the sporadic simple groups as a whole. Specifically, we prove the existence of two new maximal subgroups of M , isomorphic to the automorphism groups of PSL 2 ( 13 ) and PSU 3 ( 4 ) , and we establish that M has no almost simple maximal subgroup with socle PSL 2 ( 8 ) or PSL 2 ( 16 ) . We also correct the claim that M has no almost simple maximal subgroup with socle PSU 3 ( 4 ) , and provide evidence that the maximal subgroup PSL 2 ( 59 ) (constructed in 2004) does not exist. Our proofs are supported by reproducible computations carried out using the publicly available Python package mmgroup for computing with M recently developed by M. Seysen. We provide explicit generators for our newly discovered maximal subgroups of M in mmgroup format.},

In particular, we prove that the space of point modules of every prime monomial algebra with Hilbert series 1 / ( 1 − t ) 2 —which is thus thought of as a ‘monomial P 1 ’—is isomorphic to a union of a classical projective line with a Cantor set. While there is a continuum of monomial P 1 's with non-equivalent graded module categories, they all share isomorphic parametrizing spaces of point modules. In contrast, free algebras are geometrically rigid, and are characterized up to isomorphism from their spaces of point modules. Furthermore, we derive enumerative and ring-theoretic consequences from our analysis. In particular, we show that the formal power series counting the irreducible components of the parametrizing spaces of truncated point modules of finitely presented monomial algebras are rational functions, and classify isomorphisms and automorphisms of projectively simple monomial algebras.},

The classifying space can also be generalized in a different direction: it extends from categories to bicategories as the geometric realization of the geometric nerve. This paper introduces a hybrid of the two ideas: an iterated magnitude homology theory for categories with a second- or higher-order enrichment. This encompasses, for example, groups equipped with extra structure such as a partial ordering or a bi-invariant metric. In the case of a strict 2-category, iterated magnitude homology recovers the homology of the classifying space; we investigate its content and behaviour when interpreted for partially ordered groups, normed groups, and strict n -categories for n > 2 .},

Additionally, we establish a comprehensive metrical theory for Hurwitz continued fractions. Let Φ : N → R > 0 be any function. For any complex number z and n ∈ N , let a n ( z ) denote the n th partial quotient in the Hurwitz continued fraction of z . One of the main results of this paper is the computation of the Hausdorff dimension of the set E ( Φ ) : = { z ∈ C : | a n ( z ) | ≥ Φ ( n ) for infinitely many n ∈ N } .

The proof is given by conceptualizing the properties of all three models into a Chebyshev system and by proving its uniqueness. In addition, we show that the classes of the Cooper–Hogancamp projectors in the quantum horizontal trace coincide with those of the Cooper–Krushkal projectors on the passing through strands.

  abstract     = {We give an explicit bijective correspondence between nonzero pairs of complex numbers, which we regard as spinors or spin vectors, and horospheres in 3-dimensional hyperbolic space decorated with certain spinorial directions. This correspondence builds upon work of Penrose–Rindler and Penner. We show that the natural bilinear form on spin vectors describes a certain complex-valued distance between spin-decorated horospheres, generalising Penner's lambda lengths to 3 dimensions. From this, we derive several applications. We show that the complex lambda lengths in a hyperbolic ideal tetrahedron satisfy a Ptolemy equation. We also obtain correspondences between certain spaces of hyperbolic ideal polygons and certain Grassmannian spaces, under which lambda lengths correspond to Plücker coordinates, illuminating the connection between Grassmannians, hyperbolic polygons, and type A cluster algebras.},

  abstract     = {For integers k ≥ 1 and n ≥ 2 k + 1 , the Kneser graph K ( n , k ) has as vertices all k -element subsets of an n -element ground set, and an edge between any two disjoint sets. It has been conjectured since the 1970s that all Kneser graphs admit a Hamilton cycle, with one notable exception, namely the Petersen graph K ( 5 , 2 ) . This problem received considerable attention in the literature, including a recent solution for the sparsest case n = 2 k + 1 . The main contribution of this paper is to prove the conjecture in full generality. We also extend this Hamiltonicity result to all connected generalized Johnson graphs (except the Petersen graph). The generalized Johnson graph J ( n , k , s ) has as vertices all k -element subsets of an n -element ground set, and an edge between any two sets whose intersection has size exactly s . Clearly, we have K ( n , k ) = J ( n , k , 0 ) , i.e., generalized Johnson graphs include Kneser graphs as a special case. Our results imply that all known natural families of vertex-transitive graphs defined by intersecting set systems have a Hamilton cycle, which settles an interesting special case of Lovász' conjecture on Hamilton cycles in vertex-transitive graphs from 1970. Our main technical innovation is to study cycles in Kneser graphs by a kinetic system of multiple gliders that move at different speeds and that interact over time, reminiscent of the gliders in Conway's Game of Life, and to analyze this system combinatorially and via linear algebra.},

A sentence in the language of set theory is locally verifiable if it asserts the existence of a level V α of the cumulative hierarchy of sets with some first-order property; this is equivalent to being Σ 2 in the Lévy hierarchy. A sentence is V α -satisfiable if it can be forced without changing V α , and V-satisfiable if it is V α -satisfiable for all ordinals α . The Σ 2 -Potentialist Principle, introduced by Woodin, asserts that every V -satisfiable locally verifiable sentence is true. We show in Theorem 6.2 that the Σ 2 -Potentialist Principle is consistent relative to a supercompact cardinal. We accomplish this by generalizing Gitik's method of iterating distributive forcings by embedding them into Príkry-type forcings [6, Section 6.4] ; our generalization, Theorem 5.2 , works for forcings that add no bounded subsets to a strongly compact cardinal, which requires a completely different proof. Finally, using the concept of mutual stationarity, we show in Theorem 7.5 that the Σ 2 -Potentialist Principle implies the consistency of a Woodin cardinal. 3},

In this paper, we develop a novel method for computing these skein modules. We show that if the skein module S ( M , Q [ A ± 1 ] ) of M is tame (e.g. finitely generated over Q [ A ± 1 ] ), and the S L ( 2 , C ) -character scheme is reduced, then the dimension dim Q ( A ) ⁡ S ( M , Q ( A ) ) is the number of closed points in this character scheme. This, in particular, verifies a conjecture in the literature relating dim Q ( A ) ⁡ S ( M , Q ( A ) ) to the Abouzaid-Manolescu S L ( 2 , C ) -Floer theoretic invariants, for infinite families of 3-manifolds. We prove a criterion for reducedness of character varieties of closed 3-manifolds and use it to compute the skein modules of Dehn fillings of ( 2 , 2 n + 1 ) -torus knots and of the figure-eight knot. The later family gives the first instance of computations of skein modules for closed hyperbolic 3-manifolds. We also prove that the skein modules of rational homology spheres have dimension at least 1 over Q ( A ) .},

In order to do this, we codify ( ∞ , 1 ) -categories in terms of quiver representations in them. By examining a universal instance of such Hochschild homology, we explicitly identify its natural symmetries, and construct a non-stable version of the cyclotomic trace map. Along the way we give a unified account of the cyclic, paracyclic, and epicyclic categories. We also prove that this gives a combinatorial description of the n = 1 case of factorization homology as presented in [4] , which parametrizes ( ∞ , 1 ) -categories by solidly 1-framed stratified spaces.},

As a primary application, we propose a recursive method for computing the trace (the hyperbolic cosine of the length) of orthogeodesics and establish the existence of surfaces where the trace of each orthogeodesic is an integer. These surfaces and their orthogeodesics are closely related to integral Apollonian circle packings. Notably, we found a new type of root-flipping that transitions between roots in different quadratic equations of a certain type, with Vieta root-flipping as a special case. Finally, we provide a combinatorial proof of Basmajian's identity for hyperbolic surfaces, akin to Bowditch's combinatorial proof of the McShane identity.},

This universal cohomology theory is known as Quillen cohomology. In any setting, Quillen cohomology of a given object is classified by its cotangent complex. The main purpose of this paper is to study Quillen cohomology of operads enriched over a general base category. Our main result provides an explicit formula for computing Quillen cohomology of enriched operads, based on a procedure of taking certain infinitesimal models of their cotangent complexes. Furthermore, we propose a natural construction of the twisted arrow ∞-categories of simplicial operads. We then assert that the cotangent complex of a simplicial operad can be represented as a spectrum valued functor on its twisted arrow ∞-category. When working in stable base categories such as chain complexes and spectra, Francis and Lurie proved the existence of a fiber sequence relating the cotangent complex and Hochschild complex of an E n -algebra, from which a conjecture of Kontsevich is verified. We establish an analogous fiber sequence for the operad E n itself, in the topological setting.},

They are all better upper bounds for the opposite Findim. Precisely, we prove Findim Λ op = edell Λ ≤ ddell Λ ( or sub - ddell Λ ) ≤ dell Λ and provide examples where the last inequality is strict (including the recent example from [16] where dell Λ = ∞ , but ddell Λ = 1 = Findim Λ op ). We further enhance the connection between the findim conjecture and tilting theory by showing finitely generated modules with finite derived delooping level form a torsion-free class F . Therefore, studying the corresponding torsion pair ( T , F ) will shed more light on the little finitistic dimension. Lastly, we relate the delooping level to the ϕ -dimension ϕ dim, a popular upper bound for findim, and recover a sufficient condition for the findim conjecture given in [5] .},

  abstract     = {For positive integers n ⩾ s > r , the Turán function T ( n , s , r ) is the smallest size of an r -graph with n vertices such that every set of s vertices contains at least one edge. Also, define the Turán density t ( s , r ) as the limit of T ( n , s , r ) / ( n r ) as n → ∞ . The question of estimating these parameters received a lot of attention after it was first raised by Turán in 1941. A trivial lower bound is t ( s , r ) ⩾ 1 / ( s s − r ) . In the 1990s, de Caen conjectured that r ⋅ t ( r + 1 , r ) → ∞ as r → ∞ and offered 500 Canadian dollars for resolving this question. We disprove this conjecture by showing more strongly that for every integer R ⩾ 1 there is μ R (in fact, μ R can be taken to grow as ( 1 + o ( 1 ) ) R ln ⁡ R ) such that t ( r + R , r ) ⩽ ( μ R + o ( 1 ) ) / ( r + R R ) as r → ∞ , that is, the trivial lower bound is tight for every R up to a multiplicative constant μ R .},

These stability problems can all be shown to be specific instances of the following problem: given a differential graded Lie algebra g , a differential graded Lie subalgebra h of finite codimension in g and a Maurer-Cartan element Q ∈ h 1 , when are Maurer-Cartan elements near Q in g gauge equivalent to elements of h 1 ?

Moreover, we show that these spaces are not K -equivalent, even though they are natural blow-ups at the unique cusps and have the same cohomology. This is analogous to the work of Casalaina-Martin-Grushevsky-Hulek-Laza on the moduli space of cubic surfaces. The moduli spaces of ordinary stable maps, that is the Fulton-MacPherson compactification of the configuration space of points on P 1 , play an important role in the proof. We further relate our computations to new developments in the minimal model program and the recent work of Odaka. We briefly discuss other cases of moduli space of points on P 1 where a similar behaviour can be observed, hinting at a more general, but not yet fully understood phenomenon.},

  abstract     = {Coboundary expansion (with F 2 coefficients), and variations on it, have been the focus of intensive research in the last two decades. It was used to study random complexes, property testing, and above all Gromov's topological overlapping property. In part I of this paper, we extended the notion of coboundary expansion (and its variations) to cochains with permutation coefficients , equipped with the normalized Hamming distance. We showed that this gives a unified language for studying covering stability of complexes, as well as stability of group homomorphisms — a topic that drew a lot of attention in recent years. In this part, we extend the theory to the permutation coefficients setting. This gives some new results, even for F 2 coefficients, opens several new directions of research, and suggests a pattern to proving the existence of non-sofic groups. Along the way, we solve the dimension 2 case of a problem of Gromov, exhibiting a family of bounded degree coboundary expanders with F 2 coefficients.},

We show that the derived direct image of the dualizing complex along this morphism is pure, and admits a decomposition in the sense of the Beilinson–Bernstein–Deligne–Gabber decomposition theorem. We introduce a new perverse filtration on the Borel–Moore homology of M ( Π Q ) , using this decomposition. We show that the zeroth piece of the resulting filtration on the cohomological Hall algebra built out of the Borel–Moore homology of M ( Π Q ) is isomorphic to the universal enveloping algebra of an associated BPS Lie algebra g Π Q . This Lie algebra is defined via the Kontsevich–Soibelman theory of critical cohomological Hall algebras for 3-Calabi–Yau categories. We then lift this Lie algebra to a Lie algebra object in the category of perverse sheaves on the coarse moduli space of Π Q -modules, and use this algebra structure to prove results about the summands appearing in the above decomposition theorem. In particular, we prove that the intersection cohomology of singular spaces of semistable Π Q -modules provide “cuspidal cohomology” – a conjecturally complete canonical subspace of generators for g Π Q .},

Our rule is formulated in terms of pipe puzzles, incorporating the structures of both bumpless pipe dreams and classical puzzles. As direct applications, we recover the separated-descent puzzle formula by Knutson and Zinn-Justin (by setting y = t ) and the bumpless pipe dream model of double Grothendieck polynomials by Weigandt (by setting v = id and x = t ).

This extends and complements recent results for spin 4–manifolds. Our examples span virtually all possible intersection forms, both even and odd, indefinite and definite, and include many irreducible 4–manifolds. To derive these examples, we study multi-twists, projective twists, and multi-reflections, which are all mapping classes supported around collections of embedded spheres and projective planes. Our obstructions to Nielsen realization are based on the work of Konno. We investigate projective twists in further detail, and notably, employ them to show that, for many closed symplectic 4–manifolds, the symplectic Torelli group is not generated by squared Dehn twists.},

We show that the survival time is governed by high-density local configurations. In particular, we show that there is a long string of high-degree vertices on which the infection lasts for time n λ 2 + o ( 1 ) . To establish a matching upper bound, we introduce a modified version of the contact process which ignores infections that do not lead to further infections and allows for a sharper recursive analysis on branching process trees, the local-weak limit of the graph.

  abstract     = {Fix a finite-dimensional simple Lie algebra g and let g J ⊆ g be a Lie subalgebra coming from a Dynkin diagram inclusion. Then, the corresponding restriction functor is not essentially surjective on finite-dimensional simple g J –modules. In this article, we study Finkelberg–Tsymbaliuk's shifted quantum affine algebras U q μ ( g ) and the associated categories O μ (defined by Hernandez). In particular, we introduce natural subalgebras U q ν ( g J ) ⊆ U q μ ( g ) and obtain a functor R J from O s h = ⨁ μ O μ to ⨁ ν ( U q ν ( g J ) -Mod ) using the canonical restriction functors. We then establish that R J is essentially surjective on finite-dimensional simple objects by constructing notable preimages that we call inflations . We conjecture that all simple objects in O J s h (which is the analog of O s h for the subalgebras U q ν ( g J ) ) admit some inflation and prove this for g of type A–B or g J a direct sum of copies of sl 2 and sl 3 . We finally apply our results to deduce certain R-matrices and examples of cluster structures over Grothendieck rings .},

We also prove the stable ergodicity of certain algebraic actions, including the natural action of a generic pair of matrices near the identity on a sphere of arbitrary dimension. These are consequences of the quasi-conformal blender , a local and stable mechanism/phenomenon introduced in this paper, which encapsulates our method for proving stable local ergodicity by providing quasi-conformal orbits with fine controlled geometry.

Since this matches the growth rate Θ ( n 1 / ( d − 1 ) ) for the generic (non-border) subrank recently established by Derksen-Makam-Zuiddam, we find that the generic border subrank has the same growth rate. In our proof, we use a generalisation of the Hilbert-Mumford criterion that we believe will be of independent interest.},

This calls for a generalised notion of compact Hausdorff space whose points carry an arithmetic character to be preserved by continuous maps. The arithmetic character of a point is (the complete isomorphism invariant of) a metrically complete additive subgroup of the real numbers containing 1—namely, either 1 n Z for an integer n = 1 , 2 , … , or the whole of R . The main result needed to establish the extended duality theorem is a substantial generalisation of Urysohn's Lemma to such “arithmetic” compact Hausdorff spaces. The original duality is obtained by considering the full subcategory of spaces every point of which is assigned the entire group of real numbers. In the Introduction we indicate motivations from and connections with the theory of dimension groups.},

Our new description of unital operads allows an illuminating comparison between the two-sided monadic bar constructions used in such applications and “classical” monoidal two-sided bar constructions.

The metric result is generalized to other measures satisfying a certain Fourier decay assumption. Both upper bounds are optimal up to a factor of logarithmic order, and the latter result improves a recent result of Chow and Technau.

This paper extends this property to higher order and uses it to generalize two classic properties from order-1 to order-2: (1) among the complete level-2 hypertriangulations of a generic point set in R 2 , the order-2 Delaunay triangulation lexicographically maximizes the sorted angle vector; (2) among the maximal level-2 hypertriangulations of a generic point set in R 2 , the order-2 Delaunay triangulation is the only one that has the local angle property. We also use our method of establishing (2) to give a new short proof of the angle vector optimality for the (order-1) Delaunay triangulation. For order-1, both properties have been instrumental in numerous applications of Delaunay triangulations, and we expect that their generalization will make order-2 Delaunay triangulations more attractive to applications as well.},

In this paper we provide a unifying method to construct Varopoulos type extensions of BMO and L p boundary functions. In particular, we show that a) if f ∈ BMO ( ∂ Ω ) , there exists F ∈ C ∞ ( Ω ) such that dist ( x , Ω c ) | ∇ F ( x ) | is uniformly bounded in Ω and the Carleson functional of dist ( x , Ω c ) s − n | ∇ F ( x ) | as well the sharp non-tangential maximal function of F are uniformly bounded on ∂Ω with norms controlled by the BMO-norm of f , and F → f in a certain non-tangential sense H s | ∂ Ω -almost everywhere; b) if f ¯ ∈ L p ( ∂ Ω ) , 1 < p ≤ ∞ , there exists F ¯ ∈ C ∞ ( Ω ) such that the non-tangential maximal functions of F ¯ and dist ( ⋅ , Ω c ) | ∇ F ¯ | as well as the Carleson functional of dist ( ⋅ , Ω c ) s − n | ∇ F ¯ | are in L p ( ∂ Ω ) with norms controlled by the L p -norm of f ¯ , and F ¯ → f ¯ in some non-tangential sense H s | ∂ Ω -almost everywhere. If, in addition, the boundary function is Lipschitz with compact support, then both F and F ¯ can be constructed so that they are also Lipschitz on Ω ‾ and converge to the boundary data continuously. The latter results hold without the additional assumption of the pointwise John condition. Finally, for elliptic systems of equations in divergence form with merely bounded complex-valued coefficients, we show some connections between the solvability of Poisson problems with interior data in the appropriate Carleson or tent spaces and the solvability of Dirichlet problem with L p and BMO boundary data.},

The Borel subalgebra B constructed in [18] is in fact a regular exact Borel subalgebra as defined in [7] . Later, Conde [9] showed that given a quasi-hereditary algebra ( R , ≤ R ) with a basic regular exact Borel subalgebra B and a Morita equivalent quasi-hereditary algebra ( R ′ , ≤ R ′ ) with a basic regular exact Borel subalgebra B ′ , the algebras R and R ′ are isomorphic, and Külshammer and Miemietz [20] showed that there is even an isomorphism φ : R → R ′ such that φ ( B ) = B ′ . In this article, we show that if R = R ′ , then φ can be chosen to be an inner automorphism. Moreover, instead of just proving this for regular exact Borel subalgebras of quasi-hereditary algebras, we generalize this to an appropriate class of subalgebras of arbitrary finite-dimensional algebras. As an application, we show that if ( A , ≤ A ) is a finite-dimensional algebra and G is a finite group acting on A via automorphisms, then under some natural compatibility conditions, there is a Morita equivalent quasi-hereditary algebra ( R , ≤ R ) with a basic regular exact Borel subalgebra B such that g ( B ) = B for every g ∈ G .},

  abstract     = {In this paper we study multiplication operators on Bergman spaces of high dimensional bounded domains and those von Neumann algebras induced by them via the geometry of domains and function theory of their symbols. In particular, using local inverses and L a 2 -removability, we show that for a holomorphic proper map Φ = ( ϕ 1 , ϕ 2 , ⋯ , ϕ d ) on a bounded domain Ω in C d , the dimension of the von Neumann algebra V ⁎ ( Φ , Ω ) consisting of bounded operators on the Bergman space L a 2 ( Ω ) , which commute with both M ϕ j and its adjoint M ϕ j ⁎ for each j , equals the number of components of the complex manifold S Φ = { ( z , w ) ∈ Ω 2 : Φ ( z ) = Φ ( w ) , z ∉ Φ − 1 ( Φ ( Z ) ) } , where Z is the zero variety of the Jacobian J Φ of Φ. This extends the main result in [14] in high dimensional complex domains. Moreover we show that the von Neumann algebra V ⁎ ( Φ , Ω ) may not be abelian in general although Douglas, Putinar and Wang [15] showed that V ⁎ ( Φ , D ) for the unit disk D is abelian.},

These theories are defined on categories of cobordisms which are decorated by ribbon graphs and cohomology classes and take values in categories of graded super vector spaces. Computations in these theories are enabled by a detailed study of the representation theory of U q E ( gl ( 1 | 1 ) ) . We argue that by restricting to subcategories of integral weight modules we obtain topological quantum field theories which are mathematical models of Chern–Simons theories with gauge supergroups psl ( 1 | 1 ) and U ( 1 | 1 ) coupled to background flat C × -connections, as studied in the physics literature by Rozansky–Saleur and Mikhaylov. In particular, we match Verlinde formulae and mapping class group actions on state spaces of non-generic tori with results in the physics literature. We also obtain explicit descriptions of state spaces of generic surfaces, including their graded dimensions, which go beyond results in the physics literature.},

By mapping feasible points of this infinite-dimensional linear program into a finite-dimensional problem via discrete reduction, we provide a general method to obtain dual bounds on the Cohn-Elkies linear program. This reduces the number of variables to be finite, enabling computer optimization techniques to be applied. Using this method, we prove that the Cohn-Elkies bound cannot come close to the best packing densities known in dimensions 3 ≤ d ≤ 13 except for the solved case d = 8 . In particular, our dual bounds show the Cohn-Elkies bound is unable to solve the 3, 4, and 5 dimensional sphere packing problems.},

In this paper we study recurrence rates for the dynamical system ( Σ A , σ ) that hold μ -almost surely. In particular, given a function ψ : N → N we are interested in the following set R ψ = { i ∈ Σ A : i n + 1 … i n + ψ ( n ) + 1 = i 1 … i ψ ( n ) for infinitely many n ∈ N } . We provide sufficient conditions for μ ( R ψ ) = 1 and sufficient conditions for μ ( R ψ ) = 0 . As a corollary of these results, we discover a new critical threshold where the measure of R ψ transitions from zero to one. This threshold was previously unknown even in the special case of a non-uniform Bernoulli measure defined on the full shift. The proofs of our results combine ideas from Probability Theory and Thermodynamic Formalism. In our final section we apply our results to the study of dynamics on self-similar sets.},

  abstract     = {In this paper we paralinearize the contour dynamics equation for sharp-fronts of α -SQG, for any α ∈ ( 0 , 1 ) ∪ ( 1 , 2 ) , close to a circular vortex. This turns out to be a quasi-linear Hamiltonian PDE. The key idea relies on a novel desingularization of the Hamiltonian vector field which is a convolution integral operator with nonlinear singular kernel. After deriving the asymptotic expansion of the linear frequencies of oscillations at the vortex disk and verifying the absence of three wave interactions, we prove that, in the most singular cases α ∈ ( 1 , 2 ) , any initial vortex patch which is ε -close to the disk exists for a time interval of size at least ∼ ε − 2 . This quadratic lifespan result relies on a paradifferential Birkhoff normal form reduction and exploits cancellations arising from the Hamiltonian nature of the equation. This is the first normal form long time existence result of sharp fronts.},

Suppose that F has isolated singularities and that its Poincaré metric is complete. This is the case for a very large class of singularities, namely, non-degenerate and saddle-nodes in dimension 2. Let μ be an ergodic harmonic measure on F . We show that the upper and lower local hyperbolic entropies of μ are leafwise constant almost everywhere. Moreover, we show that the entropy of μ is at least 2.},

These identities hold over a large space of metrics including ones with hyperbolic cone points, and in particular, show how to extend a result of the first author to surfaces with cusps. One of the main ingredients in the approach is a partition of the set of orthogeodesics into sets depending on their dynamical behavior, which can be understood geometrically by relating them to geodesics on orbifold surfaces. These orbifold surfaces turn out to be exactly on the boundary of the space in which the underlying identity holds.},

  abstract     = {This paper is devoted to understanding curves X over a number field k that possess infinitely many solutions in extensions of k of degree at most d ; such solutions are the titular low degree points. For d = 2 , 3 it is known ( [9] , [2] ) that such curves, after a base change to k ‾ , admit a map of degree at most d onto P 1 or an elliptic curve. For d ⩾ 4 the analogous statement was shown to be false [3] . We prove that once the genus of X is high enough, the low degree points still have geometric origin: they can be obtained as pullbacks of low degree points from a lower genus curve. We introduce a discrete-geometric invariant attached to such curves: a family of subspace configurations, with many interesting properties. This structure gives a natural alternative construction of curves from [3] . As an application of our methods, we obtain a classification of such curves over k for d = 2 , 3 , and a classification over k ¯ for d = 4 , 5 .},

We show that, up to profinite completion, they all yield the same result, and thus arrive at an unambiguous definition of the profinite homotopy type of a log scheme. Specifically, in [8] , we define this to be the profinite étale homotopy type of the infinite root stack, and show that, over C , this agrees up to profinite completion with the Kato-Nakayama space. Other possible candidates are the profinite shape of the Kummer étale site X k e ´ t , or of the representable étale site of . Our main result is that all of these notions agree, and moreover the profinite étale homotopy type of the infinite root stack is not sensitive to whether or not it is viewed as a pro-system in stacks, or as an actual stack (by taking the limit of the pro-system). We furthermore show that in the log regular setting, all these notions also agree with the étale homotopy type of the classical locus X triv (up to an appropriate completion). We deduce that, over an arbitrary locally Noetherian base, the étale homotopy type of G m N agrees with that of B μ ∞ N up to completion.},
