  abstract     = {Majority subspace clustering (SC) algorithms depend on one or more hyperparameters that need to be tuned for the SC algorithms to achieve high clustering performance. This is often performed using grid-search, assuming that held out set is available. In some domains, such as medicine, this assumption does not hold true in many cases. To address this problem, we propose an approach to label-independent hyperparameter optimization by applying the SC algorithm to the data and use the resulting cluster assignments as pseudo-labels to compute clustering quality metrics (e.g., accuracy (ACC) or normalized mutual information (NMI)) across a predefined hyperparameter grid. Assuming that ACC (or NMI) is a smooth function of hyperparameter values, it is possible to select subintervals of hyperparameters, which are then iteratively further split into halves or thirds until a relative error criterion is satisfied. In principle, the hyperparameters of any SC algorithm can be tuned using the proposed method. We demonstrate this approach on five single-view SC algorithms and two multi-view SC algorithms, comparing the achieved performance with their oracle versions across six datasets for single-view algorithms and three datasets for multi-view algorithms. The proposed method typically achieves clustering performance that is up to 7 % lower than that of the oracle versions. We also enhance the interpretability of the proposed method by visualizing subspace bases, estimated from the computed clustering partitions. This aids in the initial selection of the hyperparameter search space.},

  abstract     = {Imbalanced regression in tabular data, where target variables exhibit highly skewed distributions, causes standard models to perform poorly on rare but critical values. While recent deep learning approaches have addressed this challenge, they primarily employ distribution smoothing or loss reweighting and were designed for image data, showing limited effectiveness on tabular datasets. Unlike existing methods that rely solely on smoothing or reweighting, we propose Calibrated Mixup, a novel framework that generates high-fidelity synthetic samples for underrepresented regions through a dual refinement strategy. Our method first discretizes targets into bins and generates synthetic samples via targeted mixup using either target-proximity or feature-similarity for donor selection. The key innovation lies in our dual refinement: we ensure global statistical consistency via MMD-based calibration that matches sample moments, followed by local structural fidelity enforcement through Soft Nearest Neighbor (SNN) loss regularization. This combination guarantees synthetic samples are both statistically plausible and structurally coherent within the data manifold. Extensive experiments on seven tabular datasets demonstrate our method achieves 10–20 % MAE reduction compared to state-of-the-art baselines, with particularly strong improvements on highly imbalanced datasets. Our approach also enhances existing methods when used as preprocessing, validating its versatility.},

These issues mislead training and distract the learning focus, impeding the extraction of discriminative features. The efficiency-reliability trade-off commonly encountered in unsupervised learning also compromises representation learning. To address these drawbacks, we introduce a novel paradigm, dubbed adaptive sparse contrastive learning (ASCL), that sparsely constructs informative contrastive pairs for each pseudo-class in a mini-batch, rather than establishing dense pairs for every instance. To mitigate the efficiency-reliability trade-off, we propose two complementary sparse contrastive learning objectives: the composite sparse contrastive loss (CSCL) and the weighted sparse contrastive loss (WSCL). These objectives adaptively modulate the pulling strength within classes based on the changing intra-cluster discrepancies, balancing aggressive exploration and conservatism, thus facilitating the exploration of fine-grained and informative identity cues. Our proposed ASCL enhances representation learning without additional overhead. Extensive experiments on three large-scale object re-identification datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed ASCL. In particular, ASCL achieves new state-of-the-art results on the challenging MSMT17 dataset, with 46.6 % mAP and 76.4 % top-1 accuracy.

  abstract     = {Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) is an implicit representation method for modeling scenes from multi-view images. NeRF synthesizes views by sampling rays within the scene and continuously integrating points along the ray paths. This approach represents the final color and density of each ray as pixel values in the view, enabling the generation of high-quality image compositions. Although this method can faithfully reconstruct scenes, it performs suboptimally for specular reconstruction. Inspired by probe techniques in game engines and spherical harmonics in computer graphics, our work introduces spherical harmonics probes to capture environmental lighting and specular anisotropic information, thereby efficiently reconstructing surface details. Additionally, we incorporate a spherical harmonics attention mechanism and an anisotropy loss function to enable the model to accurately represent view information from various angles. This method is referred to as SS-NeRF and has been validated on the Blender, Shiny Blender, Shiny Real, and Mip-NeRF 360 datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that SS-NeRF can effectively capture appearance details, simulate realistic lighting and reflection information, and more closely approximate the lighting details found in the real world.},

To address this gap, we propose Cro ss- M odal D ynamic B rain N etwork Classification for Neuropsychiatric Diseases ( CroMDBN ), a novel framework that leverages adaptive spatio-temporal encoding and multi-knowledge prompts to enhance classification performance in neuropsychiatric diseases. Unlike traditional models that rely on single-modality disease patterns, CroMDBN learns shared and distinct features across modalities, enabling robust cross-modal generalization. The framework introduces an adaptive sliding-window dual-path approach to capture temporal connectivity variations, enhanced by dynamic connectivity mapping and temporal attention. Additionally, CroMDBN integrates diverse knowledge sources, including knowledge graphs and insights from ChatGPT, to enhance classification through better brain connectivity modeling. Disease-specific positional encodings improve the representation of complex spatial and temporal dependencies. A contrastive learning-based clustering strategy broadens feature representations, improving generalization and robustness. Extensive experiments on ABIDE, ADNI, and Rest-meta-MDD datasets demonstrate that CroMDBN outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving mean AUC scores of 78.24 %, 85.56 %, and 70.04 %, and F1 scores of 73.15 %, 91.91 %, and 66.06 %, respectively.

  abstract     = {Recent breakthroughs in AI-generated content (AIGC) technologies have made it possible to decode and reconstruct visual stimuli from electroencephalography (EEG) signals. Most existing methods extract global semantic information from EEG signals as the condition embedding to control a generative AI model, enabling it to generate candidate images that maintain global semantic consistency with those observed by subjects. However, relying solely on a global conditional control for image generation makes it difficult to recover the local spatial locations of objects and the spatial relationships among objects, which results in substantial discrepancies between the reconstructed images and the corresponding perceived ones. To address this issue, this paper proposes an EEG-driven natural image reconstruction with regional semantic awareness, termed “EEG-RegionalDiff”. Specifically, it first extracts semantic- and location-aware latent EEG codes from EEG signals through the joint learning of masked EEG signal recovery and EEG-based visual classification. These latent EEG codes are then embedded into the latent diffusion model (LDM) as conditions to drive the reconstruction of the visual stimuli with regional semantic awareness. To enhance the local control capabilities over the semantic regions, the LDM is fine-tuned by introducing regional semantic maps as conditional constraints. Quantitative and qualitative comparison experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed EEG-RegionalDiff method, not only in achieving region-level semantic alignment but also in maintaining semantic dependencies among different object regions.

  abstract     = {Time series analysis has potential to capture the essence of dynamic changes over time, and is widely used for analyzing and predicting future trends in data arranged in chronological order, such as Electroencephalogram (EEG) based cognitive workload monitoring and healthcare. One of the current research challenges lies in effectively extracting temporal and frequency features from global and local perspectives and efficiently fusing these features. This paper proposes a d ynamic t emporal- f requency p arallel graph neural net work (DTFPNet) that learns features from both the time and frequency domains, explicitly modeling the relationships among variables and capturing short-term and long-term interactions. Specifically, two types of learnable graphs are used to dynamically represent the relationships among different spatial nodes. These two types of learnable graphs are continually trained in an end-to-end manner throughout the entire training stage. For feature representation in the frequency domain, rather than adopting the mainstream Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT), which learns in the complex field and incurs greater computational complexity, an efficient Spectral Learning Module (SLM) based on the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) is applied in real-number field to explore global patterns in the frequency domain. In addition, to enhance feature representations, two different types of global filters—real-value-based and Gated-Recurrent-Unit-based, are tailored for datasets with significant variability. Importantly, we argue that time and frequency features extracted at the same time steps provide effective distinctive representations of sequence signals. Experimental results demonstrate that our DTFPNet achieves superior performance on 52 univariate and multivariate datasets. Specifically, compared to the current state-of-the-art, our DTFPNet on 23 univariate datasets shows a significant average improvement of 6.4 %.},

Deep learning approaches have gained prominence in SAR target recognition and received extensive attention. However, these methods often struggle when data is scarce, leading to insufficient training and challenges in effective feature extraction. To address this limitation, we propose a less data-dependent feature extraction framework. Specifically, we introduce the dual-tree complex wavelet transform (DTCWT) to capture multi-frequency feature details of SAR images, integrated with convolutional neural network. This approach enables effective extraction of high- and low-frequency information. By leveraging the characteristics of these frequency features, low-frequency subbands are used to emphasize the global structural features in the images, and high-frequency subbands are employed to identify the significance of different regions in the images. In response to the aforementioned characteristics, we introduced an attention mechanism to effectively incorporate high-frequency local information into low-frequency global information, thereby enhancing feature representation and recognition efficiency. Moreover, we propose an adaptive rotational convolution, and apply it to the high-frequency feature extraction. The adaptive rotational convolution can adapt to the directionally selective subbands with a single convolution kernel. Experiments conducted on the MSTAR and SAR car datasets demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve better recognition performance with fewer parameters, especially on small-scale datasets. The ablation study also confirms the effectiveness of the introduced DTCWT and rotational convolution.},

Robust RL aims to improve policy stability under disturbances. However, existing methods are often based on simultaneous move games. This overlooks the asymmetry of real attack scenarios, where an attacker has a second-mover advantage and launches a disturbance after observing the agent’s action. To address this, we propose a robust method that models action space perturbations as a zero-sum Stackelberg game and propose a leader-follower actors-critic framework, with the agent as the leader and the adversary as the follower in a hierarchical structure. In this framework, the leader’s intended action will be perturbed by the follower before it is applied. The follower searches for worst-case perturbation in the action space after observing the leader’s action. Both are evaluated by a shared critic within a sequential structure. By leveraging the Stackelberg model, the leader can anticipate potential worst-case perturbations before acting, enabling the agent to maximize its reward while considering the adversarial response. Experiments in several continuous control tasks demostrate that our method improves robustness under action space attakcs and shows pretty good generalization capabilities under varying environmental dynamics.},

Subsequently, we construct a smoother multi-scale information perception module that is more suitable for traffic scenes and extract short-range and medium-range dependencies more robustly. Finally, we propose a lightweight interaction branch to improve the correlation between the classification and regression branches. Extensive experimental results show that our method obtains robust performance in traffic scenes. Specifically, we achieve state-of-the-art results in the marine traffic scenes and the land traffic scenes. In addition, our method obtains competitive performance on the universal detection dataset MS COCO, with MSTDNet obtaining 46.6 AP when using ResNet-50 as the backbone. The code will be released.},

  abstract     = {Human joint-angle estimation predicts relative rotations between adjacent joints. While most existing methods emphasize global body orientation, they often overlook the fine-grained angular characteristics of individual joints. Such local features can be more decisive than global configurations in actions like archery. To address this gap, we present the Branch-Splitter Multi-Granularity Feature Fusion Network (BS-MFFN). First, a Body-Aware Attention module extracts multi-granularity body features within the backbone. The Branch Splitter module then decouples local features at each granularity, preserving their independence and adapting to movement inconsistencies across body parts. A Multi-Scale Perception module further enhances robustness to scale variations. Evaluations on Human3.6M, 3DPW, and UBody show substantial error reductions in local joint-angle estimation: from 20.39° to 12.13°, 15.49° to 11.60°, and 13.03° to 10.88°, respectively, surpassing existing methods.},

  abstract     = {Remote sensing image super-resolution (SR) aims to enhance image spatial resolution while preserving the accuracy of texture information. Recently, denoising diffusion probabilistic models have overcome issues such as excessive smoothing and modal collapse in generative models, demonstrating excellent performance in image super-resolution tasks. However, due to the diverse and complex nature of land cover types in remote sensing images, existing methods often exhibit performance fluctuations across different scenes, leading to generated details that do not align with ground truth. To address this issue, we propose a novel land-cover prior diffusion probabilistic model (LPDiffSR) specifically for remote sensing image super-resolution. We integrate the land cover modulation branch with the feature recovery branch into the diffusion land-cover aware block (DLCAB), enabling LPDiffSR to more effectively reconstruct the detailed features of various land covers. Then, diffusion transformer block (DTB) is incorporated in the encoder to produce more accurate and rich feature representation. In addition, we design a scalable attention-enhanced depthwise network (SAED-Net) that leverages multi-scale and attention mechanisms to explore potential priors from low-resolution inputs, thereby improving reconstruction performance. Rigorous quantitative and qualitative evaluations on the LoveDA and DLRSD datasets demonstrate that LPDiffSR significantly outperforms existing CNN, GAN, and Diffusion-based SR methods in terms of image generation quality and visual fidelity. Meanwhile, the experimental results in downstream vision tasks further validate the practicality and advantages of the SR images generated by LPDiffSR.

Recently, OFVL-MS has been proposed to resolve the issue of growing model size when the scene number increases. However, the alternating optimization of scene-shared and scene-specific parameters results in inadequate encoding of scene-general and scene-related attributes among scenes. Towards this end, we develop OFVL-MS++, a substantial extension of OFVL-MS, which decouples the localization of multiple scenes into two stages to achieve the maximum efficacy for scene-shared parameters and scene-specific parameters. The first stage seeks to learn the scene-general features by taking the images under various scene domains as inputs and outputting the coarse localization. The second stage aims to learn to adaptively expand the scene-specific parameters for each scene in the deep model, where the requisite positions for expanding scene-specific parameters are automatically learned. Comprehensive experiments show the excellent localization ability of OFVL-MS++ families.},

PGSL performs large-scale graph self-supervised pretraining on over 1000 ccRCC WSIs using a masked link-prediction task that recovers local topology and tumor-microenvironment semantics by randomly masking nodes and predicting their connectivity. In inference, the pretrained model induces a weighted adjacency that provides topology-aware guidance for slide-level computation. This learned graph, together with initial patch features, is processed by a graph neural network to integrate global WSI context and produce patient-level risk scores. We evaluate PGSL on two private cohorts and the public TCGA-KIRC dataset, where it consistently outperforms multiple-instance learning and graph baselines across survival tasks. The gains stem from data-adaptive graph induction that replaces heuristic constructions and from effective aggregation over the induced topology. PGSL demonstrates robust generalization and delivers interpretable attention patterns aligned with prognostic pathology. These results highlight PGSL as an effective and scalable framework for pathological graph analysis and ccRCC survival stratification.},

Currently, existing models generally neglect the semantic relevance of local features, which may cause to limited identification performance. To address this issue, we propose a semantic-guided occlusion simulation based local feature semantic expansion network (FOSENet) to pursue satisfactory performance. Firstly, we propose a semantic-guided occlusion simulation (SGOS) method, which generates semantically relevant occlusion patches and further simulates the occlusion based on the semantic information of pedestrians to improve the diversity of the occluded pedestrian samples. Then, we propose a local feature semantic expansion (LFSE) method, which obtains several local areas around each key area and selects some useful local areas as additional cues of the key area to enhance the discrimination ability. Finally, we introduce a cross-center offset loss function, which enlarges the distance of a pair of nearest neighbor samples from two classes to optimize the model. Thus, the samples belonging to different identities are pushed further away. Extensive experiments are conducted on four challenging datasets, and the proposed method can achieve competitive results compared to multiple state-of-the-art works.

  abstract     = {Discovering the inherent routine of interactions between proteins is of great importance in deciphering microscopic life systems. It is essentially a pattern recognition task since the most crucial step is to uncover the complex interaction patterns hidden in the biological knowledge graphs. Recent advances have shown great promise in this regard; however, existing solutions still overlook three critical issues: 1) category heterogeneity, 2) relation heterogeneity, and 3) annotation scarcity, which severely hinder the comprehensive identification and understanding of protein interaction patterns. To address these issues, we introduce a protein interaction pattern recognition framework based on heterogeneous semantics mining and hierarchical graph representation, namely SemanGraphPPI. Our model integrates the annotation knowledge graph with the interaction knowledge graph through hierarchical graph representation, enabling end-to-end function representation of proteins. Additionally, it effectively mines heterogeneous function semantics of proteins by explicitly modeling the heterogeneous information in the annotation knowledge graph and enhances the function representation of under-labeled proteins through a well-designed hierarchical knowledge enhancement module. Exhaustive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that our proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to other baseline methods and exhibits good generalization and efficiency in large-scale PPI prediction.},

A challenge arises when the unlabeled set includes classes not seen during training, which can impair the model’s generalization ability. Prior research has mainly tackled this at the data level, attempting to either eliminate or down-weight data from these unseen classes, yet this approach doesn’t fully alleviate the negative impact on SSL algorithms. This paper shifts focus from the data level to the parameter level. Our analysis indicates that only a select group of parameters, which we call ‘safe parameters’, are critical for seen-class classification. On the other hand, the rest of the parameters, which we refer to as ‘harmful parameters’, appear to be more applicable to unseen-class data. With this understanding, we introduce Augmented Safe Parameter Learning. This approach aims to distinguish and activate safe parameters while rendering harmful parameters inactive, thereby reducing the detrimental effects of unseen-class unlabeled data. Specifically, our method categorizes all parameters as either safe or harmful, and employs a safe parameter enhancement strategy to update safe parameters and neutralize harmful ones.

The proposed network employs multiple attention-guided branches to disentangle different degradation components from the multi-scale features extracted by the Transformer-based trunk network. Then the trunk output is decomposed into grouped features and dynamically assigned to branches with a fully connected layer to jointly estimate the clean background and the degraded input. Comprehensive experiments on four types of single-weather datasets and one multiple-weather degraded dataset validate that our MCD-Net significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, especially under challenging mixed-weather conditions.},

Previous works rely on a single image to deal with this abnormal exposure problem, but they meet the problem of lost textures recovery. In contrast, considering the spectrum irradiance of indoor lights, this work introduces an additional NIR image, and uses the complementary characteristics of the RGB-NIR pair to correct the unevenly exposed face image. To adjust the abnormal luminance distribution, our FICNet introduces an initial exposure correction (IEC) module to adjust the RGB input features. In addition, to recover the lost textures in overexposed regions, FICNet employs cascaded deformable fusion (CDF) modules to effectively aggregate RGB and NIR branch features via spatial non-adjacent sampling and offset transferring. Furthermore, for robust model training, we devise three kinds of abnormal exposure simulation using linear and Gaussian exposure models and S-shaped mapping on face images to generate diverse training data from limited captured images. Experimental results validate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art image fusion, guided restoration, and exposure correction approaches.

However, it has several limitations, such as the inability to accurately identify the cluster centers of sparse clusters and the continuous misassignment of non-center points, which is often referred to as the “domino effect”. To address these issues, a novel density peaks clustering algorithm integrating manifold distance and mutual nearest neighbors (DPC-MDMN) is proposed. First, the harmonic density based on the mutual nearest neighbors is introduced to eliminate density differences between any two clusters. Second, a new relative distance is defined using the expanded connectivity-based manifold distance. This approach determines the connections between different clusters by analyzing the density variations along the paths of points, effectively amplifying the distance between different cluster centers and enabling more accurate identification of the cluster centers in the decision graph. Finally, a two-step assignment strategy is designed. The information of mutual nearest neighbors is used in the first step to cluster highly similar points. In the next step, different neighbor types are taken into account, with proportional weights using for the assignment. Experiments conducted on 12 synthetic datasets and 19 real-world datasets demonstrate that the DPC-MDMN algorithm performs better, particularly on the datasets with weak connectivity, where the true cluster centers can be clearly identified in the decision graph.},

  abstract     = {Re-ranking is the critical final step in object re-identification systems, responsible for effectively ordering a list of candidate objects to more closely align with the desired target objects. While existing methods often focus on single-stage feature vector extraction due to resource limitations, these approaches can result in rankings filled with inconsistent or even misaligned images in terms of key attributes like color, pose, and clothing. To tackle these challenges, we create a ReID( Re -Ranking through I mage D escription) framework, which uses deep semantic information to improve re-ranking through contextually enhanced features. This substantially increases the accuracy of object re-identification. Our primary contributions are as follows: 1. We create a richly annotated dataset based on real-world images for training an object semantic extraction model. 2. We design the ReID framework, which digs deep into the appearance similarities of objects within images and employs an end-to-end matching algorithm for re-ranking, thereby enhancing re-identification accuracy. 3. Extensive experiments show that, in both supervised and unsupervised scenarios, our approach significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art on large-scale datasets for vehicle and person re-identification.},

  abstract     = {Most of the existing graph neural networks suffer from severe performance degradation under distribution shifts. The fundamental reason for degradation is that the model tends to use incorrect associations between feature and label for prediction. It significantly impacts the model’s performance under distribution shifts. Most of the existing graph out-of-distribution generalization research only considers the independence between subgraph and external factors to eliminate directly incorrect associations while ignoring spurious correlations between subgraphs. However, the spurious correlation between subgraphs still indirectly generates incorrect associations between spurious subgraph and labels. At the same time, it also results in indirect incorrect associations between causal subgraph and environment affecting the accurate selection of the causal subgraph. These problems further affect the model’s generalization ability. To solve the above problem, we propose a joint subgraph independence method to jointly eliminate the correlation between subgraphs and the correlation with external factors. Specifically, except for the independence of subgraphs from external factors, we learn a set of sample weights to make the spurious subgraph and causal subgraph independent of each other. Through eliminating the correlation between subgraphs, we avoid indirectly incorrect associations and promote more accurate identification of subgraph structures. At the same time, the selection of subgraph structure and independence with external factors provide a guiding prior for decorrelation between subgraphs, avoiding the loss of information and difficulty in optimization caused by dense decorrelation between all node features. We conduct extensive experiments on different datasets and the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.},

Realism deteriorates quickly if we minimize distortion, and vice versa . The existing methods manually determine and apply a realism level, which is a degree of the trade-off, to an entire image, resulting in time-consuming training and suboptimal quality. In this paper, we propose a novel LIC model equipped with a predictor that automatically determines realism levels for regions of the image. Thus, we reconstruct images using the optimal realism levels. Moreover, we developed a two-stage training framework for stable training of the proposed model. The experimental results show that the proposed model achieved significant perceptual quality while the PSNR is comparable to the existing methods.},

Previous works address this challenge by utilizing Vision-Language Models and mask proposal networks for region-text matching. However, this paradigm may lead to incorrect target localization due to the inherent ambiguity and diversity of free-form referring expressions. To alleviate this issue, we present LGD (Leveraging Generative Descriptions), a framework that utilizes the advanced language generation capabilities of Multi-Modal Large Language Models to enhance region-text matching performance in Vision-Language Models. Specifically, we first design two kinds of prompts, the attribute prompt and the surrounding prompt, to guide the Multi-Modal Large Language Models in generating descriptions related to the crucial attributes of the referent object and the details of surrounding objects, referred to as attribute description and surrounding description, respectively. Secondly, three visual-text matching scores are introduced to evaluate the similarity between instance-level visual features and textual features, which determines the mask most associated with the referring expression. The proposed method achieves new state-of-the-art performance on three public datasets RefCOCO, RefCOCO+ and RefCOCOg, with maximum improvements of 9.97 % in oIoU and 11.29 % in mIoU compared to previous methods},

However, most existing methods are tailored for static and discrete data, limiting their applicability in real-world scenarios where new classes emerge continually. Although continual learning has shown promise in sequential task learning, it is not directly suitable for multi-view data due to its neglect of inter-view consistency and complementarity. To address these limitations, we propose a novel Continual Deep Multi-View Clustering (CDMVC) framework that enables effective knowledge retention and transfer without accessing historical data. Building on this, we further introduce CKR-MVC, a continual clustering method via contrastive knowledge replay, which integrates inter-view contrastive learning with knowledge-guided experience replay. Specifically, CKR-MVC selectively generates and replays subspace features from previous tasks to mitigate forgetting. After extracting current task semantics from each view, a knowledge distillation strategy is employed to align features across tasks, preserving cross-task consistency and capturing complementary semantics. Clustering is then performed on the fused comprehensive representations to continually learn new tasks. Additionally, a two-level contrastive learning strategy across and within tasks is designed to fully leverage multi-view information. Extensive experiments on multiple public datasets demonstrate the superiority of CKR-MVC in overcoming catastrophic forgetting and improving continual multi-view clustering performance.},

  abstract     = {Change detection in remote sensing images is essential for monitoring environmental changes on Earth’s surface. Although vision transformers (ViTs), particularly plain ViTs pre-trained on large-scale datasets and endowed with extensive knowledge and strong comprehension capabilities, have achieved remarkable success as backbones in numerous computer vision applications, they remain underutilized in change detection tasks. In this domain, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) continue to dominate due to their powerful feature extraction capabilities. In this paper, our study uncovers ViTs’ unique advantage in discerning large-scale changes, a capability where CNNs fall short. Capitalizing on this insight, we introduce ChangeViT, a framework that adopts a plain ViT backbone to enhance the performance of large-scale changes. This framework is supplemented by a detail-capture module that generates detailed spatial features and a feature injector that efficiently integrates fine-grained spatial information into high-level semantic learning. The feature integration ensures that ChangeViT excels in both detecting large-scale changes and capturing fine-grained details, providing comprehensive change detection across diverse scales. Without bells and whistles, ChangeViT achieves state-of-the-art performance on three popular high-resolution datasets ( i.e ., LEVIR-CD, WHU-CD, and CLCD) and one low-resolution dataset ( i.e ., OSCD), which underscores the unleashed potential of plain ViTs for change detection. Furthermore, thorough quantitative and qualitative analyses validate the efficacy of the introduced modules, solidifying the effectiveness of our approach.

To address the limitation, we develop a novel HAD via double nonlocal priors (HADDNLP) framework that preserves critical background structure. The proposed HADDNLP method first adopts the patch-wise nonlocal low-rank tensor (NLRT) modeling to explore global correlation along spectrum (GCS) and self-similarity (SS) across distant regions in hyperspectral images (HSIs), thereby preserving the structural and contextual details of the background. Then, the nonlocal means (NLM) prior is integrated to maintain spatial distribution within the HSIs, further enhancing the model’s ability to distinguish anomalies from the background. We optimize the model with an alternating minimization (AM) algorithm for NLRT estimation and an alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) for joint background reconstruction and anomaly detection. Experimental results on the real satellite and aerial hyperspectral datasets demonstrate that our proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in the HAD tasks.},

Previous methods address the challenge of similar synthetic samples leading to model saturation by leveraging the specific downstream model to guide the generation process, and dynamically adjusting sample difficulty to prevent downstream performance plateaus. However, such an approach never considers the interoperability of these synthetic samples, which may not be universally challenging due to varying feature focuses across different downstream models. Thus, we propose a strategy that uses the discrepancy between backbone-extracted features and real image prototypes to generate challenging samples, employing two loss functions: one for key-area diversity and another for overall image fidelity. This ensures key areas are challenging while the background remains stable, creating samples that are broadly applicable for downstream tasks without overfitting to specific models.

  abstract     = {Currently, most innovations in image fusion methods focus on designing network architectures for source image feature extraction and formulating loss functions for fusion networks, while often neglecting the necessary adjustments and optimisations of hyperparameters within these loss functions. However, the selection of hyperparameters for the loss function of the fusion network is crucial because it determines the iterative direction of the network and significantly influences the final results. This study proposes an image fusion network with hyperparameter adaptive optimisation adjustment, termed whale optimisation algorithm-edge invertible CMamba fusion (W-EICMFusion). First, we introduce a CMamba module that effectively extracts common information features within the local and broad receptive fields. We designed an edge-extraction invertible neural network (EE-INN) module that captures edge detail information from two modalities, and a fusion layer known as a residual dense efficient channel attention network (RDENet) to enhance the extraction of complementary information. Unlike other fusion networks that depend on manual parameter tuning, this study employs the whale optimisation algorithm (WOA) to determine the optimal hyperparameters adaptively. Our experiments compared our designed fusion network with 11 recently developed advanced methods related to it. The proposed method demonstrates the best overall performance and achieves the highest comprehensive score in comparative experiments conducted on the MSRS, LLVIP, Road-Scene, and M3FD datasets.

  abstract     = {Graph similarity learning (GSL) aims to quantify the similarity score between two graphs. Although recent GSL methods based on graph neural networks (GNNs) take advantage of intra-graph structures in message passing, few of them fully utilize the structures presented by edges to boost the representation of their connected nodes. Moreover, previous cross-graph node embedding matching lacks the perception of the overall structure of the graph pair, due to the fact that the node representations from GNNs are confined to the intra-graph structure, causing the unreasonable similarity score. Intuitively, the cross-graph structure represented in the assignment graph is helpful to rectify the inappropriate matching. Therefore, we propose a structure-enhanced graph matching network (SEGMN). Equipped with a dual embedding learning module and a structure perception matching module, SEGMN achieves structure enhancement in both embedding learning and cross-graph matching. The dual embedding learning module incorporates adjacent edge representation into each node to achieve a structure-enhanced representation. The structure perception matching module achieves cross-graph structure enhancement through assignment graph convolution. The similarity score of each cross-graph node pair can be rectified by aggregating messages from structurally relevant node pairs. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that SEGMN outperforms the state-of-the-art GSL methods in the GED regression task, and the structure perception matching module is plug-and-play, which can further improve the performance of the baselines by up to 25 %.},

This paper presents a robust single-sphere calibration method that leverages the properties of active illumination to overcome this challenge. We first analyze the geometric structure of sphere boundaries under projector lighting and show that they originate from distinct apparent contours in the camera and projector views. Exploiting dual epipolar geometry, we segment these boundaries and fit separate image conics for each view. Based on this, we derive two novel orthogonality constraints between the conics and the image of the absolute conic, enabling complete calibration from a single sphere. To enhance precision, we further propose a nonlinear optimization strategy that jointly minimizes sphere reconstruction and point reprojection errors, refining both intrinsic and extrinsic parameters as well as lens distortions. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly enhances conic fitting accuracy under self-shadowing conditions and provides a flexible, accurate calibration solution with a single sphere.},

Moreover, network modulation based on attribution analysis is employed to integrate domain knowledge into the deep learning model, thereby mitigating the model’s susceptibility to spurious correlations.

To address this issue, we propose a novel structure-aware Spherical Density Attention Network (SDANet) that captures more structural features by cross-domain learning. Our method allows models to learn and aggregate features in different spatial domains by introducing spherical density information, thus broadening the receiving field and gathering more contextual information. First, we derive a non-parametric spherical kernel density estimate formula to calculate the explicit spherical density for each point. This provides abundant structural information and leads to more discriminative point features. Second, the explicit spherical density is directly used to calculate the attention score, and the information fusion of different spatial domains is guided by the spherical density, so that the model can learn more comprehensive and richer knowledge, thus improving the performance and generalization ability of the model. Our experiments demonstrate that SDANet achieves competitive performance on popular point cloud benchmarks and outperforms methods that only consider a single spatial domain.},

However, such a network does not fully exploit the abundant texture-structural information presented in hyperspectral images, particularly neglecting the valuable texture-structural clues in the frequency domain. This limitation results in a lack of sufficient discrimination in the captured spectral-spatial features. To alleviate this deficiency, we elaborate a hybrid texture-structural learning network (HTLNet) for hyperspectral image classification. More specifically, texture dynamic convolution is proposed to dynamically aggregate high-frequency texture structure information into convolution kernels to improve local feature perception. To capture long-range dependencies, a multi-head texture spectral self-attention module is designed to improve model’s ability to perceive spectral and texture structure information. This approach also helps mitigate the information loss caused by use of down-sampling techniques, such as average pooling, used in multi-head self-attention to reduce computational costs. HTLNet can integrate the spectral and texture structure information into the parameter learning of the network when capturing the spectral-spatial features. Experimental results show that on the Indian Pines, Pavia University, Salinas, Houston, and WHU-Hi-LongKou datasets, the performance of HTLNet reaches respectively 0.48 %, 2.67 %, 1.32 %, 1.14 %, and 0.63 % higher than that of other representative peers.},

Unsupervised methods, by contrast, aim to automatically learn the optimal alignment between images without relying on labeled data, but they often struggle with balancing the complex trade-off between regularization and similarity loss, leading to issues with model tuning and weak generalization across diverse datasets. In this paper, a novel hierarchical gradient modulation strategy is proposed for multi-resolution image registration. This method introduces a compatibility criterion based on the relationship between the gradients of similarity loss and regularization loss. It evaluates the compatibility between similarity and regularization gradients, integrates them through intuitive strategies that align mutually reinforcing gradients, project conflicting gradients orthogonally to avoid interference, and balance gradients of equal importance through averaging. It prioritizes global deformation with stronger regularization at low resolution and focuses on fine details with reduced regularization at high resolution. Experimental results on common medical datasets, forward-looking sonar datasets, and fabric defect detection datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior registration performance compared to baseline methods and state-of-the-art hyperparameter-related research without incurring additional computational costs, achieving optimal loss balance in a multi-resolution structure.},

Traditional RES methods assume that a single description refers to only one target, limiting their applicability in real-world scenarios where multiple or no targets may exist. To address this limitation, the generalized referring expression segmentation (GRES) task with corresponding positive and negative samples has been put forward. However, existing GRES methods often fail to consider the independence of multiple targets and do not introduce any tailored structure designs, leading to performance bottlenecks. Therefore, in this work, we propose an Ins tance-oriented G RES framework named InsRES , leveraging instance-level clustering and hierarchical cross-modal feature interaction to enhance vision-language understanding. Given an image-expression pair, our proposed Instance-Aware Clustering module is able to generate instance-aware queries that correspond to candidate masks based on feature clustering. Furthermore, a Multi-scale Spatial Propagation module is proposed to achieve vision-guided language feature enhancement for better multimodal alignment. After that, InsRES filters and selects the expected segmentation masks to produce precise instance-level predictions based on the textual description. Extensive evaluations show that InsRES achieves state-of-the-art performance on the GRES and RES tasks, demonstrating its superiority in practical scenarios.},

Fine-grained product recognition is unsatisfactory due to its poor generalizability to the huge number of categories and unseen categories. While users search for products, they usually enter text or image queries to find relevant products and get their detailed specifications. This raises the cross-modal fine-grained product retrieval problem. In this work, we construct a fine-grained product retrieval dataset named FGPR, meticulously annotated with the stock-keeping unit (SKU) triplets including product name, brand, and size. FGPR comprises nearly 360 K images across more than 85 K SKU categories and provides optical character recognition (OCR) annotations for all images to facilitate retrieval using vision and OCR text information. Compared to other product datasets, our dataset has the largest number of SKU categories. Its diversity is conducive to a more comprehensive evaluation in fine-grained retrieval, particularly for pre-trained models. In a simple multi-modal framework, we evaluate the effectiveness of fine-grained product retrieval using images, OCR texts, and their fusion, thereby confirming the significant role of OCR texts. The performance improvements achieved by introducing a decoder for SKU information prediction highlight the significance of detailed and appropriate annotations, i.e., SKU triplets.

To address these issues, this paper proposes a cross-modal fusion network based on Mamba, named VMMNet. Specifically, a Dynamic State Space (DSS) block is designed using the selective scan mechanism, reducing the computational complexity of attention mechanisms from O ( N 2 ) to linear, thereby significantly improving network efficiency and inference speed. Furthermore, to tackle the issue of information loss during multimodal feature fusion, two innovative modules, the Cross-Mamba Enhancement Block (CMEB) and the Merge-Mamba Fusion Block (MMFB), are introduced. The CMEB enhances inter-modal information interaction through a cross-selective scan mechanism, while the MMFB further integrates the features output by CMEB to ensure information integrity. Finally, a Channel Aware Mamba Decoder (CMD) is designed to enhance the network’s modeling capability in the channel dimension. On existing RGB-T crowd counting datasets, VMMNet reduces FLOPs by 94.3 % compared to the state-of-the-art methods and achieves performance improvements of 18.7 % and 23.3 % in GAME(0) and RMSE, respectively.},

In this paper, we propose the Test-time Cache-aided Cross-modal Correlation Correction (TC 4 ) method, which acts as a pioneer for especially addressing the UC-TBPS task by novel test-time re-ranking. Firstly, we conduct clustering inside the pedestrian image gallery, and construct the reward and penalty caches based on these clustering centers, to store more sentences relays for alleviating the cross-domain problem. Secondly, we calculate the reward and penalty values to refine the appropriately located image-sentence correlation positions under the guidance of these two caches, respectively. Finally, the refined image-sentence correlations are used to re-rank the original retrieval results. As a test-time re-ranking approach, our TC 4 method does not require fine-tuning in the target domain, and can obtain retrieval performance improvements with negligible additional overheads. Extensive experiments and analyses on the tasks of UC-TBPS as well as unsupervised cross-domain image-text matching can validate the effectiveness and generalization capacities of our proposed TC 4 solution.},

  abstract     = {Water-related images are crucial for applications such as marine exploration, underwater robotics, and ecological monitoring. However, due to wavelength-dependent absorption and scattering, these images often suffer from color distortion, low contrast, and structural blurring, impairing downstream visual tasks. While diffusion models offer strong reconstruction capabilities through progressive denoising, their reliance on paired supervision limits their applicability in underwater scenarios. To address this, we propose a pseudo-label guided diffusion framework for water-related image enhancement, enabling high-quality restoration without real ground-truth labels. Specifically, we design a U-Net-based diffusion network with a linear time-step scheduling strategy to progressively recover global structure and local texture. To compensate for the lack of supervision, we introduce a semantic-visual pseudo-labeling mechanism: semantic prompts generated by the large multimodal model LLaVA are matched with multiple enhanced images using Zip-CLIP to produce semantic similarity heatmaps. A lightweight G-CNN fuses these cues into pseudo-labels that guide the diffusion process. Extensive experiments on UIEB, U45, and UCCS datasets demonstrate that our method consistently surpasses existing approaches in terms of sharpness, color fidelity, and semantic structure preservation. These results highlight the effectiveness of integrating multimodal pseudo-supervision with diffusion modeling for robust underwater image enhancement.

  abstract     = {In learning problems, the noise inherent to the task at hand hinders the possibility to infer without a certain degree of uncertainty. Quantifying this uncertainty, regardless of its wide use, assumes high relevance for security-sensitive applications. Within these scenarios, it becomes fundamental to guarantee good (i.e., trustworthy) uncertainty measures, which downstream modules can securely employ to drive the final decision-making process. However, an attacker may be interested in forcing the system to produce either (i) highly uncertain outputs jeopardizing the system’s availability or (ii) low uncertainty estimates, making the system accept uncertain samples that would instead require a careful inspection (e.g., human intervention). Therefore, it becomes fundamental to understand how to obtain robust uncertainty estimates against these kinds of attacks. In this work, we reveal both empirically and theoretically that defending against adversarial examples, i.e., carefully perturbed samples that cause misclassification, additionally guarantees a more secure, trustworthy uncertainty estimate under common attack scenarios without the need for an ad-hoc defense strategy. To support our claims, we evaluate multiple adversarial-robust classification models from the publicly available benchmark RobustBench on the CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets, and on a robust semantic segmentation model evaluated on Pascal-VOC.

  abstract     = {Graph learning methods have been extensively applied in diverse application areas.However, what kinds of inherent graph properties (e.g., graph proximity and structural information) have been encoded into graph representation learning for downstream tasks are still under-explored. In this paper, we propose a novel graph probing framework (GraphProbe) to investigate and interpret whether the family of graph learning methods has encoded different levels of knowledge in graph representation learning. Based on the intrinsic properties of graphs, we design three probes to systematically investigate the graph representation learning process from different perspectives, respectively the node-wise level, the path-wise level, and the structural level. We construct a thorough evaluation benchmark with ten representative graph learning methods from random walk based approaches, basic graph neural networks and self-supervised graph methods, and probe them on six benchmark datasets for node classification, link prediction and graph classification. The experimental evaluation verify that GraphProbe can estimate the capability of graph representation learning. Remaking results have been concluded: GCN and WeightedGCN methods are relatively versatile methods achieving better results with respect to different tasks.

Among these issues, smoke density plays a crucial role for refine the granularity of smoke representation, yet it has been largely overlooked in previous research. In this work, we introduce the SAM-powered (Segment Anything Model [1]) DenSi ty-Aware Progressive Smoke Seg mentation method ( DenSiSeg ). For smoke regions, we construct a background feature prototype to refine smoke mask labels into fine-grained density information using a per-pixel metric. Following this, soft-contrastive learning and progressive evolving strategies are devised to smoothly and iteratively refine the feature distribution of smoke at different density levels. For background regions, knowledge transfer based on the vision foundation model is employed, harnessing the world knowledge within the foundation model to enhance the understanding of diverse background. Extensive experiments on several public datasets demonstrate that the proposed DenSiSeg method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

The definition of structured frameworks stems from the need to reliably assess data stream classification methods, considering the constraints of delayed label access, the costs of their acquisition and the costs of model adaptation. The current experimental evaluation often boundlessly exploits the assumption of the immediate label access to monitor the recognition quality and adapt the methods to the changing concepts. The problem is leveraged by reviewing currently described methods and techniques for data stream processing and verifying their outcomes in simulated environment . This work defines a taxonomy of data stream processing frameworks and presents four processing schemes that link the tasks of drift detection and classification while considering a natural phenomenon of label delay . The presented research shows that classification quality is significantly affected not only by the disruptive phenomenon of concept drifts and label delay , but also by the undertaken processing scheme that describes the flow of labels in the recognition system. Considering a specific processing framework depending on real-world constraints proves to be a critical aspect of reliable and realistic experimental evaluation.},

One feasible approach to mitigate this issue is to replace large datasets with smaller, carefully crafted representations that retain the essential properties of the original data. In this paper, we revisit the exploration of this approach through the interaction of coresets - small, provably correct summaries of data - and Conformal Prediction, a robust and general method for calibrating machine learning predictions. Specifically, we build on existing work to introduce Conformal Compressors, a method inspired by coresets that leverages Conformal Prediction for data compression.

To quantify uncertainty for the federated classification task, we extend conformal prediction to the federated learning system. First, we design the prototype-based adaptive prediction set (PAPS) score function for FL to compute the integrated prototype-based non-conformity score. It utilizes prototypes as proxies to protect privacy and reduce the size of the prediction set. Subsequently, we propose the federated conformal prediction algorithm based on prototype similarity (FCP-Pro) to overcome the data non-exchangeability and improve the prediction efficiency. It simultaneously enforces label shift correction and similarity calibration adjustment to the empirical distribution of federated calibration samples. The coverage guarantee of the proposed FCP-Pro algorithm is proved theoretically. To validate the effectiveness of the FCP-Pro algorithm, extensive experiments have been conducted on the CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet datasets.

Although deep learning techniques have been widely applied to image recognition and have achieved great success, this is not the case for 2D shape recognition. Inspired by the powerful spatial representation ability of Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs), we leverage this technique to address the shape recognition problem. To this end, we propose a Boundary-Aware Shape Recognition Graph Convolutional Network (BASR-GCN). To be specific, we first extract the maximum boundary of the object depicted in an image and sample this boundary into a set of key points. Given a key point, a set of features is then extracted as its representation. Furthermore, we construct a series of graphs from the key points and use the BASR-GCN to learn the spatial layout of these points. In addition, we introduce a multi-scale BASR-GCN (BASR-GCN-MS) in order to exploit the shape features extracted at different scales. To our knowledge, GCNs have not been applied to 2D shape recognition before. The proposed method is tested using four publicly available shape data sets. Experimental results show that our method outperforms the baselines. We believe that these promising results should be due to the fact that the BASR-GCN captures the spatial layout and semantic information of the shape fulfilled by graph convolutions.},

However, existing TW completion methods remain sensitive to rank selection and fail to effectively leverage the group smoothness in HSIs, leading to suboptimal recovery performance. To address these limitations, we propose a tensor wheel completion with parallel matrix factorization and group smoothness (TWC-PMFGS). First, we impose low-rank matrix factorization on all ring factors by leveraging the rank relationship between the original tensor and the TW factors. This enhances the ability of TW decomposition to capture the global information of HSIs and improves the model’s robustness to rank selection. Second, we observe that HSIs exhibit group sparsity in the gradient domain and theoretically demonstrate that this structure can be effectively expressed by the TW factors. To better exploit this group smoothness, we impose the ℓ 2 , 1 -norm on the gradient factors. Finally, we evaluate the proposed TWC-PMFGS method on six hyperspectral images and seven multispectral images. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our TWC-PMFGS.

Additionally, pose sequences often contain significant redundancy between frames.

The SCT encoder treats hidden features between blocks as Temporal Feature Signals (TFS) and applies the Discrete Cosine Transform, a Fourier transform-based technique, to determine the spectral components to be retained. By filtering out certain high-frequency noise components, SCT compresses the sequence length and reduces redundancy.

The LPG generates skeletal position information that complements the input 2D joint positions, thereby improving the model’s performance.

Briefly, the EPA first employs the lightweight channel Attention (LCA) module to capture global information. Then, lightweight depthwise convolution is used to extract multiscale features. Finally, we use a simplified channel self-attention, name as DTFF module, to aggregate information at different scales. Unlike traditional channel self-attention, DTFF module adopts two unique techniques, replacing Q (Query) or K (Key) with original input, and using channel anchored attention to dynamically aggregate information at different scales. To further demonstrate the potential of EPA, we also designed an efficient EPA-based network (EPA-Net).

While historical few-shot learning methods have focused on multi-scale feature fusion using techniques such as random resizing or feature pyramids, the exploration of inter-scale feature differences has largely been overlooked. Unlike previous methods, we propose a novel few-shot learning approach, the Scale Parallax Network, which treats images at different resolutions as complementary sources of visual information. We adopt an image-pyramid-based structure to extract multi-scale feature representations and enhance the model representational capacity.

However, the brittleness of DL models to noisy and out-of-distribution inputs is ailing their deployment in sensitive fields. Current models often lack uncertainty quantification, providing only point estimates. We propose SUPER-Net, a Bayesian framework for trustworthy image segmentation via uncertainty propagation. Using Taylor series approximations, SUPER-Net propagates the mean and covariance of the model’s posterior distribution across nonlinear layers. It generates two outputs simultaneously: the segmented image and a pixel-wise uncertainty map, eliminating the need for expensive Monte Carlo sampling. SUPER-Net’s performance is extensively evaluated on MRI and CT scans under various noisy and adversarial conditions. Results show that SUPER-Net outperforms state-of-the-art models in robustness and accuracy. The uncertainty map identifies low-confidence areas affected by noise or attacks, allowing the model to self-assess segmentation reliability, particularly when errors arise from noise or adversarial examples.},

  abstract     = {The drug discovery process often employs phenotypic and target-based virtual screening to identify potential drug candidates. Despite the longstanding dominance of target-based approaches, phenotypic virtual screening is undergoing a resurgence due to its potential being now better understood. In the context of cancer cell lines, a well-established experimental system for phenotypic screens, molecules are tested to identify their whole-cell activity, as summarized by their half-maximal inhibitory concentrations. Machine learning has emerged as a potent tool for computationally guiding such screens, yet important research gaps persist, including generalization and uncertainty quantification. To address this, we leverage a clustering-based validation approach, called Leave Dissimilar Molecules Out (LDMO). This strategy enables a more rigorous assessment of model generalization to structurally novel compounds. This study focuses on applying Conformal Prediction (CP), a model-agnostic framework, to predict the activities of novel molecules on specific cancer cell lines. A total of 4320 independent models were evaluated across 60 cell lines, 5 CP variants, 2 set features, and training-test splits, providing strong and consistent results. From this comprehensive evaluation, we concluded that, regardless of the cell line or model, novel molecules with smaller CP-calculated confidence intervals tend to have smaller predicted errors once measured activities are revealed. It was also possible to anticipate the activities of dissimilar test molecules across 50 or more cell lines. These outcomes demonstrate the robust efficacy that LDMO-based models can achieve in realistic and challenging scenarios, thereby providing valuable insights for enhancing decision-making processes in drug discovery.},

However, existing learning-based MVS methods often overlook depth maps that include the geometric shapes of the scene when constructing the cost volume. This can result in suboptimal reconstructions, particularly in low-texture or repetitive-texture regions where valuable geometric information is absent. To address this issue, we propose a highly efficient multi-view stereo network with Depth-aware Iterations (DI-MVS) that effectively incorporates context-guided depth geometry into the cost volume using a depth-aware iterator. Specifically, the proposed depth-aware iterator consists of a Depth-Aware Cost Completion (DACC) module and a 2D ConvGRU module. Firstly, the DACC module is used to construct a Depth-Aware Cost Volume (DACV) that contains rich geometric information. Secondly, the 2D ConvGRU module processes the DACV, continuously optimizing the depth map in a coarse-to-fine manner. Finally, we propose a Hybrid Loss Strategy that combines the strengths of two loss functions to enhance the robustness of depth estimation. Further, we propose DI-MVS++ by designing a Depth Representation Consistency (DRC) loss to alleviate differences between various depth representations, enhancing training stability and thereby improving the effectiveness of the hybrid loss strategy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DI-MVS++ outperforms state-of-the-art methods on DTU dataset and BlendedMVS dataset. It also exhibits powerful generalization ability on Tanks-and-Temples benchmark and ETH3D benchmark. The source code is available at: https://github.com/JianfeiJ/DI-MVS .},

Past research has predominantly treated the SOR task as a static process, typically formulating it as a regression or classification problem. However, these approaches overlook the dynamic nature of human attention, which shifts as context and inter-object correlations influence focus. To address this, we employ a reinforcement learning strategy, modeling SOR as a dynamic iterative sequence process. We train an actor to select salient objects from the environment. Additionally, we design a reward strategy that encourages the selection of the most prominent object among those not previously chosen. The selection order generated by the actor directly determines the ranking of object saliency in the scene. Furthermore, we identify limitations in existing SOR evaluation metrics, which may falter in certain scenarios. To address this, we introduce a simple and useful metric, referred to as the F1-Sor, into SOR tasks, improving the evaluation accuracy of the SOR tasks. Our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on publicly available SOR datasets.},

In addition, addressing unbalanced engagement among different clients in global training is crucial for further advancing the FGL application. Aiming to address the aforementioned challenges, we propose a Soft Clustering Based Federated Graph Learning (SCFGL) on non-IID Graphs, which mitigates the non-IID problem of both data and structure feature levels while balancing the impact of clients with different levels of engagement. Firstly, to address the non-IID distribution of structural features among graph-structured data from different clients, we develop a Truncated Singular Value Decomposition (TSVD) based soft clustering method, which constructs principal vectors by applying TSVD to the structural embeddings and divides personalized clusters by structural similarity. Secondly, we design a model aggregation method that takes into account both the level of client engagement and the model quality to tackle unbalanced client engagement in real-world application scenarios. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments under various settings, such as cross-dataset and cross-domain. The results demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms existing FGL state-of-the-art methods in terms of performance.},

  abstract     = {Intelligent fault diagnosis requires robust capturing of specific features, representing the fault patterns, from time-series vibration signals. Most of the existing solutions require complex preprocessing steps to make the signal suitable for training a deep learning model. This article presents a novel vision transformer with a selective residual in the multihead self-attention network, called Selective Residual Vision Transformer (SeReViT), for improved robustness in capturing the fault signature from the vibration signal. The novel attention mechanism incorporates cumulative attention by utilizing the best attention through residual connections in each block of multihead attention. The best attention term is defined using the highest value of L1-norms of attention value (the scaled-dot product of key and query) of multiheads. It enables the model to focus on selected best attention to learn the long-range dependencies among sequential input image patches, resulting in better classification performance. The proposed framework is validated for fault diagnosis on the Case Western Reserve University bearing fault diagnosis dataset and the Paderborn University dataset. Since these datasets are already cleaned data, noisy vibration data are created by adding white noise for the demonstration of the robustness of the proposed framework. The vibration signals are first converted to images using the short-time Fourier transform with a fixed window size. The generated images are used to train and validate the proposed SeReViT. The results outperformed the state-of-the-art convolution-based models for fault diagnosis for both cleaned datasets and noisy datasets. The short-time Fourier transform is utilized to convert the noisy (raw) vibration signals from rotating machines to spectrum images.},

  abstract     = {Remote sensing image (RSI) denoising is an important topic in the field of remote sensing. Despite the impressive denoising performance of RSI denoising methods, most current deep learning-based approaches function as black boxes and lack integration with physical information models, leading to limited interpretability. Additionally, many methods may struggle with insufficient attention to non-local self-similarity in RSI and require tedious tuning of regularization parameters to achieve optimal performance, particularly in conventional iterative optimization approaches. In this paper, we first propose a novel RSI denoising method named sparse tensor-aided representation network (STAR-Net), which leverages a low-rank prior to effectively capture the non-local self-similarity within RSI. Furthermore, we extend STAR-Net to a sparse variant called STAR-Net-S to deal with the interference caused by non-Gaussian noise in original RSI for the purpose of improving robustness. Different from conventional iterative optimization, we develop an alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM)-guided deep unrolling network, in which all regularization parameters can be automatically learned, thus inheriting the advantages of both model-based and deep learning-based approaches and successfully addressing the above-mentioned shortcomings. Comprehensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that STAR-Net and STAR-Net-S outperform state-of-the-art RSI denoising methods.

  abstract     = {Training deep neural networks (DNNs) with noisy labels is a challenging task that significantly degenerates the model’s performance. Most existing methods mitigate this problem by identifying and eliminating noisy samples or correcting their labels according to statistical properties like confidence values. However, these methods often overlook the impact of inherent noise, such as sample quality, which can mislead DNNs to focus on incorrect regions, adulterate the softmax classifier, and generate low-quality pseudo-labels. In this paper, we propose a novel Affinity-aware Uncertainty Quantification (AUQ) framework to explore the perception ambiguity and rectify the salient bias by quantifying the uncertainty. Concretely, we construct the dynamic prototypes to represent intra-class semantic spaces and estimate the uncertainty based on sample-prototype pairs, where the observed affinities between sample-prototype pairs are converted to probabilistic representations as the estimated uncertainty. Samples with higher uncertainty are likely to be hard samples and we design an uncertainty-aware loss to emphasize the learning from those samples with high uncertainty, which helps DNNs to gradually concentrate on the critical regions. Besides, we further utilize sample-prototype affinities to adaptively refine pseudo-labels, enhancing the quality of supervisory signals for noisy samples. Extensive experiments conducted on the CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and Clothing1M datasets demonstrate the efficacy and effectiveness of AUQ. Notably, we achieve an average performance gain of 0.4 % on CIFAR-10 and a substantial average improvement of 2.3 % over the second-best method on the more challenging CIFAR-100 dataset. Moreover, there is a 0.6 % improvement over the sub-optimal method on Clothing1M. These results validate AUQ’s capability in enhancing DNN robustness against noisy labels.},

To tackle this problem and address the challenges of point clouds, we introduce a novel approach, referred to as CoMPR (Condensation via bidirectional Matching and Point Recycling). CoMPR aims to increase the point utilization rate and make use of still informative points, which are typically discarded during max pooling operations, through a recycling strategy.

Specifically, the low- and high-frequency components, which are acquired via discrete wavelet transform (DWT), are boosted by a low-frequency booster (LFB) and a high-frequency booster (HFB), respectively. High-frequency components contain abundant details but also more noise. To suppress the noise and strengthen critical features, in HFB, we devise a complex convolutional frequency attention module (CCFAM), which utilizes complex convolutions to generate dynamic complex-valued channel and spatial attention to improve the Fourier spectrum of high-frequency components. Moreover, considering the importance of multi-scale information, we aggregate the multi-scale frequency features to enrich the frequency components in both LFB and HFB. Experimental results on IDRiD and DDR datasets show that our WFDENet outperforms state-of-the-art methods. The source code is available at https://github.com/xuanli01/WFDENet .},

  abstract     = {Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques hold significant potential for enhancing the causal discovery process, which is crucial for understanding complex systems in areas like healthcare, economics, and artificial intelligence. However, no causal discovery methods currently incorporate explainability into their models to derive the causal graphs. Thus, in this paper we explore this innovative approach, as it offers substantial potential and represents a promising new direction worth investigating. Specifically, we introduce R e X, a causal discovery method that leverages machine learning (ML) models coupled with explainability techniques, specifically Shapley values, to identify and interpret significant causal relationships among variables. Comparative evaluations on synthetic datasets comprising continuous tabular data reveal that R e X outperforms state-of-the-art causal discovery methods across diverse data generation processes, including non-linear and additive noise models. Moreover, R e X was tested on the Sachs single-cell protein-signaling dataset, achieving a precision of 0.952 and recovering key causal relationships with no incorrect edges. Taking together, these results showcase R e X’s effectiveness in accurately recovering true causal structures while minimizing false positive predictions, its robustness across diverse datasets, and its applicability to real-world problems. By combining ML and explainability techniques with causal discovery, R e X bridges the gap between predictive modeling and causal inference, offering an effective tool for understanding complex causal structures.

  abstract     = {Fuzzy clustering, as an important data analysis method, has gained extensive application in several fields. However, there are two problems with traditional fuzzy clustering that affect the performance of clustering results. One problem is that traditional fuzzy clustering algorithms map samples to membership space, only considering the relationship between samples and cluster centers, without taking into account local structural information between samples. Another problem is that traditional fuzzy clustering algorithms fail to take into account both the balance and distinguishability of membership degrees simultaneously. To address these problems, we propose a fuzzy clustering algorithm with locality preserving based on anchor graph (FCLPAG). We utilize the graph regularization term to ensure that the samples in the membership space preserve the local structure in the original space. To expedite the clustering, the model first constructs the membership matrix A from samples to anchors, then learns the membership matrix B from anchors to cluster centers, and finally obtains the membership matrix U from samples to cluster centers by U = A B . In addition, we introduce a quadratic programming term and a cluster balance constraint term to ensure that the clustering results are simultaneously distinguishable and balanced. Finally, we used an iterative optimization method to address the model, and conducted experiments on eight benchmark datasets, which demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.},

In this paper, we propose a novel one-shot multi-target image domain adaptation model based on kernel modulation.

By effectively mining strong negative samples from cross-domain knowledge, it aims to maximize the structural feature from the source domain and accurately reflect the unique attributes of various style target domains.

In this study, we present a complex-valued neural network designed for accurate estimation of frequency components encompassing both magnitude and phase, the Unified-Complex High-Resolution Frequency Representation Module (UHFreq). This method generates comprehensive high-resolution frequency domain representations, addressing key limitations in current approaches that typically capture only amplitude information, omit crucial phase details, and suffer from low resolution in frequency domain outputs. Furthermore, conventional methods for physiological signal detection and recognition require meticulous preprocessing steps, including demodulation and filtering. In response to these challenges, we propose UHFreq-based Vital Sign Status Detection Network (UVSD-Net), an application example of UHFreq, which classifies different human physiological states starting from raw radar echoes. This model utilizes the UHFreq structure as the frontend for the frequency domain representation of physiological signals from raw radar echoes. The UVSD-Net architecture incorporates a dual-pathway design: one pathway processes frequency domain features via UHFreq, while the other applies time domain amplitude and phase information from the raw radar signals. Furthermore, a weight redistribution mechanism is introduced across the different feature domains to enhance cross-domain feature integration and interaction. This comprehensive end-to-end framework offers a robust approach for analyzing time domain original signals and enables effective execution of downstream tasks.},

To address this challenge, we propose Multi-AD, an unsupervised convolutional neural network (CNN) model for robust anomaly detection across medical and industrial domain images. Our approach utilizes the squeeze-and-excitation (SE) block to enhance feature extraction by applying channel-wise attention, enabling the model to focus on the most relevant features and detect subtle anomalies. Additionally, knowledge distillation (KD) transfers informative features from the teacher to the student model, enabling effective learning of the differences between normal and anomalous data. Then, the discriminator network further enhances the model’s capacity to distinguish between normal and anomalous data. At the inference stage, by integrating multi-scale features, the student model gains the ability to detect anomalies of varying sizes. Teacher-student ( T - S ) architecture ensures consistency in representing high-dimensional features while adapting these features to improve anomaly detection. Multi-AD was evaluated on several medical datasets, including brain MRI, liver CT, and retina OCT, as well as industrial datasets, such as MVTec AD, demonstrating strong generalization across multiple domains. Experimental results demonstrated that our approach consistently outperformed state-of-the-art models, achieving the best average accuracy for anomaly localization at both the image level (81.4 % for medical and 99.6 % for industrial) and pixel level (97.0 % for medical and 98.4 % for industrial), making it effective for real-world applications.},

  abstract     = {Remote sensing semantic segmentation has been widely used in recent years. Most existing works focus on combining CNNs and Transformer or Mamba to extract local and global information. However, they suffer from the following drawbacks. Firstly, the high interclass similarity and significant variations of object sizes are rarely considered. Secondly, existing models with high accuracy tend to have more parameters, which limits their deployment on limited computational resources. To tackle these challenges, we propose a lightweight semantic segmentation method, termed Multilevel Multiscale Dual-Path Fusion Network (MMDNet), which can enhance the discrimination of similar categories and has strong boundary awareness capability. Specifically, MMDNet consists of three key modules: AIC-XLSTM, Reinforced Information Fusion Module (RIFM), and Regional Attention Balancing Module (RABM). AIC-XLSTM uses the exponential gating of Vision-LSTM (ViL) to enhance differences between similar categories and compensates for the loss of detail information through an improved linear head. RIFM adopts a three-stage strategy to filter out the noises from features of both paths and fuse them. RABM, by smoothing the attention response, enables the model to focus on objects while handling their edges, boosting the classification accuracy of boundaries. Experimental results on four remote sensing datasets (i.e., Vaihingen, Potsdam, LoveDA and FloodNet) demonstrate superior segmentation performance and efficiency compared to state-of-the-art approaches. In detail, MMDNet achieves the highest mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) among all dataset, while utilizing the fewest parameters. For example, MMDNet achieves 76.28 % mIoU on Vaihingen dataset, outperforming all methods, with only 24.92 % of the compared method’s average parameters.

  abstract     = {Crowd localization aims to predict the precise location of each instance within an image. Current advanced methods utilize pixel-wise binary classification to address the congested prediction, where pixel-level thresholds convert prediction confidence into binary values for identifying pedestrian heads. Due to the extremely variable contents, counts, and scales in crowd scenes, the confidence-threshold learner is fragile and lacks generalization when encountering domain shifts. Moreover, in most cases, the target domain is unknown during training. Therefore, it is crucial to explore how to enhance the generalization of the confidence-threshold locator to latent target domains. In this paper, we propose a Dynamic Proxy Domain (DPD) method to improve the generalization of the learner under domain shifts. Concretely, informed by the theoretical analysis of the upper bound of generalization error risk for a binary classifier on latent target domains, we introduce a generated proxy domain to facilitate generalization. Then, based on this theory, we design a DPD algorithm consisting of a training paradigm and a proxy domain generator to enhance the domain generalization of the confidence-threshold learner. Additionally, we apply our method to five types of domain shift scenarios, demonstrating its effectiveness in generalizing crowd localization.

  abstract     = {Most existing deep fusion models operate predominantly in the spatial domain, which limits their ability to effectively preserve texture details. In contrast, methods that incorporate frequency-domain information often suffer from inadequate interaction with spatial-domain features, thereby constraining overall fusion performance. To address these limitations, we propose a Collaborative Spatial-Frequency Learning Network (CSFNet) for infrared and visible image fusion. In the frequency-domain learning branch, we introduce a frequency refinement module based on wavelet transform to enable cross-band feature interaction and facilitate effective multi-scale feature fusion. In the spatial-domain branch, we embed a learnable low-rank decomposition model that extracts low-rank features from infrared images and sparse detail features from visible images, forming the basis of a dedicated spatial feature extraction module. Additionally, an information aggregation module is designed to learn complementary representations and integrate cross-domain features efficiently. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, we conducted extensive experiments on three publicly available datasets: MSRS, TNO, and RoadScene, and compared CSFNet with sixteen state-of-the-art (SOTA) fusion methods. On the MSRS dataset, CSFNet achieved favorable results, with a mean and standard deviation of SF = 12.2108 ± 3.8706, VIF = 1.0232 ± 0.1397, Qabf = 0.7112 ± 0.0397, SSIM = 0.6909 ± 0.0859, PSNR = 17.6517 ± 3.8767, and AG = 4.0243 ± 1.5465.

  abstract     = {The one-class classification (OCC) problem has garnered considerable research attention owing to the inherent difficulty and high cost associated with acquiring abnormal samples in many application scenarios. Among the existing methodologies, support vector data description (SVDD) has emerged as a classical approach, spawning a wide array of variants. Despite its extensive development, several critical challenges persist. For instance, (i) existing SVDD-based methods exhibit limitations when addressing multimodal data, particularly when the dimensions of each modality differ; (ii) these methods are highly sensitive to the trade-off parameter; and (iii) many SVDD variants demonstrate inadequate performance in scenarios with a scarce number of abnormal samples. To overcome these issues, we propose a novel one-class classification framework termed distribution entropy regularized multimodal subspace SVDD (DEMS-SVDD). Our contributions are threefold. First, we design two novel regularization terms—the multimodal graph regularization and the sparse projection matrix regularization—which collectively exploit complementary information and preserve consistency across multimodal data even when abnormal samples are limited. Second, we introduce a new weighting scheme, derived from sample distribution and information entropy theories and denoted as distribution entropy-based weights, to assign adaptive importance to each sample. Third, our framework considers the uncertainty of classification, the amount of information contained, the importance of establishing hypersphere boundaries, as well as the sample distribution. The DEMS-SVDD is instantiated in two variants, namely linear and nonlinear, and extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate its superior performance and robustness compared with numerous existing algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Incomplete Multi-View Clustering (IMC) plays a pivotal role in integrating and analyzing multi-view data with missing information. Most of existing IMC methods improve clustering performance by inherently incorporating a data recovery step to derive a common representation or consensus graph. However, the imputation of missing data may introduce biased errors, which can accumulate and amplify during iterative optimization, ultimately distorting clustering results. To tackle this critical issue, we propose a novel unified optimization framework that jointly learns data completion and error removal in a mutually reinforcing manner. Specifically, our method introduces a dual-path architecture: one path reconstructs missing views via self-representation, while the other path explicitly models and eliminates biased errors. Crucially, these two components interact via an alternating minimization scheme, enabling them to mutually enhance each other. This synergy effectively reduces error accumulation, leading to a more accurate graph for clustering. Experiments on real-world datasets show that the proposed framework achieves state-of-the-art performance under extremely high missing rates (up to 90 %), significantly reducing error propagation while outperforming existing baselines.},

Existing approaches like data resampling distort the original data distribution and may impair the ability of deep learning models to learn intrinsic data features. To address this issue, we propose a novel Time series Dual-Branch Balance Contrastive Learning (TDBCL) method that synergistically integrates contrastive learning and classification learning. TDBCL employs a synchronous dual-branch multi-task learning strategy to simultaneously perform contrastive representation learning and resampled classifier learning, improving the classification of highly imbalanced time series. For the contrastive learning branch, we propose a Cross-Category Data Augmentation Combination Strategy to enhance feature diversity and representativeness. In the classification learning branch, we introduce the DDTSS resampling algorithm tailored for time series, combining a novel DDTW-Tomek Link undersampling method and Self-SMOTE oversampling technique. DDTSS is applicable to complex scenarios including multivariate, multi-class, highly imbalanced, and few-sample extreme imbalance situations. Furthermore, TDBCL introduces a novel Cosine Annealing Transfer Learning strategy to dynamically adjust the focus between contrastive and classification learning during training. This strategy enables a smooth transition from feature learning to classification, facilitating effective collaboration between the two branches and significantly enhancing overall performance. Extensive experiments on imbalanced UCR and UEA datasets demonstrate TDBCL’s state-of-the-art performance, especially in highly imbalanced scenarios. The proposed methods provide an effective solution for handling class imbalance in time series classification. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/haobinlaosi/TDBCL .},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we demonstrate that CLIP can also be adapted to downstream tasks where its vision-language alignment is suboptimally learned during pre-training on web-crawled data, all without requiring fine-tuning. We explore the case of monocular depth estimation, where CLIP’s contrastive prior struggles to generalize, compared to its success in domains such as generative modeling and semantic segmentation. Since CLIP fails to consistently capture similarities between image patches and natural language prompts describing distance, we eliminate the use of its pre-trained natural language token embeddings and distill the semantic prior of its frozen text encoder into a single learnable embedding matrix called “mirror” . The main design goal of mirror is to derive a non-human language prompt that approximates an optimal natural language prompt: “ How far is this location from the camera? ” Using this approach, we jointly train two lightweight modules, a mirror and a compact decoder, on top of a frozen CLIP for dense depth prediction. Compared to conventional depth models, our framework is significantly more efficient in terms of parameters and computation. The resulting model exhibits impressive performance, matching several state-of-the-art vision models on the NYU Depth v2 and KITTI benchmark datasets, while outperforming all vision-language depth models based on a frozen CLIP prior. Specifically, our method reduces the Absolute Relative Error (Abs Rel) by 68.7 % on NYU Depth v2 and by 75.6 % on KITTI compared to the method of Auty et al. , a representative CLIP-based baseline. Experiments demonstrate that the suboptimal depth understanding of CLIP in terms of spatial and temporal consistency can be significantly corrected without either fine-tuning it or concatenating mirror with its pre-trained subword token embeddings. Furthermore, an ablation study on the convergence status of mirror shows that it is implicitly trained to capture objects, such as humans and windows, where semantic cues play an important role in detection.},

  abstract     = {Style and content information, which are model-independent inherent properties of an image, serve as crucial information that deep neural networks depend on for classification tasks. However, most existing gradient-based attacks mainly distort content-related information through semantic distortion of the model’s final output, neglecting the role of style information. To fully distort the inherent intrinsic information of the image, this paper proposes Semantic-Style joint Expectation Perturbations (SSEPs). Specifically, we first establish a style loss based on the kernel function from the feature space of the surrogate model and inject it into gradient-based attacks to form a Semantics-Style joint Loss (SSL) for generating joint perturbations. Subsequently, we use gradient normalization and the proposed dynamic gradient decomposition scheme to address the problems of multi-objective gradient magnitude differences and gradient conflicts that occur in SSL during optimization. Finally, we generate SSEPs by motivating the maximization of the expected loss, thereby enhancing the transferability of Adversarial Examples (AEs). On the ImageNet sub-dataset, extensive experiments show that AEs covered with SSEPs have high transferability. Compared to the baseline attack (MI-FGSM), our method achieves at least a 14 % and 5 % higher attack success rate for normally trained models and defense models, respectively. Compared with other classic and advanced gradient-based attacks and feature-level attacks, our method still has advantages in attack performance.

However, existing state-of-the-art noisy label learning methods typically employ a small loss trick, which can result in over-cleaning and error accumulation during training. In this paper, a Progressive Cross-Validation Learning (PCVL) method is proposed for signal classification with noisy labels. PCVL addresses the problem of mislabeled samples in the signal dataset with a two-step sample filtering approach. Specifically, in the initial phase, the samples are divided into K-folds, with each fold being trained separately using K models. These models are cross-validated with each other to select reliable candidate cleaning samples. The K independent training datasets help to increase the discrepancy between models, thereby enhancing the accuracy of sample selection. In the second step, the loss distribution of the candidate samples is approximated, and the class loss margins are estimated for the criterion of reliable sample selection. The employment of a two-step sample selection process affords PCVL the benefits of circumventing over-cleaning and the reliable selection of clean samples. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that PCVL can effectively improve the performance of signal classification in the presence of noisy labels. Furthermore, PCVL does not require the prior label noise rate and is more robust than its counterparts.},

Most current recognition scenarios are indoor with single or slightly-changing illumination on finger veins. In outdoor scenarios, collected finger vein images have obvious illumination intensity variations. Environmental lighting severely impacts the inter-class distance of veins, and data collection is often under a single lighting condition, challenging recognition performance. To tackle these problems, we propose a feature-disentanglement-based finger vein recognition model for outdoor scenarios with dynamic illumination changes which aims to extend finger vein recognition performance from single-to multi-illumination intensity scenarios. we first adopt a multi-task learning strategy to separate the features into identity features and illumination features, and we construct an Illumination Linear Removal Network (ILR) to obtain independent illumination components without identity information and extract illumination-independent features. Secondly, we design an Interchangeable Reconstruction and Redecomposition Loss (IRRL) by exchanging the independent feature components of two finger vein images, the mixed features are reconstructed and then decomposed into independent feature components again, so as to strengthen the decomposition process and the extraction of inherent identity features. Finally, we release a new annotated multi-illumination finger vein dataset (MIFVD) with significant illumination intensity differences, annotated for identity and illumination intensity. This dataset is designed to replicate and validate the variations in finger vein data collected in outdoor scenarios. Extensive experiments on MIFVD demonstrate the strong single-illumination generalization ability of our method.

However, due to its unique imaging principles, SAR images contain significant speckle noise and blurred boundary and detail features, which reduces the detection accuracy and leads to missed detection and false detection. To address these issues, this paper proposes a SAR image CD method based on saliency region guidance and Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) keypoint extraction to reduce the interference of speckle noise. First, a saliency region guidance method is introduced to analyze the saliency of local features in SAR images, extracting potentially changed regions and reducing the interference of speckle noise. Second, the SIFT is employed to extract keypoints in regions significantly different from the background in the difference map, leveraging its robustness to speckle noise. By extracting keypoints, the approximate location and extent of the changed regions are determined. These are, then, fused with the saliency region information, enhancing the saliency weights of pixels around keypoints for more extraction of change regions. Finally, a Vision Transformer (ViT) detection network is used for SAR image CD, utilizing the combined saliency information from the original saliency map and SIFT keypoints. This approach effectively integrates SIFT’s stable description of local features with ViT’s modeling capability for global features, improving the model’s accuracy and robustness.},

Despite progress achieved by deep learning methods, particularly graph neural networks, challenges remain in handling multi-scale temporal patterns and complex spatial dependencies. Spatiotemporal datasets are characterized by heterogeneous temporal patterns, encompassing short-term variations, long-term trends, and seasonal cycles, which pose difficulties for unified representation learning. Additionally, spatial correlations vary across scales and cannot be fully captured by predefined graph structures. Although frequency-domain decomposition has emerged as a promising solution for multi-scale time series modeling, the lack of theoretical insight into its effectiveness limits its application. To address these issues, we propose FMSGL, a Frequency-domain Multi-Scale Graph Learning network with an Information-Theoretic Constraint. This model utilizes DB4 wavelet decomposition to extract features across multiple frequency components and adaptively learns graph structures at different scales. A Scale Independence Constraint is introduced to theoretically support decomposition-based modeling, and a Wavelet Weighted MSE loss function is designed to emphasize frequency-specific importance. Experimental results demonstrate that FMSGL consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in modeling complex spatiotemporal data.},

  abstract     = {Image enhancement plays a fundamental role in image processing and computer vision. Its primary purpose is to improve the visual quality of an image by enhancing its contrast and brightness. However, most existing enhancement methods tend to amplify the imaging noise, especially in very dark regions of the image, leading to undesirable artifacts in the enhanced result. To address this problem, this paper aims to develop a method that enhances low-light images without introducing these artifacts. We propose a novel anisotropic p th-order total variation-based (ApTV-based) Retinex decomposition with an adaptive reflectance regularizer for low-light image enhancement, where p represents the exponent in our regularization term, controlling the degree of structure preservation in the resulting image. Specifically, for 0 < p ≤ 1 , the ApTV with a smaller p -value can effectively extract strong structures of the image, making it suitable for piecewise smooth illumination estimation. In contrast, a larger p -value can help preserve the image’s fine details and suppress noise, making it favorable for accurate reflectance estimation. More importantly, since the degree of noise amplification varies across different regions, we incorporate the obtained illumination into the reflectance regularizer to enable adaptive denoising. Extensive numerical experiments and comparisons with state-of-the-art low-light image enhancement methods demonstrate that the proposed adaptive Retinex decomposition approach achieves superior performance both qualitatively and quantitatively. It effectively addresses noise amplification and artifact issues while enhancing overall image quality.},

However, these methods simply add noise to the rendered images and fail to construct explicit 3D adversarial samples limited by the implicit representation of NeRF. To address the above limitation, we propose a novel G aussian S plitting Attack ( GSAttack ) scheme based on Gaussian Splatting to generate explicit 3D adversarial samples that deceive the classifier in various viewpoints . Specifically, we first quantify the contribution of each Gaussian based on its gradient in adversarial attack. Subsequently, we split tiny Gaussians from the high contribution Gaussians as initial 3D perturbations, which are then optimized by adversarial loss to ensure deception in diverse viewpoints. Furthermore, to ensure the invisibility of 3D perturbation, we devise position and color losses to make the perturbations tightly bound to the object surface and minimize the color differences. Owing to these ingenious designs, our 3D perturbations are more natural in space and effective attack neural network. Experimental results show that the 3D adversarial samples generated by our GSAttack can effectively deceive the classifier over a wider range of viewpoints and achieve superior visualization compared to existing schemes.},

  abstract     = {Current anchor graph-based multi-view clustering methods can effectively address the problem of high computational cost for clustering large-scale multimedia data. However, they have the following shortcomings: (1) The relationships between anchor points are not adequately considered. (2) The correlations between the consistent anchor graph and diverse anchor graphs are ignored. To handle these issues, we propose a novel multi-view clustering method named Hypergraph Regularization-Based Anchor Learning (HRFAL). Specifically, we first process the original data to obtain a consistent anchor graph and diverse anchor graphs, which can explore more comprehensive consistent and complementary information. Meanwhile, the hyper-Laplacian regularization is applied to the anchor points to explore the higher-order relationships between the anchor points, thus enabling the generation of high-quality anchor graphs. Furthermore, the orthogonal diversity constraints are imposed on the consistent and diverse anchor graphs to enhance the distinction between the consistent and diverse components, resulting in better exploitation of consistent and complementary information. Finally, the Schatten p -norm constraint is implemented on the consistent anchor graph to maintain its low-rank structure, thus obtaining more robust consistent information. Experimental results on eight multi-view datasets show that HRFAL exhibits superior performance in terms of accuracy and speed.},

  abstract     = {The core task of feature matching is establishing correspondences between two images. The methods based on Transformers have achieved impressive results, which can directly capture the relationships among all features without relying on the distances between them. However, it also reduce the weight of long-distance texture features and ignore simultaneous integration of global, local, and multi-scale features, leading to limited matching accuracy. To address this issue, we propose a detector-free feature matching method based on Transformer with multi-level processing and coarse-grained filtering. First, we apply a local window aggregation module to minimize irrelevant interference through window attention and combine local self-attention with global self-attention to ensure the features have a global perspective but not lose local details. Then, the multi-scale features are processed in layers, integrating multi-scale information into the matching phase, allowing each layer to perform feature matching at different scales for more precise matches. Additionally, we designed a filter to discard incorrectly matched points in the global context, thereby improving the accuracy of the matching points. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method delivers excellent results comparing with the current state-of-the-art techniques in the tasks of pose estimation, homography estimation, and visual localization. Compared with the baseline method LoFTR, our method achieves an average improvement of 16.07 % in pose estimation, 6.52 % in homography estimation, and 9.69 % in visual localization. Meanwhile, our method also demonstrates superior performance compared to other state-of-the-art feature matching approaches.},

  abstract     = {Contrastive deep graph clustering has attracted widespread attention due to its self-supervised representation learning mechanism and excellent clustering performance. Although, most existing methods rely on low-pass filtering to achieve denoising, ignoring the potential benefit of high-frequency information and noise in obtaining comprehensive and robust representation. Second, commonly used contrastive learning strategies generally treat non-target samples as negative samples, which is prone to triggering contrastive bias and weakening the representation quality. To this end, this paper proposes a novel contrastive graph clustering framework, Dual-level Noise Augmentation for Graph Clustering with triplet-wise Contrastive learning (DNA-CGC), strengthening the benefit of noise to enrich the representation learning and amplify the contrastive learning efficacy. It consists of two core modules, Hybrid Noise Representation Augmentation (HNRA) and Noise-Aware Contrastive Learning (NACL). The HNRA module integrates low- and high-frequency graph signals to capture both shared and distinctive node characteristics, while introducing Gaussian noise as beneficial perturbation to enrich the representation diversity, thereby achieving multi-information fusion under hybrid noise. The NACL module, on the other hand, generates exclusive negative samples through Gaussian noise and constructs the triplet-wise contrastive pairs (Target, Positive, Negative), mitigating the contrastive bias by preventing false negatives and further facilitating more accurate semantic alignment. Extensive experiments on six benchmark datasets validate the significant advantages of DNA-CGC in terms of clustering performance and representation quality.

Hence, an efficient navigation plan is essential for the final success. This paper proposes a novel parameter-efficient action planner using large language models (PEAP-LLM) to generate a single-step instruction at each location. The proposed model consists of two modules, LLM goal planner (LGP) and LoRA action planner (LAP). Initially, LGP extracts the goal-oriented plan from REVERIE instructions, including the target object and room. Then, LAP generates a single-step instruction with the goal-oriented plan, high-level instruction, and current visual observation as input. PEAP-LLM enables the embodied agent to interact with LAP as the path planner on the fly. A simple direct application of LLMs hardly achieves good performance. Moreover, existing hard-prompt-based methods are prone to errors in complex scenarios and require human intervention. To address these issues and prevent the LLM from generating hallucinations and biased information, we propose a novel two-stage method for fine-tuning the LLM, consisting of supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and direct preference optimization (DPO). SFT improves the quality of the generated instructions, while DPO incorporates environmental feedback into fine-tuning. Experimental results demonstrate a noticeable enhancement over the baseline model on the REVERIE benchmark.},

  abstract     = {Automated lesion segmentation of medical images has made tremendous improvements in recent years due to deep learning advancements. However, accurately capturing fine-grained global and regional feature representations remains a challenge. Many existing methods achieve suboptimal performance in complex lesion segmentation due to information loss during typical downsampling operations and insufficient capture of either regional or global features. To address these issues, we propose the Global and Regional Compensation Segmentation Framework (GRCSF), which introduces two key innovations: the Global Compensation Unit (GCU) and the Region Compensation Unit (RCU). The proposed GCU addresses resolution loss in the U-shaped backbone by preserving global contextual features and fine-grained details during multiscale downsampling. Meanwhile, the RCU introduces a self-supervised learning (SSL) residual map generated by Masked Autoencoders (MAE), obtained as pixel-wise differences between reconstructed and original images, to highlight regions with potential lesions. These SSL residual maps guide precise lesion localization and segmentation through a patch-based cross-attention mechanism that integrates regional spatial and pixel-level features. Additionally, the RCU incorporates patch-level importance scoring to enhance feature fusion by leveraging global spatial information from the backbone. Experiments on three publicly available medical image segmentation datasets, including brain stroke lesion, lung tumor and coronary artery calcification datasets, demonstrate that our GRCSF outperforms state-of-the-art methods, confirming its effectiveness across diverse lesion types and its potential as a generalizable lesion segmentation solution.},

We propose RGBX-DiffusionDet, a generalized diffusion-based object detection framework that enables seamless fusion of heterogeneous 2D modalities (denoted as “X”, e.g., depth, infrared, and polarimetric data) with RGB imagery. The proposed approach adopts a mid-level feature fusion strategy to address the heterogeneous nature of multimodal data, characterized by varying spatial resolutions, noise profiles, and semantic content. Instead of commonly used brute-force feature concatenation, we introduce two novel architectural components: (1) a dynamic channel reduction convolutional block attention module (DCR-CBAM), which enhances cross-modal fusion by emphasizing salient channel features while reducing the dimensionality of merged RGB-X features, and (2) a dynamic multi-level aggregation block (DMLAB), which addresses a limitation of the baseline DiffusionDet decoder by adaptively fusing spatial features to improve object localization. Additionally, we incorporate novel regularization losses that promote channel saliency and spatial selectivity, resulting in compact and discriminative feature embeddings. Extensive experiments on RGB-depth (KITTI), a newly annotated RGB-polarimetric (RGB-P) dataset, and RGB-infrared (M3FD) benchmarks demonstrate consistent superiority of the proposed approach over RGB-only baselines, while maintaining decoding efficiency. We further show that RGBX-DiffusionDet exhibits improved robustness and generalization capability in visually-corrupted conditions, demonstrating its practical efficiency for robust multimodal object detection.},

  abstract     = {Multiple distributed medical institutions can leverage federated learning (FL) to collaboratively build a shared prediction model with privacy protection. However, the presence of non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data in medical imaging leads to data drift in practical learning scenarios, detrimentally affecting both convergence and generalization to the unseen domain. In this paper, we propose a novel framework named Federated Frequency Adaptive Interpolation(FedFAT), which leverages a frequency space adaptive interpolation mechanism to mitigate data drift in federated domain generalization. FedFAT enables clients to adaptively exchange partial amplitude information, leveraging multi-source data distributions to enhance generalization. Crucially, local phase information is retained to preserve privacy. To mitigate data drift, FedFAT employs cross-client feature alignment via amplitude normalization, which effectively batch-normalizes images from diverse source distributions. Furthermore, we introduce a client-specific weight perturbation mechanism designed to guide local models toward a consistent low-loss region. We have theoretically analyzed the proposed method and empirically conducted extensive experiments on two medical image classification and segmentation tasks, showing that FedFAT outperforms a set of recent state-of-the-art methods with average Dice improvement of 2.42 % and 10.61 % on the prostate MRI segmentation datasets (PROMISE12, PROSTATEx, and NCI-ISBI) and breast cancer classification datasets(CAMELYON17), respectively. FedFAT also has an improvement of 4.15 % on generalization performance. These results demonstrate the superiority of FedFAT in handling data drift and improving generalization performance.},

The network mainly consists of the following three core modules: the Hilbert curve enhanced Visual Mamba Block (HVM Block), Selective Attention Fusion Module (SAFM), and Multi-scale Context-Aware Module (MCAM). The HVM Block utilizes the Hilbert curve to reduce the dimensionality of two-dimensional images and applies a selective scanning algorithm in Mamba, enabling the network to effectively capture local dependencies while maintaining a global receptive field, thereby optimizing the consistency of intra-class semantic information. The SAFM module effectively merges local detail information from shallow networks with global semantic information from deep networks, alleviating the problem of local detail information loss. Finally, the MCAM module, introduced at the end of the network, enhances the model,s ability to judge contextual information, thereby improving segmentation accuracy.

This hierarchical relevance-guided refinement mechanism helps the model extract more fine-grained representations. Furthermore, we propose a hierarchical spatial-frequency contrastive learning mechanism (HSCL), facilitating the dual-domain information fusion and learning an embedding space with enhanced intra-class consistency and inter-class diversity by modeling intra-domain and cross-domain feature correlations on multi-level features in the spatial and frequency domains.

  abstract     = {Weakly supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) using image-level labels aims to create pseudo-labels leveraging Class Activation Maps (CAM) to train a separate segmentation model. Recent methods that utilize Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) models have achieved significant advancements. These approaches take advantage of CLIP’s capability to identify various categories without requiring additional training. However, due to the limited local information of the final embedding layer, the CAM generated by the CLIP model is still a rough region with an under-activated or over-activated issue. Furthermore, the abundant multi-layer information of CLIP, which plays a vital role in dense prediction, has been ignored. In this paper, we proposed a LayerCLIP model for a fine-grained CAM generation via hierarchical features, which consists of two consecutive components: a dynamic hierarchical CAMs module and an adaptive affinity module. Specifically, the dynamic hierarchical CAMs module utilizes the hierarchical features to produce two complementary CAMs, along with a dynamic strategy to fuse these CAMs. Subsequently, the affinity based on multi-head self-attention is adaptively reweighted to refine CAM by the CAM itself in the adaptive affinity module. LayerCLIP significantly enhances the quality of CAM. Our method achieves a new state-of-the-art performance on PASCAL VOC 2012 (75.1 % mIoU) and MS COCO 2014 (46.9 % mIoU) through extensive benchmark experiments.},

However, the field of image Dehazing is currently encountering a bottleneck. We can identify two primary reasons for the difficulty in further enhancing Dehazing quality. First, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) struggle to capture long-range dependencies. Second, haze causes pixels that are similar in haze-free images to diverge in appearance. To address these challenges simultaneously, we propose a Wavelet-Based Physically Guided Normalization Dehazing Network (WBPGNDN). Specifically, we introduce a physically guided Normalization designed to restore the similarity of pixels as seen in haze-free images. Additionally, we utilize Wavelet Decomposition to seize long-range dependencies. While traditional methods typically apply wavelet decomposition in the image domain, we instead implement it in the feature domain. Experiments on both real and simulated hazy images demonstrate the Dehazing efficacy of our proposed method. The extensive results indicate that our approach matches or surpasses state-of-the-art methods, yielding high-quality visual outcomes and effectively addressing the limitations of existing methods.},

  abstract     = {Recent unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) methods show the effectiveness of pseudo-labels for unlabeled target domain. However, pseudo-labels inevitably contain noise, which can degrade adaptation performance. This paper thus propose a Generative models for Noise-Robust Training (GeNRT), a method designed to mitigate label noise while reducing domain shift. The key idea is leveraging the class-wise distributions of the target domain, modeled by generative models, provide more reliable pseudo-labels than individual pseudo-labeled instances. This is because the distributions statistically better represent class-wise information than a single instance. Based on this observation, GeNRT incorporates a Distribution-based Class-wise Feature Augmentation (D-CFA), which enhances feature representations by sampling features from target class distributions modeled by generative models. These augmented features serve a dual purpose: (1) providing class-level knowledge from generative models to train a noise-robust discriminative classifier, and (2) acting as intermediate features to bridge the domain gap at the class level. Furthermore, GeNRT leverages Generative and Discriminative Consistency (GDC), enforcing consistency regularization between a generative classifier (formed by all class-wise generative models) and the learned discriminative classifier. By aggregating knowledge across target class distributions, GeNRT improves pseudo-label reliability and enhances robustness against label noise. Extensive experiments on Office-Home, VisDA-2017, PACS, and Digit-Five show that our GeNRT achieves comparable performance to state-of-the-art methods under both single-source and multi-source UDA settings.},

The generic object detectors suffer a dramatic performance degradation on tiny object detection. For this purpose, we present a tiny object detection approach based on Dynamic scale-awareness label assignment and Contextual enhancement (DCNet), which improves the tiny object detection performance from label assignment and feature enhancement perspectives. Considering the IoU-based label assignment seriously harms the positive samples for tiny objects, we design a Dynamic Scale-Awareness (DSA) label assignment to replace it in the region proposal network. The DSA label assignment adaptively rescales preset anchors and introduces the regression information to better assign the preset anchors for tiny objects. Furthermore, the tiny objects often exhibit weak feature responses due to their poor-quality appearance. Therefore, we propose a contextual enhancement module that aggregates contextual information at different scales to enhance tiny objects’ feature responses. Comprehensive experimental analyses on multiple datasets confirm the effectiveness and good generality of our proposed DCNet in tiny object detection.},

This work aims to simultaneously remove the surgical smoke and restore true-to-life image colors with deep learning. However, deep learning-based smoke removal remains a challenge due to: 1) the non-homogeneous distribution of surgical smoke, 2) higher frequency modes being hindered from being learned due to spectral bias. In this work, we propose the multi-frequency shared-feature-learning based conditional diffusion model with adaptive smoke attention for removing surgical smoke. The proposed model learns to map both the smoky and smokeless images into a shared inherent feature by the forward learning and synthesize the smokeless image by the reverse learning, and the input noisy image used for the forward learning is wrapped by the smoke attention learning to ease sampling steps and facilitate shared feature optimization. The smoke attention learning employs smoke segmentation and convolutional block attention modules to capture the non-homogeneous features of smoke. The multi-frequency learning is introduced to incorporate with shared feature learning to enhance the mid-to-high frequency features. In addition, the multi-task learning incorporates shared feature loss, smoke perception loss, dark channel prior loss, and contrast enhancement loss to help the model optimization. The experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms other state-of-the-art methods on both synthetic/real laparoscopic surgical images, with the potential to be embedded in laparoscopic devices for de-smoking.},

GNNs are heavily based on manually defined brain topology; if there are false connections or noise, it will greatly affect the decoding performance. To address the aforementioned challenges, a series of GNN-based graph topology learning (GTL) methods have received widespread attention due to their ability to automatically optimize brain topology. However, existing GTL methods are usually implemented in a supervised manner and rely on a large amount of annotated data, making it difficult to directly transfer them to different decoding scenarios. Therefore, in this paper, a Brain Topology Inference framework based on Multi-View Contrastive Self-supervised Learning (BTI-MVCSL) is proposed for neural decoding. Specifically, BTI-MVCSL first designs a series of graph learners, which can infer brain topological connections as “learner”, generate topology learning objectives as “instructor” from the original fMRI data, and maximize consistency between “instructor” and “learner” to extract the rich information in hidden connections. Furthermore, in order to achieve fully automated topology learning guidance, BTI-MVCSL develops a new self-learning mechanism that can use the “learner”-view brain topology to update the “instructor”-view brain topology during model optimization and further achieves comparative constraints through the “instructor” topology. The proposed BTI-MVCSL has been extensively evaluated in two publicly available fMRI datasets, demonstrating superior performance and revealing potential changes in brain topology under different decoding tasks.},

  abstract     = {LiDAR perception is a critical task in 3D computer vision. Currently, inspired by the success of vision transformers in 2D images, many LiDAR-based detectors also partition the whole scene point cloud into non-overlapping windows, and perform window attention and window shifting to capture local and global information respectively. While these methods improved performance of LiDAR detection task, they often fail to account for the intrinsic separability of 3D LiDAR point clouds. Unlike 2D images, where objects can overlap and blend into one another, objects in LiDAR are distinct and non-overlapping. In this paper, building upon this insight, we propose the Dynamic Cluster Transformer (DCT), a clustering-based point cloud backbone that incorporates transformer architecture. Our approach is designed to exploit the unique characteristics of LiDAR point clouds, enabling a more efficient 3D feature extraction. Specifically, the DCT architecture comprises two primary modules: Sparse Cluster Generation (SCG) and Cluster Feature Interaction (CFI). The Sparse Cluster Generation is responsible for producing initial sparse cluster features from the entire scene point cloud, providing a basis for local and global feature propagation. The Cluster Feature Interaction then facilitates information propagation between these clusters and surrounding voxels, allowing for a more comprehensive understanding of the spatial relationships. This proposed clustering-based learning process is simple yet effective, conforming to the physical characteristics of LiDAR point clouds. Empirical results demonstrate that DCT achieves state-of-the-art performance on the large-scale Waymo Open Dataset and nuScenes dataset.},

L2 normalized softmax losses (such as NormFace, CosFace, ArcFace, etc.) and Naive softmax losses both reduce the magnitudes of image features in the training process and achieve good results in face recognition and person re-identification tasks, respectively. In this paper, we fully utilize the feature vector magnitudes and propose Condense loss for Re-ID tasks, which replaces the inner production of Naive softmax loss with the negative Euclidean distance. Condense loss generates negative radial gradients when updating weight parameters to push all features compacter. Because the coefficients of tangential gradients (the tangential component of the gradients) are related to feature magnitudes, it ideally provides monotonically decreasing tangential gradients, resulting in gradually diminishing updates that enhance the stability of the training process. We also introduce a margin parameter into Condense loss to enlarge inter-class distances and thus help the model learn more discriminative features. Mathematical analysis is given in this paper, and we have conducted sufficient experiments focusing on Re-ID tasks to prove the corresponding conclusion. The experimental results demonstrate that the Condense loss achieves competitive results compared to the state-of-the-art methods in the person re-identification task.

Existing multi-scale architectures use simple, static channel-wise splitting, limiting expressiveness. To improve this, we introduce a regularized, feature-dependent Shuffle operation and integrate it into vanilla multi-scale architecture. This operation adaptively generates channel-wise weights and shuffles latent variables before splitting them. We observe that such operation guides the variables to evolve in the direction of entropy increase, hence we refer to NFs with the Shuffle operation as Entropy-Informed Weighting Channel Normalizing Flow (EIW-Flow). Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, CelebA, ImageNet, and LSUN demonstrate that EIW-Flow achieves state-of-the-art density estimation and competitive sample quality for deep generative modeling, with minimal computational overhead.},

When post hoc OOD detection is applied at inference time, we discover that it can effectively replace buffer-based strategies. We examine the performance of these methods in terms of classification accuracy of seen samples and rejection rates of unseen samples. We show that our approach achieves competitive performance compared to recent multi-head and single-head methods that rely on memory buffers and other buffer-free approaches. The results show that the proposed approach outperforms them in a closed-world setting and detects unseen samples while being significantly resource-efficient.

  abstract     = {Recent research typically improves the performance of multi-label image recognition by constructing higher-order pairwise label correlations. However, these methods lack the ability to effectively learn multi-scale features, which makes it difficult to distinguish small-scale objects. Moreover, most current attention-based methods to capture local salient features may ignore many useful non-salient features. To address the aforementioned issues, we propose a Transformer-based Progressive Attention Network (TPANet) for multi-label image recognition. Specifically, we first design a new adaptive multi-scale feature attention (AMSA) module to learn cross-scale features in multi-level features. Then, to excavate various useful object features, we introduce the transformer encoder to construct a semantic spatial attention (ESA) module and also propose a context-aware feature enhanced (CAFE) module. The former ESA module is used to discover complete object regions and capture discriminative features, and the latter CAFE module leverages object-local features to enhance pixel-level global features. The proposed TPANet model can generate more accurate object labels in three popular benchmark datasets (i.e., MS-COCO 2014, Pascal VOC 2007 and Visual Genome), and is competitive to state-of-the-art models (e.g., SST and FL-Tran, etc.).},

Nonetheless, existing methods mainly rely on structured knowledge from a single layer, overlooking the valuable discrepant knowledge that captures the diversity and distinctiveness of features across various layers, which is essential for the KD process. We present Layer-wise Correlation and Attention Discrepancy Distillation (LCADD) to tackle this issue, training compact and accurate semantic segmentation networks by considering layer-wise discrepancy knowledge. Specifically, we employ two distillation schemes: (i) correlation discrepancy distillation, which constructs a pixel-wise correlation discrepancy matrix across various layers to seize more detailed spatial dependencies, and (ii) attention discrepancy self-distillation, which aims to guide the shallower layers of the student network to emulate the attention discrepancy maps of the deeper layers, facilitating self-learning of attention discrepancy knowledge within the student network. Each proposed method is designed to work collaboratively in learning discrepancy knowledge, allowing the student network to better imitate the teacher from the perspective of layer-wise discrepancy. Our method has demonstrated superior performance on various semantic segmentation datasets, including Cityscapes, Pascal VOC 2012, and CamVid, compared to the latest knowledge distillation techniques, thereby validating its effectiveness.},

  abstract     = {In gradient masking, certain complex signal processing and probabilistic optimization strategies exhibit favorable characteristics such as nonlinearity, irreversibility, and feature preservation, thereby providing new solutions for adversarial defense. Inspired by this, this paper proposes a plug-and-play gradient semi-masking module ( GSeM ) to improve the adversarial robustness of neural networks. GSeM primarily contains a feature straight-through pathway that allows for normal gradient propagation and a feature mapping pathway that interrupts gradient flow. The multi-pathway and semi-masking characteristics cause GSeM to exhibit opposing behaviors when processing data and gradients. Specifically, during data processing, GSeM compresses the state space of features while introducing white noise augmentation. However, during gradient processing, it leads to inefficient updates to certain parameters and ineffective generation of training examples. To address this shortcoming, we correct gradient propagation and introduce gradient-corrected adversarial training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GSeM differs fundamentally from earlier gradient masking methods: it can genuinely enhance the adversarial defense performance of neural networks, surpassing previous state-of-the-art approaches.},

  abstract     = {Image inpainting is a great challenge when reconstructed with realistic textures and required to enhance the consistency of semantic structures in large-scale missing regions. However, popular structural prior guidance methods primarily rely on the reconstruction of structural features. Due to the Markovian property inherent in purely feedforward architectures, noise undergoes persistent accumulation and propagation in early network layers. Without intermediate feedback mechanisms, minor artifacts in shallow layers would be nonlinearly amplified through successive convolution operations and cannot be timely corrected, thereby hindering the extraction of valid structural information. To this end, we presents a bi-generative network (Bi-GNet) guided by specific semantic structures, including an auxiliary network N s and an inpainting network N inp . Here N s provides the structural prior information to N inp for reconstructing the texture details of images. Additionally, we provide the spatial coordinate attention (SCA) and the adaptive feature filtering (AFF) module to ensure structural consistency and texture plausibility in the reconstructed content. Experiments demonstrate that Bi-GNet significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art approaches on three datasets and achieves good inpainting results on the Mogao Grottoes mural dataset.},

The goal of LML is to train a classification model that estimates the class of each instance using the majority label. This problem is valuable in a variety of applications, including pathology image segmentation, political voting prediction, customer sentiment analysis, and environmental monitoring. To solve LML, we propose a Counting Network trained to produce bag-level majority labels, estimated by counting the number of instances in each class. Furthermore, analysis experiments on the characteristics of LML revealed that bags with a high proportion of the majority class facilitate learning. Based on this result, we developed a Majority Proportion Enhancement Module (MPEM) that increases the proportion of the majority class by removing minority class instances within the bags. Experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method on four datasets compared to conventional MIL methods. Moreover, ablation studies confirmed the effectiveness of each module.

  abstract     = {This paper introduces feature subset weighting using monotone measures for distance-based supervised learning. The Choquet integral is used to define a distance function that incorporates these weights. This integration enables the proposed distances to effectively capture non-linear relationships and account for interactions both between conditional and decision attributes and among conditional attributes themselves, resulting in a more flexible distance measure. In particular, we show how this approach ensures that the distances remain unaffected by the addition of duplicate and strongly correlated features. Another key point of this approach is that it makes feature subset weighting computationally feasible, since only m feature subset weights should be calculated each time instead of calculating all feature subset weights ( 2 m ), where m is the number of attributes. Next, we also examine how the use of the Choquet integral for measuring similarity leads to a non-equivalent definition of distance. The relationship between distance and similarity is further explored through dual measures. Additionally, symmetric Choquet distances and similarities are proposed, preserving the classical symmetry between similarity and distance. Finally, we introduce a concrete feature subset weighting distance, evaluate its performance in a k -nearest neighbours (KNN) classification setting, and compare it against Mahalanobis distances and weighted distance methods.},

  abstract     = {Domain Generalization (DG) learns a model from multiple source domains to combat individual domain differences and ensure generalization to unseen domains. Most existing methods focus on learning domain-invariant absolute representations. However, we empirically observe that such representations often suffer from notable distribution divergence, leading to unstable performance in diverse unseen domains. In contrast, relative representations, constructed w.r.t. a set of anchors, naturally capture geometric relationships and exhibit intrinsic stability within a dataset. Despite this potential, their application to DG remains largely unexplored, due to their common transductive assumption that anchors require access to target-domain data, which is incompatible with the inductive setting of DG. To address this issue, we design Re2SL, a simple and lightweight plug-in module that follows a pre-trained encoder and constructs anchors solely from source-domain prototypes, thereby ensuring a completely inductive design. To our knowledge, Re2SL is the first to explore relative representation for DG. This design is inspired by the insight that ReS idual differences between absolute and domain-specific representations can spontaneously seek stable representations within the same distribution shared across all domains . Leveraging these stable representations, we construct cross-domain ReL ative representation to enhance stability and transferability without accessing any target data during training or anchor computation. Empirical studies show that our constructed representation exhibits minimal H -divergence, confirming its stability. Notably, Re2SL achieves up to 4.3 % improvement while reducing computational cost by 90 %, demonstrating its efficiency.},

First, we introduce a simplified Retinex decomposition by embedding weighted total variation optimization into a single Gaussian convolutional layer, enabling robust illumination estimation without the need for training. Next, we guide the diffusion denoising process using the estimated reflectance map, employing patch-wise inversion and reflectance-conditioned sampling to effectively suppress noise while preserving structural details. Finally, unlike previous diffusion-based LLIE methods that perform only monotonous global brightness enhancement, we incorporate text guidance into the sampling process, enabling controllable enhancement that aligns with user-specific stylistic preferences. RetinexGDP thus provides a modular, interpretable, and text-controllable solution for low-light image enhancement.

  abstract     = {Infrared and visible image fusion (IVIF) aims to fuse thermal target information in infrared images and spatial texture information in visible images, improving the observability and comprehensibility of the fused images. Currently, most IVIF methods suffer from the loss of salient target information and texture details in fused images. To alleviate this problem, a progressive cross-modal feature fusion network (PCFFusion) for IVIF is proposed, which comprises two stages: feature extraction and feature fusion. In the feature extraction stage, to enhance the network’s feature representation capability, a feature decomposition module (FDM) is constructed to extract two modal features of different scales by defining a feature decomposition operation (FDO). In addition, by establishing correlations between the high- frequency and low-frequency components of two modal features, a cross-modal feature enhancement module (CMFEM) is built to realize correction and enhancement of the two features at each scale. The feature fusion stage achieves the fusion of two modal features at each scale and the supplementation of adjacent scale features by constructing three cross-domain fusion module (CDFMs). To constrain the fused results preserve more salient targets and richer texture details, a dual-feature fidelity loss function is defined by constructing a salient weight map to balance the two loss terms. Extensive experiments demonstrate that fusion results of the proposed method highlight prominent targets from infrared images while retaining rich background details from visible images, and the performance of PCFFusion is superior to some advanced methods. Specifically, compared to the optimal results obtained by other comparison methods, the proposed network achieves an average increase of 30.35 % and 10.9 % in metrics Mutual Information (MI) and Standard deviation (SD) on the TNO dataset, respectively.},

The ADM is used to achieve more accurate depth prediction by learning adaptive offsets to decouple the depth prediction from object center constraints. The AHM is proposed to obtain more discriminative task heads through task-aware attention and task-interaction attention. The task-aware attention can generate different weights adapted to different tasks and the task-interaction attention can guide depth tasks to interact with other tasks.

The proposed method: (1) employs Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) and sample entropy-guided Variational Mode Decomposition (VMD) to separate the input time series into noise components and multiple smooth Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMFs), to better capture intrinsic data dynamics; (2) refines the sub-series distribution features via an adaptive module guided by sample entropy, dividing each sub-series into subsequences with maximal distribution difference to improve adaptability to periodic changes and market volatility; (3) predicts each subsequence with adaptive distribution matching based on discontinuous random subsequence combinations, and then linearly superposes the prediction results as a final output, thereby boosting accuracy and generalizability. Comprehensive experiments on both public and self-constructed datasets (including four years of Taobao sales data for dresses, jeans, sweatshirts, and sweaters, totaling over 44.7 million records) demonstrate that TAMD outperforms existing methods significantly, highlighting its effectiveness in revealing the complexity of apparel market data and enhancing prediction performance.},

To the best of our knowledge, this study presents one of the first comprehensive analyses of demographic bias in FAR, proposing a systematic framework to detect, quantify, and promote awareness of both representational and stereotypical biases, supporting their mitigation. Leveraging established taxonomies, we evaluate state-of-the-art datasets using a rigorous set of interpretable bias metrics to uncover hidden demographic imbalances. To support reliable fairness assessment, we first enrich the datasets with standardized demographic annotations using the FairFace model. We then address label inconsistencies through the integration of predictions from advanced Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Our analysis reveals substantial imbalances across gender, age, and racial categories-specifically White, Black, and Asian- affecting dataset composition. Furthermore, we show that conventional fairness metrics often yield divergent assessments, highlighting the importance of multi-metric evaluation. This study provides a replicable methodology and actionable insights to support bias-aware facial analysis.},

However, it encounters two key challenges: the high computational cost of graph construction and eigenvalue decomposition, and the inevitable information deviation introduced by the last process. To tackle these obstacles, we propose Fast Multi-view Discrete Clustering with two solvers (FMDC), to directly and efficiently solve the multi-view graph clustering problem. FMDC involves: (1) generating a compact set of representative anchors to construct anchor graphs, (2) automatically weighting them into a symmetric and doubly stochastic aggregated similarity matrix, (3) executing clustering on the aggregated form with the discrete indicator matrix directly computed through two efficient solvers that we devised. The linear computational complexity of FMDC w.r.t. data size is a notable improvement over traditional quadratic or cubic complexity. Extensive experiments confirm the superior performance of FMDC both in efficiency and in effectiveness.},

Foundation models (FMs) provide a promising enhancement strategy by extracting the text medical knowledge embeddings from FMs and use it to guide the specific classification model. However, the clinical knowledge is generally structurized, and the use of pure text as knowledge representation may not be significant enough for enhancing downstream model. Moreover, the lesion areas are generally subtle, combining FMs to downstream model in a coarse-grained manner still faces challenge in precisely attending the lesions. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel medical image classification model that effectively embeds clinical knowledge through combining graphs and FMs. First, we represent the clinical rules as graphs, where the node describes the critical characteristics of disease. During training, we use FMs to extract the embeddings of node text description, and use graph transformer to extract global representation of graphs. By employing vision transformer to encode input images, we propose a global-local alignment module to transfer clinical knowledge where the embeddings of image branch and graph branch are aligned from image-to-graph level and patch-to-vertex level, respectively. Moreover, we propose a dynamic image patch selection method to reduce the attention of the model to irrelevant and noisy regions. Experimental results on bladder tumor classification dataset verifies that even with limited training data, the proposed method can not only achieve SOTA performance, but also accurately attend the lesion areas, thus improving the trustworthiness.},

Existing solutions struggle with distribution mismatches between reconstructed and observed data, asymmetric cross-modal structures, and insufficient cross-modal knowledge sharing. To tackle these issues, we propose an asymmetric simulation-enhanced flow reconstruction (ASE-FR) framework, which contains following contributions: (1) Distribution-consistent flow reconstruction module that align available and missing modality distributions by normalizing flows; (2) Asymmetric simulation module that perturbs and randomly masks features to mimic real-world modality absence and improve robustness; (3) Modal-shared knowledge distillation that transfers shared representations from teacher encoders to a student encoder through contrastive learning. This framework is applicable to a range of real-world scenarios, such as multi-sensor networks in smart manufacturing, medical diagnostic systems combining imaging and electronic health records, and autonomous driving platforms that integrate camera and LiDAR data. The experimental results show that our ASE-FR method achieves 94.71 %, 41.85 % and 81.90 % accuracy on Audiovision-MNIST, MM-IMDb and IEMOCAP datasets, as well as 1.1376 error rate on CMU-MOSI dataset, which exhibits competitive performance.},

  abstract     = {The robustness of deep neural networks is a crucial factor in safety-critical applications, particularly in complex and dynamic environments (e.g., medical or driving scenarios) where localized corruptions can arise. While previous studies have evaluated the robustness of semantic segmentation (SS) models under whole-image natural or adversarial corruptions, a comprehensive investigation into the spatial robustness of dense vision models under localized corruptions remained underexplored. This paper fills this gap by introducing novel, region-aware metrics for benchmarking the spatial robustness of segmentation models, along with an evaluation framework to assess the impact of natural localized corruptions. Furthermore, it uncovers the inherent complexity of evaluating worst-case spatial robustness using only a single localized adversarial attack. To address this, the work proposes a region-aware multi-attack adversarial analysis to systematically assess model robustness across specific image regions. The proposed metrics and analysis were exploited to evaluate 14 segmentation models in driving scenarios, uncovering key insights into the effects of localized corruption in both natural and adversarial forms. The results reveal that models respond to these two types of threats differently; for instance, transformer-based segmentation models demonstrate notable robustness to localized natural corruptions but are highly vulnerable to adversarial ones, and vice versa for CNN-based models. Consequently, we also address the challenge of balancing robustness to both natural and adversarial localized corruptions by means of ensemble models, thereby achieving a broader threat coverage and improved reliability for dense vision tasks.},

Regulations such as the “right to be forgotten” require models to remove these sensitive traces without full retraining. We introduce a practical encoder-only transformer baseline as a robust reference for future HTR research. Building on this, we propose a two-stage unlearning framework for multihead transformer HTR models. Our method combines neural pruning with machine unlearning applied to a writer classification head, ensuring sensitive information is removed while preserving the recognition head. We also present Writer-ID Confusion (WIC), a method that forces the forget set to follow a uniform distribution over writer identities, unlearning user-specific cues while maintaining text recognition performance. We compare WIC to Random Labeling, Fisher Forgetting, Amnesiac Unlearning, and DELETE within our prune-unlearn pipeline and consistently achieve better privacy and accuracy trade-offs. This is the first systematic study of machine unlearning for HTR. Using metrics such as Accuracy, Character Error Rate (CER), Word Error Rate (WER), and Membership Inference Attacks (MIA) on the IAM and CVL datasets, we demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art or superior performance for effective unlearning. These experiments show that our approach effectively safeguards privacy without compromising accuracy, opening new directions for document analysis research.

  abstract     = {This paper explores a federated learning approach that automatically selects the number of latent processes in multi-output Gaussian processes (MGPs). The MGP has seen great success as a transfer learning tool when data is generated from multiple sources/units/entities. A common approach in MGPs to transfer knowledge across units involves gathering all data from each unit to a central server and extracting common independent latent processes to express each unit as a linear combination of the shared latent patterns. However, this approach poses key challenges in (i) determining the adequate number of latent processes and (ii) relying on centralized learning which leads to potential privacy risks and significant computational burdens on the central server. To address these issues, we propose a hierarchical model that places spike-and-slab priors on the coefficients of each latent process. These priors help automatically select only needed latent processes by shrinking the coefficients of unnecessary ones to zero. To estimate the model while avoiding the drawbacks of centralized learning, we propose a variational inference-based approach, that formulates model inference as an optimization problem compatible with federated settings. We then design a federated learning algorithm that allows units to jointly select and infer the common latent processes without sharing their data. We also discuss an efficient learning approach for a new unit within our proposed federated framework. Simulation and case studies on Li-ion battery degradation and air temperature data demonstrate the advantageous features of our proposed approach.},

  abstract     = {Current state-of-the-art deep multi-view clustering methods resort to contrastive learning to learn consensus representations with Cross-View Consistency ( CVC ). However, contrastive learning has inherent limitations when being applied to the multi-view clustering. On one hand, contrastive learning suffers from class collision issue, compromising the discriminability of consensus representation. On the other hand, contrastive alignment of two views of different quality could lead to representation degradation for the higher-quality view, weakening the robustness of the consensus representation. To alleviate these issues, this paper presents an Adaptive Multi-view consistency clustering method via structure-enhanced contrastive learning ( A da M ), which learns multi-faceted consensus representation that balances view-consistency, discriminability and robustness, forming an optimal consensus representation. Specifically, we first design a view fusion module and a structural learning module to learn view weights and structural relationships among samples, respectively, to derive the consensus representation. Second, beyond CVC , we propose a novel clustering framework called Adaptive Multi-View Consistency ( AMVC ), which adaptively aligns specific view representation with consensus representation based on the learned view weights. Furthermore, compared to CVC , we theoretically demonstrate the superiority of AMVC in learning robust consensus representation. Third, A da M leverages the structural relationships among samples to refine the conventional contrastive loss, further enhancing the discriminability of the consensus representation. Extensive experimental results on eight datasets demonstrate the superior performance of A da M over eight advanced multi-view clustering baselines.},

  abstract     = {Advanced text spotting methods typically rely on large-scale, meticulously labeled datasets to achieve satisfactory performance. However, annotating fine-grained positional information of texts in real-world scene images is extremely costly and time-consuming. Although some weakly supervised methods have been developed to reduce annotation costs, they face two major challenges: 1) their performance significantly lags behind the fully supervised counterparts, and 2) They are tightly coupled with specific text spotting models, meaning that switching to a different model would require retraining and incur substantial computational costs. To address these limitations, we propose a novel text-only weakly supervised learning framework for text spotting via text-to-polygon generator. In the first stage, we pretrain a text-to-polygon generator on an auxiliary dataset, e.g., synthetic or public datasets, where full annotations are readily accessible. In the second stage, given real-world target datasets annotated with text-only labels, we employ the pretrained generator to produce pseudo polygon labels, thereby constructing a pseudo-labeled supervised dataset for training text spotting models. To ensure high-quality pseudo polygon labels, the text-to-polygon generator first identifies all candidate text regions, then filters those that are relevant to the target text, and finally predicts their precise spatial locations. Notably, this generator requires only a single pretraining session and can subsequently be applied to any text spotting model and target text-only dataset without incurring additional costs. Extensive experiments on public benchmarks demonstrate that our method can significantly reduce labeling costs while maintaining competitive performance.},

  abstract     = {Domain shift caused by variations in data acquisition significantly impedes the deployment of medical image segmentation models in clinical settings. Domain generalization aims to mitigate performance degradation induced by domain shift by training a model using source domain data and generalize well to unseen target domain. In this work, we have an interesting observation: domain shift results in significantly different activation patterns across domains even they have semantically identical input. This cross-domain “feature misalignment” phenomenon motivates us to develop a hypothesis: mitigating cross-domain feature misalignment may enhance domain generalization. To this end, we propose a framework called Aegis , which employs style augmentation to generate augmented image features that simulate domain shift. Subsequently, we introduce a dual attention-guided feature calibration (DAFC) module to facilitate feature interaction between source and augmented images, thereby establishing an implicit alignment constraint within the shared feature space. Furthermore, we propose an uncertainty-guided feature alignment (UFA) loss, which quantifies segmentation discrepancies caused by domain shift and incorporates an uncertainty-weighting mechanism to enhance the alignment of hard-to-classify pixel regions. These components work in synergy to effectively mitigate cross-domain feature misalignment, promote robust feature alignment, and ultimately improve cross-domain generalization. Extensive experiments conducted on three widely used benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly outperforms existing methods in domain generalization.

  abstract     = {Mural sketches reveal both the content and structure of the murals and are crucial for the preservation of murals. However, existing methods lack robustness, making it difficult to suppress noise while preserving sketches on damaged murals and fully capturing details on clear murals. To address this, we propose a Data Uncertainty-Driven Robust Network (DURN) for mural sketch detection. DURN uses uncertainty to quantify noise in the murals, converting prediction into a learnable normal distribution, where the mean represents the sketch and the variance denotes the uncertainty. This enables the model to learn both the sketch and the noise simultaneously, achieving noise suppression while preserving the sketches. To enhance sketches, we design an Adaptive Fusion Feature Enhancement Module (AFFE) to dynamically adjust the fusion strategy according to the contribution of features at different scales and reduce the information loss caused by feature dimensionality reduction to maximize the utility of each feature. We develop a novel Deep-Shallow Supervision (DSS) module to mitigate background noise using deep semantic information to guide shallow features without adding parameters. Additionally, we achieve model lightweighting through pruning techniques, ensuring competitive performance while reducing the number of parameters to only 4.5 % of the original. The experimental results show an improvement of 10. 4 % AP over existing methods, demonstrating the robustness of DURN for complex and damaged murals.

  abstract     = {The Light Field (LF) captures both spatial and angular information of scenes, enabling precise depth estimation. Recent advancements in deep learning have led to significant success in this field; however, existing methods primarily focus on modeling surface characteristics (e.g., depth maps) while overlooking the depth space, which contains additional valuable information. The depth space consists of numerous space points and provides substantially more geometric data than a single depth map. In this paper, we conceptualize depth prediction as a spatial modeling problem, aiming to learn the entire depth space rather than merely a single depth map. Specifically, we define space points as signed distances relative to the scene surface and propose a novel distance-constraint query mechanism for LF depth estimation. To model the depth space effectively, we first develop a mixed sampling strategy to approximate its data representation. Subsequently, we introduce an encoder-decoder network architecture to query the distances of each point, thereby implicitly embedding the depth space. Finally, to extract the target depth map from this space, we present a generation algorithm that iteratively invokes the decoder network. Through extensive experiments, our approach achieves the highest performance on LF depth estimation benchmarks, and also demonstrates superior performance on various synthetic and real-world scenes.},

For this reason, we present a new framework that efficiently and effectively segments objects without the need for human annotations. Firstly, a MultiCut algorithm is applied to self-supervised features for coarse mask segmentation. Then, a mask filter is employed to obtain high-quality coarse masks. To train the segmentation network, we compute a novel superpixel-guided mask loss, comprising hard loss and soft loss, with high-quality coarse masks and superpixels segmented from low-level image features. Lastly, a self-training process with a new adaptive loss is proposed to improve the quality of predicted masks. We conduct experiments on public datasets in instance segmentation and object detection to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.

  abstract     = {With the development of social media, people like to post images and comments to share their ideas, which provides rich visual and textural semantic information for image aesthetics assessment (IAA). However, most previous works either extracted the unimodal aesthetic features from image due to the difficulty of obtaining comments, or combined multimodal information together but ignoring the interactive relationship between image and comment, which limits the overall performance. To solve the above problem, we propose a Multimodal Interaction-Guided Fusion Network (MIGF-Net) for image aesthetics assessment based on both image and comment semantic information, which can not only solve the challenge of comment generating, but also provide the multimodal feature interactive information. Specifically, considering the coupling mechanism of the image theme, we construct a visual semantic fusion module to extract the visual semantic feature based on the visual attributes and the theme features. Then, a textural semantic feature extractor is designed to mine the semantic information hidden in comments, which not only addresses the issue of missing comments but also effectively complements the visual semantic features. Furthermore, we establish a Dual-Stream Interaction-Guided Fusion module to fuse the semantic features of images and comments, fully exploring the interactive relationship between images and comments in the human brain’s perception mechanism. Experimental results on two public image aesthetics evaluation datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods.

However, in the process of maximizing information acquisition, IPP must also account for energy consumption, time constraints, and physical obstacles, which often lead to inefficiencies. To address these challenges, we propose an Information Path Planning method based on Reinforcement Learning and Information-Directed Sampling (IRIS). This model is the first to integrate Reinforcement Learning (RL) with Information-Directed Sampling (IDS), ensuring both immediate rewards and the potential for greater information gain through exploratory actions. IRIS employs an off-policy deep reinforcement learning framework, effectively overcoming the limitations observed in on-policy methods, thereby enhancing the model’s adaptability and efficiency. Simulation results demonstrate that the IRIS algorithm performs exceptionally well across various IPP scenarios. Once training stabilizes, IDS will dominate decision-making with a probability of approximately 1.3 % to yield better outcomes, highlighting its significant potential in this field.

In semantic segmentation, another major challenge is the difficulty in predicting accurate object boundaries, as even strong teacher models can produce ambiguous or imprecise outputs. To address both challenges, we present Knowledge Tailoring, a novel distillation framework that adapts the teacher’s knowledge to better match the student’s representational capacity and learning dynamics. Much like a tailor adjusts an oversized suit to fit the wearer’s shape, our method reshapes the teacher’s abundant but misaligned knowledge into a form more suitable for the student. KT introduces feature tailoring, which restructures intermediate features based on channel-wise correlation to narrow the representation gap, and logit tailoring, which improves boundary prediction by refining class-specific logits. The tailoring strategy evolves throughout training, offering guidance that aligns with the student’s progress. Experiments on Cityscapes, Pascal VOC, and ADE20K confirm that KT consistently enhances performance across a variety of architectures including DeepLabV3, PSPNet, and SegFormer.

  abstract     = {Benefiting from the in-depth integration of multimodal data, survival prediction has emerged as a pivotal task in cancer prognosis by facilitating personalized treatment planning and medical resource allocation. In this study, we report an intriguing phenomenon of inter-modality capability gap (ICG) enlargement during joint survival modelling of genomics data and pathology images. This observation, supported by our dedicated theoretical analysis, uncovers a previously unrecognized modality imbalance problem, where pathology modality suffers from limited gradient propagation and insufficient learning while genomics modality dominates in reducing survival loss. To tackle this problem, we further propose a balanced multimodal learning approach for survival prediction named BMLSurv, which introduces two innovative auxiliary learning strategies: self-enhancement learning (SEL) and peer-assistance learning (PAL). The SEL strategy exploits a real-time imbalance measure to guide extra task-aware supervision, therefore dynamically strengthening pathology-specific gradient propagation in a self-enhanced manner. Meanwhile, the PAL strategy leverages the stronger genomics modality as a “helpful peer” to assist the sufficient learning of pathology modality via a new risk-ranking distillation technique. Extensive experiments on representative cancer datasets demonstrate that by successfully address the modality imbalance problem, BMLSurv remarkably narrows the ICG in joint survival modelling and consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a large margin. These results underscore the potential of BMLSurv to advance multimodal survival prediction and enhance clinical decision-making in cancer prognosis.},

In brain hyper-networks, nodes represent brain regions of interest (ROIs), while edges describe the interactions of multiple ROIs, providing important high-order information for brain disease analysis and diagnosis. However, most of the existing hyper-network studies focused on the hyper-connection (i.e. hyper-edge) analysis and ignored the local topological information on nodes. To address this problem, we propose a new representation method (i.e., hyper-network curvature) for brain hyper-network analysis. Compared with the existing hyper-network representation methods, the proposed hyper-network curvature can be used to analyze the local topologies of nodes in brain hyper-networks. Based on hyper-network curvature, we further propose a novel graph kernel called brain hyper-network curvature kernel to measure the similarity of a pair of brain hyper-networks. We have proved that the proposed hyper-network curvature is bounded and brain hyper-network curvature kernel is positive definite. To evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed method, we perform the classification experiments on functional magnetic resonance imaging data of brain diseases. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method can significantly improve classification accuracy compared to the state-of-the-art graph kernels and graph neural networks for classifying brain diseases.},

In this paper, we propose a novel Joint Luminance-Chrominance Learning Network (JLCLNet) for LEQA to comprehensively assess the effects of low-light image enhancement (LLIE) algorithms. Specifically, we construct a two-branch network architecture consisting of a luminance learning branch and a chrominance learning branch.

Meanwhile, the chrominance learning branch addresses potential color distortions by integrating perceptual information from the two parallel chrominance channels of the CIELAB color space. Finally, the complementary features from both branches are fused to predict quality scores. Experimental results on four public LEQA databases demonstrate the performance advantages of the proposed method compared to the state-of-the-art approaches.

Intuitively, Hete-RSIs are acquired with different remote sensors, and they cannot be compared directly for LCCD because of the different imaging modalities. In this paper, a graph contrastive learning network (GCLN) is proposed for LCCD with bitemporal Hete-RSIs. First, with the motivation of smoothing the noise and utilizing contextual information, the k-nearest neighbor algorithm is used to improve the spectral homogeneity of the pixels within a superpixel. Then, a pairwise graph is constructed on the basis of each superpixel from spectral similarity and dissimilarity perspectives, and a graph feature learning network is designed to learn the near-far dependencies of graph features for change detection. Finally, the similarity and dissimilarity loss functions are coupled as a contrastive loss function to expand the difference between similar and dissimilar features. Comparisons with seven advanced methods on five pairs of Hete-RSIs demonstrate the feasibility and superiority of the proposed GCLN for LCCD with Hete-RSIs. For example, the improvements on the five datasets are 3.63 % , 8.47 % , 4.17 % , 8.23 % , and 4.98 % in terms of overall accuracy.

  abstract     = {Thermal imaging technology is exceptionally valuable in environments where visibility is limited or nonexistent. However, the high cost and technological limitations of high-resolution thermal imaging sensors restrict their widespread use. Many thermal cameras are now paired with high-resolution visible cameras, which can help improve low-resolution thermal images. However, aligning thermal and visible images is challenging due to differences in their spectral ranges, making pixel-wise alignment difficult. Therefore, we present the Edge Craft Odyssey Network (ECONet), a lightweight transformer-based network designed for Guided Thermal Super-Resolution (GTSR) to address these challenges. Our approach introduces a Progressive Edge Prediction module that extracts edge features from visible images using an adaptive threshold within our innovative Edge-Weighted Gradient Blending technique. This technique provides precise control over the blending intensity between low-resolution thermal and visible images. Additionally, we introduce a lightweight Cascade Deep Feature Extractor that focuses on efficient feature extraction and edge weight highlighting, enhancing the representation of high-frequency details.

  abstract     = {Due to the inherent vulnerabilities of large Vision-Language Models (VLMs), security governance has emerged as a critical concern, particularly given the risks posed by noisy and biased training data as well as adversarial attacks, including data poisoning and prompt injection. These perturbations can significantly degrade model performance and introduce multifaceted societal risks. To verify the safe robustness of VLMs and further inspire the design of defensive AI frameworks, we propose Virtual Scenario Hypnosis (VSH), a multimodal prompt injection jailbreak method that embeds malicious queries into prompts through a deceptive narrative framework. This approach strategically distracts the model while compromising its resistance to jailbreak attempts. Our methodology features two key innovations: 1) Targeted adversarial image prompts that transform textual content into visual layouts through optimized typographic designs, circumventing safety alignment mechanisms to elicit harmful responses; and 2) An information veil encrypted In-Context Learning (ICL) method for text prompts that systematically evades safety detection protocols. To streamline evaluation, we employ Large Language Models (LLMs) to facilitate an efficient assessment of jailbreak success rates, supported by a meticulously designed prompt template incorporating multi-dimensional scoring rules and evaluation metrics. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of VSH, achieving an overall success rate exceeding 82% on 500 harmful queries spanning multiple domains when tested against LLaVA-v1.5-13B and GPT-4o mini.},

  abstract     = {As one of important data preprocessing techniques, feature selection aims to remove redundant and irrelevant features and has been extensively applied to many fields. At present, however, the evaluation of existing feature selection algorithms focuses mainly on the scale of the selected features and the performance of models formulated by the selected features, while the running time of feature selection algorithms is usually neglected. It is noted that the computation complexity of the majority of feature selection algorithms is the square order of the number of instances, resulting in an exponential increase of the running time for large-scale data. In this paper, we propose an algorithm of core instance selection based on the locality-sensitive hashing (CISLSH) to improve the computation efficiency of feature selection algorithms by alleviating the instances used for feature selection. Specifically, all the instances are firstly considered to map them into the one-dimensional integer space using a locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) function. Given a set of hash functions families, a bucket index matrix is constructed to integrate all the mapping results of the set of hash functions families. Then, a voting mechanism is designed according to the bucket index matrix, which motivates to present a novel data partitioning method dividing similar instances into the same bucket (partition) as many as possible. Furthermore, the CISLSH algorithm is developed by selecting a core instance from each non-empty bucket. Finally, numerical experiments are conducted to assess the performance of CISLSH. The experimental results show that the execution of feature selection using the representative instances selected by CISLSH can not only significantly reduce the running time of feature selection but also guarantee the effectiveness of the selected features.},

  abstract     = {Multimodal neuroimaging genetics is a crucial approach for identifying biomarkers of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) by leveraging the inherent relationships between genetic and neuroimaging data. However, existing methods are limited by susceptibility to input noises, underutilization of complementary information across neuroimaging modalities, and ineffective handling of samples with incomplete modalities. To address these challenges, we propose an Adaptive Latent Disease State Learning (ALDSL) method, which integrates noise reduction, latent space learning, adaptive regularization, and feature selection into a unified framework for detecting AD biomarkers from incomplete multimodal data. ALDSL introduces a noise reduction strategy based on inter-variable correlations and tailored distance metrics to eliminate noises in the input data, thereby obtaining high-quality representations for each modality. Additionally, latent disease state learning with adaptive regularization is proposed to capture inter-modality correlations by projecting the high-quality representations from multiple modalities into a common latent space. To utilize samples with incomplete modalities, we design a modality-specific weight matrix that accounts for the missing information in the latent disease state learning. Furthermore, an adaptive weighting determination strategy is developed to ensure that the modalities with different data types and varying sample sizes contribute on the same scale. We develop an efficient alternating optimization algorithm to solve the objective function of ALDSL. Experimental results on synthetic datasets and the ADNI GO/2 dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of ALDSL in detecting AD biomarkers.},

  abstract     = {The complementary and conflicting relationships between views are two fundamental issues when applying Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to multi-view attributed graph anomaly detection. Most existing approaches do not address the inherent multi-view properties in the attribute space or leverage complementary information through simple representation fusion, which overlooks the conflicting information among different views. In this paper, we argue that effectively applying GNNs to multi-view anomaly detection necessitates reinforcing complementary information between views and, more importantly, managing conflicting information. Building on this perspective, this paper introduces Multi-View Message Passing (MMP), a novel and effective message passing paradigm specifically designed for multi-view anomaly detection. In the multi-view aggregation phase of MMP, views containing different types of information are integrated using view-specific aggregation functions. This approach enables the model to dynamically adjust the amount of information aggregated from complementary and conflicting views, thereby mitigating issues arising from insufficient complementary information and excessive conflicting information, which can lead to suboptimal representation learning. Furthermore, we propose an innovative aggregation loss mechanism that enhances model performance by optimizing the reconstruction differences between aggregated representations and the original views, thereby improving both detection accuracy and model interpretability. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets validate the effectiveness and robustness of our method. The source code is available at https://github.com/weihus/MMP .},

Firstly, we design heterophily-based neighbor sampling to sequentially filter high-hop neighbors by degree. Next, to obtain comprehensive global information, we construct a multi-hop recursive learning method with head and tail attention vectors to learn multi-hop neighbor features. Finally, we combine the average node degree of the graph with hop decay modeling to learn importance coefficients at different hops and adaptively aggregate the learned multi-hop features.

  abstract     = {It is crucial to accurately segment organs from abdominal CT images for clinical diagnosis, treatment planning, and surgical guidance, which remains an extremely challenging task due to low contrast between organs and surrounding tissues and the difference of organ size and shape. Previous works mainly focused on complex network architectures or task-specific modules but frequently failed to learn irregular boundaries and did not consider that different slices from the same case might contain targets of different numbers of categories. To tackle these issues, this paper proposes UAMSNet for abdominal multi-organ segmentation. In UAMSNet, a hybrid receptive field extraction (HRFE) module is introduced to adaptively learn the features of irregular targets, which has an adaptive dilation factor containing distance information to facilitate spatial and channel attention. The HRFE module can simultaneously learn multiple scales and deformations of different organs. Furthermore, a multi-organ boundary-enhanced attention (MBA) module in the encoder and decoder is designed to provide effective boundary information for feature extraction based on the large peak of the organ edge. Finally, the difference in the number of organ categories between different slices is first considered using a loss function, which can adjust the loss computation based on organ categories in the image. The loss function mitigates the effect of false positives during training to ensure the model can adapt to small organ segmentation. Experimental results on WORD and Synapse datasets demonstrate that our UAMSNet outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods. Ablation experiments confirm the effectiveness of our designed modules and loss function. Our code is publicly available on https://github.com/HeyJGJu/UAMSNet .},

  abstract     = {Predicting the distribution of objects in the real world from monocular images is a challenging task due to the disparity between object distributions in perspective images and reality. Many researchers focus on predicting object distributions by converting perspective images into Bird’s-Eye View (BEV) images. In scenarios where camera parameter information is unavailable, the prediction of vanishing lines becomes critical for performing inverse perspective transformations. However, accurately predicting vanishing lines necessitates accounting for variations in object size, which cannot be effectively captured through simple regression models. Therefore, this paper proposes a size variation-aware method, utilizing expert knowledge from object detection to build a reinforcement learning framework for predicting vanishing lines in traffic scenes. Specifically, this method leverages size information from trained detectors to convert perspective images into BEV images without the need for additional camera intrinsic parameters. First, we design a novel reward mechanism that utilizes prior knowledge of scale differences between similar objects in perspective images, allowing the network to automatically update and learn specific vanishing line positions. Second, we propose a fast inverse perspective transformation method, which accelerates the training speed of the proposed approach. To evaluate the effectiveness of the method, experiments are conducted on two traffic flow datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm accurately predicts vanishing line positions and successfully transforms perspective images into BEV images. Furthermore, the proposed algorithm performs competitively with directly supervised methods. The code is available at: https://github.com/HotChieh/DDRL.},

  abstract     = {In industrial computed tomography (ICT), factors like beam scattering, insufficient beam intensity, and detector dark current often lead to weak edges, scattering artifacts, and severe Gaussian noise in ICT images. These issues pose significant difficulties for accurate segmentation of high-density complex structures using existing active contour models (ACMs). To address these limitations, this paper presents a variable Gaussian kernel scale active contour model based on Jeffreys divergence (VGJD). Firstly, the Jeffreys divergence (JD) is incorporated into the energy function to replace the conventional Euclidean distance, enhancing the contour’s ability to quantify pixel value disparity during evolution. Additionally, a filter weight is introduced to minimize the impact of noise. Moreover, a variable Gaussian kernel scale strategy is adopted to effectively integrate both global and local image information, thereby enhancing the robustness of the initial contour and improving the precision of detail segmentation. Finally, optimized length and regularity terms are employed to enforce constraints on the level set function. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the VGJD model can effectively segment various complex ICT images, achieving superior precision in comparison to other ACM models.

However, current STGNN models often fail to capture the discriminative sparse substructure and the smooth distribution of these samples. To this end, this paper introduces RostGNN, robust spatio-temporal graph neural networks, for achieving more discriminative graph representations. Concretely, RostGNN extracts the spatial and temporal features by performing gated recurrent units on the given time series data and calculating adjacent matrixes for graphs. Then, we impose the iterative hard-thresholding approach on the final association matrix to obtain a sparse graph. Meanwhile, we calculate a similarity matrix from the side information of samples to smooth the achieved data representations and use fully connected networks for graph classification. We finally applied RostGNN to brain graph classification in experiments on real-world datasets. The results demonstrate that RostGNN delivers robust and discriminative graph representations and performs better than compared methods, benefiting from the sparsity and manifold regularizers. Furthermore, RostGNN can potentially yield useful findings for data understanding.},

  abstract     = {The single modality hashing (SMH) has achieved impressive performance on image retrieval task in recent years. The only fly in the ointment is that most of the methods mainly measure the image similarity based on the high-level class labels. The retrieval needs in the real world are diverse in form of different subsets of the semantics (not only the category labels) presented in the query image. However, existing SMH methods fail to account for such customized image retrieval task that allows users to select visual semantics or their combinations present in the query and retrieve similar images based on such selected semantic descriptions. To address such practical issues, we propose a deep hashing to learn Interpretable Binary Codes (IBC), endowing the hashing bits with semantic interpretability rather than purely entangling the class information in the whole codes, i.e., aligning the criteria of binary space partition of each bit with a particular visual semantic concept. Specifically, binary encoding is a highly non-linear operation of dimension reduction, the semantic and spatial information of which has respectively been abstract and lost heavily. In light of the rich semantic interpretability and binary concept detection ability of convolutional filters, we innovatively transfer the semantic knowledge from filters to hashing bits by align the distributions of the binary codes and filter activations that capture the presence/absence of visual patterns in images. To further improve the semantics of filters/bits, the shared and learnable classification rules are introduced and optimized to disentangle the sparse composition between the category label and encoded semantics in filters/bits. With high interpretability, we can selectively combine bits corresponding to the target semantics during retrieval, thereby enabling flexible and customized similarity searches. Extensive experiments on several large-scale datasets covering general objects and scenes, single and multiple label scenarios, demonstrate the interpretability and functionalities of learned binary codes for the customized image retrieval tasks.},

  abstract     = {Infrared and visible image fusion (IVIF) seeks to generate fused images that combine rich texture details with distinct thermal radiation features by integrating and leveraging complementary information from multiple sources. However, existing fusion methods frequently neglect the challenges posed by illumination degradation and inaccurate color contrast, which arise due to light energy loss and light scattering during atmospheric transmission. To address these limitations, this study introduces an innovative IVIF framework, termed AFFusion, which integrates an atmospheric scattering physical model with a frequency-domain feature component. By accurately predicting and estimating two key physical parameters-the transmission map and atmospheric light-within the scattering model, AFFusion harnesses atmospheric scattering principles to produce enhanced visible images, thereby mitigating the adverse effects of energy attenuation and scattering. Furthermore, to resolve artifacts and texture loss caused by traditional atmospheric scattering models, AFFusion incorporates Fourier transform in conjunction with spatial and channel attention mechanisms to selectively amplify amplitude and phase features in the frequency domain, thereby enhancing texture fidelity and detail representation within the fused images. Comprehensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that AFFusion surpasses state-of-the-art methods in both qualitative and quantitative performance metrics, while also providing robust support for high-level visual tasks.

  abstract     = {Composed video retrieval (CoVR) is a challenging task of retrieving relevant videos in a corpus by using a query that integrates both a relative change text and a reference video. Most existing CoVR models simply rely on the late-fusion strategy to combine visual and change text. Furthermore, various methods have been proposed to generate pseudo-word tokens from the reference video, which are then integrated into the relative change text for CoVR. However, these pseudo-word-based techniques exhibit limitations when the target video involves complex changes from the reference video, e.g. , object removal. In this work, we propose a novel CoVR framework that learns context information via context-aware dual prompts for relative change text to achieve effective composed video retrieval. The dual prompts cater to two aspects: 1) Global descriptive prompts generated from the pretrained V-L models, e.g. , BLIP-2, to get concise textual representations of the reference video. 2) Local target prompts to learn the target representations that the change text pays attention to. By connecting these prompts with relative change text, one can easily use existing text-to-video retrieval models to enhance CoVR performance. Our proposed framework can be flexibly used for both composed video retrieval (CoVR) and composed image retrieval (CoIR) tasks. Moreover, we take a pioneering approach by adopting the CoVR model to achieve zero-shot CoIR for remote sensing. Experiments on four datasets show that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in both CoVR and zero-shot CoIR tasks, with improvements of as high as around 3.5 % in terms of recall@K=1 score.},

  abstract     = {Tensor wheel (TW) decomposition has recently emerged as a powerful technique for achieving state-of-the-art recovery performance in tensor completion tasks. However, its widespread application has been hindered by issues related to rank sensitivity and high computational cost. To address these limitations, we introduce an efficient and compact TW decomposition method for low-rank tensor completion. Specifically, we demonstrate that the model complexity of TW decomposition is controlled simultaneously by two elements, namely, the explicit TW rank and implicit sparsity in the core tensor. Therefore, low-rank and sparsity regularization are introduced to ring factors and core factor, respectively, to achieve a compact TW decomposition. Furthermore, to alleviate the computational bottleneck of TW decomposition, we propose a novel generalized inverse operation, which reduces the computational complexity of vanilla TW decomposition from O ( I N R 2 N ) to O ( I N R N ) . Subsequently, we develop an efficient alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm with theoretical convergence guarantees. Numerical tensor completion experiments on color images, multispectral images, and color videos demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior performance while significantly reducing runtime compared to state-of-the-art methods.

  abstract     = {Solution for addressing real-world image classification challenges. Human-AI collaborative classification (HAI-CC) aims to synergise the efficiency of machine learning classifiers and the reliability of human experts to support decision making. Learning to defer (L2D) has been one of the promising HAI-CC approaches, where the system assesses a sample and decides to defer to one of human experts when it is not confident. Despite recent progress, existing L2D methods rely on the strong assumption of ground truth label availability for training, while in practice, most datasets often contain multiple noisy annotations per data sample without well-curated ground truth labels. In addition, current L2D methods either consider the setting of a single human expert or defer the decision to one human expert, even though there may be multiple experts available, resulting in a suboptimal utilisation of available resources. Furthermore, current HAI-CC evaluation frameworks often overlook processing costs, making it difficult to assess the trade-off between computational efficiency and performance when benchmarking different methods. To address these gaps, this paper introduces LECOMH – a new HAI-CC method that learns from noisy labels without depending on clean labels for training, simultaneously maximising collaborative accuracy with either one or multiple human experts, while minimising the cost of human collaboration. The paper also introduces benchmarks featuring multiple noisy labels per data sample for both training and testing to evaluate HAI-CC methods. Through quantitative comparisons on these benchmarks, LECOMH consistently outperforms HAI-CC methods and baselines, including human experts alone, multi-rater learning and noisy-label learning methods across both synthetic and real-world datasets.},

  abstract     = {Underwater Object Detection (UOD) faces significant challenges due to complex degradation factors, such as color shifts caused by light absorption and scattering, spatially varying noise induced by plankton and sea snow, and motion blur resulting from dynamic water currents. Among existing methods, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are limited by fixed receptive fields, making it difficult to model long-range noise patterns; while Transformers excel at modeling global dependencies, they suffer from high computational complexity and weak capability in restoring fine-grained local features. Neither can effectively address the demands of detecting underwater-specific noise and small objects. To tackle these issues, we propose UOD-Mamba, a state space model (SSM)-based framework for underwater object detection. At its core is the Noise-Aware Dual-path Mamba (NADM) module, which integrates a global-local dual-path fusion strategy to enable both long-range noise modeling and local feature enhancement. The global path balances noise in input features through the Noise-Balanced Preprocessing Module (NBPM) and leverages Mamba’s long-range modeling capability to extract global noise patterns; the local path fuses the Underwater Enhanced Multi-scale Attention Module (UEMA) with CSP convolution to model edge and detail features at a fine-grained level, thereby compensating for the loss of local information. By explicitly learning the distribution characteristics of underwater noise and capturing the differences between noise and target features, the framework enhances detection robustness in noisy environments. Experimental validation on the DUO and RUOD datasets demonstrates that UOD-Mamba sets a new state-of-the-art in detection performance. It also exhibits advantages in explicit modeling of diverse noises, preservation of local details, and computational efficiency across multi-noise scenarios, enabling effective handling of complex underwater interference environments.},

  abstract     = {Fusing low-spatial-resolution hyperspectral images with high-spatial-resolution (HSR) multispectral images is pivotal for generating HSR hyperspectral images (HSR-HSIs). While current deep unrolling-based multi-stage frameworks have shown notable advancements due to their robustness and interpretability, they still exhibit limitations in adequately harnessing the HSI prior knowledge. This deficiency is principally attributed to three factors: (1) prior knowledge learned from training samples often overlooks target-specific characteristics; (2) insufficient feature representation within and across stages; and (3) insufficient modeling of spatial–spectral dependencies. To address these issues, we propose a novel Cross-domain-aware Transformer (CaFormer). Specifically, a cross-domain aware attention mechanism is investigated to capture intrinsic joint spatial–spectral dependencies through unified cross-domain feature representation. The attention mechanism models HSI eigenfeatures to derive spatial and spectral representations while preserving their mutual correlations. Furthermore, we introduce a Fourier Domain Perception Block to enhance structural and semantic representations by exploiting amplitude and phase components in the frequency domain, thereby strengthening feature aggregation across stages. To further improve adaptability while preserving the interpretability of deep unrolling networks, CaFormer employs a dual-stage prior learning strategy, transferring prior knowledge learned from general training data to the specific observed scene. Our experimental evaluations on four public datasets and Worldview-2 satellite images confirm that our proposed method outperformed eleven state-of-the-art methods.

  abstract     = {Misaligned multimodal medical images pose challenges to the fusion task, resulting in structural distortions and edge artifacts in the fusion results. Existing registration networks primarily consider single-scale deformation fields at each stage, thereby neglecting long-range connections between non-adjacent stages. Moreover, in the fusion task, due to the quadratic computational complexity faced by Transformers during feature extraction, they are unable to effectively capture long-range correlated features. To address these problems, we propose an image registration and fusion method called DTMFusion. DTMFusion comprises two main networks: a Dual-Teacher Self-Distillation Registration (DTSDR) network and a Mamba-Conv-based Fusion (MCF) network. The registration network employs a pyramid progressive architecture to generate independent deformation fields at each layer. We introduce a dual-teacher self-distillation scheme that leverages past learning history and the current network structure as teacher guidance to constrain the generated deformation fields. For the fusion network, we introduced Mamba to address the quadratic complexity problem of Transformers. Specifically, the fusion network involves two key components: the Shallow Fusion Module (SFM) and the Cross-Modality Fusion Module (CFM). The SFM achieves lightweight cross-modality interaction through channel exchange, while the CFM leverages inherent cross-modality relationships to enhance the representation capability of fusion results. Through the collaborative effort of these components, the network can effectively integrate cross-modality complementary information and maintain appropriate apparent strength from a global perspective. Extensive experimental analysis demonstrates the superiority of this method in fusing misaligned medical images.},

Scene flow is a crucial element to describe 4D occupancy map tendency. However, an accurate scene flow is difficult to predict in the real scene. In this paper, we find that BEV scene flow can approximately represent 3D scene flow in most traffic scenes. And coarse BEV scene flow is easy to generate. Under this thought, we propose 4D occupancy forecasting method FSF-Net based on coarse BEV scene flow. At first, we develop a general occupancy forecasting architecture based on coarse BEV scene flow. Then, to further enhance 4D occupancy feature representation ability, we propose a vector quantized based Mamba (VQ-Mamba) network to mine spatial-temporal structural scene feature. After that, to effectively fuse coarse occupancy maps forecasted from BEV scene flow and latent features, we design a U-Net based quality fusion (UQF) network to generate the fine-grained forecasting result. Extensive experiments are conducted on public Occ3D dataset. FSF-Net has achieved IoU and mIoU 9.56 % and 10.87 % higher than state-of-the-art method. Hence, we believe that proposed FSF-Net benefits to the safety of autonomous driving.},

Besides, we devise a novel nonlinear adaptive brightness mapping function (NABM), whose parameters are optimized via a designed automatic light enhancement network (ALENet) to brighten the illumination component. The enhancements are obtained by fusing the noiseless reflection component with the brightened illumination component.

Additionally, the semi-supervised proxy learning strategy maximizes information extraction from limited labeled data and promotes robust generalization across known and unseen categories. Our approach achieves substantial improvements in both novel category discovery and known category classification on seven popular UFG-NCD datasets, with average performance gains of 10.41 % in the accuracy of the old class and 4.27 % in the accuracy of the new class in task-agnostic evaluation, while with average performance gains of 4.40 % in clustering accuracy on the unlabeled training data in task-aware evaluation.},

Second, leveraging the region-based active contour model-which is independent of image gradients and adept at handling complex contour topology changes-we design a novel level set function to serve as the level set in the geometric active contour model. While this new level set exhibits formal similarity to classical level sets in representing binary segmentation contours, its formulation is derived from network prediction outputs. Third, we construct an adaptive weighted active contour energy function as a loss function within HRNet for multi-class segmentation. This loss function preserves geometric information while penalizing deviations between network-predicted probabilities and ground truth, effectively mitigating spatial information loss and optimizing boundary. Comparative experiments demonstrate that our model outperforms classical methods on objective metrics including mIoU and mPA.},

  abstract     = {Both conventional and source-free multi-source domain adaptation (MSDA) tasks often face bias toward source domains, because more numerous labeled data in these domains, compared with a single unlabeled target domain, can dominate the training process. To alleviate the bias, target adaptation techniques train a target model on the pseudo-labeled target domain data only, with the source-domain-biased models used as the labeling function for pseudo-label generation. However, the pseudo labels may contain noise and harm performance when directly used for supervision. To tackle label noise, we introduce a novel Bi-level Optimization for Robust Target Training (BORT 2 ) scheme. BORT 2 trains a noise-robust target model on pseudo-labeled target data only and meanwhile updates the labeling function (i.e., the source-domain-biased models) to improve pseudo-label quality. Specifically, the target model is a stochastic network designed to be robust to label noise. Such a stochastic network exploits a Gaussian distribution to model the feature of each target instance and deploys an entropy maximization regularizer to the Gaussian to quantify the uncertainty of each pseudo-label, where the uncertainty is utilized to mitigate the negative effects of label noise. In addition, BORT 2 leverages the entropy to update the labeling function for better pseudo-label quality. Updating both the labeling function and the stochastic network involves a nested bi-level optimization problem, addressed using implicit differentiation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that BORT 2 achieves state-of-the-art performance for both conventional and source-free MSDA, as verified on Office-Home, Office-Caltech, PACS, Digit-Five, and the large-scale DomainNet datasets.},

  abstract     = {Absolute phase unwrapping-based fringe projection profilometry (APU-FPP) has the advantages of pixel-wise calculation, high precision, and full-field sensing of 3D shape information. To the best of our knowledge, existing APU-FPP methods have a general contradiction between accuracy and efficiency because of projecting extra auxiliary coded fringes (ACFs). In this paper, a line-coded absolute phase unwrapping (LCAPU) algorithm is presented for absolute 3D shape reconstruction of the scene with non-uniform reflectivity and complex surfaces. Firstly, a sequence of single-pixel lines is successively embedded into two sets of 3-step phase-shifting patterns to mark fringe periods, which can thoroughly avoid extra ACFs to disrupt the coherence of adjacent morphological information. Secondly, two line-coded phase-shifting patterns with the same phase shift are used to recognize the corresponding coded lines containing the fringe order cue, which can be simultaneously used to guide fringe mutual compensation, thereby extracting a high-quality phase. Finally, according to the pixel positions and the fringe indices of the decoded lines, a multi-layer decoding (MLD) algorithm is developed to iteratively generate a fringe order map, which can adapt to the randomness of morphological changes. Compared to other methods, the proposed LCAPU can not only perform a one-shot 3D shape reconstruction with a single image acquisition, but also automatically correct phase errors, balancing ultra-efficiency and high accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance and the practical application potential in dynamic complex scenes.},

  abstract     = {In multi-dimensional classification (MDC), instances are associated with multiple class variables that are assumed in the output space, and each class variable corresponds to one heterogeneous class space and characterizes the objects’ semantics from one dimension. Learning from MDC examples poses challenges due to the heterogeneity of class spaces, since the outputs from different class spaces are not directly comparable. Moreover, existing approaches often use identical data representation for all labels in a class, which may lead to suboptimal results as each label might be determined by its own specific characteristics. Critically, the inherent incomparability of raw heterogeneous labels prevents existing methods from effectively capturing label correlations, which are essential for guiding feature learning. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm named LEAD, i.e., learning Label-spEcific feAtures for multi-Dimensional classification. LEAD first resolves label heterogeneity by transforming the original output space into a unified encoded label space through one-hot label encoding. This critical alignment enables explicit extraction of label correlations from the encoded space. To enhance the reliability of the estimation of label correlations, LEAD then leverages feature-space manifold structures via locally linear embedding, propagating labeling information across similar instances to counteract sparsity. Finally, LEAD jointly learns label-specific feature representations and constructs the classifier through sparse learning while incorporating label correlations. Experimental comparisons on fifteen datasets demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art multi-dimensional classification methods.

  abstract     = {Optical Coherence Tomography Angiography (OCTA) is an innovative and non-invasive imaging technique that leverages motion contrast imaging to generate angiographic images from high-resolution volumetric blood flow data rapidly. However, OCTA imaging is vulnerable to various artifacts induced by eye movements, including displacement artifacts, duplicated scanning artifacts, and white line artifacts. Previous methods that attempted to mitigate eye motion artifacts necessitated costly hardware upgrades. However, despite the availability of advanced eye-tracking hardware and software correction in commercial machines, motion artifacts persist in real-world usage. Recently developed cost-effective learning-based methods only focus on the removal of white line artifacts while neglecting the displacement artifacts and duplicated scanning artifacts. To address this challenge, we propose a comprehensive framework, TSAR, to remove three types of eye motion artifacts in OCTA images. In the first stage, we leverage the intrinsic axial and directional attributes of these artifacts in the first phase to develop an innovative hierarchical transformer network. This network is designed to capture global-wise, local-wise, and vertical-wise features effectively while also removing displacement and duplicate scanning artifacts. Afterward, we leverage the contextual information and develop a residual conditional diffusion model (RCDM) to remove the white line artifacts. By applying our TSAR to the degraded OCTA images, we aim to eliminate all three types of motion artifacts. We evaluate the superior performance of our proposed methodology in artifact removal and image quality enhancement compared to other methods by conducting experiments on both synthetic and real-world OCTA images.

These OCR errors are one of the major challenges for Text-VQA and Text-Caption systems. To address this, we propose a novel multi-modal OCR Token and Word Alignment (TWA) method to alleviate OCR errors in these tasks. First, we artificially create the misspelled OCR tokens and render them onto the RGB images, which can effectively simulates OCR errors. Second, we propose an OCR token-word contrastive learning task to pre-train OCR token representation, making the system more robust to OCR errors. Finally, we introduce a vocabulary predictor with character-level semantic matching, which enables the model to recover the correct word from the vocabulary even with misspelled OCR tokens.

  abstract     = {Effectively leveraging the provided priors is crucial for interactive segmentation. Existing approaches typically encode clicks via distance-based maps, which are then concatenated or added to the original image as network input. However, these methods do not fully exploit the semantic information embedded in the provided priors, leading to confusion in the feature distribution of different targets and reducing the segmentation quality. To address this issue, we propose a prior tokenization-based interactive segmentation method that uses simple Vision Transformers. By extending the original image tokens with prior tokens, each token represents the semantic features of the foreground and background related to the priors. These tokens participate in the self-attention operation alongside regular image tokens, gradually extracting semantic features from the image tokens to the prior tokens. In addition, we introduce a discriminative loss function to enforce inter-class separation and intra-class compactness of the prior tokens. Subsequently, we employ a cross-attention mechanism to couple the prior tokens with the regular image block token features, ensuring that the features extracted by the network are aligned with the user’s intent. Finally, we use the register method to suppress artifacts and enhance the segmentation performance further. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior interaction efficiency, robustness, and generalization ability across various medical image segmentation benchmarks.

Existing enhancement methods typically struggle with color-related degradations such as color casting, artifacts, and distortion. To address these challenges, we propose an end-to-end Color Transformation Network for low-light image enhancement, with a specific focus on improving color restoration. By leveraging the complementary strengths of the HSV and RGB color spaces in capturing color attributes, our approach enables effective interaction between these color spaces at the feature level. The HSV branch simultaneously enhances the V component while extracting features from the H and S components, thereby providing a more comprehensive set of cues for color recovery. To facilitate interaction, we design a learnable Color Transformation Block that bridges the HSV and RGB feature domains, effectively simulating the HSV-to-RGB conversion. Furthermore, a Cross-Integration Block, employing an attention-based cross-guidance mechanism, enables bi-directional information flow between the two color spaces.

To this end, a joint adversarial attack method against 3D object tracking is proposed, which simulates defects of the point cloud data in the form of point filtration and perturbation simultaneously. Specifically, a voxel-based point filtration module is designed to filter points of the tracking template, which is described by the voxel-wise binary distribution regarding the density of the point cloud. Furthermore, a voxel-based point perturbation module adds voxel-wise perturbations to the filtered template, whose direction is constrained by local geometrical information of the template. Experiments conducted on popular 3D trackers demonstrate that the proposed joint attack have decreased the success and precision of existing 3D trackers by 30.2% and 35.4% respectively in average, which made an improvement of 30.5% over existing attack methods.},

The method starts with an initial overclustering of the data and relies on the unimodality graph that connects subclusters forming unimodal pairs. Such pairs are identified using an appropriate statistical test. UniForCE identifies maximal locally unimodal clusters that are statistically significant by computing a spanning forest in the unimodality graph. Experimental results on both real and synthetic datasets illustrate that the proposed methodology is particularly flexible and robust in discovering regular and highly complex cluster shapes.

  abstract     = {Recent findings suggest that with the same teacher architecture, a fully converged or “stronger” checkpoint surprisingly leads to a worse student. This can be explained by the Information Bottleneck (IB) principle, as the features of a weaker teacher transfer more “dark” knowledge because they maintain higher mutual information with the inputs. Meanwhile, various works have shown that severe teacher-student structural disparity or capability mismatch often leads to worse student performance. To deal with these issues, we propose a generalizable and efficient Knowledge Distillation (KD) framework with implicit Student-Aware Teacher Ensembles (SATE). The SATE framework simultaneously trains a student network and a student-aware intermediate teacher as a learning companion. With the proposed co-training strategy, the intermediate teacher is trained gradually and forms implicit ensembles of weaker teachers along the learning process. Such a design enables the student model to retain more dark knowledge for better generalization ability. The proposed framework improves the training scheme in a plug-and-play way so that it can be applied to improve various classic and state-of-the-art KD methods on both intra-domain (up to 2.184 % ) and cross-domain (up to 7.358 % ) settings, under a diversified configurations on teacher-student architectures, and achieves a major efficient advantage over other generic frameworks.

  abstract     = {Sparse subspace representation (SSR) is an attractive technique for subspace segmentation of high-dimensional data through a self-representation manner to reveal its algebraic structure. Numerous generalizations of SSR have been developed to meet different applications. However, a fatal limitation in those extensions is their neglect of feature weights in visual samples, which play crucial roles in segmenting or recognizing specific objects. This paper introduces a discriminative attention based weighted SSR model to tackle visual objects. In the proposed model, the prior information is empirically constructed for intra-cluster features and inter-cluster ones, aided by the sparse representation of samples. An attention mechanism is introduced to learn weights of features of samples. The attention based weights of objects in samples and sparse representation of samples are collaboratively learned from the prior information. A hard version and a soft one of attention based sparse subspace representation, abbreviated as HDAWSSR and SDAWSSR, are specified by assigning attention of features by a Boolean matrix and a fuzzy matrix. Algorithms for solving both models are meticulously developed, respectively. Applications of both algorithms in clustering and moving object detection within high-dimensional image data are investigated. Experimental results show that both models outperform the state-of-the-art subspace based segmentation methods.},

  abstract     = {Vehicle Re-identification (Re-ID) retrieves target vehicle images from non-overlapping cameras. To address label noise in pseudo-labels, we propose the Multi-scale Feature Sharing and Collaborative Sampling (MFSCS) method. Specifically, the designed multi-scale feature sharing module moves beyond reliance on global features, efficiently promoting the exchange of characteristics between global and local aspects. This shared feature approach collectively mitigates the label noise arising from clustering. Recognizing that clustering methods are highly sensitive to outliers, we introduce a collaborative sampling module that cooperatively combines samples in the clustering process before training the model. This cooperative sampling module is better equipped to handle outliers in the samples and update label information more efficiently. As a result, it asymptotically improves the accuracy and stability of the model. The effectiveness of the proposed method in terms of performance is demonstrated through extensive experiments conducted on both the latest challenging truck Re-ID dataset, Truck-ID and VeRi-776.},

Recent wisdom focuses on preventing catastrophic forgetting yet overlooks the limited samples issue, resulting in poor new class performance. In this paper, we argue that old class samples contain rich knowledge, which can be exploited to supplement the learning of new classes. To this end, we propose to Look from Old Classes (YLOC) for FSCIL, enhancing both the base and incremental sessions. In the base session, we develop a prototype centered loss (PCL) to obtain a compact distribution of old classes. During incremental sessions, we devise a prototype augmentation learning (PAL) method to aid the learning of new classes by exploiting old classes.

  abstract     = {Self-supervised methods, including contrastive learning and masked skeleton modeling, have demonstrated considerable potential in the field of skeleton-based action recognition. While contrastive learning captures fine-grained details at the instance level, masked skeleton modeling emphasizes joint-level features. Recent studies have begun to combine these two approaches. However, existing combination methods primarily focus on integrating the tasks within the skeleton space. Moreover, existing contrastive learning methods often fail to exploit the comprehensive interaction information in skeletal structures, resulting in suboptimal performance when recognizing actions involving multiple individuals. To overcome these limitations, we introduce the Dual-Decoder Collaborative Learning (DDC) with Multi-Hybrid View Augmentation (MHGNA) method, which connects these two tasks across multiple spaces. Specifically, the masked skeleton modeling task provides diverse views for the contrastive learning task in the skeleton space, while the contrastive method aligns the features generated by both tasks within the feature space. We further present an innovative view augmentation method that enhances the model’s capacity to understand human interaction relationships by shuffling and replacing data across temporal, spatial, and personal dimensions. Extensive experiments on four downstream tasks across three large-scale datasets demonstrate that DDC exhibits stronger representational capabilities compared to state-of-the-art methods.

  abstract     = {Autonomous driving perception is driving rapid advancements in Bird’s-Eye-View (BEV) technology. The synergy of surround-view imagery and radar is seen as a cost-friendly approach that enhances the understanding of driving scenarios. However, current methods for fusing radar and camera features lack effective environmental perception guidance and dynamic adjustment capabilities, which restricts their performance in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we introduce the D3PD framework, which combines fusion techniques with knowledge distillation to tackle the dynamic guidance deficit in existing radar-camera fusion methods. Our method includes two key modules: Radar-Camera Feature Enhancement (RCFE) and Dual Distillation Knowledge Transfer. The RCFE module enhances the areas of interest in BEV, addressing the poor object perception performance of single-modal features. The Dual Distillation Knowledge Transfer includes four distinct modules: Camera Radar Sparse Distillation (CRSD) for sparse feature knowledge transfer and teacher-student network feature alignment. Position-guided Sampling Distillation(SamD) for refining the knowledge transfer of fused features through dynamic sampling. Detection Constraint Result Distillation (DcRD) for strengthening the positional correlation between teacher and student network outputs in forward propagation, achieving more precise detection perception. and Self-learning Mask Focused Distillation (SMFD) for focusing perception detection results on knowledge transfer through self-learning, concentrating on the reinforcement of local key areas. The D3PD framework outperforms existing methods on the nuScenes benchmark, achieving 49.6 % mAP and 59.2 % NDS performance. Moreover, in the occupancy prediction task, D3PD-Occ has achieved an advanced performance of 37.94 % mIoU. This provides insights for the design and model training of camera and radar-based 3D object detection and occupancy network prediction methods.

Specifically, a new Transformer-based network is designed to classify the degradation stages of bearings. Additionally, a parallel RUL prediction model incorporating attention mechanisms is introduced, which integrates Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCN) and Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Units (BiGRU) to capture degradation features from multiple dimensions automatically and enhance the model’s ability to capture long-term dependencies in sequence tasks. Finally, the RUL prediction results from different stages are adaptively integrated using a smoothing technique to generate the final RUL. The accuracy and superiority of the proposed method are validated on the PHM2012 bearing dataset.},

This raises an important question: under what conditions is a multimodal approach essential for chart question-answering? We observe that these traditional approaches often struggle with complex color patterns, structural intricacies, and implicit numerical data. Yet, limited research addresses these challenges. To bridge this gap, we introduce a new multimodal chart dataset, mChartQABench, constructed by consolidating data from existing open-source datasets to address challenges with color, structure, and textless chart data. To handle these complex multimodal scenarios effectively, we propose mChartQA, a framework integrating the advanced language processing of LLMs with a state-of-the-art table-to-text engine. This framework excels in aligning visual and textual data, enhancing deep reasoning and contextual understanding within charts. Experimental results show that mChartQA achieves superior performance across four datasets, with over 20 % overall accuracy improvement on mChartQABench.},

Although CP is widely used as a post-processing step (on the outputs of machine learning models) to produce reliable set-valued predictions, it is still challenging to post-process heterogeneous (i.e., categorical & numerical) predictions since the traditional CP procedures are either exclusively designed for classification or only tailored to regression. This article proposes the use of a simple yet novel copula-based CP method that jointly produces (discrete) set-valued predictions and (continuous) interval-valued predictions. This approach offers flexibility by allowing the prioritization of specific outputs’ reliability and applies to general heterogeneous multi-task problems. We demonstrate its effectiveness in the context of autonomous driving, on two popular multi-class object detection benchmarks, where it effectively infers set values for object classes and bounding boxes with the specified confidence levels. Experimental results validate our method’s ability in handling heterogeneous multi-task conformal predictions: we achieve high confidence levels without losing the informativeness of the prediction regions.},

The existing causal discovery methods have shown promising results in effective connectivity network analysis, however, they often overlook the dynamics of causality, in addition to the incorporation of spatio-temporal information in data. Dynamic effective connectivity networks (dECNs) reveal the changing directed brain activity and the dynamic causal influences among brain regions, which facilitate the identification of individual differences and enhance the understanding of human brain. To learn dynamic causality, we propose a deep spatio-temporal fusion architecture, which employs a dynamic causal deep encoder to incorporate spatio-temporal information into dynamic causality modeling, and a dynamic causal deep decoder to verify the discovered causality. The effectiveness of the proposed method is first illustrated with simulated data. Then, experimental results from Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort (PNC) demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method in inferring dECNs, which reveal the dynamic evolution of directed flow between brain regions. The analysis shows the difference of dECNs between young adults and children. Specifically, the directed brain functional networks transit from fluctuating undifferentiated systems to more stable specialized networks as one grows. This observation provides further evidence on the modularization and adaptation of brain networks during development, leading to higher cognitive abilities observed in young adults.},

Additionally, we also proposed a novel intra- and inter-domain loss functions that enhance class recognition and feature compatibility, with their convergence rigorously validated through a novel analytical approach. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that SSID achieves accuracies of 85.4 % and 85.3 % on two widely recognized UDA benchmarks, outperforming the second-best methods by 0.94 % and 1.17 %, respectively.

However, the challenge of accurate retrieval persists due to the varied and complex content in untrimmed videos, and there has been a lack of discussion on which types of content compromise visual representations. In this paper, we found that text and blur texture are of this nature, grounded in empirical observations. Indeed, in models focusing on the visual modality, both the visual structure of text (without semantics) and the smoothness of blur texture (with few edges and corners) interfere with decision-making. To address them, we propose two strategies: text-masking learning, which excludes the effect of text in the descriptor for inputs that may contain text content, and blur texture filtering, a re-scaling strategy that mitigates the impact of blur textures by exploiting the neural network’s insensitivity to the smoothed pixel-wise gradients. Furthermore, through empirical observations, we demonstrate that our proposed method effectively handles visuality-threatening content. Additionally, we show that our method can lead to state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks of untrimmed videos.},

CAP is versatile and can be applied to a broad range of node classification tasks due to the commonly existing community structures within networks. Extensive evaluations on diverse node classification benchmarks demonstrate that CAP consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving accuracy improvements of up to 4.34 % while significantly reducing pre-training time by up to 14.87 times compared to existing techniques.

  abstract     = {Diffusion models have made significant progress in trajectory prediction tasks but still face several critical challenges. The ordinary differential equation (ODE) solving methods used in standard diffusion models often suffer from error accumulation during multi-step iterations. Additionally, the denoising process is highly time-consuming due to the large number of computational steps, which significantly hinders inference efficiency and makes real-time applications challenging. To address these issues, we propose a diffusion-based method, DiffTrajectory, which integrates the Runge-Kutta (RK4) method, a Leap Initializer Module (LIM), and an Adaptive Dynamic Step-size Strategy (ADSS) to enhance generation accuracy and greatly optimize inference efficiency. Specifically, to tackle the problem of error accumulation, DiffTrajectory formalizes the denoising process as an ODE-solving problem and adopts the RK4 as a numerical solution. By computing multiple intermediate points at each iteration, this approach significantly reduces error accumulation. To improve the efficiency of the denoising process, DiffTrajectory introduces LIM, which leverages a pre-trained initial model to quickly generate a high-quality starting point for denoising, thereby reducing the computational burden during the initial denoising stages. Furthermore, we design the ADSS that adjusts the step size dynamically based on the results of each denoising stage, ensuring the quality of the generated results while substantially shortening inference time. Extensive experiments on the ETH/UCY and NBA datasets demonstrate that DiffTrajectory achieves substantial improvements in both accuracy and efficiency.},

  abstract     = {With the increasing application of machine learning in industrial production, model uncertainty quantification has become a critical tool to evaluate the prediction reliability and guide decision-making. The Conformal Predictive System (CPS), which generates Cumulative Distribution Functions (CDFs), provides valuable support for uncertainty quantification. However, CPS faces limitations when addressing heteroskedasticity. This paper proposes a Mondrian Conformal Predictive System (LWT-MCPS) based on an enhanced Decision Tree. The proposed approach constructs decision trees using splitting criteria derived from Levene’s test and Welch’s t -test, ensuring that the variance and mean within each partition remain as homogeneous as possible. Furthermore, it incorporates predicted values and prediction variances estimated using the k -Nearest Neighbors (KNN) as splitting features, effectively mitigating the impact of high-dimensional data on tree partitioning and enhancing the model’s ability to identify heterogeneous regions. Experiments conducted on simulated data, public datasets, and blast furnace ironmaking data demonstrate that LWT-MCPS generates CDFs with lower Continuous Ranked Probability Scores (CRPS) than traditional CPS. These results validate its significant advantages in addressing heteroskedasticity challenges.},

  abstract     = {Hyperspectral image classification (HSIC) is a foundational topic in remote sensing. However, the high correlations between bands and the spectral correlations often result in redundant data. Moreover, traditional convolutional neural networks (CNNs) compress spatial dimensions through pooling layers or strides during spatial information extraction, resulting in the loss of spatial information. To overcome these challenges, we propose a spatial multi-semantic features guided spectral-friendly Transformer network (SFTN), which effectively extracts the spectral and spatial features of HSIs. Specifically, a multi-semantic spatial attention (MsSA) module applies unidirectional spatial compression along the height and width dimensions. Thus, this module maintains spatial structure in one direction while aggregating global spatial information, thereby minimizing information loss during compression. It then employs multi-scale depth-shared 1D convolutions to capture multi-semantic spatial information. Furthermore, the spectral-friendly Transformer replaces the traditional multi-head self-attention (MHSA) with spectral correlation self-attention (ECSa), which effectively captures spectral differences and thus reduces the redundancy of spectral information. Extensive experiments on several HSI datasets show that the proposed SFTN method outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in HSIC applications.

In this paper, we propose a backdoor defense scheme based on adversarial prediction proximity and contrastive knowledge distillation. This scheme not only detects poisoned models and labels but also effectively unlearns backdoors while preserving the model’s benign functionality. Based on the observation that untargeted adversarial examples and poisoned samples exhibit proximity in feature space within poisoned models (i.e., adversarial prediction proximity), we first detect backdoors by analyzing changes in the prediction behavior of untargeted adversarial examples for models before and after fine-tuning. Next, we purify the poisoned model using a triplet loss that incorporates clean samples and untargeted adversarial examples. This process is guided by contrastive knowledge distillation, where a fine-tuned model acts as a “benign teacher”, and a backdoor-retained model serves as a “malicious teacher”, encouraging the poisoned model to align its feature representations with clean behavior. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that our scheme achieves high accuracy in detecting poisoned models and labels, even with limited access to clean samples. Furthermore, our scheme provides effective backdoor purification, while preserving the integrity and performance of models.},

However, such useful transformations are much more limited in hyperspectral imaging, where images contain hundreds to thousands of spectral bands. To improve the performance of hyperspectral image analysis, we introduce four new hyperspectral space transformations in this paper: the Hyper-Chrominance-Luminance (H-CL), the Hyper-Hue-Chroma-Luminance (H-HCL), the Hyper-Hue-Saturation-Intensity (H-HSI), and the Hyper-Hue-Saturation-Value (H-HSV). These transformations extend the corresponding CL, HCL, HSI, and HSV 3D color spaces to multiple dimensions. To investigate their suitability in the context of texture classification, several well-known texture descriptors, including both theory-driven (handcrafted) and data-driven (deep learning) methods, are used in the experiments. Ten hyperspectral datasets are considered: HyTexila, SpecTex, HyperPlastic, and seven datasets extracted from the Timbers database. Among these datasets, six new ones are introduced in this paper. The proposed H-CL, H-HCL, H-HSI, and H-HSV transformations are also compared with state-of-the-art transformation strategies.

  abstract     = {Current federated backdoor attacks focus on collaboratively training backdoor triggers, where multiple compromised clients train their local trigger patches and then merge them into a global trigger during the inference phase. However, these methods require careful design of the shape and position of trigger patches and lack the feature interactions between trigger patches during training, resulting in poor backdoor attack success rates. Moreover, the pixels of the patches remain untruncated, thereby making abrupt areas in backdoor examples easily detectable by the detection algorithm. To this end, we propose a novel benchmark for the federated backdoor attack based on feature aggregation. Specifically, we align the dimensions of triggers with images, constrain the trigger’s pixel boundaries so that it is within a small range to avoid being detected, and aggregate trigger features from multiple compromised clients to enhance the global trigger’s ability to capture distributed data patterns. Furthermore, leveraging the intra-class attack strategy to train specific triggers for each class of samples, we propose the simultaneous generation of backdoor triggers for all target classes, significantly reducing the overall production time for triggers across all target classes and increasing the risk of the federated model being attacked. Experiments demonstrate that our method can not only bypass the detection of defense methods while patch-based methods fail, but also achieve a zero-shot backdoor attack with a success rate of 77.39 %. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to implement such a zero-shot attack in federated learning. Finally, we evaluate attack performance by varying the trigger’s training factors, including poison location, ratio, pixel bound, and trigger training duration (local epochs and communication rounds).},

We introduce LayerMix, an innovative Data Augmentation (DA) approach that systematically enhances model robustness through structured fractal-based image synthesis. By meticulously integrating structural complexity into training datasets, our method generates semantically consistent synthetic samples that significantly improve neural network generalization capabilities.

Within the QMTN framework, a lightweight spectral-spatial attention residual network is proposed for extraction of HSI features. The network incorporates a residual mechanism in both spectral and spatial feature extraction processes and includes an attention block to improve network performance by focusing on key locations in the spatial features. To maximize the use of the limited samples for constructing diverse meta-tasks, two meta-task generation approaches are employed, with and without simulated noise. Experiments on three public HSI datasets demonstrate that the QMTN framework effectively reduces the dependence on labeled samples in a single scene and significantly improves the classification performance and convergence of the internal network. The meta-task generation method with simulated noise can improve the classification performance of the QMTN.},

For vision-based designs, the marker-embedded sensing layer serves as the pivotal element of the force platform, unveiling diverse sensing characteristics throughout the learning process. However, none of the previous studies have thoroughly investigated the differences among these sensing features and leveraged them to optimize DL models for enhanced performance in multidimensional force detection. This study addresses this gap by systematically evaluating five distinct features (including optical flow, original images, and their derivatives) using four classic CNN architectures. Our comparative analysis reveals a clear feature-force specialization: gray images are most effective for pressure decoupling, while arrow images are superior in decoupling shear stress. Based on this finding, we proposed and validated a dual-branch DL model that fuses these two specialized features. The model achieves a strong, comprehensive performance on both tasks simultaneously, demonstrating the efficacy of our evidence-based feature-fusion strategy. This study provides new insights into sensing feature selection and evidence-based neural network design for vision-based multidimensional force platforms.

However, distribution shifts across these domains pose a significant challenge in maintaining performance across past, present, and future domains, that is, causing the catastrophic forgetting on previously seen domains and limited generalization to unseen ones. To address the above issues, we propose to guide consistent feature extraction to bridge distribution shifts using text prompts designed to remain invariant across domains. First, identity-consistent text prompts capturing high-level image semantics are extracted and aligned with image features throughout the lifelong learning pipeline. Moreover, to enhance generalization to unseen domains, we introduce an adversarial training that text features are contrastively aligned with both original and future-style image features, the latter generated by applying gradient-based perturbations in the feature space. Compared with 21 representative models on 11 benchmark datasets, our proposed model, trained without access to historical data, achieves performance comparable to the model trained using a joint training approach, and it performs well on all of the past, present, and future domains. We further explored the forgetting of the first historical domain and the generalization to all unseen domains under all 24 orders, and the results confirmed the superiority of our model.

  abstract     = {Foundation models like CLIP demonstrate exceptional capabilities over a broad domain of knowledge, such as with zero-shot classification; however, they also require significant computational resources, narrowing their real-world utility. Recent studies have shown that mapping features from pre-trained vision encoders into CLIP’s latent space can transfer some of CLIP’s abilities to smaller vision encoders, offering a promising alternative. Yet, the performance of these vision encoders still falls short of CLIP’s native capabilities, particularly in low-data regimes. In this work, we argue that enhancing training data coverage/diversity significantly improves mapping efficacy. We achieve this using tailored loss functions rather than relying on data augmentation or increasing training samples. For instance, we exploit the inherent multimodal nature of CLIP’s latent space, by incorporating cycle-consistency loss as one of our loss functions. Moreover, the mapping is learned using entirely unlabelled and unpaired data, eliminating the need for manual labelling or data pairing in novel domains. From these findings, our resulting method (Zoom-shot) offers a viable path to flexible zero-shot models for resource-limited, data-scarce settings. We test Zoom-shot’s zero-shot performance across various pre-trained vision encoders on coarse- and fine-grained datasets and achieve superior performance compared to recent works. In our ablations, we find Zoom-shot allows for a trade-off between data and compute during training; allowing for a significant reduction in required training data.

  abstract     = {Single-pixel imaging provides significant advantages for non-visible wavelength detection and ultra-compressed sensing. However, accurate reconstruction from severely under-sampled measurements remains challenging. To tackle this, we propose a novel wavelet-guided diffusion enhancement network with directional learning for single-pixel imaging (WGDNet), which hierarchically reconstructs images through wavelet component-aware reinforcement. Specifically, we design a sampling-guided model to capture essential textures and produce an initial image decomposed into high- and low-frequency components. The low-frequency part is enhanced with adaptive diffusion to preserve structure, while the high-frequency part is directionally incorporated through a multi-frequency adaptive fusion attention (MAFA) mechanism to refine details. Building on this, we develop a residual spatial adaptive fusion (RSAF) module to effectively combine low-frequency structures and high-frequency details. Extensive experiments on five public datasets demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance in both structural preservation and detail recovery. Successful implementation in the imaging system validates the applicability in real scenarios.},

Existing models often struggle to produce structurally diverse graphs. To address this limitation, we propose a novel generative framework specifically designed to capture structural diversity in graph generation. Our approach follows a sequential process: initially, a community detection algorithm partitions the input graph into distinct communities. Each community is then generated independently using deep generative models, while a dedicated module concurrently learns the interconnections between communities. To scale to graphs with a larger number of communities, we extend our approach into a hierarchical generative model. The proposed framework not only improves generation accuracy but also significantly reduces generation time for large-scale graphs. Moreover, it enables the application of prior methods that were previously incapable of handling such graphs. To highlight the shortcomings of existing approaches, we conduct experiments on a synthetic dataset comprising diverse graph structures. The results demonstrate substantial improvements in standard evaluation metrics as well as in the quality of the generated graphs.},

  abstract     = {Optical satellite imagery is a critical data source for Earth observation in remote sensing. However, cloud cover often degrades image quality, hindering its application and analysis. Therefore, effective cloud removal from optical satellite images has become a prominent research direction. In real-world scenarios, thick clouds act as pure noise, completely obscuring underlying information, while thin clouds provide partially beneficial information that can be leveraged for reconstruction. Traditional cloud removal methods often fail to distinguish between these two types of noise, leading to suboptimal performance. To address this limitation, we propose a novel cloud removal model, GLGF-CR, which incorporates a Gated Local-Global Fusion module. This module is designed to effectively separate and process the distinct characteristics of thick and thin clouds. For thick clouds, which contain no recoverable information, the model focuses on robust reconstruction using complementary data sources. For thin clouds, the model extracts and utilizes the beneficial information embedded in the partially obscured regions, enabling more accurate and detailed reconstruction. Additionally, a Dual Cross-Attention mechanism is introduced to establish robust mappings between SAR and optical modalities, further improving fusion accuracy. To handle domain shifts between source and target domains, we incorporate a domain adaptation module, which enhances the model’s ability to generalize across diverse real-world scenarios. The proposed algorithm not only outperforms existing methods on the large-scale real-world dataset SEN12MS-CR but also demonstrates strong cross-domain transferability on the Henan flood dataset. By explicitly addressing the dual nature of cloud noise–pure noise in thick clouds and partially beneficial information in thin clouds–this work advances the field of beneficial noise learning, demonstrating how noise can be systematically analyzed and utilized to improve model performance in complex scenarios.},

  abstract     = {Feature selection (FS) is essential for improving model performance in high-dimensional data by identifying the most relevant features. Concept Factorization (CF), building on Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF), is valued for revealing meaningful data structure and producing interpretable concept vectors. However, existing CF-based FS methods are typically unsupervised and do not leverage label information, leading to a bias toward high-variance features. This bias can result in the omission of low-variance features that may be highly discriminative, ultimately reducing the effectiveness of FS and compromising model performance, especially in tasks where subtle or rare patterns are important. To address these limitations, this paper proposes SCFLR, a novel semi-supervised FS method that combines CF with robust label learning. SCFLR establishes the CF framework based on the feature space by expressing each concept vector as a conic combination of the feature vectors, thereby leveraging both the underlying data structure and available label information to select a more informative and balanced set of features. To this end, SCFLR defines a linear regression-based loss function derived from the generated concept vectors to leverage information from labeled data. This loss function is further enhanced through a label learning framework based on the L 2 , 1 -norm to ensure a robust label approximation. SCFLR also utilizes the dual-graph regularization to maintain the local geometric structures in both feature and data spaces. In order to tackle the optimization problem of SCFLR, an efficient algorithm, with proof of its convergence, is introduced. Finally, the experimental validation of the SCFLR method on multiple datasets highlights its effectiveness and superior performance compared to other FS methods.},

This image is derived from a 3D saliency map computed by the internal attention mechanisms of the model, which highlights and preserves the most diagnostically relevant regions from the original volume. A surface is defined in this saliency space, enabling sampling and projection into a 2D diagnostic representation. This projection offers a compact summary of the volumetric scan, assisting clinicians in diagnostic interpretation and potentially alleviating the cognitive workload. A standard convolutional neural network trained on these synthetic 2D images achieves classification performance comparable to models operating directly on full 3D volumes. We train and evaluate our method on the OPTIMAM dataset and assess generalization through external validation on the independent BCS-DBT dataset without retraining. Results show that the model performs robustly across different clinical sources and provides an interpretable, computationally efficient tool for DBT-based breast cancer diagnosis.},

Therefore, we propose a new tracker called TransSTC, which explores the effective spatial cues in the template and temporal cues during tracking to improve the tracker’s performance. Specifically, we design the target-aware focused coding network to emphasize the efficient spatial cues in the templates, alleviating the impact of spatial cues with low associations of targets in templates on the tracker’s localization accuracy. Additionally, we employ the multi-temporal template update structure that accurately captures variations in the target’s appearance. Within this structure, the collected samples are assessed for target appearance similarity and environmental interference, followed by a three-level sample selection process to ensure the accurate template update. Finally, we introduce the motion constraint framework to dynamically adjust the classification results based on the target’s historical motion trajectory. Extensive experimental results on seven tracking benchmarks demonstrate that TransSTC achieves competitive tracking performance.},

The encoder incorporates an explicit alternating process inspired by a physics-guided model, enabling iterative decoupling of image features into reflectance and shading. Two asymmetric decoders are designed to reconstruct reflectance and shading maps based on their distinct properties. In addition, we introduce a shading loss function leverages spatial distributions of texture and structure. Unlike standard total variation (TV) losses, it employs a texture-likelihood-weighted TV norm, where weights are derived via a patch-matching scheme to distinguish isotropic textures from anisotropic image edges. This design enhances the model’s ability to suppress texture while preserving structure. Experimental results on three datasets (MIT, MPI-Sintel, and IIW) show the effectiveness of our method: on MIT and MPI-Sintel, it reduces the mean-squared-errors of both reflectance and shading by over 40 % compared to existing works, and on IIW, it achieves a superior WHDR score of 13.2, outperforming all existing methods.},

The prevailing hyperspectral methods adapt pretrained RGB-based object tracking networks for hyperspectral tasks by converting the hyperspectral images into false-color images and fine-tuning the whole network on hyperspectral datasets, which achieves impressive results in challenging scenarios. However, the performance of hyperspectral trackers is limited by the spectral information loss during the transformation, and fine-tuning the entire pretrained network is inefficient for practical applications. To address the issues, a new hyperspectral object tracking method based on domain adaption, hyperspectral adapter for tracking (HyA-T), is proposed in this work. The hyperspectral adapter for the self-attention (HAS) and the hyperspectral adapter for the multilayer perceptron (HAM) are proposed to generate the adaption information and to transfer the multi-head self-attention (MSA) module and the multilayer perceptron (MLP) in pretrained network for the hyperspectral object tracking task by augmenting the spectral information in the original hyperspectral images into the calculation of the MSA and MLP. Additionally, the hyperspectral enhancement of input (HEI) is proposed to augment the original spectral information into the input of the tracking network. The proposed methods extract spectral information directly from the hyperspectral images, which reduce the negative impact of the spectral information loss caused by the transformation. Moreover, only the parameters in the proposed methods are fine-tuned, which is more efficient than the existing methods. Extensive experiments were conducted on four datasets with various spectral bands, verifying the effectiveness of the proposed methods. The HyA-T achieves state-of-the-art performance on all the datasets.},

While adapting large pre-trained models is a common solution, such an approach requires significant resources and suitable source domains, which are often unavailable. To address these limitations, we propose Information Transfer from the Built Geodesic Surface (ITBGS), a framework that generates high-quality images from scratch. The core of ITBGS is our Feature Augmentation on Geodesic Surface (FAGS) module, which constructs a Geodesic surface to create a diverse pseudo-source domain from the initial samples. By transferring structural information from the augmented domain to guide the generator’s training, our method completely removes the need for pre-trained models. To refine the output, a supporting Interpolation and Regularization (I&R) module is also introduced to enhance the smoothness and perceptual quality of generated images. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ITBGS achieves state-of-the-art or comparable performance on various few-shot datasets, successfully balancing image fidelity and diversity.},

  abstract     = {Video anomaly detection is crucial for analyzing surveillance videos and plays a significant role in maintaining public safety. Recent advances in weakly supervised methods, utilizing video-level labels, have improved performance based on techniques like multi-instance learning and temporal modeling. Furthermore, memory banks demonstrate great potential in unsupervised anomaly detection, prompting their integration into weakly supervised setups. However, these methods depend on the Top- k selection mechanism to update the prototypes within memory banks, which has limitations such as overlooking valuable prototypes, leading to a biased updating process, and requiring hyperparameters. To tackle these challenges, we introduce a novel video anomaly detection model, FADMB ( F ully A ttention-based D ual M emory B ank network), which replaces the Top- k selection mechanism with an innovative attention-based prototype updating paradigm to obtain a more comprehensive and robust memory bank. Additionally, we design a Hybrid Encoder that encodes local and global temporal information to produce superior video representations. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of FADMB, achieving 85.79 % AUC on UCF-Crime dataset and 83.29 % AP on XD-Violence dataset.},

  abstract     = {Zero-shot action recognition, which addresses the issue of scalability and generalization in action recognition and allows the models to adapt to new and unseen actions dynamically, is an important research topic in computer vision communities. The key to zero-shot action recognition lies in aligning visual features with semantic vectors representing action categories. Most existing methods either directly project visual features onto the semantic space of text category or learn a shared embedding space between the two modalities. However, a direct projection cannot accurately align the two modalities, and learning robust and discriminative embedding space between visual and text representations is often difficult. To address these issues, we introduce Dual Visual-Text Alignment (DVTA) for skeleton-based zero-shot action recognition. The DVTA consists of two alignment modules-Direct Alignment (DA) and Augmented Alignment (AA)-along with a designed Semantic Description Enhancement (SDE). The DA module maps the skeleton features to the semantic space through a specially designed visual projector, followed by the SDE, which is based on cross-attention to enhance the connection between skeleton and text, thereby reducing the gap between modalities. The AA module further strengthens the learning of the embedding space by utilizing deep metric learning to learn the similarity between skeleton and text. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performances on several popular zero-shot skeleton-based action recognition benchmarks. The code is available at: https://github.com/jidongkuang/DVTA .},

  abstract     = {Facial vision-based contactless physiological signal measurement is an important intelligent application. Currently, there are a large number of fully supervised deep learning frameworks targeting this field to remotely extract biosignals by detecting facial skin optical imaging changes caused by cardiac activity. However, these solutions suffer from training data paucity, label inconsistent, and misalignment. Although many self-supervised methods have been proposed, they generally fall into the trap of capturing irrelevant periodic features and spatial semantic drifts since the very sensitive and weak pulse-induced skin color variations. To address the above issues, we design a novel self-supervised video Transformer framework for remote physiological measurements, named TranSpike. First, we abandon the popular unlabeled and blind video frame resampling, and construct positive and negative samples in pixel-wise frequency reconstruction of facial reflections. This strategy simulates pseudo heart rate labels and avoids the spike attenuation caused by existing Nyquist–Shannon and temporal random samplings. Second, we improve the vision Transformer backbone and optimize the related model to consider long-term temporal physiological cues beyond spatial context and spatiotemporal perception. Third, we propose an innovative contrastive paradigm and corresponding architecture that inspire the interaction of biological signals, pulse rates, and power spectra to recover rhythmic features. Experimental results demonstrate that our scheme outperforms representative methods when targeting mainstream datasets. Importantly, our model not only competes with existing self-supervised techniques, but also shows remarkable consistency with state-of-the-art full-supervised monitoring architectures in zero-annotation.},

This paper introduces KANBalance, an integrative approach that combines newly emerged Kolmogorov–Arnold Networks (KANs) with Focal Loss to tackle skewed class distributions. By substituting fixed neural activations with trainable univariate spline expansions, KANs deliver localized transformations that elevate minority-class patterns. The Focal Loss component further amplifies these challenging samples, collectively reshaping decision boundaries in favor of underrepresented instances. KAN’s ability to “zoom in” on narrow feature intervals complements Focal Loss’s capacity to emphasize hard examples, forming a synergistic framework that addresses each technique’s inherent limitations. We validate our method on two medical imaging benchmarks—pediatric chest X-rays for pneumonia detection and brain MRIs for tumor identification, both exhibiting pronounced imbalance. Results demonstrate superior accuracy, F1 scores, and AUC compared to widely used sampling baselines (e.g., SMOTE, ADASYN), and ablation studies confirm the synergy between spline-based adaptations and a minority-focused loss. Our findings reveal that coupling imbalance-aware objectives with adaptive network representations can significantly improve minority detection in complex healthcare contexts.},

However, existing SSL methods struggle with class imbalance and unreliable pseudo-label problems, causing error accumulation and performance drops. To address these issues, we propose a C lustering-guided contrastive P rototype L earning (CPL) to generate segmentation masks through pixel-to-prototype comparison. Specifically, CPL leverages cluster queries in the mask Transformer encoder to learn prototypes, which are class-aware latent representations of images. To solve the class imbalance problem, we introduce contrast loss between the prototypes learned by the teacher and the student model. We further formalize the segmentation task as a pixel-to-cluster center assignment problem; the updated cluster centers actively guide the consistency between the mask and per-pixel classification in the decoder, thereby improving the quality of pseudo labels. Our method is a plug-in and can be integrated into any SSL model. We conducted comparative and ablation studies with six state-of-the-art SSL models on the ACDC, LA and LiTs medical image datasets.

  abstract     = {The effectiveness of deep learning models is primarily attributed to the development of datasets free from disturbances. However, these datasets contain noisy annotations due to mistakes in manual labeling. The mainstream method, sample selection, can mitigate negative impact, but shows considerable fluctuations. Moreover, semi-supervised training gradually degrades due to error accumulation caused by imprecise selection. In the paper, we propose a novel learning framework for learning with noisy labels in image classification tasks, called Class Prototype-based Modeling (CPM) for Semi-supervised Learning (CPSL). We employ cluster analysis on class-wise features to construct CPM, thereby combining prototypical contrastive loss to divide clean and noisy samples. Next, we introduce knowledge distillation into two semi-supervised modules, in order to supervise the trained student network by the teacher one. The teacher network provides smoothing and pseudo labels for the FixMatch module, but assists in guessing labels for the MixMatch module. Additionally, a contrastive loss only for the labeled set, combined with class-wise feature-level prototypes provided by CPM and predicted features of samples, minimizes the memorization risk. Experimental results on corrupted datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, particularly in challenging datasets, such as too-large categories and real-world scenarios. Specifically, our method achieves 1.8 %, 3.0 %, and 2.1 % improvements on synthetic CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny-ImageNet datasets, and obtains 86.4 % and 75.1 % accuracies for real-world datasets, i.e., Animal10N and Clothing1M.

This long-tail distribution poses a significant challenge, resulting in inadequate model performance on the rare, yet safety-critical, parts of the data.

Additionally, our approach attains state-of-the-art performance in terms of ADE metric on the ETH/UCY datasets, while only slightly trailing Y-Net in terms of the FDE metric.

At present, there are style transfer models that focus on the global image and style transfer models that focus on the details of the image. However, global stylization can lead to insufficient style display, and detailed stylization can result in a lack of information in the content. In addition, simple warping of the image can affect the model’s understanding of content and style. To solve the above problems, we propose a new fusion module, a cube and cube root network and a warping constraint loss. Inspired by the fact that a value is first cubed and then taken its cube root, it remains unchanged, we integrate three fusion methods, including the module focusing on the global stylization and the module focusing on the stylization of details, which can more deeply balance the content and style parts. The warped content image is injected into the style transfer model, resulting in the warped content loss, the warped style loss, and the warped MSE loss. The warping constraint during training facilitate the model’s understanding of image content and style. Comparative experiments and ablation experiments demonstrate that the model produces better stylization effects under the cube and cube root network and the warping constraint loss.

A fundamental belief is that data imputation is helpful for learning performance, and it follows that the pursuit of better classification can guide the data imputation process. While some works consider using label information to assist in this task, their simplistic utilization of labels lacks flexibility and may rely on strict assumptions. In this paper, we propose a new framework that effectively leverages supervision information to complete missing data in a manner conducive to classification. Specifically, this framework operates in two stages. Firstly, it leverages labels to supervise the optimization of similarity relationships among data, represented by the kernel matrix, with the goal of enhancing classification accuracy. To mitigate overfitting that may occur during this process, a perturbation variable is introduced to improve the robustness of the framework. Secondly, the learned kernel matrix serves as additional supervision information to guide data imputation through regression, utilizing the block coordinate descent method. The superiority of the proposed method is evaluated on four real-world datasets by comparing it with state-of-the-art imputation methods. Remarkably, our algorithm significantly outperforms other methods when the data is missing more than 60 % of the features.},

  abstract     = {Ovarian cancer is one of the most harmful gynecological diseases. Early detection of ovarian tumors, facilitated by computer-aided techniques, is key to significantly reducing mortality rates. Amidst advancements in medical diagnostics, ultrasound imaging has emerged as a ubiquitous tool in clinical environments. Nevertheless, current methods mainly focus on single-modality ultrasound segmentation or recognition of ovarian tumors, overlooking the representation potential of multi-modality imaging. To address this problem, we propose a Multi-Modality Ovarian Tumor Ultrasound (MMOTU) image dataset containing 1469 2d-ultrasound images and 170 contrast-enhanced ultrasonography (CEUS) images with pixel-wise and global-wise annotations. We focus on an unsupervised cross-domain semantic segmentation task to explore the model’s adaptation potential from 2d-ultrasound and CEUS modalities. For this task, we propose a feature alignment-based architecture named Dual-Scheme Domain-Selected Network (DS 2 Net). Specifically, we embed adversarial learning to conduct feature-level alignment and propose the Domain-Distinct Selected Module (DDSM) and Domain-Universal Selected Module (DUSM) to represent the distinct and universal features in source-style and target-style. Extensive experiments and analysis on the MMOTU image dataset underscore the remarkable performance of DS 2 Net in fostering bidirectional cross-domain adaptation between 2d-ultrasound and CEUS images, thereby enhancing segmentation accuracy and pushing the boundaries of ovarian tumor detection technologies. Our proposed dataset and code are available at https://github.com/cv516Buaa/MMOTU_DS2Net .},

  abstract     = {Segmentation of tissues, organs and lesions from 2D/3D medical images is crucial in clinical analysis, diagnosis and treatment. Fully-supervised segmentation methods are costly, since labeling extensive medical images is both laborious and time-consuming. Semi-supervised segmentation, which learns from both the labeled and unlabeled data, is a promising method to alleviate the requirement of annotations. However, most existing semi-supervised methods face challenges in filtering out pseudo-label noise, extracting useful information from hard-to-segment samples, and balancing the weights of supervised and unsupervised losses. In this work, we propose a novel pseudo-labeling-based semi-supervised framework for medical image segmentation tasks, comprising two training phases. The first process utilizes a small iteration to encourage the learning of reliable points in predictions, achieving the pseudo-labeling refinement. The second phase employs pseudo-labels to compute a novel loss based on the harmonic mean, which enhances focus on hard samples. Additionally, we introduce a new min-max strategy for adaptively adjusting the weights between supervised and unsupervised losses, improving the robustness of the segmentation model. Experimental results on four public multimodal medical datasets demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms other state-of-the-art semi-supervised segmentation methods.},

However, we observe that the weakly relevant features and unreliable target distribution weaken the discriminative representation of graph learning, which limits the graph clustering performance. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel method termed Adaptive feature Boosting and distribution Refinement (ABR) for graph clustering. Specifically, we adaptively enhance the model’s capability to capture crucial graph structure and node attributes in each learning iteration through a local-global feature boosting approach. Moreover, we design a dynamic distribution refinement strategy that measures the importance of various soft assignment distributions to generate a robust target distribution. Extensive experiments conducted on five benchmark datasets have demonstrated that our proposed ABR achieves an average improvement of 3.63 % on four metrics compared to the suboptimal graph clustering method.},

Due to the large number of Chinese character categories, collecting diverse high-quality Chinese air-writing samples remains a costly challenge, constraining research progress. In this paper, we propose DiffChar, a generator-based method capable of rapidly generating high-quality air-writing samples. We regard air-writing samples not only as a time-series but also as a graph structure, thereby exploiting their dual characteristics. To better model the structure of characters, we propose a glyph-oriented graph-based U-shaped network, called GG-UNet. The GG-UNet models the structure of air-writing data from a graphical perspective. Simultaneously, we propose a position-dependent conditional embedding method, called PCE. It enhances the details of the generated sample by embedding position-specific conditional information at different locations in the input noise sequence. The generator of DiffChar is based on the design of GG-UNet and PCE. Through experiments, we demonstrate that the proposed modifications significantly improve the quality of Chinese character air-writing generation. Furthermore, through extended experiments, we demonstrate that DiffChar seamlessly integrates with a style-encoding network to synthesize stylized samples. Finally, we present GIAHCC-UCAS2024, a new air-writing dataset generated using DiffChar. This dataset encompasses 3811 Chinese characters, comprising 368,688 instances.},

However, most of the proposed models may suffer from the following main challenges: (i) The scarcity of historical data in financial markets, renders deep learning methods much less robust. (ii) Market-based time-series instances such as price data may share high similarities most of the time, making it challenging to extract discriminative representations. In this paper, we tackle these challenges within a coherent deep-learning model: C ontrastively A ligned C r oss-mod a l ( C ross)- A ttention Mode l ( Caracal ) for portfolio selection. By introducing multi-modal data, we contrastively extract and fuse cross-modal information and attend to both data-driven and real-world spatio-temporal relations with respect to an objective loss that considers the entire joint distribution of asset returns. Specifically, we propose an Inter-Modal Contrastive Fusion Module to build connections among features of highly correlated multi-modal pairs. This allows the model to find and align temporal-related text-numeric pairs, and then exchange cross-modal information and fuse cross-modal features using the attention mechanism. We further design an Inner-Modal Contrastive Learning Module to guide the feature enhancement by simultaneously learning coarse-grained and fine-grained temporal feature representations from the similarity information between instances in each modality. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets show that our proposed model generates superior investment performance in comparison to other state-of-the-art models. We also conduct rich ablation experiments to justify the effectiveness of each module.},

  abstract     = {Recent studies on 3D Gaussian Splatting demonstrate promising applications in novel view synthesis with impressive results. However, achieving high-fidelity rendering becomes challenging due to images degradation commonly encountered in real-world scenarios. To address this issue, this paper proposes a plug-and-play Gaussian Splatting restoration pipeline, named GC-GS (Gradient Control Gaussian Splatting), which is applicable to various types of degradation, such as blur, low-resolution, low-light, or underwater scenarios. Specifically, the pre-trained 2D restoration models are employed to directly restore the degraded images. Various types of input image degradation problems can be transformed into the view inconsistency. Moreover, a gradient control strategy is introduced to mitigate the view inconsistency. Such a strategy follows the unanimity rule to execute the densification. During densification, the accumulated average of the view-space positional gradients is updated. Gaussians will clone or split only if the updated average view-space positional gradients from all of the restored images are consistent with the gaussian densification threshold. In addition, gradient control strategy employs gradient weighted optimization to further mitigate the impact of inconsistent regions. The proposed method effectively integrates the capabilities of the 2D restoration model into the task of novel view synthesis under various input image degradation. Without the need for complex network design or training methods, our method can adaptively mitigate the impact of these inconsistencies on gaussian densification and optimization solely by evaluating and weighting gradient information. Experiments demonstrate that GC-GS achieves superior rendering quality compared to previous state-of-the-art 3D restoration methods specific to single tasks on real datasets, while maintaining real-time rendering capabilities.

Manual generation of intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) plans is time-consuming and expertise-dependent. This paper introduces an innovative approach for automatic IMRT planning, featuring three key elements: a singularity coding method, a cascaded model with neural memory Ordinary Differential Equation (nmODE), and a new evaluation criterion. The coding method reduces input data dimensions, representing 3D spatial information through 2D images and lowering computational cost. The cascaded model, with Dose Prediction and Fluence Map Prediction sub-models, integrates nmODE blocks to enhance nonlinearity. Ablation studies highlight the effectiveness of the cascaded structure and nmODE. Collaborative training strategies and a dual encoder in the Fluence Map Prediction Model (FPM) facilitate end-to-end learning. The new evaluation criterion calculates the error in the tumor target region.

Existing methods, however, depend critically on accurate annotations and, under complex spectral signatures and environmental noise, label errors inevitably degrade spectral–spatial representations and impair model generalization. Some existing methods address label noise by discarding noisy samples, but this sacrifices informative data and reduces the diversity of positive–negative pairs required for contrastive learning, thereby undermining feature discriminability. To address these challenges, we propose selective-relaxed contrastive learning (SRCL), a unified framework for robust spectral–spatial representation learning under noisy labels. Specifically, we first employ a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) on per-sample loss values to partition the dataset into clean and noisy subsets. Currently, we perform spectral-spatial embedding graph learning to capture structural information and apply label propagation to correct erroneous annotations. Subsequently, we integrate a selective-relaxed contrastive module to aggregate low-confidence noisy samples into a super-class, increasing their affinity with the correct category and mitigating noise-induced errors. Meanwhile, high-confidence clean samples are employed in a supervised manner to generate reliable positive and negative pairs for robust representation learning. Extensive experiments on several benchmark datasets with varying noise levels demonstrate that SRCL substantially outperforms state-of-the-art approaches by effectively reutilizing noisy samples and significantly improving model effectiveness.},

To address these two issues, we propose Adaptive Momentum Weight Averaging (AMWA) to smoothen the loss surface and stabilize the training process. The network is updated based on weight averaging with an adaptive momentum that is dynamically determined by the validation error and the learning process variations. Then, our theoretical analysis shows that the proposed method decreases the variance of the network parameters during training, and improves the robustness to initialization. In experiments, we observe that the AMWA generalizes better to the test set on a wide variety of architectures and tasks: STEERER, VGG, ResNet, Dilated Network (CSRNet), and WideResNet on crowd counting.

To address this issue, we propose an end-to-end supervised mutual guiding framework, which explicitly supervises the propagation of complementary information between modalities, for RGBT tracking. In particular, we perform reliable mutual guiding between RGB and thermal features through introducing the supervised modality reliability estimation, whose training labels are generated by comparing the tracking accuracy of different modalities. To mitigate the impact of noisy labels, we introduce a classification-based weight estimation approach that utilizes joint predictions from multiple classifiers. In addition, we optimize the tasks of reliability estimation, mutual guiding and RGBT tracking within a multi-task learning framework to leverage the interrelation among these tasks.

Accurate and timely monitoring is essential for mitigation. However, traditional methods rely heavily on manual sampling, which is time-consuming, labor-intensive, and often inaccurate. Moreover, existing intelligent approaches primarily focus on the visible grain surface, failing to detect pest activity deep within the grain piles. To overcome these limitations, a systematic framework Pest Manager is proposed for precise pest counting and species identification in invisible grain pile storage environments. The framework consists of three key components: an improved grain probe trap ( PestMoni ), an infrared-based pest drop dataset ( PestSet ), and a multi-task Transformer-based architecture ( PestFormer ). Specifically, PestMoni utilizes two infrared emitter-photodiode pairs in an asymmetric orthogonal layout integrated into a customized circuit to detect and record pests as they fall. PestSet serves as a comprehensive dataset that supports robust pest counting and species classification across five representative stored-grain pest species. PestFormer is designed to analyze the characteristic waveforms of falling pests and incorporates a Conditional Modification Module (CMM) to mitigate device-to-device variability and standardize data processing. Extensive experiments were conducted to evaluate the reliability of PestMoni, the availability of PestSet, and the effectiveness of PestFormer. Notably, PestFormer achieved state-of-the-art performance, with 99.2 % accuracy in pest counting and 86.9 % accuracy in species identification, demonstrating its significant potential for pest management in grain storage facilities.},

Existing methods explore feature disentanglement to learn a compact generic feature space by eliminating domain-specific knowledge. Such methods not only sacrifice discrimination in target domains but also limit the model’s robustness against per-identity appearance variations across views, which is an inherent characteristic of ReID. In this work, we formulate Cross-Domain Variations Mining (CDVM) to simultaneously explore explicit domain-specific knowledge while advancing generalizable representation learning. Our key insight is that cross-domain style variations need to be explicitly modelled to represent per-identity cross-view appearance changes. This approach retains the model’s robustness against cross-view style variations that can reflect the specific characteristics of different domains whilst maximizing the learning of a globally generalizable (invariant) representation. To this end, we propose utilizing cross-domain consensus to learn a domain-agnostic generic prototype. Subsequently, this prototype is refined by incorporating cross-domain style variations, thereby achieving cross-view feature augmentation. Additionally, we further enhance the discriminative power of the augmented representation by formulating an identity attribute constraint to impose attention on the importance of individual attributes, while maintaining overall consistency across all pedestrians. Extensive experiments validate that the proposed CDVM model outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods by significant margins.},

  abstract     = {Semantic segmentation techniques are widely applied in various image analysis tasks. However, compared with natural images, medical image segmentation presents greater challenges. For instance, lesions often vary significantly in morphology, size, and structure, and are frequently accompanied by low contrast and blurred boundaries. To simultaneously preserve fine tissue structures when handling large-scale lesions and ensure the coherence of the divergent structures of vessels, tumors, and other organs while accurately segmenting adjacent cells, this paper proposes the concept of “Global Capture and Local Carving”. It introduces a model that integrates a hierarchical information fusion strategy, named CarveNet. CarveNet incorporates a carving mechanism at three levels: downsampling, feature transmission, and bottleneck processing. Structural Carving Pooling Module underpins the downsampling carving, deeply optimizing the information structure and morphology at different levels to maximize detail retention and minimize downsampling loss. Multi-window Carving ViT is employed for transmission carving, enhancing global information modeling while refining local feature representation. The bottleneck carving integrates a long-distance recurrent communication mechanism with grid-like spatial random shuffling to strengthen the robustness and diversity of feature extraction. Experiments conducted on eight medical image datasets demonstrate that CarveNet consistently delivers outstanding performance across all tasks, surpassing the second-best method in Dice coefficient by 1.136 %. This fully validates its effectiveness in terms of multi-lesion adaptability, accuracy, and generalization capability. The code is available at https://github.com/YF-W/CarveNet .},

  abstract     = {The domain discrepancy in medical images acquired under different situations renders a major hurdle in deploying pre-trained medical image segmentation models for clinical use. Since it is less possible to distribute training data with the pre-trained model due to the huge data size and privacy concerns, source-free unsupervised domain adaptation (SFDA) has recently been increasingly studied based on either pseudo labels or prior knowledge. However, when the domain discrepancy is large, the image features and probability maps used by pseudo label-based SFDA and the consistent prior assumption and prior prediction network used by prior-guided SFDA may become less reliable. In this paper, we propose a Pro mpt learning based SFDA ( ProSFDA ) method for medical image segmentation, aiming to improve the quality of domain adaption by explicitly minimizing the domain discrepancy. The workflow of ProSFDA consists of a Prompt Learning Stage (PLS) and a Feature Alignment Stage (FAS). Specifically, in PLS, we estimate source-domain images via adding a domain-aware prompt to target-domain images. We then optimize the prompt by minimizing the statistic alignment loss, and thereby prompt the source model to generate reliable predictions on the altered target-domain images. In FAS, we also align the features of altered target-domain images and their styles-augmented counterparts to optimize the source model, and hence push the model to extract compact features. We have evaluated our ProSFDA on two multi-domain medical image segmentation benchmarks. Our results indicate that the proposed ProSFDA outperforms other SFDA methods substantially and is even comparable to UDA methods. Code is available at https://github.com/ShishuaiHu/ProSFDA .},

  abstract     = {Few-shot learning (FSL) aims to accurately classify samples of different categories using extremely limited training data. In this work, we thoroughly analyze the fact that existing FSL methods ignore the differences, even significant differences, in feature representations extracted by different base backbones from each input image, which in turn affect classification performance. Therefore, a novel automatic feature selection (AFS) module is designed which has the capability to consistently obtain high-quality feature representations from each input image across different datasets and integrate quantized local and global features extracted from different base backbones using adaptive weights. Furthermore, the designed AFS module has the capability to effectively highlight the target feature information, suppress the influence of background noise, and improve the quality of feature representations. Then a novel AFS-based feature reconstruction (AFS-FR) network is proposed for performing different FSL tasks. Extensive experiments conducted on five benchmark datasets (i.e., CUB-200-2011, Stanford Dog, Mini-ImageNet, Tiered-ImageNet, and Aircraft) demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed AFS-FR method over state-of-the-art approaches. Especially in the Tiered-ImageNet dataset, the classification accuracies of the proposed AFS-FR method under the 5-way 1-shot and 5-way 5-shot experimental settings are 86.30 ± 0.13 and 94.84 ± 0.06 respectively, which achieve about 4 % and 5 % improvement than the best performance indicators in the comparison methods respectively.},

  abstract     = {With the rapid development of multimedia technology, the number of images has grown significantly, making the search for similar images an urgent necessity in everyday life. Hash image retrieval has gradually dominated the field of image retrieval due to its advantages of computational efficiency and high accuracy. However, existing image retrieval algorithms, whether based on convolutional neural networks (CNN) or Vision Transformers (ViT), primarily focus on enhancing the extraction of target category features in the spatial domain, neglecting the role of features in other domains, which to some extent limits retrieval accuracy. This paper proposes a Spatial-Frequency Cross-Shift Learning Perceptive Transformer Features in Decoupled Hashing (SFPTH), for image retrieval. First, based on the spatial location distribution of image features and the target category features present in the channels, we designed the Spatial-Spectral Dual-Domain Shift Perception (SSD) module within deep semantic feature layers. This design not only focus on features of the same category across different locations, but also the embedded frequency domain can also learn category information brought by target features enhanced through spatial shifts, thereby strengthening the output in deep features. This provides rich semantic information for discrete mapping, reducing the probability of misclassification. Secondly, we designed a bit decoupling loss to promote the independence of bits, which reduces the similarity of discrete values in model output by penalizing the correlation between labels, ensuring that the binarized output of the hash codes is more discriminative. We conducted extensive experiments on three public image retrieval datasets: MS-COCO, ImageNet, and CIFAR10, achieving retrieval performance of 93.33 % , 94.92 % , and 94.87 % , respectively.},

However, domain shifts among several source and target domains greatly limit the MDA algorithms’ implementation. Although various transfer learning approaches have been proposed, they mostly concentrate on domain level in two scenarios: single source domain or multiple source domains, ignoring the importance of category shifts in both cases. To overcome these issues, we propose a globally localized alignment with category shifts (GLACS) method for image classification. Specifically, we first construct a global cross-domain correlation matrix, which mines the maximum correlations among data samples. While learning the greatest correlations across domains for feature representation purpose, we also focus on the local category shift alignment by identifying the feature representations that are distinguished from each other. Samples from the source or target domain that belong to the same class are draw closer together, while samples of different classes are simultaneously pushed apart. Hence, we alleviate the domain shifts and category shifts at the domain and class levels. Furthermore, we utilize an adaptive weighting strategy on the classifier to produce more reliable results. Comprehensive experiments on six visualization benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method can achieve significant performance.},

We integrate the minimum message length criterion with a component-wise expectation-maximization algorithm to develop a scalable approach that performs parameter estimation and model selection. Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that DCS2BM outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both accuracy and efficiency. On synthetic networks with heterogeneous degrees, our model achieves an average NMI (normalized mutual information) of 0.99-exceeding the best baseline by 4.2 %. Furthermore, for large-scale networks with up to 40,000 nodes, DCS2BM maintains consistently high performance ( N M I > 0.99 ) while reducing computation time by 87.4 % compared to traditional approaches.},

However, despite the acquisition of large amounts of data, the few-shot problem often arises due to insufficient labeled data, and the function space of the network degrades the generalization performance. In this paper, we propose a recurrent progressive few-shot network (RPF-Net) for the classification of dual-source remote sensing images. It mainly consists of two parts: solving for the optimized fusion direction and adaptive feature-trusted decision-level fusion. In the first part, considering the problem of insufficient function space constraints under few-shot conditions, we propose representative-reinforcement learning, which performs the next fusion step by analyzing the state of the current moment and selecting the optimal action. This recurrent progressive propagation process dynamically adjusts the fusion features, guiding them toward the optimal fusion direction within a larger function space under few-shot conditions. In the second part, considering that the importance of different source features in multiple fusions is different, we focus on uncertainty theory and perform focused decision-level fusion by analyzing the characteristics of different source features. This network can dynamically adjust the fusion direction and fusion method of features, solving the problem of too large function space under few-shot conditions.

  abstract     = {Feature selection aims to select the optimal feature subsets from the dataset and has been widely applied in many fields and systems. However, data are not always static, and most of them are unlabeled. Besides, features may be heterogeneous and generated dynamically in practical applications. Therefore, online streaming feature selection was proposed that assumes the features are generated one by one or group by group on the fly while the number of instances remains fixed. This paper focuses on a new practical issue of online unsupervised streaming feature selection where the features are heterogeneous and dynamically generated in groups. Difficulties come from three aspects: the lack of label information, the uncertainty about the feature space, and the dynamic generation of heterogeneous streaming features. To solve this issue, we propose a new online Unsupervised Heterogeneous Group Streaming Feature Selection method named UHGSFS. To handle the problem of heterogeneous streaming features without the feature type information, UHGSFS applies MIC (Maximal Information Coefficient) to evaluate feature relationships without assuming data distribution in advance. To address the challenge of unlabeled information, UHGSFS clusters streaming features by the density based on the Gaussian kernel function and minimizes redundancy by selecting representative features. Extensive experiments were conducted on 13 benchmark datasets, with comprehensive comparisons against state-of-the-art supervised and unsupervised streaming feature selection methods. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method achieves comparable or even superior performance relative to supervised streaming feature selection methods.},

Existing methods can achieve satisfactory performance through carefully designed network architectures. However, they often ignore the semantic information of scene structures, leading to poor performance in the semantic boundary areas of the predicted depth maps. To address this issue, we propose SSRDepth, a monocular depth estimation method that leverages semantic segmentation to improve metric depth prediction. Specifically, we decompose metric depth into segmentation scale and semantic-aware relative depth, which are predicted separately through Segmentation Proposal Scale (SPS) module and an Adaptive Relative Depth (ARD) module. The SPS module predicts the segmentation scale under the constraints of semantic segmentation and scale alignment, endowing the model with semantic awareness and maintaining sharp semantic boundaries. Meanwhile, the ARD module adaptively predicts semantic-aware relative depth within a normalized depth space through a hybrid regression approach. Furthermore, to effectively capture structural details in semantic segments, we propose the Segmentation Query Guided Aggregation (SQGA) module, which utilizes a novel feature interaction approach to enhance the aggregation of multi-scale features, guided by masks produced through a Segmentation Mask Generator (SMG).

  abstract     = {Understanding text-rich images plays a pivotal role in multimodal reasoning, as real-world scenes often contain abundant text, such as logo images, advertisement images, electronic invoices, PDF scanned images, etc. While current large vision-language models (LVLMs) have shown promise, many primarily focus on improving input resolution, yet lack dedicated mechanisms for reasoning and rely on autoregressive objectives for implicit alignment between textual and visual elements. This lack of precise alignment and reasoning capability highlights a key gap: existing models are still limited in their ability to effectively integrate textual semantics with visual structure, which impairs performance in tasks such as layout interpretation, contextual understanding of embedded text, and multimodal reasoning in real-world scenarios. Therefore, we developed a Reasoning Elicitation and Multi-Granularity Contrastive Learning (REMGCL) method for text-rich image understanding in large vision-language models. The reasoning elicitation module first integrates text information and detailed image descriptions to generate instruction-following rationale data in a cost-efficient manner. Then, the general instruction-following data and the generated rationale data are integrated to fine-tune the model, enhancing its reasoning capabilities. The Multi-Granularity Contrastive Learning (MGCL) loss aims to align visual and semantic features at both coarse-grained and fine-grained levels. At the coarse-grained level, we align the image features with words filtered out by a label filtering algorithm. At the fine-grained level, we align the word embeddings and patch embeddings corresponding to the text areas in the image. The MGCL captures hierarchical representations and improves the ability of the model to comprehend complex visual-textual relationships. Extensive experiments on benchmark text-rich image understanding datasets demonstrate the efficacy of the REMGCL, showcasing significant performance improvements in reasoning tasks.},

  abstract     = {The proliferation of social media platforms has led to an explosion of multimodal data that encapsulates rich emotional content. Effectively integrating heterogeneous modalities to predict sentiment polarity remains a critical challenge. Existing approaches often underexploit sentiment prior knowledge and largely ignore the impact of social links on emotional trends, resulting in suboptimal performance. To address these limitations, we propose a novel multimodal sentiment analysis framework, i.e., Label Semantic Guidance under Social Links (LSGSL). LSGSL enhances sentiment reasoning by jointly modeling visual-textual features and the social relationships between users. Specifically, it encodes social links as a graph structure to facilitate sentiment-aware interactions across modalities, and introduces a novel use of sentiment labels-not merely as classification targets, but as semantic embeddings that guide the fusion and reasoning processes. Furthermore, LSGSL adopts a multi-task learning paradigm that jointly optimizes three objectives: image-text contrastive loss, sentiment-guided semantic similarity loss, and sentiment polarity classification loss. Extensive experiments on three widely-used benchmark datasets demonstrate that LSGSL consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, offering new insights into the role of social context and semantic label guidance in multimodal sentiment analysis.},

However, the effectiveness of these methods heavily depends on prompt selection strategy. Moreover, most existing methods overlook the model plasticity since they focus on solving the model’s stability issues, leading to a sharp decline in performance for new classes in long task sequences of incremental learning. To address these limitations, we propose a novel prompt-based continual learning method called TIPS, which mainly consists of two modules: (1) a novel two-level prompt selection strategy combined with a set of adaptive weights for sparse joint tuning, aiming to improve the accuracy of prompt selection; (2) a semantic knowledge distillation module that enhances the generalization ability to new classes by creating a language token and utilizing semantic information of class names. We validated TIPS on 4 datasets across three incremental task scenarios. TIPS surpasses or matches SOTA in all scenario settings, maintaining stable prompt selection accuracy throughout multiple incremental learning sessions. Notably, TIPS outperformed the current state-of-the-art by 2.03 %, 4.78 %, 1.18 %, and 5.59 % on CIFAR, ImageNet-R, CUB-200, and DomainNet. Our code locates at: https://github.com/gogo-l/Tips .},

  abstract     = {Large-scale models have exhibited remarkable capabilities across diverse domains, including automated medical services and intelligent customer support. However, as most large models are trained on single-modality corpora, enabling them to effectively process and understand multimodal signals remains a significant challenge. Current research often focuses on designing task-specific or scenario-specific tuning strategies, which limits the scalability and versatility. To address this limitation, we propose a unified framework that concurrently handles multiple tasks and modalities. In this framework, all modalities and tasks are represented as unified tokens and trained using a single, consistent approach. To enable efficient multitask processing, we introduce a novel tuning strategy termed neural tuning, inspired by the concept of sparse distributed representation in the human brain, where only specific subsets of neurons are activated for each task. Furthermore, to advance research in multimodal and multitask learning, we present a new benchmark, MMUD, which includes samples annotated with multiple task labels spanning reasoning segmentation, referring segmentation, image captioning, and text-to-image generation. By applying neural tuning to pretrained large models on the MMUD benchmark, we demonstrate the ability to handle multiple tasks simultaneously in a streamlined and efficient manner.

Although deep learning techniques are acknowledged for their effectiveness in predicting future events by analyzing past behaviors, those approaches have resulted in poor prediction accuracy for video surveillance data. To tackle this issue, a new framework called the Horned Lizard ZfNet Summarization Framework (HLZSF) was introduced in this research. The primary processes, like filtering, key frame extraction, crime events tracking, and crime prediction with classification, were performed. To filter the noise features continuously, the mathematical steps of the filtering process were processed in the hidden layer with the min-max scalar function. Moreover, the crime events tracking function is executed by processing the food-hunting behaviour of the horned lizard. In addition, the feature selection from the video frame is performed with the horned lizard skin colour changing as the best solution. The Python environment is adopted for this study to validate the video surveillance database. Here, the incorporation of the horned lizard's best solution, which is skin changing behaviour based on a specific object in the deep network, has been employed to earn the finest feature selection and prediction outcome. The accuracy attained by the novel HLZSF is 97.87 %, and the recorded F-score is 97.88 %, precision 98.01 %, and recall 97.8 %, which is the finest outcome compared to alternative models.},

  abstract     = {Ordinal Classification (OC) addresses those classification tasks where the labels exhibit a natural order. Unlike nominal classification, which treats all classes as mutually exclusive and unordered, OC takes the ordinal relationship into account, producing more accurate and relevant results. This is particularly critical in applications where the magnitude of classification errors has significant consequences. Despite this, OC problems are often tackled using nominal methods, leading to suboptimal solutions. Although decision trees are among the most popular classification approaches, ordinal tree-based approaches have received less attention when compared to other classifiers. This work provides a comprehensive survey of ordinal splitting criteria, standardising the notations used in the literature to enhance clarity and consistency. Three ordinal splitting criteria, Ordinal Gini (OGini), Weighted Information Gain, and Ranking Impurity, are compared to the nominal counterparts of the first two (Gini and information gain), by incorporating them into a decision tree classifier. An extensive repository considering 45 publicly available OC datasets is presented, supporting the first experimental comparison of ordinal and nominal splitting criteria using well-known OC evaluation metrics. The results have been statistically analysed, highlighting that OGini stands out as the best ordinal splitting criterion to date, reducing the mean absolute error achieved by Gini by more than 3.02 % . To promote reproducibility, all source code developed, a detailed guide for reproducing the results, the 45 OC datasets, and the individual results for all the evaluated methodologies are provided.},

  abstract     = {Unpaired deep-learning (UPDL) methods have been widely studied for X-ray computed tomography (CT) imaging, and have achieved promising performances for low-dose CT (LDCT) image restoration with specific dose-level parameter setting. However, CT scans with different dose-level parameter settings (i.e., different combinations of tube currents/mAs and/or exposure views) would result in significant heterogeneity in CT images. Directly training the existing UPDL models with heterogeneous datasets would result in poor performance. To address this issue, we propose a dose-level parameter prompted unpaired learning (DLPP-UL) method, which can be effectively trained with heterogeneous datasets for LDCT image restoration. Specifically, we construct a dose-level parameter prompted (DLPP) generator and discriminator for a cycle-consistent adversarial network (CycleGAN), which can efficiently embed dose-level parameter prompting features. In addition, we share the dose-level parameter prompting features among the generators and discriminator, and design a dose-level distinguishable (DLD) training strategy for stable training the DLPP-UL model. Both simulated and real datasets with multiple dose-level parameter settings are adopted to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed DLPP-UL method. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed DLPP-UL model can achieve promising performance in terms of both quantitative and qualitative measurements, making it highly attractive for practical LDCT image restoration.},

Our approach first partitions the rating matrix into two submatrices with divergent sparsity levels. We then introduce a feature transfer method that leverages nuclear norm regularization to propagate user preferences across submatrices, thereby enhancing prediction accuracy for the sparse submatrix. Furthermore, the preference structure of the sparse submatrix is transferred to the dense submatrix to improve overall prediction accuracy. We develop a fixed-point method to solve the optimization model, which scales efficiently to large problems. Although the proposed objective function is non-convex, theoretical analysis demonstrates its convergence. Evaluations on synthetic datasets and real-world datasets such as MovieLens-1M, Douban-Book, and Amazon-CD datasets show that ReSFTNNR significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in recommendation accuracy.},

It lowers bit-widths of weights and/or activations efficiently by calibrating quantization parameters, such as a quantization interval, using a small number of training samples. We have observed that 1) dynamic ranges are different significantly across tokens, and 2) the ranges could differ depending on input instances, even for the same token. To address the scale variations in tokens, we introduce a token-based dynamic bit-width assignment method for quantization of ViTs, that adjusts the bit-width of each token dynamically adaptive to input instances. To this end, we exploit a quantization error for each token as an indicator for the bit-width adjustment. Instead of computing the quantization error for every token at runtime, which is computationally demanding, we propose to approximate the quantization error using a quantization interval. We also present a shifting quantizer specific to post-GELU activations that show an asymmetric distribution between positive and negative values. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, boosting the performance of a vanilla token-wise quantization scheme drastically, with marginal computational costs.},

The former highlights uncertainty stemming from inter-class resemblances, while the latter addresses analogous uncertainty within individual instances. We propose a novel framework, Adaptive Similarity Labeling (ASL), that captures both class-level and instance-level uncertainty by adaptively assigning soft labels based on semantic similarity and instance difficulty. ASL mitigates feature collapse and improves uncertainty estimation without adding inference-time overhead, and can be used regardless of the uncertainty metric used.

In this work, we propose MMIFprompt, a prompt-based fine-tuning approach that guides a Vision Foundation Model (VFM) using minimal trainable parameters for optimal fusion results. Our approach incorporates a novel Mixture of Expert Selection (MES) mechanism that adapts features through content-guided prompt generation using a modality expert dictionary, effectively adapting the pretrained VFM to MMIF while mitigating cross-modality interference. To further enhance knowledge transfer, we design two types of prompts: Bidirectional Common Prompts (BCP) to extract modality-shared information and Unidirectional Modality-Specific Prompts (UMSP) to preserve modality-specific features. Without full model fine-tuning, MMIFprompt achieves superior fusion quality with only 7.1M trainable parameters-just 8.7 % of the backbone’s parameters. Notably, it offers strong generalization across diverse medical image fusion tasks and can be seamlessly integrated into various VFMs as a plug-and-play module, maintaining excellent fusion performance.

  abstract     = {Topological consistency is crucial in boundary segmentation tasks for reticular images, such as those in neuron electron microscopy, aerial road imaging, and material microscopic imaging. Misalignments in segmentation results frequently bring about significant topological errors, which can exert a more detrimental impact on subsequent analysis compared to pixel-level inaccuracies. Existing methods generally struggle to effectively identify and resolve topological errors, especially in complex reticular structures and irregularly shaped objects. In this study, Skea-Topo, a novel skeleton-based loss function is proposed to boost topological accuracy, so as to address these challenges. Skea-Topo comprises two key components: 1) Skeleton-Aware Weighted Loss (Skeaw), which leverages a pre-weighted graph to prioritize error-prone regions and refines weighting strategies using object skeletons for improved handling of irregular objects; 2) Boundary Rectified Term (BoRT), which identifies topological critical pixels during training and applies additional weighting to these pixels. We evaluate Skea-Topo on five diverse datasets, including SNEMI3D, IRON, MASS. ROAD, DRIVE, and the newly introduced Al-La MicroData from the materials domain. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that Skea-Topo outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving a remarkable improvement of up to 7 points in the Variation of Information (VI) metric, reducing the VI score from 76.67 to 69.02. Both objective and subjective evaluations confirm the superior performance of Skea-Topo across all datasets, highlighting its effectiveness in overcoming the limitations of existing approaches.

However, learning a robust detector that relies solely on single-domain data is challenging due to limited data diversity. To address this issue, we propose an Adversarial Spectral Perturbation (AdvSP) approach to improve Single-DGOD generalization. Specifically, we first conduct a comparative analysis of the Fourier spectra of multiple images, revealing that image color, texture, and semantic content are characterized by three distinct Fourier spectral components. On this basis, we develop a spectral perturbation module (SPM) containing three learnable perturbation factors to jointly disrupt the Fourier spectra, simulating diverse variations in image attributes. Furthermore, we introduce an adversarial learning objective to optimize the SPM, and the learned SPM is then employed to construct adversarial images for detector training. Visual analysis of style features demonstrates that AdvSP greatly diversifies source images, while encouraging results on three benchmark datasets further confirm the effectiveness of AdvSP. Moreover, AdvSP features a plug-and-play design and can be easily integrated into different detection frameworks.},

However, critical challenges remain, including the scarcity of well-annotated multi-modal datasets and the difficulty in establishing precise anatomical region-to-text alignment due to unstructured clinical reports. To address these limitations, we propose a novel graph-based foundation model for CXR, named Graph-Aware Vision-Language Pre-training (GAVLP), which introduces two key innovations. First, our structured data generation module leverages the large language model (LLM) to transform sparse disease labels into richly annotated, structured semantic descriptions, effectively bridging the gap between limited clinical annotations and the need for comprehensive training supervision. Second, our Region-wise Graph Learning (RGL) framework constructs a global-to-regional graph topology to model hierarchical relationships between CXR regions and their clinical semantics. By treating region-specific features as relational nodes within a graph convolutional network (GCN), we achieve fine-grained alignment of visual and textual representations while preserving anatomical consistency. Extensive experiments on standard medical benchmarks demonstrate that GAVLP significantly outperforms state-of-the-arts methods in key downstream tasks, including zero-shot classification and cross-modal retrieval. Our framework advances multi-modal representation learning by unifying visual and non-visual features in a graph-structured space, offering enhanced interpretability and clinical applicability.},

Additionally, the model size and memory requirements must be considered for real-world deployment. To address these challenges, we propose an Attention-assisted Multilevel Fusion framework for IPAD, named AMF-IPAD. The proposed framework first employs an iris mask-guided attention module to separately extract ocular features for detecting global attacks and iris features for detecting local attacks. We then introduce an attention-assisted multilevel fusion strategy that systematically integrates complementary information across the image, feature, and score levels for robust iris liveness classification inference. Finally, a weighted joint loss function, combining pixel-wise supervision and self-distillation, is used to train the model effectively. The experimental results show that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on four publicly available datasets ( e.g. , LivDet-Iris 2017) under various protocols, demonstrating its superior generalization in cross-domain scenarios, while being able to effectively detect diverse attack types.},

However, previous studies for videos concentrate on practical performance improvements and yield remarkable results, while still lacking more in-depth theoretical exploration behind these advancements. Especially in light of the additional temporal dimension in videos compared to images, the importance of developing a novel perspective to rethink introducing new knowledge for dynamic-video is highlighted, which further supports the improvement of the learned representations. Therefore, this paper aims to explore a novel intellectual perspective, which injects new insights into video contrastive learning to further promote technical progress. For that, we delve into brain knowledge to redefine the essential temporal information (called temporal-invariant information) and temporal-redundancy in videos, subsequently exploring the construction of temporal views inspired by the attentional modulation mechanism as Temporal-invariant Video Contrastive Learning (TiVCL). Specifically, four temporal-invariant strategies are proposed to disturb temporal-redundancy, corresponding to distinct cognitive characteristics in human top-down attention mechanism (i.e., attention competition, perceptual constancy, motion association, and contour integration), providing preliminary validation for the heuristic value of single cognitive characteristics. Furthermore, we synergistically integrate these four strategies into an integration scheme, demonstrating the crucial role of multi-cognitive characteristics collaboration in extracting temporal-invariant information in video contrastive learning. Empirical experiments on multiple video benchmarks are performed to validate the optimal parameters of the temporal views generated through both individual strategies and the integration scheme in the proposed TiVCL. Moreover, excellent results across different video tasks also demonstrate the superior performance of TiVCL over advanced video methods. This study attempts to draw a more expansive picture for motivating more promising brain-inspired works for videos.},

Specifically, an inverted dark channel prior map is designed to suppress the sky and highlight objects over the water. Building on this prior map, we develop a prior encoder to extract object-related features. Additionally, we propose a Prior-Guided Residual Block (PGRB) and a Prior-Guided TriUpsample (PGTU) module, which effectively integrate the extracted prior features for both feature encoding and upsampling. This integrated approach enhances the network’s ability to accurately restore overwater objects, leading to improved defogging performance. Furthermore, we develop a prior map-guided GAN loss and a prior map-guided cycle-consistency loss, which guide the network to recover objects with greater fidelity while minimizing unnecessary restoration of the sky region. Through extensive experimental comparisons, our method demonstrates superior performance over existing state-of-the-art approaches in terms of qualitative analysis, quantitative metrics, and improvements in object detection.},

Deep learning advancements have led to the widespread use of Self-Attention (SA) based expert models in tasks such as X-ray, CT, and MRI segmentation due to the ability to model global dependencies. However, the design of SA does not specifically cater to detailed feature modeling, leading to mis-segmentation, especially with tiny or morphologically irregular organs or lesions. Additionally, diverse medical imaging modalities and diseases require expert knowledge to construct different architectures, limiting generalizability. Therefore, in this study, we first elucidated and demonstrated the critical role of feature interaction capability in enhancing the fine segmentation performance of expert models in medical image segmentation tasks. Then, we innovatively designed a general and robust attention mechanism named Recurrent-Attention (RecA). RecA builds a pipeline that continuously maintains and passes the processing feature flow within the model, covering the global dependency modeling capability from a single-layer feature map to the whole model, enhancing the feature interaction ability. Finally, Performance evaluations on two widely used 2D and three 3D public datasets validated RecA's effectiveness. The results showed that RecA can seamlessly replace SA in existing expert models, significantly improving performance without increasing parameter size or computational complexity. RecA exhibits outstanding robustness, independent of expert models and input image modalities. The introduction of RecA offers a new and efficient solution for detailed feature modeling in medical image segmentation, with the potential to become a foundational attention mechanism in future segmentation models.},

  abstract     = {Zero-shot character recognition aims to recognize unseen characters that have never appeared in training, utilizing auxiliary information like radical descriptions or printed templates. Zero-shot recognition is important for Chinese characters because of the huge number of character classes and the inability to pre-collect training samples for all classes. For zero-shot Chinese character recognition (ZSCCR), previous methods learn a cross-modal alignment between the character samples and the auxiliary information, and then employ it to recognize unseen characters. These methods ignore two issues: domain shift implying that the alignment learned from seen characters deviates on unseen characters, and anisotropic Gaussian distribution implying that the feature distribution of each unseen character exhibits highly variable variance across different directions. To alleviate these issues, we propose to synthesize unseen character samples to build a Gaussian density-based Bayesian classifier in the feature space, and calibrate the classifier to fit into the true feature distributions of unseen characters. To assist the Bayesian classifier calibration, a cross-modal prototype classifier and a conditional generator are first trained on seen characters. The parameters of unseen classes in the Bayesian classifier are estimated on the features of synthesized data and calibrated by interpolation, smoothing, and regularization. The calibration helps reduce the bias of estimated parameters to mitigate the domain shift. Experiments on both a handwritten Chinese character dataset and a natural scene character dataset show the effectiveness and superiority of our proposed method.

  abstract     = {Recently, untargeted physical adversarial attacks against object detectors in the field of autonomous driving have been widely studied. Compared with untargeted attacks, targeted attacks offer more precise control over the detector’s output and pose a greater threat, yet they have rarely been studied. Meanwhile, adversarial patches located outside bounding box offer greater stealthiness and lower deployment difficulty. However, achieving targeted physical attacks outside bounding box is a non-trivial problem. To address this problem, this paper proposes a novel targeted attack framework by leveraging a multi-task collaborative parallel optimization strategy. Specifically, the framework decomposes the attack process into two subtasks optimized in parallel: (1) Eliminating perception of the object. This subtask aims to help the object evade detection. We propose a loss function that combines global semantic representations with local intermediate layer features to achieve this. (2) Reconstructing an erroneous perception of the object. This subtask aims to force the model to output a preset bounding box and class label. We propose a loss function that establishes an incorrect spatial association between the adversarial patch and the original object to achieve this. The proposed method finally tested against three state-of-the-art cnn based object detectors: Yolov8, Yolov9, and Yolov11. Results show that our adversarial patch achieves up to 78.1 % targeted attack success rate, outperforming the compared methods by as much as 77.7 %. More importantly, we verified the effectiveness of our attack in the physical world. The patch remains effective across different devices, viewing angles, and distances.

  abstract     = {Density Peak Clustering (DPC) is a density-based clustering algorithm that selects cluster centers based on local density and relative distance. However, existing Granular Ball (GB)-based DPC methods often rely on threshold-based, one-pass GB construction, which limits the quality of generated GBs, particularly in boundary regions. Moreover, GB density is typically estimated solely from internal compactness, which fails to reflect its global representativeness. These limitations cause suboptimal center identification. To address this, we propose a Density Peak Clustering based on Granular Ball with K-Nearest Neighbor (GBK-DPC), which introduces an adaptive optimization mechanism to divide large-radius GBs, enhancing boundary resolution. It further defines GB density using a dual-factor estimation that incorporates both internal compactness and external neighborhood density. A dynamic allocation strategy is introduced to allocate non-central points only when sufficient neighboring GB information is available, thereby improving fault tolerance. Experiments on 23 datasets demonstrate that GBK-DPC achieves excellent clustering performance.},

  abstract     = {Human-object interaction (HOI) detection has attracted more and more attention due to its wide potential applications. Recently, Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) achieves promising results in 2D/3D zero-shot and few-shot learning. To overcome current heavy reliance on the large collection of annotated HOI data and often failure to recognize such unseen HOI relationships in training datasets in existing methods, we propose a smart collaborative reasoning framework named CORE-CLIP based on semantic enhancement driven by the openness and robustness of CLIP. Specifically, the text guided dual fusion attention module (TDA) captures precise interaction patterns by progressively integrating CLIP text embeddings, CLIP visual features, and global contextual features. The semantically enhanced explicit interaction classification module (SEC) is initialized by leveraging semantic information of objects, actions, and interactions generated through CLIP text embeddings, to ensure alignment between visual features and linguistic semantics. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CORE-CLIP has state-of-the-art performance on two benchmark datasets. In particular, compared to GEN-VLKT, the proposed CORE-CLIP improves 1.36 mAP on V-COCO and 1.01 mAP on HICO-DET. Zero-shot experimental results outperform state-of-the-art methods GEN-VLKT by a signifigant margin of 34.4 % in UO type setting and HOICLIP by 50.9 % in UO type setting, respectively. The inference speed of CORE-CLIP surprisingly attains 38.3 FPS while its total parameters are only 52.9M.},

  abstract     = {Despite the empirical success of non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) methods based on graph embedding, there are still some deficiencies, such as: 1) They are sensitive to affinity matrix due to encoding inherent structure by a self-defined graph cannot perfectly accommodate different underlying distributions of various datasets; 2) There is no comprehensive consideration of global and local structures; 3) The structural consistency of the feature space, the representation space and the original space are not persisted. Hence, we propose a novel model, i.e. robust locality regularized non-negative matrix factorization with structure preservation (RLNMF-SP), to tackle the above issues. Firstly, the low-rank attribute is applied to suppress the negative effects of noise and occlusion on the model, while obtaining a characterization of the global structure of the sample. Secondly, the Euclidean distance is employed to automatically assign appropriate neighborhoods to each data point, which reach to explicitly grasp the geometric topology without human intervention. Finally, graph embedding and positional constraint criteria are adopted to achieve structure preservation. Specifically, the learned similarity matrix is adopted to maintain the neighbor relationship invariant in the representation space, and hold the compactness within classes and separability between classes in the feature space. Numerous experiments have shown that this model exhibits excellent performance on interference-free, noise-containing, occlusion-containing, and mixed noise and occlusion datasets, and its recognition rate is on average 1–4 % higher than that of other models.},

  abstract     = {Microscopic-level digital pathology is the gold standard for cancer diagnosis, staging, and postoperative prognosis. In pathology image recognition, clinical descriptions—such as cell morphology, mitotic activity, and nuclear characteristics—play a crucial role in diagnosis alongside image features. Recent advancements in vision-language models (VLMs) have improved pathology image analysis by incorporating cue words to refine feature extraction. Integrating physicians' cues has further enhanced interpretability, fostering greater trust among clinicians and patients. However, most of current VLM methodologies depend on the assumption of perfect alignment between features across the pathology image and cue word modalities, compressing multimodal features into a single vector. This approach weakens predictive capabilities and robustness, leading to inaccuracies when inputs are misaligned. As a solution, this work introduces a novel VLM that utilizes paired multimodal data to learn unified discrete representations, enabling effective cross-modal generalization for downstream tasks. The model employs Information Co-Compression (ICC) and Cross-Exponential Moving Average (CEMA) to capture fine-grained features within paired data, significantly improving cross model features retrieval ability. Experimental results on a bladder cancer pathology image database demonstrate a prediction accuracy of 90.51 % and an F1-score of 92.5 %. The model also generalizes well to a stomach adenocarcinoma dataset, achieving 92.68 % accuracy and surpassing state-of-the-art (SOTA) models by 6.28 %. Additionally, testing on a natural image dataset yielded an accuracy of 83.83 %, outperforming baseline model by 13.52 %. These results highlight the model’s superior predictive performance and its potential to enhance trust and decision-making in real-world medical applications.},

However, they still face pressing challenges, such as the underutilization of spatio-temporal body structure features in transformers and the inadequate granularity of spatio-temporal interaction modeling in graph convolutional networks, which leads to pervasive depth ambiguity in monocular 3D human pose estimation. To address these limitations, this paper presents the Spatio-Temporal GraphFormer framework (STGFormer) for 3D human pose estimation in videos. First, we propose a Spatio-Temporal criss-cross Graph (STG) attention mechanism that better leverages inherent human body graph priors across sequential data and captures long-range spatio-temporal dependencies more effectively. Next, we introduce a dual-path Modulated Hop-wise Regular GCN (MHR-GCN) to independently process temporal and spatial dimensions, preserving both rich temporal-dynamic features and high-dimensional spatial representations. Furthermore, the module leverages modulation to optimize parameter efficiency and incorporates spatio-temporal hop-wise skip connections to capture higher-order information. Finally, we demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP datasets.},

  abstract     = {Recent self-supervised learning methods rely on massive general-domain datasets for robust model pretraining. However, these datasets may lack specificity required in specialized domains. Collecting large, supervised datasets to compensate for this limitation is also cumbersome. This raises a key question: Can automatically crafted domain-specific datasets serve as efficient and effective SSL pretrainers, performing comparable to—or even surpassing—much larger state-of-the-art general-domain datasets? To address this challenge, we propose Precision at Scale (PaS) , a novel modular pipeline for automatic creation of domain-specific datasets on-demand. PaS leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) through three distinct phases: Concept Generation, where LLMs identify relevant domain concepts; Image Collection, utilizing VLMs and Generative models to gather appropriate images; Data Curation, ensuring quality and relevance by eliminating unrelated or redundant images. We conduct extensive experiments across three complex domains — food, insects, and birds — proving that PaS datasets compete and often surpass existing domain-specific datasets in diversity, scale, and effectiveness as pretrainers. Models pretrained on PaS datasets outperform those trained on large-scale general-domain datasets (ImageNet-1K) by up to 21 % and surpass same-scale domain-specific datasets by 6.7 % across classification tasks. Notably, despite being an order of magnitude smaller, PaS datasets outperform ImageNet-21K pretraining, with improvements of 3.3 % in fine-tuning and 9.5 % in few-shot learning, and showing superior performance on specialized dense tasks. Furthermore, by efficiently fine-tuning pretrained VLMs like CLIP and SigLIP using low-rank methods, we achieve performance gains (+4.2 % over CLIP) in specialized domains with minimal overhead, demonstrating the versatility of PaS datasets.},

Similar to identifying colon polyps, doctors often utilize an endoscope to observe EC lesions. However, segmenting early esophageal cancer is difficult, due to the flat shape, similar color to the surrounding mucosa, and the interference of esophageal inflammation. Moreover, this field lacks a comprehensive benchmark for depth exploration. To address these challenges, we construct a new benchmark and propose a novel Frequency-enhanced Contextual Conversion Network (FCC-Net) for esophageal lesion segmentation, which effectively captures multi-level context information and leverages the frequency domain to identify fine-grained lesion boundaries. Specifically, we propose a Frequency-enhanced Context Module (FCM) to merge high-level features, facilitating the capture of global context information and offering essential cues from the frequency domain for accurate lesion boundary identification. Additionally, we present a Scale-induced Cross-level Fusion (SCF) module that fully integrates features from the adjacent levels. This enables the learning of multi-scale features through different convolution kernels, effectively handling scale variations. Furthermore, a Contextual Conversion Module (CCM) is presented to incorporate the global context information and boundary-related cues to enhance EC lesion segmentation performance. Experimental results across multiple EC datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms other state-of-the-art medical segmentation methods.

  abstract     = {In order to obtain more accurate pseudo-labels, more and more unsupervised feature selection (UFS) algorithms consider the intrinsic structure of data. However, data in real life not only has its inherent structure, but also has external connections between data. To address these issues, this article proposes central point link learning guided sparse dynamic diagonal embedding for feature selection (CPLDE). First, the diagonal graph is dynamically constructed in the subspace, and the sparsity of the diagonal graph is ensured by l 2,1 -norm. The graph constructed through sparse diagonal dynamics preserves a more accurate intrinsic distribution of data. Secondly, CPLDE constructs the central point link graph in the data space, preserving the distance information between each data and the central points. By using the similarity of distance information, the external connection between data can be obtained. Then, the critical knowledge of the pseudo-label obtained by the central point link learning is used to guide the sparse diagonal graph embedded in the pseudo-label learning process. As a result, the relevance between the intrinsic distribution of data and pseudo-labels, as well as the relevance between the extrinsic relationship of data and pseudo-labels, are enhanced. In addition, the central point link graph and sparse diagonal embedding graph form a dual graph structure, while retaining the manifold structure of the data. Finally, a new FS framework is constructed by combining the idea of dual graph learning and maximizing the between-class distance with trace ratio. To better embed the impact of the central points on data in FS and reduce losses, an improved update optimization method is proposed, which can obtain a better feature transformation matrix. Through comprehensive experiments on 8 datasets, it is verified that the FS performance of CPLDE is superior to 7 typical UFS algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Underwater Image Enhancement (UIE) aims to improve the visual quality of underwater images. Unlike conventional enhancement tasks, underwater images face the challenge of lacking real reference images. Existing works select well-enhanced images from various approaches as references to train enhancement models, but their performance is inherently limited by the synthetic reference images. To address this, we propose CLIP-UIE, a novel multimodal framework that leverages Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) to incorporate prior knowledge from the in-air natural domain to counteract the adverse impact of synthetic reference images. For this purpose, we first generate a large-scale synthetic underwater dataset based on three representative synthesis methods to activate an image-to-image diffusion model. Then, we incorporate the prior knowledge from the in-air natural domain with CLIP to train an explicit CLIP-Classifier. Subsequently, we integrate this CLIP-Classifier with UIE benchmark datasets to jointly fine-tune the pre-trained diffusion model, steering the enhancement process toward the in-air natural domain and surpassing the constraints of the synthetic reference domain. Additionally, we observe that during fine-tuning, the image-to-image diffusion model and the CLIP-Classifier primarily focus on high-frequency intermediate variables. Therefore, we propose a partial fine-tuning strategy targeting these variables that is 10 times faster than conventional strategies. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method exhibits a more natural appearance.

  abstract     = {Existing Mamba-based medical image segmentation methods faces two persistent shortcomings: their dependence on inflexible predefined scanning strategies and their limited capacity for spatial perception when handling anatomies with complex geometries. To address these challenges, we introduce GraphMamba, a novel graph-driven spatial order-aware Mamba framework. Our approach is rooted in a crucial insight: achieving robust spatial understanding requires learning structural relationships that maintain consistency regardless of input patch orders. GraphMamba implements this principle through two pivotal technical advancements. First, graph-driven topology-aware adaptive scanning module dynamically generates content-aware scanning orders by constructing and refining dynamic graph, thereby replacing conventional predefined orders with topology-guided traversal strategies. Second, spatial consistency learning establishes geometric invariance across varying scanning orders through carefully designed regularization constraints, enabling both geometry-coherence and order-invariant representation learning. Through rigorous evaluation on multiple clinical segmentation tasks, including myocardium and myocarditis lesion segmentation, liver and liver tumor segmentation, and abdominal multi-organ segmentation tasks, GraphMamba demonstrates substantial improvements in both segmentation accuracy and robustness compared to existing methods, confirming its effectiveness for medical image analysis.},

  abstract     = {Supervised classification has achieved significant success across various domains; however, the increasing cost of labeled data has become a major bottleneck as data scales up. In response, weakly-supervised learning has emerged as a promising approach, aiming to leverage complex and diverse sources of weak supervision. However, existing weakly-supervised algorithms struggle when dealing with ordered high-dimensional data, particularly in the context of pairwise learning. To address this challenge, this paper investigates the limitations of existing algorithms that focus on learning from pairs containing at least one positive class, and extends them to N-tuples where at least one positive class is present. This extension aims to adapt the method to more generalized and complex scenarios encountered in real-world applications. Specifically, we introduce a novel weakly-supervised learning framework for both not-all-negative N-tuples and unlabeled data, offering a powerful strategy for training a binary classifier. In this setting, the dataset contains N-tuples with at least one positive class and unlabeled data points. To provide guarantees for the trained classifier, we establish an estimation error bound to prove its consistency. Finally, through rigorous experimental settings, we demonstrate that our proposed method effectively overcomes the challenges posed by not-all-negative N-tuples and unlabeled data, making it applicable to real-world scenarios.},

DAHI combines: (i) Region Density Estimation (RDE), which identifies areas likely to contain overlooked objects; (ii) Density-Aided Crop Selection (DACS), which efficiently selects high-density, low-overlap regions for re-inference; and (iii) Crop Margin Aware Non-Maximum Suppression (CMA-NMS), which merges detections from full-image and region-based inferences while mitigating boundary-related errors. DAHI requires no retraining and integrates seamlessly with standard object detectors. Experiments on several aerial and driving detection benchmarks demonstrate improved detection quality and runtime efficiency compared to existing multi-inference approaches, while introducing reduced computational overhead. These results support the use of DAHI as an effective and practical enhancement for small object detection in complex visual scenes.},

  abstract     = {Image harmonization aims to synthesize photo-realistic images given composite images constructed by combining background and foreground source images. Most existing methods assume that the only difference between the two sources is illumination. However, in degradation scenarios, the source images inevitably exhibit complex distribution inconsistencies, including noise and resolution variations. Previous works have struggled to handle such inconsistencies despite their impressive performance. In this paper, we propose an image Harmonization Conditional Diffusion Model (H-CDM) to address the challenge in complex degradation scenes. Our model eliminates the intricate distribution inconsistencies by iteratively transforming the distributions from one source to another in a tractable manner. To achieve this, we first introduce a degradation-aware network with a degradation map estimation module (DEM). Given the degraded composite image, the degradation map can be generated by this estimation module and serves as a prior in our model. Further, we design a multi-scale masked deep supervision (MDS) loss to enhance the generation of photo-realistic harmonized images with fewer sampling steps. To verify the effectiveness of our H-CDM, we compare our H-CDM with other comparison methods on the newly constructed D-iHarmony4 dataset, where we achieve promising performance across the three metrics, mean squared error (MSE), peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), and foreground MSE (fMSE). To evaluate the robustness of our H-CDM, we also conduct a mean opinion score (MOS) test. The results demonstrate that our H-CDM produces more favorable and photo-realistic images. Our H-CDM can be applied in image editing to generate user-friendly composite images, especially when one of the source images is degraded due to being captured under non-ideal photography conditions.

First, a unary potential evaluates the reliability of each individual match based on its local neighborhood consensus. Second, a pairwise potential enforces geometric compatibility between adjacent matches. This two-tiered approach effectively captures rich topological constraints while maintaining computational efficiency. We formulate the final inference as an Unconstrained Binary Quadratic Programming (UBQP) problem and solve it with a fast, gradient-based discrete optimization algorithm. Our method is general, efficient, and requires no training, making it a versatile filtering module applicable to any set of putative correspondences, regardless of their origin from handcrafted or learned feature descriptors.

Existed MOT methods excel at accurately tracking multiple objects in real-time across various scenarios. However, these methods still face challenges such as poor noise resistance and frequent ID switches. In this research, we propose a novel ConsistencyTrack, joint detection and tracking (JDT) framework that formulates detection and association as a denoising diffusion process on perturbed bounding boxes. This progressive denoising strategy significantly improves the model’s noise resistance. During the training phase, paired object boxes within two adjacent frames are diffused from ground-truth boxes to a random distribution, and then the model learns to detect and track by reversing this process. In inference, the model refines randomly generated boxes into detection and tracking results through minimal denoising steps. ConsistencyTrack also introduces an innovative target association strategy to address target occlusion. Experiments on the MOT16, MOT17 and DanceTrack datasets demonstrate that ConsistencyTrack outperforms other compared methods, especially better than DiffusionTrack in inference speed and other performance metrics.

Transferring CLIP to downstream tasks (e.g., zero- or few-shot classification) is a hot topic in multimodal learning. However, current studies focus on single-modality adaptation and fail to capture target-relevant fine-grained features. In this paper, we propose an Image Description Enhanced CLIP-Adapter (IDEA), a multimodal adapter that effectively boosts CLIP’s performance on few-shot classification tasks. This adapter leverages the textual descriptions in the training set to enhance the model’s ability to capture fine-grained features. Meanwhile, IDEA is a training-free method for CLIP, and it can be comparable to or even exceeds state-of-the-art models on multiple tasks. Furthermore, we introduce Trainable-IDEA (T-IDEA), which extends IDEA by adding two lightweight learnable components (i.e., a projector and a learnable latent space), further enhancing the model’s performance and achieving SOTA results on 11 datasets. As one important contribution, we employ the LLaMA model and design a comprehensive pipeline to generate textual descriptions for images of 11 datasets, resulting in a total of 1,637,795 image-text pairs, named “IMD-11”.

In these contexts, MDE must achieve a balance between lightweight design and high accuracy. Nonetheless, the existing lightweight MDE methods usually sacrifice performance for efficiency. To address this challenge, we propose MG-Mono, a Multi-Granularity method for lightweight self-supervised MDE. Specifically, we propose a Multi-Granularity Information Fusion (MGIF) module within the encoder to comprehensively capture and integrate image features at pixel, local and global granularities. In our MGIF, the global dependency of pixels is modeled by Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), which can avoid the quadratic complexity and improve the efficiency of our method. Furthermore, we introduce a Feature-weighted Consistency Loss to extract favorable semantic priors from a pre-trained semantic segmentation model to guide the feature generation of our method. This strategy enhances the feature representation without increasing inference time, leading to improved depth estimation accuracy. At last, we also propose an efficient Neighborhood-Weighted Cooperative (NWC) prediction head in the decoder to refine the depth map by leveraging local contextual depth information.

To address this issue, we propose a Two-Stage Poison-Only Backdoor Attack (TSBA). Specifically, in a poison-only scenario, TSBA employs a two-stage poisoning strategy to attach triggers to both the object region and the selected background region in video frames, while using contrastive loss and total variation loss to optimize the triggers, enhancing the effectiveness and stealthiness of the attack. Extensive experiments under various settings show that our backdoor attack significantly degrades the performance of trackers based on Siamese networks, Transformer, and temporal information, outperforming existing attack methods.

  abstract     = {Recently, significant progress has been made in single image super-resolution (SISR) tasks with methods based on CNN. However, the computational and memory costs of large CNN models limit their applicability on embedded or mobile devices, and the utilization of global contextual information is constrained. Vision Transformers have shown improved results in super-resolution tasks by effectively capturing global information through self-attention mechanisms. Nevertheless, existing ViT methods have certain limitations, such as the restriction to a single dimension aggregation in spatial or channel domains, increased computational complexity as the input image size grows, and neglect of the requirements for texture patterns. To address these issues, this paper proposes a lightweight image super-resolution method called Cross-domain Aggregation Frequency Fusion Transformer (CAFT). Specifically, CAFT consists of a Spatial Domain Cross-Exploration Attention (SCEA) module for deep interaction in the spatial domain across axes (height and width), a Channel Domain Transposed Attention (CDTA) module for interaction across feature channels, and a Frequency-guided Fusion Block (FGFB) that leverages frequency domain processing to extract fine-grained image detail features. The combination of these modules achieves global correlations, texture feature extraction, and information propagation. In the experiments, we evaluate the CAFT method on multiple lightweight SISR datasets and compare it against existing SISR methods. Our method exhibits improvements of 0.40 dB, 0.47 dB, and 0.17 dB on Manga109 compared to DiVANet, SPAN, and SRConvNet-L, respectively. The results demonstrate that our approach provides excellent super-resolution performance and better detail restoration while maintaining low computational complexity and parameter count.

  abstract     = {Recent years, multiple kernel clustering (MKC) has extensive applications in data analysis field. Due to its characteristic of low computational complexity, Late Fusion Multiple Kernel Clustering (LFMKC) stands out among existing MKC algorithm methods. However, LFMKC is still confronted with some problems. Firstly, LFMKC only uses single-scale partition to obtain the clustering results, failing to learn about the information in the kernel matrices thoroughly. Secondly, LFMKC cannot utilize the higher-order correlations since the base partitions are fixed. Besides, LFMKC need an extra k -means step to yield the result. To overcome these limitations, we design a new method named One-step Late fusion Multiple kernel clustering via Tensorized adaptive Multi-scale partition Fusion (OLMTMF), which integrates multi-scale fusion, high-order tensor information and spectral rotation (SR) into a unified framework. To be more precise, we first design an adaptive algorithm to integrate multi-scale partition instead of single partition, fully exploring the information in different kernel matrices. Next, OLMTMF builds a tensor with different fused partitions, constrained by Tensor Nuclear Norm (TNN), to discover the higher-order correlations among these fused partitions. Finally, OLMTMF utilizes SR to directly obtain clustering results, further improving the clustering performance. We also develop an alternative procedure with theoretical convergence guarantee to optimize the objective function of OLMTMF. Extensive experiments indicate that OLMTMF achieves excellent clustering performance on different datasets with low computational complexity.

  abstract     = {Computer scientists consider an artificial intelligence system safe and trustworthy if it fulfills four pillars: robustness, transparency, fairness, and privacy. We propose a fifth fundamental aspect: conformal guarantee, that is, the probabilistic assurance that the system will behave as expected. We introduce CONFIDERAI (Conformal Interpretable by Design Explainable and Reliable Artificial Intelligence), a new score function for binary rule-based classifiers depending on both rules’ performance and geometry; the latter includes both the position of points within rule boundaries and rule overlaps, these being quantified via geometrical rule similarity. Furthermore, we address the problem of individuating regions in the feature space in which conformal guarantees are satisfied, by defining the concept of conformal critical set (CCS). The overall method is tested with promising results, comparable in efficiency to traditional scores, on ten datasets of real-world interest, such as domain name server tunneling detection and cardiovascular disease prediction. Moreover, newly generated rules from CCS resulted into an improved precision and reduced error on a target class, thus avoiding prediction failures in safety-critical contexts.},

We conducted a series of cluster-distance-based analyses to evaluate and enhance the model’s feature extraction capabilities. The proposed model was trained and tested on a dataset containing 50 Australian animal species, with 700 images per species, resulting in a total of 35,000 images.

On a separate validation set of previously unseen images, it attained a recognition accuracy of 91.29 % with an average confidence score of 0.801.

This leads to inadequate background refinement in the absence of negative clicks. In response, we propose DiffClick , a novel framework that processes positive and negative clicks in different enhancement modules. Starting from the initial segmentation results derived from the first click, both our Foreground Enhancement Module and Background Enhancement Module utilize a weight fusion module to augment features based on the type of guidance received. The Foreground Enhancement Module refines foreground features guided by positive clicks. Similarly, the Background Enhancement Module processes negative clicks and improves background segmentation by incorporating weight maps of background regions. Additionally, this module includes a non-target prototype to provide supplementary background guidance, ensuring effective segmentation even when negative clicks are lacking. Extensive experiments show that DiffClick beats most existing methods, especially when negative clicks are absent.},

Methods to improve performance under occlusion, including data augmentation, part-based clustering, and more inherently robust architectures, including Vision Transformer (ViT) models, have, to some extent, been evaluated on their ability to classify objects under partial occlusion. However, evaluations of these methods have largely relied on images containing artificial occlusion, since they are inexpensive to generate and label. Additionally, these methods are compared to early, now outdated models, and rarely to each other. We contribute the Image Recognition Under Occlusion (IRUO) dataset, based on the OVIS dataset in [1]. IRUO utilizes real-world and artificially occluded images to test and benchmark leading methods’ robustness to partial occlusion in visual recognition tasks. In addition, we contribute the design and results of a human study using images from IRUO evaluating human classification performance on multiple levels and types of occlusion. We find that ViT-based models show higher recognition accuracy than modern CNN-based models, which are more accurate than earlier CNN-based models, but that ViT models are still modestly below human accuracy. We also find that diffuse occlusion, in which relevant objects are seen through“holes” in occluders such as fences and leaves, can greatly reduce the accuracy of deep recognition models as compared to humans, especially CNNs.},

Traditional graph neural networks (GNN) often overlook the need to connect and balance the information across different levels of granularity, which is essential in histopathology for accurately capturing cellular morphology, tissue architecture, and spatial relationships. To address these challenges and provide a more holistic view of the patient's condition, we propose an Adaptive Multi-Graph Fusion-based Attentive Graph Neural Network (AMGF-GNN), which includes (1) three distinct graphs constructed and processed based on community information, feature similarity, and a combination of both to learn cell-to-cell interactions from three different views, enabling to distinguish the influence of each node in every single graph, (2) Adaptive Attentive Multi-Graph Fusion module which adaptively fuses the embeddings from all three paths, ensuring that the most relevant features from each graph are prioritized, and learns to balance the contributions of the community and feature-based information, addressing the uncertainty of their relative importance for the final grading task, (3) a dual-level loss optimization incorporates intra-graph and inter-graph similarity measures, ensuring consistency and robustness in the learned embeddings. The proposed method was experimentally validated and compared with nine other state-of-the-art (SOTA) models using the glioma TCGA and invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) datasets. It achieved a superior accuracy of 89.68 % for the binary grading of the glioma TCGA dataset, outperforming other competing models and demonstrating the effectiveness of AMGF-GNN.},

To alleviate such catastrophic forgetting issue, the state-of-the-art approach often freezes the learned feature extractor to preserve the old knowledge and introduces additional model components when learning new knowledge each time. The forgetting issue can be effectively handled by such approach at the price of rapid model expansion. In this paper, we propose a novel continual learning framework, called SEIL, with a much Slower model Expansion rate and better Incremental Learning performance than its counterparts. Specifically, instead of introducing an entire feature extractor, the majority of network parameters are shared during continual learning, and only the remaining lightweight modules are expanded for each new task. An out-of-the-distribution (OOD) technique is also applied to two auxiliary classifiers for more class-balanced predictions. The proposed method achieves new state-of-the-art results on multiple benchmark datasets under the standard continual learning settings.},

The findings indicate that the NMF model with β divergence ( β -NMF) performs excellently in clustering different data types and noise assumptions. However, existing NMF-based data clustering methods are defined within a latent decoder model, lacking a verification mechanism. Recently, self-representation techniques have been applied to a wide range of tasks, empowering models to autonomously learn and verify representations that faithfully reflect the intricacies and nuances inherent in their input data. This paper proposes a self-representation factorization model for data clustering that incorporates local information into its learning process. The Regularized Encoder-Decoder NMF model based on β divergence ( β -REDNMF) integrates encoder and decoder factorizations into a β cost function that mutually verify and refine each other, resulting in the formation of more distinct clusters. To incorporate the local information into the method, we add a graph regularization to the model. The β -REDNMF, owing to its autoencoder-like architecture and utilization of local information, produces more informative word embeddings with generalization abilities that apply to various data types. We present an efficient and effective optimization algorithm based on multiplicative update rules to solve the proposed unified model. The experimental results on the ten well-known datasets show that the proposed β -REDNMF model outperforms other state-of-the-art data clustering methods.},

  abstract     = {Remote sensing image captioning (RSIC) is a cross-modal task aimed at describing scene categories, object classes, and their spatial relationships in remote sensing images using natural language. Existing methods typically focus on training models in single language, neglecting the linguistic-enhancing information derived from syntactic structure differences and diverse expressions of the same objects and scenes. This information, present in cross-linguistic annotated data, can significantly enhance language perception and enrich training data. To verify the effectiveness of this information, we propose an auxiliary language-enhanced network called DIA, which leverages linguistic information from auxiliary languages to improve the quality and fluency of target language generation. DIA consists of shared visual feature extractor, target language generator, and auxiliary language generator. The shared visual feature extractor integrates the Linguistic-Irrelevant Feature Enrichment (LiFE) module, while a Linguistic Bridge connects the target and auxiliary language generators. The LiFE module employs linguistic-irrelevant feature extraction and multi-view attention to extract precise visual features, enriching the representations while minimizing language bias. Multi-view attention balances deep semantic expressions and linguistic-irrelevant features. The Linguistic Bridge establishes interactive pathway between the target language generator (ALG) and the auxiliary language generator (TLG), enabling the TLG to learn from the ALG’s language modeling capabilities. This interaction allows the TLG to handle complex visual features, improving language generation performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model achieves significant performance improvements on the UCM, Sydney, RSICD, and NWPU datasets. Specifically, on the UCM dataset, BLEU-4 is improved by 5.06 %, and CIDEr is improved by 16.86 %.},

The Wasserstein distance is gradually used to investigate the optimal transport problems in brain functional networks. However, most of the existing brain network analysis methods based on Wasserstein distance focus on the optimal transport between specific topologies (e.g., tree and pyramid structure) and neglect the optimal transport in global topologies of brain functional networks. To tackle this problem, we propose a new distance called graph sliced Wasserstein (GSW) distance to measure the optimal transport cost in global topologies of brain functional networks. Based on GSW distance, we further propose a new graph kernel called sliced Wasserstein graph (SWG) kernel to measure the global topological similarity of brain functional networks. We prove that our proposed GSW distance is a distance metric and SWG kernel is positive definite. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we perform the classification experiments on functional magnetic resonance imaging data of brain diseases from ADHD-200 dataset, ABIDE dataset and ADNI dataset. The experimental results show that our proposed GSW distance can be utilized to analyze the statistical differences of brain functional networks and identify important brain regions. The SWG kernel can significantly improve classification accuracy compared to state-of-the-art graph kernels and graph neural networks for classifying brain diseases.},

Recently, methods based on multi-view information fusion have been proposed to infer gene expression profiles from histology images. However, they tend to face two key challenges: the acquisition of view-specific and view-common information, and the utilization of shared information across multiple views in achieving information fusion. To tackle these challenges, we propose Bridging Attention Fusion-based Multi-view Graph Neural Networks (BAF-MGNN) which incorporate graph processing module and a bridge module, to capture the specific information and shared information from different feature spaces. Specifically, the graph processing module includes visual graph processing and spatial graph processing block, aiming to acquire view-specific information. To facilitate the alignment and fusion of visual and spatial embedding, we introduce a bridge module, which considers the shared information as a bridge connecting different views. Subsequently, the fused embedding is utilized for the spatial gene expression prediction. Extensive experiments on human breast cancer datasets show that BAF-MGNN achieves superior performance compared with state-of-the-art methods. The ablation experiment also showcases the essential role of each module. In summary, BAF-MGNN can achieve multi-view information fusion by leveraging shared information and enable the spatial gene expression prediction from histology images.},

  abstract     = {The mainstream deep learning-based image dehazing methods that rely solely on RGB information experience a sharp decline in performance when confronted with dense fog. To this aim, this paper proposes an RGB-FIR multimodal fusion-transfer network, along with a collaborative optimization strategy tailored for image dehazing. The developed network comprises two key modules: a multi-level feature fusion module and a multi-scale image transfer module. Specifically, the former employs a cross-modal multi-scale based on cross-pooling attention model to explore the complementary information cross scales and levels of RGB-FIR multimodal images. The latter characterizes the mapping relationship between the fused multimodal features and the ground-truth image. To further boost the optimization and facilitate the dehazing performance, a collaborative optimization strategy is elaborated to harmonies the merits of both generative adversarial loss, feature matching loss, perceptual loss, and fidelity loss. To validate the effectiveness of our proposed dehazing algorithm, we have collected 11,736 pairs of foggy and foggy-free images using a binocular RGB-FIR camera. Both subjective and objective experiments demonstrate that our RGB-FIR multimodal dehazing algorithm outperforms existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) image dehazing methods in terms of restoring details, textures, and color information from foggy images.},

  abstract     = {One major problem of graph-based clustering lies in the large computation load resulted by the similarity graph. Several previous works have shown that Szemerédi’s regularity lemma can be useful in relieving this problem. Based on this lemma, we partition the original graph to obtain a reduced graph, which inherits the major structure of the original graph with a much smaller cardinality. By performing clustering on the reduced graph and mapping data labels back to the original graph, the computation load can be reduced significantly. In further works we found that the parameters of this method have significant influences on the clustering results, and this issue hasn’t been dealt with in previous works. In this paper we present a thorough investigation of the influences of the parameters on clustering results, in experiments with four representative algorithms and a large number of real datasets. As a result, we find out the appropriate ranges of parameters to improve both clustering accuracy and computation efficiency significantly. We also show that regularity partitioning outperforms ordinary k-means-based partitioning, demonstrating the advantage of the regularity lemma in building the reduced graph. Furthermore, experimental results show that relatively old algorithms can be enhanced based on this lemma to outperform recent state-of-the-art ones. This work goes a step further in extending the application of the regularity lemma from pure theoretical to practical realms.},

  abstract     = {Mapping noisy, low-light RAW images to well-exposed sRGB images is both a promising and challenging task. Traditional Image Signal Processing (ISP) pipelines exhibit suboptimal performance in extreme low-light environments. Existing deep learning-based approaches, including both single-stage and multi-stage methods, have shown great potential in enhancing RAW low-light images. Single-stage models usually struggle with domain ambiguity. Conversely, multi-stage models tend to neglect domain-specific challenges due to their reliance on similar modules across various domains, which may lead to suboptimal performance. To address these limitations, we propose a domain-specific task decoupling network (DecoupleNet) designed to deeply decouple the entangled task into two subtasks across the two domains. Specifically, we introduce a channel-normalized denoising block for effective noise suppression in the RAW domain, as well as a color correction transformer block for precise color correction in the sRGB domain. Furthermore, we design a spatial frequency block in both domains to capture fine details and textures, highlighting the often underutilized role of frequency information. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves competitive performance, surpassing state-of-the-art methods on specific metrics across the SID and MCR datasets. Specifically, 0.12 PSNR improvement on Sony dataset, 3.03 % PSNR improvement on MCR dataset and a 0.094 reduction in LPIPS on the Fuji dataset.

  abstract     = {Although present various multi-view clustering algorithms have gained significant achievements, there are still three drawbacks in most algorithms. First, they mainly concern of single-view or multi-view ensemble independently, which ignore the consistent joint learning between single view and consensus view; Second, most algorithms mainly adopt single-stage fusion strategy, such as graph-based or subspace-based, which neglect considering multi-stage fusion strategy; Third, most of them did not consider different roles played by different views. Therefore, we propose an effective two-stage auto-weighted multi-view consensus clustering via bipartite graph (TWMVC-BG) in this paper. Specifically, at the early-stage, different views can be transferred to multiple view groups in any combination, which can capture multi-granularity information in three levels (w.r.t. anchors, neighbors and features) by bipartite graph via anchors. A set of diversity bipartite graphs can be obtained from multiple view groups. At the late-stage, the graph-based concept is adopted to generate the intra-group consensus graph S ( i ) for diversity bipartite graph in i -th view group and the adaptive weight learning strategy is used with non-parameter form. Finally, the global consensus graph U is constructed by multiple intra-group consensus representation S ( i ) . Based on this, we can obtain final clustering result on the convergence consensus graph U . Experiments show that TWMVC-BG algorithm outperform state-of-the-art comparison methods on seven kinds of multi-view datasets. On partial datasets, our method can reach 10 %-18 % improvement than the best comparison algorithm.},

  abstract     = {Due to the growth of multimedia technology and increased popularity of virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) applications, the need for efficient image transmission and storage is also proliferating. We propose an image compression method based on image region importance recognition and optimal transport (OT). As not all regions in an image is equally important, we can identify critical regions in the image for high-fidelity compression and use low-fidelity compression for less critical regions. In compression, critical regions are enlarged while less important regions are reduced in size. In this process we use OT to assign higher importance to the critical regions. In uncompression, inverse OT is used to restore the image. Our method has the advantages that, first, it is applicable to various compression frameworks, including both traditional and deep learning-based compression frameworks, and second, it is more flexible in adjusting the foreground and background of the image, and the ratio of the foreground to the background can be freely adjusted according to the actual needs of application. Experimental results show that our method can improve the quality of restored image while achieving a high compression rate. Comparisons under varying experimental conditions show that our method outperforms existing techniques at the same level of compression rate by improving reconstruction fidelity for key regions by 4.5–7.0 % (95 % confidence interval).},

However, many methods are limited by employing a single perturbation mode and a specific weak-to-strong learning strategy, restricting exploration of the perturbation space and hindering performance in fine-grained segmentation. While diverse perturbations are intuitively beneficial, simply combining them can lead to inefficient optimization and instability. In this paper, we propose a multi-branch strong perturbation constraint learning framework for SSS. Our framework introduces a novel multi-branch perturbation learning (MSPL) strategy, employing multiple parallel branches with diverse strong augmentations to expand the perturbation space and capture complex semantic variations. We further design a novel constraint simulation loss (CSSL), based on a hierarchical consistency learning structure (weak-to-strong and strong-to-strong), which enforces strong-to-strong consistency between different perturbation branches. CSSL mitigates instability and enhances robustness to perturbation-induced noise, enabling the network to better generalize and achieve more accurate segmentation, especially for fine object boundaries. Extensive evaluations on benchmark datasets (PASCAL VOC 2012, Cityscapes, COCO) demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance. Ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of our proposed MSPL and CSSL components.},

  abstract     = {LiDAR point cloud streams provide precise 3D mapping and detailed spatial information but limited temporal resolution due to hardware constraints. Multi-frame point cloud interpolation, which synthesizes intermediate frames between consecutive point clouds, presents a promising solution. However, previous methods treat point cloud sequence interpolation as an iterative process, resulting in prolonged inference times and making it challenging to maintain the temporal consistency of the predicted point cloud sequence. To address these issues, we propose MoCoPCI, a novel one-shot sequence interpolation framework designed for faster and more accurate nonlinear predictions. The core of our approach is a motion correlation-based bidirectional flow prediction, which ensures temporal consistency in the predicted point cloud sequence while significantly improving efficiency. Additionally, we introduce a cross-attention mechanism based on extrapolation and injection to capture multi-scale motion information from consecutive frames. Meanwhile, a point-wise compensation mechanism refines the warped points, collectively enhancing the network’s ability to model nonlinear and non-rigid motion. Extensive experiments on benchmark outdoor datasets demonstrate that MoCoPCI achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly reducing the Chamfer distance by an impressive 24.35 %, while attaining a remarkable 2-fold speedup in inference time.

  abstract     = {Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) aims to automatically identify anomalous events in videos that significantly deviate from normal behavioral patterns. Self-supervised learning motivates models to learn effective features from unlabeled data by designing proxy tasks. However, existing approaches often rely on coarse-grained modeling, focusing mainly on global sequence order or holistic scene structures, which may limit their ability to capture subtle motion changes or localized anomalies. Therefore, this paper proposes a self-supervised learning framework combined with fine-grained spatio-temporal proxy tasks to extract key features more accurately. For the temporal branch, we design a time interval prediction task: given a fixed middle frame and randomly sampled frames from both sides, the model predicts their temporal intervals relative to the center frame, thereby modeling the dynamic patterns of behavior. To enhance temporal modeling capabilities, we introduce a multi-head self-attention mechanism to capture inter-frame dependencies in the input sequence. The spatial branch employs a noise classification task inspired by diffusion models, where varying levels of noise are added to image patches, and the model predicts the corresponding noise levels. This encourages learning of local appearance features and patch-level sensitivity to perturbations. Our method is trained in an end-to-end manner and does not rely on pre-trained models. Experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate stable performance: the method achieves AUC scores of 98.6 % on UCSD Ped2, 91.7 % on CUHK Avenue, and 83.7 % on ShanghaiTech. These results suggest that the proposed approach can generalize well across different scenes, perspectives, and types of anomalous behavior.},

However, these methods face challenges in efficiently processing large-scale datasets due to their high computational complexity. Moreover, most existing tensor-based approaches rely on the tensor nuclear norm (TNN) to approximate the tensor rank function. However, TNN penalizes larger singular values, which are essential for preserving critical structural information, thus constraining the extraction of multi-view information. To address these challenges, we propose a novel fast multi-view clustering method via tensor hyperbolic tangent- p norm minimization. First, we incorporate an efficient anchor selection strategy and construct tensors from anchor-based representations, significantly reducing the computational burden of tensor-based approaches for large-scale datasets. Second, we introduce the tensor hyperbolic tangent- p norm (THT p N), a more robust and accurate approximation of the tensor rank function, enabling improved extraction of multi-view consistency and complementarity. Extensive experiments on eight real-world datasets show that our proposed model not only surpasses tensor-based methods in clustering performance but also outperforms matrix-based methods in computational efficiency, establishing a new benchmark for fast multi-view clustering.

Although deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved promising DR grading results, constructing a precise and trustworthy DR grading model remains challenging due to limited high-quality medical image data, high computational costs, and imbalanced data distributions. To tackle these challenges, we explore the transferability of feature representations from pre-trained vision foundation models (VFMs) to fundus images through adapter learning, aiming to build an efficient imbalanced DR grading model. Unlike classical full-tuning, which fine-tunes all pre-trained parameters of VFMs, adapter learning achieves competitive performance by adding negligible fine-tuned parameter number. Motivated by the above analysis, we develop a Token Pyramid Pooling-Driven Style Adapter Learning (TPDSAL) to better capture task-specific feature representations from VFMs, which fully exploits pathological distribution prior of DR and the inherent fundus imaging characteristics. Besides, we propose a novel dual-view balanced loss (DVB) to improve imbalanced DR grading performance and trustworthiness, which explores the potential of training class frequencies in sample-wise predicted logit space and sample-wise loss value space simultaneously. Extensive experiments on four public fundus image datasets manifest the superiority of our TPDSAL with DVB over competitive transfer tuning and loss methods in terms of imbalanced grading performance and trustworthiness. Further analysis suggests that clinical prior knowledge utilization is beneficial for adapter learning in capturing task-specific feature representations from VFMs.},

  abstract     = {Video-based human pose estimation is a challenging task in computer vision. Most existing methods directly employ neural networks to extract mixed high-dimensional spatiotemporal features and estimate a deterministic pose solution for each frame. However, such methods heavily rely on the original intricate features that entangle redundant information, and neglect pose ambiguity incurred by degradations such as occlusions and blur. In this paper, we present a novel framework which addresses the above issues from two aspects. (i) We propose a Hierarchical Representation Decoupling module, along with a theoretical mutual information objective, to explicitly decouple the original spatiotemporal features into multiple non-overlapping lower-dimensional components and remove redundancy. (ii) We further introduce a Context-Aware Multi-hypothesis Inference module, reasoning a set of potential hypotheses for each frame based on different spatiotemporal semantics to compensate for the pose ambiguity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods on three benchmarks, PoseTrack2017, PoseTrack2018, and PoseTrack21.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, data-driven approaches have dominated the field of Document Artificial Intelligence (DAI), making high-quality, large-scale annotated data increasingly crucial. Consequently, numerous automated annotation methods have been developed for annotating scanned and digital-born documents. However, these techniques prove ineffective in new scenarios involving photographed documents. Combined with the time-consuming and labor-intensive nature of manual annotation, these limitations have significantly hindered the development of DAI in photographed contexts. To address this, we propose DocAligner, a novel method that automates the annotation of photographed documents through real-virtual alignment. DocAligner establishes dense correspondences between real photographed documents and their virtual clean counterparts, transferring pre-existing annotations from the virtual to the real domain. DocAligner incorporates several innovative features to account for the characteristics of document images. Firstly, it utilizes a non-rigid pre-alignment to address non-rigid deformations in document pairs. Secondly, it performs multi-scale alignment based on multi-scale features to handle large displacements and ensure high accuracy. Additionally, DocAligner employs a GRU-based recurrent module to enhance the output flows at high resolution space, obtaining better fine-grained alignment. We construct a synthetic dataset for the supervised learning of DocAligner, and then adopt a self-supervised learning approach based on real-world data to improve the robustness in real-world scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of DocAligner-annotated data for five photographed DAI tasks, along with a notable improvement in efficiency compared to manual annotation.

This paper presents an innovative approach that utilises lightweight computer’vision techniques to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of the Sample Transfer Arm (STA) aboard the MSR lander. Our methodology employs the YOLOv8 deep learning model for image segmentation, and centroid detection of tubes in the challenging dusty Martian environment. These detected masks and centroids provide the foundation for constructing an outlined representation of the tubes, which is critical for precise spatial orientation. We exploit the knowledge of the object geometry to find key points and match them using their relative positions with respect to the geometry. Subsequently, a Perspective-n-Point (PnP) algorithm with RANSAC utilizes this outline and pre-computed 3D coordinates to ascertain the tube’s pose. This enables the STA’s camera-equipped gripper to locate and retrieve the samples accurately. This process is meticulously tailored for the constrained computational resources available on Martian missions, addressing limitations in processing speed and lack of parallelization capabilities. Extensive simulations under Martian-like conditions demonstrate the robustness and reliability of our approach, which would be a necessary technology to enable a backup tube retrieval concept for a MSR campaign using a robotic arm by ensuring precise and efficient sample collection.

However, conventional matching methods yield models with poor consistency, which exacerbates the instability of the robotic grinding and polishing system. This paper constructs an objective function that minimizes the component distance under local Frenet frame. It introduces the constraint on uniform allowances about machining conditions. A space location for subsequent processing is found in solving the multi-objective optimization function. To speed up the iterative process, the method utilizes a cosine similarity vector and incorporates the double features of torsion and curvature to assist the similarity function in making judgments. The paper also examines the principle behind setting the similarity threshold. However, the initial position relationship must be sufficiently close for the target point cloud to reach the desired position during iterations. Otherwise, the matching calculation will converge to the local minimum. To address this issue, the paper proposes the objective constraint of minimizing the density entropy difference on the partitions after cylinder parametrization of the point cloud. It determines the initial spatial positional relationship within the controllable error. Through comparison with both state-of-the-art and classical matching algorithms, the proposed method demonstrates superior performance in efficiency, precision, convergence, and consistency of allowance distribution.},

  abstract     = {Image restoration (IR) plays a pivotal role in image processing, significantly influencing subsequent computer vision tasks. Recent advancements have highlighted the efficacy of deep neural networks in enhancing image restoration. Yet, these methods often underutilize critical spatial and frequency domain information, thereby constraining their performance. Specifically, Transformer-based techniques, despite bolstering global feature associations in the spatial domain, incur high computational costs and yield marginal performance gains. Addressing these limitations, we introduce SFIR, a novel convolutional network model designed for comprehensive image degradation correction. SFIR incorporates an encoder-decoder architecture, with its core innovation rooted in two modules: the Multi-scale Spatial Enhancement (MSE) module and the Frequency Amplitude Modulation (FAM) module. The MSE module enhances the model’s ability to harness spatial domain information. It achieves this by combining multi-scale feature fusion with sophisticated local window-based non-local attention mechanisms. In addition, MSE also includes an adaptive detail enhancement block, which further optimizes the model’s ability to handle complex degradations by refining detail features and smoothing features. On the other hand, the FAM module effectively addresses the challenges of substantial amplitude map variances across various channels. It uses dynamic weighting modulation to improve image clarity and restore texture details. Collectively, these modules enhance SFIR’s efficiency in leveraging both spatial and frequency domain insights, leading to notable restoration quality improvements. Experimental validation underscores SFIR’s superior performance in deraining, dehazing, and particularly deblurring, while also showcasing its advantages in parameter efficiency and computational cost.

  abstract     = {CLIP provides a shared image-text representation space with rich and diverse vocabulary, enabling object detection in undersampled and unseen categories. Recent CLIP-based object detection works show two-stage detectors typically outperform one-stage designs, but with significantly higher computational costs. A fundamental limitation of a two-stage detector is region-level alignment (distillation), which requires hundreds of image encoder forward passes from both the detector and CLIP in each image. In this work, we propose GridCLIP, a one-stage detector that requires only a single image encoder inference per input image, achieving up to 43 × faster training and 5 × faster inference compared to its two-stage counterpart ViLD, while substantially narrowing the accuracy gap. GridCLIP introduces a dual alignment strategy to learn fine-grained, grid-level representations: (1) grid-level alignment: learning grid-level features aligned with CLIP text encoder using annotated category labels, and (2) image-level alignment: aggregating grid-level features into an image-level representation aligned with the CLIP image encoder, which allows GridCLIP to learn grid-level representations of a broad range of categories, especially undersampled and unseen categories. Experiments on the LVIS benchmark show that GridCLIP achieves competitive results, with strong generalization to COCO and VOC, demonstrating its efficiency and effectiveness as a CLIP-based detector.},

  abstract     = {Multi-label image classification datasets are often partially labeled where many labels are missing, posing a significant challenge to training accurate deep classifiers. Most existing approaches assume the missing labels as negatives and/or exploit image and category relationships to regularize training. Orthogonally, this paper studies blending samples in such incomplete datasets as new samples, extending the training data magnitude to increase generalization. First, the proposed LogicMix mixes multiple partially labeled samples to produce new samples, where their unknown labels are naturally mixed by OR’s logical equivalences, without replacement with constants. Subsequently, a Decouple Partial-Asymmetric Loss is proposed to assign separate label-focusing policies to original and new samples, addressing the learning imbalance from the different positive-negative label imbalances between original and augmented samples. Finally, we propose a complete learning framework called 2WayAug-PL. LogicMix and conventional data augmentation collaborate to extend the diversity of new samples in both the sample-sample relation and human prior knowledge, while pseudo-labeling compensates for the lack of labels to provide more supervision signals. 27 partially labeled dataset scenarios derived from three benchmarking datasets with various learning difficulties are utilized for comprehensive experiments. LogicMix has shown remarkable effectiveness and generality in improving mAP against compared sample-mixing data augmentation methods. In particular, 2WayAug-PL achieves state-of-the-art average mAP of 84.3 %, 50.1 %, and 93.8 % on MS-COCO, VG-200, and Pascal VOC 2007, respectively.

  abstract     = {Despite the increasing popularity of Vision Transformers (ViTs) on vision tasks, their deployment on edge devices presents two main challenges: performance degradation due to the necessary model compression amidst computational constraints, and accuracy drop stemming from domain shift effects. Although existing post-training quantization (PTQ) methods can reduce computational load for ViTs, they often fail under extreme low-bit conditions and domain shift scenarios. To address the two challenges, this paper introduces a novel D omain A ware Post-training Quant ization ( DAQuant ) approach that simultaneously tackles extreme model compression and domain adaptation for ViTs in deployment. Compared with large language models (LLMs), the activations in ViTs account for a much larger portion of memory in inference, making the ViT quantization more difficult. We empirically found that simply adopting the equivalent smoothing strategy in LLM quantization would likely fail in ViTs, as it still results in a lot of inferior outliers. Consequently, the proposed DAQuant sophisticated developed a distribution-aware smoothing method with Learnable Activation Clipping (LAC) to mitigate the effects of outliers. Additionally, we propose an effective domain alignment strategy to improve the model’s generalizability, which preserves model’s optimization on source domain while enhancing generalization ability on the target domain. DAQuant demonstrates superior performance in both quantization error and generalization capacity, outperforming existing quantization methods significantly in real-device deployment scenarios.},

  abstract     = {Instance weighting is an effective and flexible method to alleviate the attribute conditional independence assumption in naive Bayes (NB). However, existing instance weighting methods mainly focus on how to learn a specific weight for each instance, ignoring the limitation of the original view. In this study, we argue that real-world applications are rather complicated, and it is sub-optimal to learn instance weights only using the original view. Based on this premise, we propose a novel general framework called dual-view instance weighted naive Bayes (DIWNB). In DIWNB, we first construct multiple K-nearest neighbor (KNN) classifiers and select those with the lowest error rate to classify each training instance in turn to build the generated view. Next, we learn a specific weight for each training instance, and build an instance weighted NB model in each view. Finally, we weightedly fuse the class-membership probabilities of dual views to predict the class label for each test instance. To construct the generated view, we design a hard label approach and a soft label approach, and thus two different versions are created, which we denote as DIWNB H and DIWNB S , respectively. Experimental results on 60 benchmark and 2 real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of DIWNB.},

The proposed algorithm is simple, adaptable, and specifically targeted to perform well on small datasets. We combine Graph-Laplacian based spectral decomposition with a learnable, transformer-like component. The decomposition matrices are applied as skip-connections, providing our architecture with a prior that encodes both local and global information of the underlying mesh structure. The learnable component does not make any domain-specific assumptions and can override the prior, if necessary. This flexibility also allows our model to perform well on larger datasets. We further modify the decomposition matrices to create deeper versions of this architecture and introduce a data augmentation strategy: flipping and rotations are applied to the deviations from the mean, rather than directly to the samples. In our experiments, we compare the reconstruction error of the proposed architecture against the state of the art, examine the effect of data augmentation across a small baby face dataset and a larger adult dataset and inspect our model’s capabilities to generate new samples from the encoded distribution. We show that our method outperforms current baby face models, as well as state of the art 3D morphable models, especially on the raw data.

  abstract     = {Medical images encompass a wide array of modalities and anatomical structures, requiring numerous segmentation tasks. However, current methods tend to be highly specialized, struggling to generalize to Out-of-Distribution tasks without retraining. Developing a universal segmentation model is thus a valuable yet challenging goal. In this work, we introduce SegMIC, a novel learning paradigm that addresses these challenges through In-Context Learning. The primary aim of SegMIC is to perform segmentation across arbitrary anatomies by harnessing contextual information derived from a single reference image and its corresponding annotation. Building on this concept, SegMIC employs a tailored joint mask on the image-annotation pairs of both the query and the reference, compelling the model to perform tasks conditioned on visible contextual annotation patches. Thus the inference process is streamlined, requiring only a single reference pair to specify the desired task. To train our SegMIC, we compiled an unprecedented large-scale segmentation benchmark (UniMedDB), comprising totaling 49k images and 82k annotations spanning over 14 modalities and dozens of anatomical structures. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that SegMIC adeptly utilizes context to handle diverse segmentation tasks across various modalities and anatomies, achieving superior Dice and IoU scores of 0.919 and 0.870 on in-distribution tasks while outperforming the best competitors on out-of-distribution tasks by margins of 0.111 in Dice and 0.146 in IoU.

Experiments conducted on RLBench demonstrate that TMVP outperforms baseline models across a wide range of tasks, achieving superior multi-task performance and few-shot training efficiency.

Furthermore, we propose a novel weighting scheme, which adapts to not only the balancing parameter, but also the bandwidth and the sparsity parameters in the proximal p -norm. By adopting different weights, our model provides a general framework for both edge- and structure-preserving image smoothing. Furthermore, in order to overcome the blocky artifacts in two-directional gradient regularization (4-neighborhood), we propose to consider the pixel differences in two more directions (8-neighborhood). Finally, to solve the proposed optimization model with the adaptive non-convex proximal regularization, we propose an efficient solution based on the alternating direction method of multipliers, generalized shrinkage, and the Fourier domain optimization. We have conducted experiments on a variety of applications, including image smoothing, HDR tone mapping, compression artifact removal, texture removal, and depth map upsampling. Both quantitative and qualitative results indicate the superiority of the proposed method.

  abstract     = {Feature selection for high-dimensional data is a fundamental challenge in pattern recognition, particularly within resource-constrained Internet of Things (IoT) environments. Existing feature selection algorithms often present a trade-off between computational efficiency and selection accuracy. The clonal selection algorithm, while offering potential for effective global search, is constrained by its reliance on fixed-intensity mutation operators. This limitation renders the algorithm susceptible to premature convergence to local optima. Inspired by the phenomenon wherein beneficial noise promotes optimization processes across various domains, this paper proposes a feature selection method based on Clonal Selection with Beneficial Noise, named CSBN, for the feature selection of high-dimensional data. CSBN maps the discrete feature selection problem into a continuous space using real-valued encoding. Subsequently, it introduces a dynamic noise strategy guided by antibody affinity. Specifically, low-affinity antibodies are subjected to stronger, directional noise to enhance global exploration and escape from local optima. Conversely, high-affinity antibodies undergo subtle noise to facilitate a more refined local search. Experimental results on 24 public benchmark datasets spanning various dimensions demonstrate that CSBN achieves an average feature dimensionality reduction rate of 99.52 %. It improves the average classification accuracy from 73.56 % (with all features) to 92.91 % (with the selected subset). Compared to classical feature selection methods, CSBN improves average classification accuracy by 11.05 % while maintaining comparable computational overhead. Compared to hybrid methods, CSBN improves classification accuracy by 9.15 % and feature reduction rate by 13.74 % at lower computational cost.},

  abstract     = {Federated Learning (FL) is a distributed machine learning framework that enables multiple clients to collaboratively train a global model without sharing their private data. However, the privacy of clients’ data remains at risk during the aggregation process, as sensitive information can be inferred from the uploaded gradients. Traditional Privacy-Preserving Federated Learning (PPFL) techniques often compromise either efficiency or accuracy. To address this challenge, this paper introduces a novel PPFL scheme that integrates homomorphic encryption (HE) with a mask generation technique to enhance both security and performance. Specifically, the mask generation technique employs a homomorphic pseudorandom generator (HPRG) to generate a pseudorandom sequence that serves as a mask vector to conceal d -dimensional local gradients. Subsequently, HE is utilized to encrypt the HPRG seed, ensuring that only the sum of mask vectors can be reconstructed on the server side. While existing HE-based approaches require encrypting and decrypting each dimension of the d -dimensional gradients individually (i.e., d encryption/decryption operations), our approach performs HE only once on a single seed (i.e., one encryption/decryption operation). Thus, the computation and communication overhead in our scheme does not scale with the gradient’s dimension. The scheme also provides a security proof demonstrating semantic security for both local gradients and aggregated results, with high tolerance for collusion and dropout (both up to N − 2 ). Experiments demonstrate that our scheme improves computation efficiency by 5 × ∼ 10 × and communication efficiency by 3 × ∼ 7 × compared to state-of-the-art (SOTA) HE-based schemes for a model size of 4 × 10 5 . Moreover, as the model size d increases, these advantages become more pronounced, making our scheme a practical solution for privacy-preserving federated learning, especially for large-scale models.},

Although existing methods, such as font generation and font style transfer, have demonstrated promising results, their reliance on image-based content poses limitations. The style information embedded within these images can affect generated performance and lead to practical inconveniences. Therefore, this paper first proposes a one-shot text-driven artistic glyph image generation method named ArtGlyphDiffuser, which is a fine-tuning approach based on a pre-trained large model – Stable Diffusion (SD). To achieve the fusion of cross-modal information from text and images, we introduce the Style-to-CLIP Projection module, which maps the reference image onto the latent space of SD. Furthermore, we propose a Multi-Level Controlled block that seamlessly integrates information from various scales into the denoising process of the U-Net network, enhancing the extraction and generation of complex strokes, glyphs, colors, and textures. To prevent the model from solely focusing on pixel-level features, we incorporate a Coarse-Grained Context-Consistent Loss without prior knowledge. This approach encourages the model to prioritize high-level features and effectively complements the diffusion loss. Lastly, we propose the Randomly Masked Style strategy to accelerate the model’s training while maintaining its ability to generate diverse glyphs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach can generate natural artistic glyph images with exquisite details and achieve state-of-the-art performance.

  abstract     = {Research has demonstrated that Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have a tendency to base their predictions on image styles rather than image content, resulting in models that are susceptible to reduced performance when confronted with unseen domains. Domain generalization aims to address this problem by training models that can effectively generalize to previously unseen domains by leveraging information from multiple source domains. In the context of domain generalization, recent advances have advocated for the integration of style transfer techniques into the training pipeline, to synthesize samples with diverse styles. However, these methods often face limitations in achieving sufficient diversity in generated styles while maintaining semantic consistency with the source domain. This paper proposes a novel approach to overcome these limitations by combining style transfer with principal component analysis (PCA). First, PCA is applied to extract the principal components of style information. Then, perturbations along these components create new style features, which are used with a style transfer technique to generate multiple re-stylized images while preserving semantic consistency with the content images. These diverse yet content-consistent images are integrated into the training process of a classification model, improving its capacity for domain generalization. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art techniques on several cross-domain benchmarks.},

In this paper, we propose a novel zero-shot video captioning framework named R etrieval- E nhanced T est- T ime A daptation (RETTA), which takes advantage of existing pre-trained large-scale vision and language models to directly generate captions with test-time adaptation. Specifically, we bridge video and text using four key models: a general video-text retrieval model XCLIP, a general image-text matching model CLIP, a text alignment model AnglE, and a text generation model GPT-2, due to their source-code availability. The main challenge is how to enable the text generation model to be sufficiently aware of the content in a given video so as to generate corresponding captions. To address this problem, we propose using learnable tokens as a communication medium among these four frozen models GPT-2, XCLIP, CLIP, and AnglE. Different from the conventional way that trains these tokens with training data, we propose to learn these tokens with soft targets of the inference data under several carefully crafted loss functions, which enable the tokens to absorb video information catered for GPT-2. This adaptation requires only a few iterations ( e.g. , 16) and does not require ground truth data. Extensive experimental on MSR-VTT, MSVD, and VATEX, show absolute 5.1 % ∼ 32.4 % improvements in CIDEr scores compared to several state-of-the-art zero-shot video captioning methods.},

  abstract     = {Change detection (CD) aims to identify changes in foregrounds, i.e., objects of interest. As two common sub-tasks, general CD (GCD) focuses on providing binary changes (change or no change), while semantic CD (SCD) further distinguishes categories of involved objects. However, binary changes in GCD are often not practical enough, while annotating semantic labels for SCD is very expensive. Therefore, researchers propose a novel solution that intuitively divides changes into three trends (“appear”, “disappear” and “transform”), named trend CD (TCD) in this paper. It offers more change details than GCD, while requiring less manual annotation cost than SCD. However, compared to training a GCD model, training a TCD model with supervised learning still requires trend labels annotated across three trends, which remains costly and time-consuming. To address this, we propose a weakly-supervised TCD method that requires only binary labels (change or no change) for training, enabling trend predictions (“appear,” “disappear,” “transform,” and no change) to be obtained. This approach not only leverages existing abundant datasets with binary labels for TCD but also significantly saves the annotation costs associated with trend labels. Specifically, a softmatch distance is developed to construct a weakly-supervised TCD branch within a simple GCD model. In this way, the model that is able to predict both binary and trending changes can be trained only using GCD labels. Furthermore, an approach is presented to successfully separate the foreground and background of images, which also is crucial for the weakly-supervised TCD task. The experiment results on four public data sets are highly encouraging, which demonstrates the effectiveness of our proposed model.

However, this critical task is challenged by the substantial anatomical similarity between lesions and surrounding tissues, as well as the speckle noise inherent in ultrasound imaging. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel Feature-Enhanced Query Interaction Network (FEQIN), which achieves precise segmentation through three main technical innovations. First, we utilize multi-scale feature extraction with enhanced representation capabilities for small tumor characteristics. Second, we design a Feature Enhancement Module (FEM) that preserves critical tumor characteristics during feature propagation through adaptive channel recalibration. Third, we incorporate a multi-scale deformable attention mechanism that enhances information capture efficiency while accelerating inference speed. Finally, our Query Interaction Module (QIM) establishes spatial-semantic correlations that significantly improve lesion localization sensitivity. Extensive evaluations across three clinical datasets demonstrate the superior performance of FEQIN, particularly its effectiveness in handling real-world scenarios with varying image quality.},

Current studies mainly employ graph convolutional networks to learn users’ preferences.

Moreover, the interplay between adjacent behaviors is still not fully explored. To tackle these issues, we propose a Cross-Attentive Behavior-aware Graph Convolutional Network (CAB-GCN) for recommendation. Specifically, we propose a bidirectional weight aggregation network, which simultaneously considers the impact of behaviors from both sides of the item and user.

Finally, we devise a cross-attention mechanism equipped with feature-level sliding window, which is capable of considering the interplay between adjacent behaviors. Extensive experiments on three datasets demonstrate that CAB-GCN significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving average improvements of 40.21 %, 65.43 %, and 10.26 % on each dataset.

Numerous view recovery methods have been proposed to address this problem. However, most existing methods fail to effectively capture cross-view relationships between instances across different views. Additionally, many of these methods assume the availability of a certain percentage of complete multi-view data. In response to these limitations, we introduce a novel cross-view generative model based on Transformer. This model is designed to infer missing views and generate a comprehensive semantic representation, effectively addressing the limitations of existing methods. Our approach integrates the Transformer as an intermediary between the encoder and decoder to impute latent representations for unavailable instances. To capture meaningful cross-view relationships, we employ masked multi-head self-attention based on the Transformer architecture, allowing the model to dynamically learn associations across views. Additionally, we introduce a generative pre-training process that does not require complete data, allowing the generator to recover missing views. Furthermore, a self-supervised fine-tuning process is implemented to exploit intra-view similarity, thereby enhancing the overall quality of the generated data. Extensive experiments and analyses on several incomplete benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our novel method compared with several state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract     = {Temporal action segmentation is essential for understanding long-form videos, yet accurately segmenting actions remains challenging due to complex temporal dynamics. To address this, existing models often adopt a multi-stage refinement strategy. In this framework, a preliminary prediction is first generated from a hierarchical Encoder by progressively integrating the original video features, which is then refined through multiple cascading Decoders. However, they typically focus on designing sophisticated networks to uncover complex temporal dependencies that are only present in the final output of the Encoder, ignoring the fact that various scales of temporal dependencies are already captured due to the hierarchical structure. To investigate whether segmentation quality can benefit from leveraging this unexplored information, we propose a U-Net style model, termed Multiple Temporal Scale Aggregate Network (MTSAN). Specially, unlike existing models that successively refine predictions using only the final-layer features, we extract intermediate features throughout the hierarchical process to preserve rich multi-scale temporal contexts. The Decoders are then designed to refine predictions at different temporal granularities, corresponding to the features from the same-level Encoder. To effectively exchange information across all temporal granularities, we further propose a Cross Temporal Fusion Network (CTFN) to adaptively fuse complementary information across different temporal fusion scales. Our experimental results demonstrate that explicitly utilizing multi-scale temporal information contained in Encoder is an effective approach for further improving the performance of multi-stage refinement strategy.},

  abstract     = {Class incremental learning (CIL) aims to learn a model that can not only incrementally accommodate new classes, but also maintain the learned knowledge of old classes. Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection in CIL is to retain this incremental learning ability, while being able to reject unknown samples that are drawn from different distributions of the learned classes. This capability is crucial to the safety of deploying CIL models in open worlds. However, despite remarkable advancements in the respective CIL and OOD detection, there lacks a systematic and large-scale benchmark to assess the capability of advanced CIL models in detecting OOD samples. To fill this gap, in this study we design a comprehensive empirical study to establish such a benchmark, named OpenCIL , offering a unified protocol for enabling CIL models with different OOD detectors using two principled OOD detection frameworks. One key observation we find through our comprehensive evaluation is that the CIL models can be severely biased towards the OOD samples and newly added classes when they are exposed to open environments. Motivated by this, we further propose a novel approach for OOD detection in CIL, namely Bi-directional Energy Regularization ( BER ), which is specially designed to mitigate these two biases in different CIL models by having energy regularization on both old and new classes. Extensive experiments show that BER can substantially improve the OOD detection capability across a range of CIL models, achieving state-of-the-art performance on the OpenCIL benchmark.

  abstract     = {RGB-T tracking leverages the complementarity of visible and thermal modalities for robust performance in challenging environments. However, previous RGB-T trackers are vulnerable to irrelevant backgrounds and ignore the modality gap. To address the above issues, we propose MRTTrack, a Transformer-based RGB-T tracking framework consisting of a multi-modal separate-then-collaborative (MSC) module and a cross-modal discrepancy constraint (CDC). Specifically, the MSC is designed to mitigate irrelevant background interference and operates in two stages: target-oriented token selection and multi-modal token interaction. By recursively aggregating attention maps across layers, the target-oriented token selection produces an index mask for representative tokens, which is then used to guide multi-modal token interaction via mask-based attention. Additionally, CDC enforces consistency across modalities on non-representative tokens, thereby alleviating performance degradation caused by modality gap. Comprehensive evaluations on LasHeR, RGBT210, RGBT234, and VTUAV benchmarks demonstrate strong goal-reaching performance and notable robustness improvements of our method.

However, large ViTs still remain vulnerable to adversarial examples, emphasizing the necessity of enhancing their adversarial robustness. While adversarial training is an effective defense for deep convolutional models, it often faces scalability issues with large ViTs due to high computational costs. Recent approaches propose robust fine-tuning methods, such as adversarial tuning of low-rank adaptation (LoRA) in ViT, however, they still struggle to match the accuracy of full parameter adversarial fine-tuning. An effective synergy of various defense mechanisms offers a promising approach to enhancing the robustness of ViT, yet this paradigm remains largely underexplored. To address this, we propose hyper adversarial tuning (HyperAT), a meta learning approach, which captures shared defensive knowledge among different methods to improve model robustness efficiently and effectively simultaneously. Specifically, adversarial tuning of each defense method is formulated as a learning task, and a HyperNetwork generates LoRA specific to this defense. Then, a random sampling and tuning strategy is proposed to extract and facilitate the defensive knowledge transfer between different defenses. Finally, diverse LoRAs are merged adaptively to further enhance the adversarial robustness. Experiments on various datasets and model architectures demonstrate that HyperAT significantly enhances the adversarial robustness of pretrained large vision models without excessive computational overhead, establishing a new state-of-the-art benchmark.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we propose a new network architecture for open-vocabulary 3D object detection. Conventional methods train a class-agnostic 3D object detector by classifying foreground and background predictions, followed by object-level distillation to align object representation with CLIP embedding. However, the split for foreground and background makes the detector overfit on training categories as it penalizes unannotated but correct predictions, and the object-level distillation also lacks semantic information since the class-agnostic detector only focuses on geometric information. To this end, we propose the Generalizable Open-vocabulary Two-stage 3D Detector with Dual Path Distillation (OV-GT3D). This framework effectively detects objects from novel categories and performs open-vocabulary classification with enriched semantics. Specifically, we design a localization-guided proposal generator and a semantic-based ROI discriminator for the Generalizable Two-stage 3D Detector (GT3D). Leveraging the two-stage architecture, we introduce Dual Path Distillation (DPD), which enhances object representations through point-level semantic distillation that aligns 3D point clouds with pixel-aligned CLIP features and point-to-object aggregation that propagates fine-grained semantics from points to object proposals. This makes representations semantic-aware and well-aligned with CLIP embeddings. Comprehensive evaluations on the ScanNet and SUN-RGBD datasets demonstrate that OV-GT3D outperforms prior methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance across a wide array of benchmarks.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, deep learning methods, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs), have achieved remarkable results in the field of medical image segmentation. Most existing medical image segmentation approaches rely on supervised deep learning strategies, utilizing manually annotated labels for training. Currently, numerous researchers are continually advancing the state-of-the-art in various medical image segmentation fields by proposing novel network architectures. However, we have found that, in addition to network architecture, label noise significantly limits segmentation performance. To address the issue of label noise, we propose a plug-and-play teacher-student learning strategy that iteratively redefines training labels, known as RECIST-Based Iterative Label Refinement (RILR). RILR introduces three strategies to refine training labels based on model prediction results: the RECIST-based consistent replacement strategy to prevent model overfitting, the RECIST-based conservative label refinement strategy to reduce false positives, and the RECIST-based radial label refinement strategy to minimize false negatives. Additionally, we present a new refinement loss function for training networks using the refined labels. We conducted experiments using multiple mainstream segmentation networks across three different modality datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed plug-and-play RILR method effectively reduces the impact of label noise on segmentation outcomes and enhances the performance of the segmentation networks.},

  abstract     = {Autonomous vehicle technology (AVT) relies on achieving exceptional safety and reliability, especially under challenging weather conditions such as extreme rain, fog, and clouds. In nature, we observe transitional weather states (e.g., sunny to rainy, rainy to sunny) characterized by dynamic shifts between extreme weather conditions. These dynamic shifts present significant challenges, such as sudden changes in visibility, impairing the efficiency and safety of AVT. Existing research works in AVT have primarily focused on performing scene perception and path planning in clear and distinct weather conditions. However, there is a significant gap in addressing the difficulties posed by transitional weather conditions. Moreover, these studies often overlook the critical aspects of weather forecasting, particularly in transitional weather scenarios. Predicting weather changes is crucial to ensure consistent performance and accurate scene perception in dynamic environmental conditions. Hence, we propose a novel framework called Transitional Weather Forecasting Network (TWFNet), an end-to-end spatiotemporal architecture comprising two main modules, (i) a transformer network with encoder and decoder layers to process CNN-extracted spatial features from image sequences, generating temporal features for the predicted weather transition sequence and (ii) GRU layers with self-attention for classifying the generated temporal features into different transition weather states. These components are trained jointly, providing a robust solution for forecasting transitional weather patterns. Further, we introduce an adverse intermediate weather forecasting driving dataset (AIWFD6) consisting of six transitional weather states such as sunny to foggy, foggy to sunny, sunny to rainy, rainy to sunny, cloudy to rainy, and rainy to cloudy generated using a variational autoencoder that leverages data interpolation to produce transitions. We evaluate the performance of our proposed TWFNet on the introduced AIWFD6 dataset along with a large-scale publicly available simulated continuous weather dataset called SHIFT. Our proposed TWFNet achieves a forecasting performance of 97.46 % and 74.08 % on the AIWFD6 and SHIFT datasets, respectively. These results demonstrate the efficiency of our approach in comparison with other temporal sequence modes for effectively forecasting transitional weather states across different observation sequence lengths.},

  abstract     = {Deep Neural Network-driven Color Constancy (DNNCC) models have advanced significantly in estimating illuminant chromaticity for color correction. However, their susceptibility to brightness variations–a critical factor in color constancy–remains unexplored. Our empirical analysis reveals that state-of-the-art DNNCC models exhibit notable sensitivity to brightness perturbations despite their chromaticity-focused design, potentially compromising performance in real-world scenarios with inherent illumination variability. From the insights of our analysis, we propose a Brightness Robustness Enhancement strategy (BRE) for DNNCC models. BRE employs adaptive step-size adversarial brightness augmentation to identify high-risk brightness variations and generate augmented training samples. Subsequently, BRE develops a brightness-robustness-aware model optimization strategy that integrates adversarial brightness training and brightness contrastive loss, significantly bolstering the brightness robustness of DNNCC models. As a parameter-agnostic plug-in, BRE can be seamlessly integrated into existing DNNCC models, without incurring additional overhead during the testing phase. Experiments on ColorChecker and Cube+ datasets demonstrate that BRE consistently enhances illuminant estimation performance and reduces estimation error by an average of 4.69 % across seven mainstream DNNCC models, highlighting the importance of brightness robustness in advancing color constancy.},

  abstract     = {Computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) technology has become an integral part of early breast cancer diagnosis in medical ultrasound imaging. Nonetheless, the accurate segmentation and classification of breast tumor images continue to pose significant challenges due to the uneven intensity distribution, indistinct boundaries, and the irregular shapes of tumors. A primary reason is that many CAD methods fail to capitalize on the interrelation between tumor segmentation and classification. Furthermore, most existing methods focus on classifying global images or tumor regions of interest (ROIs), often disregarding the interplay between global and local features. This study proposes a segmentation knowledge based global-local attention classification network (SGLA-Net). First, the segment anything model (SAM) is utilized to obtain high-quality segmentation masks from a limited number of annotated samples. Then, global and local feature representations are derived from enhanced images obtained through the segmentation mask. Moreover, a global-local feature interaction (GLFI) block is designed to adaptively integrate global and local information for classification. The proposed method achieved segmentation Dice coefficients of 81.239 % and 80.516 % on the internal and external datasets, respectively. In terms of classification, the method obtained Area Under the Curve (AUC) values of 0.9532 and 0.8521 on the internal and external datasets, surpassing five state-of-the-art breast ultrasound classification methods.},

However, these methods do not effectively utilize diverse domain information that could further improve task performance, despite their emphasis on mitigating domain gaps. In this paper, we propose a novel perspective on Multi-Source Domain Adaptation (MSDA), which involves rationally reorganizing domains to ‘Safeguard’ the Target Domain (StTD) from the decision boundaries of the task. The reorganization procedure consists of two steps: (1) constructing an enclosure with source domains and (2) anchoring the target domain at the center of the enclosure. To avoid causing semantic information loss during the domain feature reorganization, the procedure is conducted in a projected subspace that enhances task-related features. Our proposed StTD approach has demonstrated state-of-the-art results across four MSDA datasets, highlighting its effectiveness.},

Addressing this critical need, we introduce LungConVT-Net, an innovative architecture that blend the strengths of Vision Transformer (ViT) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to delineate among three crucial lung conditions viz., Viral Pneumonia, Bacterial Pneumonia, and COVID-19, as well as normal lung manifestations. The proposed model leverages depthwise separable convolutions, optimizing computational efficiency without sacrificing spatial filtering. Additionally, we integrate the proposed Dynamic Hierarchical Multi-Head Attention Convolution (DH-MHAC) and Adaptive Multi-Granular Multi-Head Attention (AMG-MHA) modules. These modules bridge the self-attention mechanisms with convolutions and utilize non-overlapping patches, culminating in enhanced feature extraction, respectively. A strategically incorporated Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) block within the AMG-MHA refines the model’s prowess in understanding intricate data patterns. The Gradient Connection Enhancers (GCE) capture both long-range and short-range feature dependencies, addressing potential challenges in gradient descent and promoting training stability. Experimental evaluations, spanning from bi-class to complex quad-class combinations, reveal the model’s performance compared to the state-of-the-art models. The results unveil AUC scores consistently surpassing 99 % in most bi-class scenarios and show strong performance in complex multi-class settings, with AUC scores exceeding 99 % for Pneumonia, COVID-19, and Normal categories. Moreover, in the quad-class combination, our model achieves an AUC score of 98.19 %, highlighting LungConVT-Net’s effectiveness in advancing respiratory disease diagnostics.

The range of clustering procedures available in this framework is very limited. Recently, categorical sequences attracted the attention of researchers and several promising methods were developed for univariate sequences. However, observations are often utilized in the form of multivariate categorical sequences. Currently existing methods either impose restrictive and often unrealistic assumptions or reformulate multivariate sequences as univariate ones with a higher number of states, which is often computationally prohibitive even in low-dimensional cases. The contribution of this paper is twofold. First, we explore the concept of inter-sequence transitions and develop a method for modeling their probabilities. Second, we extend the proposed model to the case of heterogeneity, which allows handling challenging real-life scenarios. As we demonstrate through the series of simulation studies, the developed mixture shows good modeling and clustering performance. The applications of the methodology to stylometry and British Household Panel Survey data produce interesting and meaningful results.},

To address this problem, this paper proposed a lightweight zero-shot pixel-level image denoising approach. First, we constructed the lightweight Regional Feature Enhanced Denoising Network (RFED-Net) that greatly reduces the network parameters by focusing on high-noise feature regions. To enable RFED-Net to learn the true values of vertex pixels, we proposed a Vertex-to-Edge pyramid mapping method (VE). Then, the Slope-to-Vertex consistency monitoring strategy (SV) is designed to construct the slope filter. Multilevel noisy images are constructed with slope filters and noise estimation to improve image consistency. Finally, numerous experiments on the Mcmaster18, PolyU, and other datasets prove that the Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) of our method improves by 2.96 % with 28.57 % faster processing compared to lightweight benchmark methods. With the same denoising quality, the image processing speed of our method is improved by 51.22 % compared to other highly complex methods.},

This task, however, is very challenging due to the difficulty in understanding the scene geometry (e.g.disparity map) from a single-view image. Existing methods tackle this task either by warping the estimated scene geometry, or by super-resolution technique. Nevertheless, they may fail due to the inaccurate estimation of scene geometry without the supervision of ground truth and insufficient usage of angular and spatial information of light fields. To address these, we propose a Disparity-Guided Light Field generation (DGLF) paradigm. Specifically, DGLF parallelly generates target light fields and disparity maps which are exploited to guide the generation process to be aware of scene geometry. Moreover, we devise an interactive discriminator that aids in synthesizing a more perceptually realistic light field by capturing the interaction of spatial and angular information. Lastly, based on DGLF and interactive discriminator, we develop a disparity-guided adversarial generative network (DG-GAN) for light field synthesis. We theoretically analyze the generalization performance of DGLF. Extensive experiments on five light field datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of DG-GAN.

However, the widespread presence of deteriorated artifacts and the scarcity of artifact databases make it difficult to train a sketch extraction model. This study develops SemiSketch, a novel semi-supervised framework that extracts clean, coherent sketches from ancient murals. By leveraging a dual-branch learning paradigm, it effectively mitigates challenges such as deterioration artifacts, noise, and data scarcity. SemiSketch innovatively uses a pixel-level reference mechanism as an intermediary “pivot” between deteriorated murals and clean sketches. It decomposes the training process into two branches: an unsupervised branch that transforms murals into sketches, and a supervised branch that refines noiseless line styles through pixel-level correspondences. We introduce a shared CNN-hybrid Vision Transformer generator to integrate the two branches, combining CNN-based transpose self-attention and axial attention to capture local and global information, thereby enhancing the extraction of key lines in murals. Additionally, a gradient frequency compensation module is employed to effectively mitigate noise caused by deterioration artifacts, resulting in more complete and cleaner sketches. Empirical evaluations are conducted on various styles of datasets, including the Fengguo Temple Buddhist frescoes, Dunhuang murals, and Indian murals. Extensive experiments show that SemiSketch substantially outperforms a wide range of baselines and effectively extracts clear and coherent sketches.

  abstract     = {With the rapid growth of video and the demand for similarity search, text-video retrieval has garnered significant attention. Existing methods usually extract features by unified encoders and compute pair-wise similarity. However, most methods employ symmetric cross-entropy loss for contrastive learning, crudely reducing the distance between positives and expanding the distance between negatives. This may ignore some effective information between negatives and lead to learning untrustworthy representations. Besides, by relying solely on constructed feature similarity, these methods often fail to capture the shared semantic information between negatives. To mitigate these problems, we propose a novel Hierarchical Text-to-Video Retrieval based on Relative Similarity, named HTVR. The developed HTVR introduces a relative similarity matrix to replace the traditional contrastive loss. Specifically, to build the relative similarity matrix, we leverage textual descriptions to construct the virtual semantic label features. Then, we can measure the relative similarity between instances based on virtual semantic label features, providing more detailed supervision for cross-modal matching. Moreover, we perform multi-level alignment by aggregating tokens to handle fine-grained semantic concepts with diverse granularity and flexible combinations. The relative similarity is further utilized for intra-modal constraints, preserving shared semantic concepts. Finally, extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets (including MSRVTT, MSVD, and DiDeMo) illustrate that our HTVR can achieve superior performances, demonstrating the efficacy of the proposed method.

Recently, DETR-based models for TAD have been prevailing thanks to their unique benefits. However, transformers demand a huge dataset, and unfortunately data scarcity in TAD causes a severe degeneration. In this paper, we identify two crucial problems from data scarcity: attention collapse and imbalanced performance. To this end, we propose a new pre-training strategy, Long-Term Pre-training (LTP), tailored for transformers. LTP has two main components: 1) class-wise synthesis, 2) long-term pretext tasks. Firstly, we synthesize long-form video features by merging video snippets of a target class and non-target classes. They are analogous to untrimmed data used in TAD, despite being created from trimmed data. In addition, we devise two types of long-term pretext tasks to learn long-term dependency. They impose long-term conditions such as finding second-to-fourth or short-duration actions. Our extensive experiments show state-of-the-art performances in DETR-based methods on ActivityNet-v1.3 and THUMOS14 by a large margin. Moreover, we demonstrate that LTP significantly relieves the data scarcity issues in TAD.},

  abstract     = {In multi-source domain adaptation, challenges include negative transfer caused by feature coupling and the inefficiency of pseudo-label generation. This paper develops a multi-source domain adaptive framework for EEG-based recognition (MSGELP), which integrates a two-stage projection matrix decoupling mechanism and graph-embedded label propagation. The method employs a dynamic source selection mechanism that adaptively selects the top- K most similar source domains based on similarity evaluation across target-source domain pairs, while eliminating latent sources of negative transfer. At the feature decoupling level, a learnable two-stage projection matrix, including a global projection matrix and an alignment projection matrix, is designed to explicitly separate cross-domain knowledge: the global projection matrix extracts common feature spanning multiple domains, while the alignment projection matrix captures domain-specific feature of source-target pairs, preserving discriminative information while avoiding feature entanglement. Furthermore, by constructing a similarity graph of source-target domain pairs and iteratively propagating labels, graph embedding techniques, along with iterative updates to the projection matrices, achieve continuous cross-domain knowledge distillation, effectively improving pseudo-label generation accuracy. Finally, rigorous testing of the cross-subject leave-one-subject-out cross-validation strategy on the SEED-IV and SEED-V datasets achieved classification accuracies of 68.70 % and 63.09 %, respectively. Experimental results indicate that the MSGELP effectively learns a shared subspace, mitigates the negative transfer problem, and outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

  abstract     = {Accurate lower-limb motion recognition is crucial for fields such as sports rehabilitation, smart healthcare, and intelligent monitoring, with wearable sensors being widely applied as a key technological approach. However, current mainstream lower-limb motion recognition methods mainly rely on single-node wearable sensors and improvements in classification models, leading to significant deficiencies in terms of data dimensionality and feature extraction capabilities. To address these issues, this paper proposes a motion recognition method that integrates a flexible sensor array and relative position images. First, a motion capture system using a flexible array sensor was developed, capable of collecting muscle activity data from 16 channels during lower-limb movements, providing rich data support for lower-limb motion recognition. Secondly, a novel relative position image generation method is proposed, which converts array data into grayscale images containing both time and spatial location information, thereby enhancing the feature expression ability of the raw data. Finally, a new network named MCRANet is designed, incorporating multi-scale cascaded residual attention module and cross-feature interaction module, significantly enhancing the feature extraction capability. Experimental results show that the proposed method performs excellently, achieving an accuracy of 97.88 % for lower-limb motion recognition, significantly outperforming existing advanced methods.},

  abstract     = {Data is the cornerstone of deep learning. This paper reveals that the recently-developed Diffusion Model is a scalable data engine for object detection. Existing methods for scaling up detection-oriented data often require manual collection or generative models to obtain target images, followed by data augmentation and labeling to produce training pairs, which are costly, complex, or lacking diversity. To address these issues, we present DiffusionEngine (DE), a data scaling-up engine that provides high-quality detection-oriented training pairs in a single stage. DE consists of a pre-trained diffusion model and an effective Detection-Adapter , contributing to generating scalable, diverse and generalizable detection data in a plug-and-play manner. Detection-Adapter is learned to align the implicit semantic and location knowledge in off-the-shelf diffusion models with detection-aware signals to make better bounding-box predictions. Additionally, we contribute two datasets, i.e. , COCO-DE and VOC-DE , to scale up existing detection benchmarks for facilitating follow-up research. Extensive experiments demonstrate that data scaling-up via DE can achieve significant improvements in diverse scenarios, such as various detection algorithms, self-supervised pre-training, data-sparse, label-scarce, cross-domain, and semi-supervised learning. For example, when using DE with a DINO-based adapter to scaling-up data, mAP is improved by 3.1 % on COCO, 7.6 % on VOC and 11.5 % on Clipart.},

GLKM initially treats each sample as an individual cluster and employs a greedy merging strategy to iteratively merge pairs of clusters, based on minimizing incremental k -means loss. The k -nearest neighbors graph is utilized to focus on local structure and improve efficiency. A red-black tree is employed to directly retrieve merged cluster pairs. GLKM yields deterministic clustering results and does not require random initialization or multiple runs to obtain optimal clustering results. In addition, it avoids producing empty clusters. Experiments on synthetic and benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of GLKM.

  abstract     = {The automated and precise segmentation of medical images is vital for the clinical diagnosis and treatment planning. Recent segmentation networks utilize the self-attention that calculates a global similarity matrix to capture the long-range dependency, which breaks the local limitation in the convolution. However, the quadratic complexity is unbearable when integrating the global context of high-resolution features. Besides, existing researches prefer to propose powerful encoders but neglect to design ingenious decoders. Following the encoder structure to design decoder is difficult to generate precise masks, owing to both difference in functionality. In this paper, we propose a segmentation network CCPNet to avoid mentioned drawbacks. Specifically, we redesign the encoding unit to efficiently blend details and semantics in each scale, and optimize its structure from the standpoint of maximizing the gradient combination. Moreover, we design the decoder that utilizes prior intermediate probability to formulate target contexts and refine decoding features through the spatial reduction cross-attention. Overall, it forms cascade adjustments to enhance the inter-category consistency and the intra-category difference. Our extensive evaluations on three public benchmarks and one self-built dataset, reveal the superiority of our CCPNet in terms of accuracy and complexity. On ACT-1K, our approach obtains best accuracy(76.38 % on mIoU and 85.04 % on mDice) compared to existing typical methods. In applications, we originally establish a standard to quantitatively analyze the tibial dyschondroplasia based on the segmented masks of self-built dataset.

  abstract     = {In partial label learning, the most challenging issue is that the ground-truth labels of training samples are concealed within their respective candidate label sets. Generally, this problem is addressed by disambiguating the candidate label set via manipulating either feature or label space. In this paper, we propose a novel partial label learning algorithm named PLOD that implements the disambiguation process as a semi-supervised clustering problem, enabling the natural utilization of both the structural information in the feature space and weakly supervised labeling information. Specifically, PLOD aims to infer the ground-truth label for each training sample using a tailor-made constrained k -means algorithm. PLOD initiates the cluster center for each class by averaging instances whose candidate label set includes that class. Subsequently, instances are assigned to the nearest class within their candidate label set. The cluster centers are then updated by averaging the instances of each class, followed by a repeated class assignment procedure. These two steps are iteratively performed until convergence. After that, a one-versus-one decomposition is employed to solve the resulting problem, treating the assigned class for each training sample as ground-truth. Finally, PLOD aggregates the related predictive outputs of the one-versus-one decomposition for each class to derive the final prediction. Experimental results on both artificial and real-world partial label data sets demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed PLOD algorithm.

  abstract     = {On datasets with noisy labels, the deep neural network will overfit the noisy labels, which will weaken the generalization of the model. Related studies show that deep neural networks have the characteristic of memorizing clean data first and then noisy data. Regularization and small loss algorithms exploit the memory characteristics of the network to improve its noise immunity. However, they tend to ignore some clean samples or require additional hyperparameters, and lack control over the direction of network parameter updates. In this paper, we propose a continual learning time-varying regularization (CLTR) based robust classification method for noisy label images. Specifically, learning with noisy label is considered as a continual learning process. By introducing the parameter processing method in catastrophic forgetting, the training parameters of the network are decomposed into clean and noisy parameters. In CLTR, the update direction of clean and noisy parameters is controlled by regularization terms with time-varying coefficients. The time-varying coefficient comes from the initial prediction of the network, which truly reflects the dynamic influence of noisy labels on the network and avoids the setting of hyperparameters. It greatly reduces the complexity of network training and improves its applicability in practice. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world benchmarks confirm the superior performance of the proposed method. The code will be released at https://github.com/vpsg-research/CLTR .},

  abstract     = {Saliency maps are widely used as a post-hoc approach to explain the decision-making process of Deep Learning (DL) based image classification models, but evaluating their fidelity remains a complex problem. While saliency metrics have been introduced to evaluate the fidelity of saliency maps, existing saliency metrics, such as perturbation-based saliency metrics, have been previously reported to demonstrate statistical inconsistency. Although inconsistencies have been noted in different works, there exists no mechanism for estimating the same, i.e., Inconsistency Estimation (IE). Our primary objective is to address this limitation, and therefore, we propose a framework to estimate the inconsistency of saliency metrics for any given DL model. The framework enables building IE models for estimating the inconsistency by employing a set of perturbation types and schemes. The framework’s modular architecture provides flexibility across (i) perturbation types (Inpainting, Uniform, and Gaussian blur), (ii) perturbation schemes (pixel-wise and patch-wise), (iii) learning mechanisms (Convolutional Neural Networks and Vision Transformers) and (iv) IE modeling techniques (bagging and boosting). Extensive experimental results are shown on three well-known DL architectures (Inception-V3, Xception, and ResNet-50) on three different public datasets, including the Imagenette, Oxford-IIIT Pets Dataset, and PASCAL VOC 2007, along with results on ViTs for Oxford-IIIT Pets Dataset, and PASCAL VOC 2007. With a comprehensive evaluation of seven different perturbation types that include two inpainting, two Gaussian blur (with kernel widths of 0.9 and 1.5), and three uniform perturbations, our work shows the effectiveness of the proposed approach in estimating inconsistency. Statistically founded tests such as repeated cross-validation and the Permutation Test further validate the idea of the proposed framework for estimating the inconsistency of saliency metrics across unseen perturbations, making it useful in real-world scenarios.},

This would yield insufficient cross-modal information exploitation, thus resulting in inaccurate localization or incomplete segmentation of salient objects. To address such issues, in this paper, we reconsider the two imperative stages of RGB-D SOD, namely object localization and object segmentation, and propose a novel Bias Constraint Network (BCNet) to mitigate fusion bias for better saliency prediction. In the object localization stage, our new Common Information Mining (CIM) module explores shared semantic information in both RGB and depth data to reduce semantic bias and accurately locate objects. In the object segmentation stage, a Regional Confidence Generation (RCG) and a Fusion and Decoupling module (FDM) work together to select more reliable information from each modality and ensure effective integration of unimodal data into fused features. This minimizes reliance on a single modality, like RGB data, enabling BCNet to effectively use information from each modality for complete salient object segmentation. These three components create a nested structure to address biased fusion challenges, ultimately boosting RGB-D SOD performance. Experimental results across challenging datasets demonstrate the superiority of our model over some state-of-the arts.},

In order to address it, this paper proposes a new incremental mechanism to construct a sequence of residual operators with norm convergence for BLS, and this new learning system is called the broad residual learning system (BRLS). It is proved that he norm convergence of the residual operators can prevent network performance deterioration with the progress of network learning to effectively mitigate the degradation problem. Also, the basic BRLS and three incremental BRLS networks (adding enhancement nodes, feature nodes, and input data) are introduced to satisfy the various scenarios requirements. By the analysis and comparison of time complexity between BRLS and BLS, one can show the novel BRLS incremental mechanism has great advantages of fast computing speed and frugal computing memory. In addition, the convergence theorem and universal approximation property of BRLS are proved to ensure the feasibility and effectiveness.

Two primary limitations persist: (1) insufficient semantic perception, introducing artifacts in degraded regions, and (2) the inability to explicitly infer depth cues, leading to over-sharpening in focused areas and inadequate restoration in defocused regions. To address these issues, we propose MDDF-SIDD, a novel two-stage framework that combines multimodal-guided diffusion and depth-aware fusion for single-image defocus deblurring. In the first stage, we construct a multimodal representation by integrating fidelity-aware image features with blur-adaptive prompt features. This representation guides a pretrained text-to-image diffusion model to achieve high perceptual quality with precise structural and semantic alignment. In the second stage, we exploit depth priors to generate a depth-adaptive weight map, distinguishing focused regions from defocused ones. This enables a Laplacian pyramid-based fusion strategy, which adaptively blends sharp details from the original image with the refined estimation from the first stage, ensuring both local detail preservation and global consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MDDF-SIDD outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both quantitative metrics and perceptual fidelity, setting a new benchmark for defocus deblurring.},

Specifically, KDConv adaptively determines the most suitable kernel from the filter pool in each spatial location through a kernel-aware module. In the filter pool, we set multiple shared filters with different size and offset parameters. The kernel-aware module builds the dependency between these kernels and generates the index map for selection. Our design of kernel-aware dynamic size and offset is specifically advantageous for dense prediction including object detection and instance segmentation.

This approach leverages a multi-modal latent topic space to represent topics and is pre-trained with unlabeled video data. Then, in the second training stage, the MultiTopClus model is frozen, and a diffusion model is applied to effectively reconstruct a multi-modal feature representation which is a combination of two kinds of input features: topical features generated by the topic model, and original features used in an existing multi-modal sarcasm detection model. Finally, the reconstructed feature representation of each modality is fed to the existing multi-modal sarcasm detection network to make sarcasm predictions. Systematic experiments are carried out on twelve existing multi-modal sarcasm detection models and two multi-modal sarcasm datasets (a video-based dataset and a tweet-based dataset). The experimental results reveal a notable improvement in overall performance across twelve baseline sarcasm detection models. These findings highlight the effectiveness of our proposed approach.},

  abstract     = {To effectively tackle long-tailed visual data classification, we propose a new classification method based on explicit and implicit feature augmentation framework with knowledge distillation called EIFA-KD. The explicit augmentation divides the contextual semantic features into class-relevant and class-irrelevant features, and synthesizes the virtual features by aggregating these two features from different samples. This can enhance the diversity of the tail classes and alleviate class imbalance. The implicit augmentation models the augmented range of a tail class sample feature as a mixture of multiple Gaussian distributions, and adaptively transfers distribution information of multiple support-classes to samples of tail classes so as to enlarge tail sample range and further enrich tail samples. In addition, we design a multi-sub-branch network based on knowledge distillation to generate high-quality features by aggregating the multiple sub-branches. Experimental results show that the proposed model outperforms several state-of-the-art models on four widely used benchmarks.},

However, many clustering algorithms encounter challenges that compromise their effectiveness and the accuracy of data grouping. This paper addresses three key challenges faced by most algorithms: (1) parameter setting, (2) data convexity, and (3) data separation. The proposed algorithm leverages density-based methods to identify and remove border points, effectively separating data sets. A hierarchical, single-linkage-based algorithm is then applied to the remaining points to generate the main clusters. Finally, the border points are reintegrated into the formed clusters. Experimental results demonstrate that the algorithm is capable of handling both convex and non-convex, as well as well-separated and poorly-separated, data sets. The impact of parameter settings on clustering outcomes is thoroughly investigated. Additionally, further experiments on real-world data sets reveal that the consistency of clustering results with classification labels strongly depends on an appropriate measure of sample similarity.},

  abstract     = {Skeleton-based action recognition has broad promising applications in the field of rehabilitation training. Accurate action recognition ensures that patients can perform rehabilitation training action accurately, thus improving the rehabilitation efficacy and reducing the risk of secondary injuries. Previous works have successfully applied graph convolution to skeleton-based action recognition, achieving excellent performance with the prior knowledge of human structures. However, graph convolutional network struggle to capture dynamic high-order correlations in human action due to it only reliance on fixed topological structure and express the adjacent joints relationship, limiting it ability to model complex and action-dependent joint correlations. To break through the above limitations, we innovatively propose a Topology-adaptive Hypergraph Transformer Network (THTFormer). THTFormer consists of a Topology-adaptive Hypergraph Convolutional module (THC) and a Hypergraph Self-Attention module (HSA). THC integrates human body topology prior knowledge to capture high-order joint correlations and adaptively adjust for different inputs. HSA is used to obtain global dependencies between joints. Besides, we design a Contrastive Learning Branch (CLB) based on intra-class and inter-class calibration to optimize local action representations and improve action recognition for similar human topology structures. Extensive experiments demonstrate that THTFormer achieves current open source state-of-the-art performances on three benchmark datasets (NTU RGB+D 60, NTU RGB+D 120 and NW-UCLA).},

Although uniformity for each view is enforced, the hidden spatial structure remains unexploited. To address this limitation, we propose an interpretable multi-view clustering method, IMVATC, embedded within a unified learning framework. IMVATC employs a novel density peak clustering (NDPC) strategy to select anchor points cross-view and adaptively learns anchor graphs for each view. Decomposing the anchor tensor formed by stacking anchor graphs produces consistent clustering results without the need for post-processing. A tensor low-rank constraint and cross-view local manifold mining further preserve the intrinsic structure of the data. We develop an efficient algorithm and rigorously prove its convergence based on the KKT condition. Experimental results across multiple real-world datasets demonstrate that IMVATC outperforms current leading multi-view clustering methods.},

For instance, ASER is crucial to understanding the underlying decision-making in real-world applications such as mental health monitoring systems. Researchers, therefore, have focused attention on advancing the interpretability and explainability of ASER models. Interpretability maximizes human understanding of complex processes by providing meaningful insights. Explainability presents the interpretable insights in a clear and human-understandable manner. Some standard interpretability methods include feature importance, feature selection methods, and attention models. Explainability methods include SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), visualizations using embedding plots, saliency maps, etc., and feature importance analysis.

Therefore, the common and individual components of each domain should be extracted for data analysis. From this perspective, we propose a novel joint low-rank and sparse components extraction (JLSC) method which combines aspects of both feature extraction and transfer learning, using three different matrices to extract different feature components. Specifically, the information-rich component is extracted by introducing the PCA-like matrix, and the common and individual components are learned by extracting the low-rank feature and column-sparsity feature, respectively. We developed an efficient augmented Lagrange multiplier-based optimization algorithm, which integrates projected matrix rank and sparsity constraints.

The routing mechanism connects capsules in consecutive layers, forming a hierarchical structure between parts and objects, also known as a parse tree. Capsule networks often attempt to model all elements in an image, requiring large network sizes to handle complexities such as intricate backgrounds or irrelevant objects. However, this comprehensive modeling leads to increased parameter counts and computational inefficiencies. Our goal is to enable capsule networks to focus only on the object of interest, reducing the number of parse trees. We accomplish this with REM (Routing Entropy Minimization), a technique that minimizes the entropy of the parse tree-like structure. REM drives the model parameters distribution towards low entropy configurations through a pruning mechanism, significantly reducing the generation of intra-class parse trees. This empowers capsules to learn more stable and succinct representations with fewer parameters and negligible performance loss.},

However, in the field of neuroscience, brain imaging often lacks semantic labels, making the construction of multi-modal medical corpus challenging. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), a commonly used brain imaging, can be employed to study functional brain networks and perform classification to obtain labels. Moreover, due to limited data samples, developing graph foundation model for brain network classification is important. We propose a multi-level graph self-supervised learning (MLGSL) method, which performs multi-level pretraining tasks to uncover disease-related correlation patterns. This graph foundation model is then used to classify brain networks to obtain semantic labels. Additionally, by integrating the potential biomarkers with relevant textual matched through large language model, a multi-modal medical corpus can be constructed. Specifically, MLGSL first conducts a functional brain network link prediction task at the individual level, and a population-level link prediction task on the population-associated network. In the encoder part of pretraining task, the proposed multi-channel enhanced attention graph convolution strengthens the attention mechanism via connection strength, while integrating visible node representations learned from different perspectives. Subsequently, MLGSL performs category prediction of functional brain networks through fine-tuning. Experiments demonstrate that MLGSL achieves optimal brain network classification performance, thereby enabling the acquisition of accurate semantic labels. By combining brain imaging data with key textual information, a multi-modal medical corpus can be constructed, providing important value for interpretation of pathological information and clinical diagnosis of diseases.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, the image acquired by camera devices usually has millions of pixels, but most traditional denoising methods mainly focus on improving the quality of denoising results and not able to remove noise from high resolution image in a reasonable time. For an efficient and fast large scale RGB image denoising method, we propose multi-resolution based adaptive Guided Filter in this work. First we analyse the performance of Guided Filter in denoising task and indicate that using the noisy image to interpolate its guidance image may improve the PSNR of denoising result under certain conditions. Then we propose the estimation scheme for local noise intensity in RGB image and obtain ancillary image through weighted sum across the color channels. The overall denoising process is conducted under multiple resolutions and consists of two stages. The ancillary image is denoised in stage one and used as guidance to remove noise in RGB image in stage two. Under each resolution, in ancillary image denoising, the developed method uses the interpolation between noisy image and up-sampling result of lower resolution denoised image as the guidance to perform Guided Filter, while in RGB image denoising, the interpolation is performed on the image to be filtered instead of its guidance. Numerical experiments on mainstream denoising datasets show that the proposed method is a hundred times faster than NLH and even faster than deep learning based methods which performed on GPU, while the PSNR of overall denoising results is only slightly lower.},

AUDI-T employs a two-stage unsupervised learning framework that transfers identity knowledge from still images to key video frames, and subsequently to neighboring frames, ensuring a consistent identity across all frames. Extensive experiments on seven benchmark datasets demonstrate that AUDI-T significantly surpasses state-of-the-art UVT methods, achieving more than 10 % improvement in precision on the large-scale TrackingNet dataset.

  abstract     = {This paper rigorously solves the challenging problem of recognizing periodic patterns under rigid motion in Euclidean geometry. The 3-dimensional case is practically important for justifying the novelty of solid crystalline materials (periodic crystals) and for patenting medical drugs in a solid tablet form. Past descriptors based on finite subsets fail when a unit cell of a periodic pattern discontinuously changes under almost any perturbation of atoms, which is inevitable due to noise and atomic vibrations. The major problem is not only to find complete invariants (descriptors with no false negatives and no false positives for all periodic patterns) but to design efficient algorithms for distance metrics on these invariants that should continuously behave under noise. The proposed continuous metrics solve this problem in any Euclidean dimension and are algorithmically approximated with small error factors in times that are explicitly bounded in the size and complexity of a given pattern. The proved Lipschitz continuity allows us to confirm all near-duplicates filtered by simpler invariants in major databases of experimental and simulated crystals. This practical detection of noisy duplicates will stop the artificial generation of ‘new’ materials from slight perturbations of known crystals. Several such duplicates are under investigation by five journals for data integrity.},

The core concept lies on leveraging the thin structure property to generate a robust crack cue, guiding the crack detection. Specifically, we first employ a simple max-pooling and upsampling operation on the crack image. This results in a coarse crack-free background, based on which a fine crack-free background can be obtained via a reconstruction network. The difference between the original image and fine crack-free background provides a fine crack cue. This fine cue embeds robust crack prior information which is unaffected by complex backgrounds, shadow, and varied lighting. As a plug-and-play method, we incorporate the proposed CrackCue into three advanced crack detection networks. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed CrackCue significantly improves the generalization ability and robustness of the baseline methods.

This restricts their application in devices with limited computational resources. While existing lightweight RGB-D SOD networks possess fewer parameters, they tend to exhibit relatively modest detection performance. To address this issue, we are focused on designing a lightweight RGB-D SOD network that maintains high detection performance while minimizing the number of parameters. To this end, we propose a lightweight and efficient network for RGB-D SOD, termed LESOD. Considering the significance of cross-modal information interaction in RGB-D SOD, we introduce the cross-modal integration module (CIM) to fuse semantic relationships between RGB and depth images. Furthermore, to effectively reduce the interference from the background and accurately decode distinct saliency maps from the multi-dimensional fused feature maps, we integrate high-level semantic information with low-level detail features and construct the multi-level feature enhancement module (MFEM). The LESOD has 2.9M parameters, a computational complexity of 3.3 GFLOPs, an inference speed of 101.2 FPS on GPU, and 16.4 FPS on CPU. Experimental results on 7 datasets show that LESOD obtains superior detection performance compared to 15 state-of-the-art RGB-D SOD methods.

Current 6-DoF grasp pose detection methods generally directly utilize existing point cloud feature extraction backbones. The focus of current approaches is primarily on designing more effective grasp pose parameter detection heads or tricks to predict 6-DoF grasp poses from the extracted features, often overlooking the critical role of the backbone network in achieving high-precision grasp pose detection. To address this, we propose an end-to-end point cloud serialized attention-based 6-DoF grasp pose detection (PSAGrasp) algorithm, which leverages attention mechanism to optimize the point cloud feature extraction process, thereby further improving the accuracy of grasp pose detection. Specifically, we serialize the unordered point cloud using space-filling curve and design a multi-encoder and -decoder cascaded serialized point cloud feature extraction backbone network based on the Transformer architecture to effectively extract point cloud features. On this basis, we propose a grasp pose detection head specifically designed for 6-DoF grasp pose detection. Furthermore, to ensure that the predicted grasp poses conform to real-world physical principle, we integrate a forced constraint based on the antipodal grasping rule into the predicted poses. The experimental results demonstrate that the detection accuracy of our algorithm has significantly improved on the GraspNet-1Billion benchmark, achieving the state-of-the-art performance. In addition, our algorithm achieved an 87.88 % grasp success rate on unseen objects in real-world Franka robot experiments. Our code is available at: https://github.com/upc-ghy/PSAGrasp .},

Therefore, visual emotion analysis (VEA) has attracted significant attention from scholars all over the world. However, emotion is a highly subjective concept that can be influenced by various attributes of the image, such as color, brightness, faces, objects, scenes and so on. These attributes are associated with the process of human cognitive emotion and they are present not only in the global features, but also in the local features. However, most existing methods rely solely on global features for classification. Some methods focus on shallow local features, but the obtained information is not comprehensive enough. In order to comprehensively extract the emotion-related attribute information in images, we propose an Attribute-Driven Deep Learning Network (AttDNet). This network comprises an attribute branch with multiple modules and a facial branch that can obtain facial attribute. The modules in the attribute branch focus on various attribute information in the image. Among them, CSCAM module can extract color information and key objects in the image, LEconv module can extract context information of objects in images, and MLPooling module can extract scene information in images. In addition, to bring samples of the same emotional category closer together, we use CenterLoss to constraint the model.

Deep MIL approaches have obtained promising results by aggregating instance-level representations via an attention mechanism to compute the bag-level prediction. These methods typically capture both local interactions among adjacent instances and global, long-range dependencies through various mechanisms. However, they treat attention values deterministically, potentially overlooking uncertainty in the contribution of individual instances. In this work we propose a novel probabilistic framework that estimates a probability distribution over the attention values, and accounts for both global and local interactions. In a comprehensive evaluation involving eleven state-of-the-art baselines and three medical datasets, we show that our approach achieves top predictive performance in different metrics.

Many MARL methods use graph neural networks (GNNs) to build a communication learning framework where agents and communication channels can be represented as nodes and edges in a graph. However, most GNN-based MARL methods simply aggregate features of neighboring agents to obtain message representations, which may not extract enough useful information. To tackle this problem, this paper investigates how to extract expressive information from neighboring agents to obtain high-quality message representations. Inspired by the recent success of contrastive learning methods, in this paper, we propose a m ulti- a gent communication protocol via g raph contrastiv e learning (MAGE), which utilizes contrast objectives to learn optimal message representations, considering feature and topological level. At the feature level, we corrupt agent features by adding more noise to insignificant neighboring agent features, to encourage the agent to recognize significant information. At the topological level, we adaptively remove edges by assigning larger removal probabilities to insignificant edges to highlight significant communication structures. Experiments across diverse benchmarks confirm that MAGE outperforms existing GNN-based MARL methods.},

  abstract     = {Currently, an increasing number of video transmissions are focusing primarily on downstream machine vision tasks rather than on human vision. While the widely deployed human visual system (HVS)-oriented video coding standards such as H.265/HEVC and H.264/AVC are efficient, they are not the optimal approaches for video coding for machines (VCM) scenarios, leading to unnecessary bitrate expenditures. Academic and technical explorations within the VCM domain have led to the development of several strategies; however, conspicuous limitations remain in their adaptability to multitask scenarios. To address this challenge, we propose a Transformable Video Feature Compression (TransVFC) framework. It offers a compress-then-transfer solution and includes a video feature codec and feature space transform (FST) modules. In particular, the temporal redundancy of video features is squeezed by the codec through a scheme-based inter-prediction module. Then, the codec implements perception-guided conditional coding to minimize spatial redundancy and help the reconstructed features align with the downstream machine perception process. Subsequently, the reconstructed features are transferred to new feature spaces for diverse downstream tasks by the FST modules. To accommodate a new downstream task, only one lightweight FST module needs to be trained, avoiding the need to retrain and redeploy the upstream codec and downstream task networks. Experiments show that TransVFC achieves high rate-task performance for diverse tasks at different granularities. We expect our work to provide valuable insights for video feature compression in multitask scenarios. The codes are available at https://github.com/Ws-Syx/TransVFC .},

Recent studies have shown that orthogonal LoRA tuning effectively mitigates forgetting. However, this work unveils that under orthogonal LoRA tuning, the critical parameters for pre-tasks still change notably after learning post-tasks. To address this problem, we directly propose freezing the most critical parameter matrices in the Vision Transformer (ViT) for pre-tasks before learning post-tasks. In addition, building on orthogonal LoRA tuning, we propose orthogonal LoRA composition (LoRAC) based on QR decomposition, which may further enhance the plasticity of our method. Elaborate ablation studies and extensive comparisons demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method. Our results indicate that our method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on several well-known continual learning benchmarks.

  abstract     = {This paper presents a novel Diffusion Condition Guided Unified Gradient-Flow-Based GAN Framework model. Recently, researchers have proposed many deep generative models, including generative adversarial networks (GAN) and denoising diffusion models. Different from the common GAN model with empirical success but less theoretical explanation, gradient-flow-based GAN models offer better theoretical explanations, but they exhibit worse empirical results. To address this problem, we propose the Diffusion Condition Guided U nified G radient Flow Based GAN model, termed UGGAN, which incorporates a diffusion process as the condition with various gradient-flow-based GAN models. Crucially, we provide a theoretical foundation for formulating the UGGAN, ensuring it maintains the same convergence as the original gradient-flow-based GAN. Furthermore, we propose self-supervised conditions that utilize the accumulated gradient flow F m as the condition for the gradient-flow-based GAN generator, significantly influencing the diversity of synthesized samples. Additionally, we proposed that the diffusion condition can work as an early stop regularization for the gradient-flow-based model. Finally, we demonstrate the algorithms for the UGGAN, which contains various types of gradient-flow-based GAN models. Thanks to the diffusion condition, UGGAN surpasses the limitations of the current gradient-flow-based GAN and can generate diverse and high-fidelity samples. In our extensive experiments on various benchmark datasets for image generation, the UGGAN method has shown significant improvement in both the quality and diversity of the synthesized samples compared to the original gradient-flow-based GAN. Additionally, our UGGAN has produced competitive synthesis samples when compared to state-of-the-art generative models.},

  abstract     = {In real-world scenarios, imaging devices are inevitably affected by adverse weather conditions, which degrade the performance of downstream vision tasks. Although diffusion models are effective in removing adverse weather effects, their restoration performance is hindered by limitations in the noise estimation network and insufficient utilization of degradation-specific information. Recently, State Space Models (SSMs) have outperformed Transformers in both performance and efficiency. However, their scanning strategies fail to ensure spatial continuity and overlook cross-channel interactions. In this paper, we propose a new all-in-one adverse weather removal framework, named Weather-DiffMamba. Specifically, we design a Degradation-Aware Mamba to extract degradation-aware features, which are converted into prompts to guide the restoration process. Additionally, we propose a spatial and channel-based scanning strategy with 10 scanning directions to enhance the ability to capture long-range dependencies and cross-channel interactions. Extensive experiments validate the superior performance of our method over multiple state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods in all-in-one adverse weather removal, as well as its effectiveness in real-world scenarios.},

  abstract     = {Currently, fully supervised methods based on density map estimation are the primary research directions for crowd counting. However, such methods require the location-level annotations of persons in an image, which is time-consuming and laborious. Therefore, a weakly supervised method relying only on count-level annotations is urgently required. As a CNN is not suitable for modelling the global context and interactions between image patches, crowd counting with weakly supervised learning via a CNN generally does not provide good performance. A weakly supervised model using Transformer was sequentially proposed to model the global context and learn the contrast features. However, the Transformer directly partitions crowd images into a series of tokens, which may not be a good choice because each pedestrian is an independent individual, and the number of parameters of the network is very large. Hence, in this study, we propose a weakly supervised crowd counting method using Joint CNN and Transformer Network (JCTNet). JCTNet consists of three parts: a CNN feature extraction module (CFM), a Transformer feature extraction module (TFM), and a counting regression module (CRM). In particular, the CFM extracts crowd semantic information features and then sends their patch partitions to the TFM to model the global context. The CRM is used to predict the number of people. Extensive experiments and visualisations demonstrate that JCTNet can effectively focus on crowded regions and obtain superior performance in weakly supervised counting on five mainstream datasets, i.e., ShanghaiTech Parts A and B, UCF-QNRF, UCF-CC-50, and NWPU-Crowd. The number of parameters of the model can be reduced by approximately 67–73 % compared with that of a pure Transformer network. We also attempted to explain the phenomenon in which a model constrained only by count-level annotations can focus on crowded regions. We believe that our study can promote further research on weakly supervised crowd counting as well as any object counting. The code is available at https://github.com/wfs123456/JCTnet .},

  abstract     = {Image restoration and enhancement are pivotal for numerous computer vision applications; however, efficiently unifying these tasks remains a significant challenge. Inspired by the iterative refinement capabilities of diffusion models, we propose CycleRDM, a novel framework designed to unify restoration and enhancement tasks while achieving high-quality mapping. Specifically, CycleRDM first learns the mapping relationships among the degraded domain, the rough normal domain, and the normal domain through a two-stage diffusion inference process. We subsequently transfer the final calibration process to the wavelet low-frequency domain via the discrete wavelet transform, performing fine-grained calibration from a frequency domain perspective by leveraging task-specific frequency spaces. To improve the restoration quality, we design a feature gain module for the decomposed wavelet high-frequency domain to eliminate redundant features. Additionally, we employ multimodal textual prompts and the Fourier transform to drive stable denoising and reduce randomness during the inference process. After extensive validation, CycleRDM can be effectively generalized to a wide range of image restoration and enhancement tasks while requiring only a small number of training samples to be significantly superior on various benchmarks of reconstruction quality and perceptual quality.

Therefore, many cross-modal hashing (CMH) methods have been proposed and performed well. However, most existing CMH methods treat all samples equally without discrimination, which may lead to suboptimal local minima. Besides, most existing approaches usually leverage modality-specific information when learning hashing functions, which cannot effectively capture both intra-and inter-modality correlations in multimodal data. To mitigate these problems, a novel Robust Self-Paced hashing (RSPH) approach is developed for cross-modal retrieval. Concretely, in the proposed RSPH, the multimodal data are progressively integrated into the hashing learning process from easy to hard, helping to avoid poor local minima. Besides, the ℓ 2 , 1 -norm is employed in the proposed method to further reduce the impact of outliers and noise. To fully exploit multimodal information, this method introduces a collaboration projection scheme that captures both modality-specific properties and cross-modal correlations, resulting in more effective hash functions. Experimental results on three benchmark datasets validate our RSPH can achieve state-of-the-art performance, demonstrating its efficacy.},

To address these limitations, we propose a novel 3D portrait stylization framework that decomposes the task into three independent subproblems: controlled generation, geometric stylization, and texture stylization. By leveraging GAN latent codes as conditional inputs, our approach simultaneously achieves multi-style generation and attribute manipulation without compromising geometric or textural fidelity.

This paper seeks to bridge this gap by introducing Gaussian adaptations to two MPM variants: the Robust Maximum Margin Classifier (RMMC) and the Cobb–Douglas Learning Machine (CD-LeMa), resulting in three novel methodologies that function as optimal Bayes classifiers. An extensive empirical comparison of various MPM variants, considering both robust and Gaussian cases, provides valuable insights into their predictive capabilities. The proposed Gaussian versions of the MPM models achieve the best performance in 71% of cases, with the RMMC variant emerging as the top approach (an average rank of 2.32 among 10 classifiers, with 1 being the top-ranked method on a given dataset). The Gaussian variants excel primarily in medium-sized datasets (1000 samples or more) and, for the MEMPM, RMMC, and CD-LeMa methods, perform better than their robust counterparts in 90% of cases.},

The benefits of discovering and predicting intricate patterns (aka regimes) in time sequences are multifold, including better understanding of the ecosystem dynamics, optimizing model selection, and improving interpretability of results. Despite recent advancements, existing methods primarily emphasize predictive accuracy, which might overshadow the need to comprehend the structural dynamics within the series. Additionally, these methods often encounter one or more of the following limitations: (1) difficulty in identifying regimes within domain-dependent segmentations; (2) inability to integrate nonlinear relationships across time series; (3) lack of an effective method to encapsulate the temporal behaviors. To tackle these challenges, we introduce a twin learning regime-switch model to simultaneously learn domain-agnostic segmentation and regime switch in a principled way. Specifically, we devise a kernel-based method that determines the duration of regime and captures dynamic switches through potent representations, accounting for the non-linear interactions between series. With this model, it is feasible to automatically achieve the two subtasks of identifying the optimal regimes and determining the most suitable segmentation. Experimental results on synthetic and real-world datasets indicate that our method is capable of revealing the structures that underpin the behavior of co-evolving ecosystems, which display different dynamics. These structures can be leveraged to better define regimes with superior predictive capabilities compared to widely used traditional models and state-of-the-art neural network models.},

First, two auxiliary transformations are elaborated that explicitly capture intermodal dependencies: the shallow transformation consolidates spatial intricacies, while the high-dimensional counterpart delves into deep feature extraction through enriched channel representations. Second, based on a meticulous analysis of the non-uniform frequency distribution in the low- and high-frequency components of the mask, we design a new unrolling paradigm that leverages a progressive masking scheme, integrating a dilation–contraction mechanism to dynamically regulate learnable frequency regions during the forward propagation across successive stages. Comprehensive experiments, spanning diverse sampling patterns, acceleration rates, generalization tests, and ablation studies, demonstrate that our approach, without reliance on complex architectures, consistently surpasses state-of-the-art methods in both visual fidelity and quantitative metrics.

Current methods are mainly divided into two categories: landmark-based detection and template-based deformation. While landmark-driven methods demonstrate efficiency, their measurement accuracy heavily relies on precise landmark localization that proves vulnerable to point cloud noise and missing data. Conversely, template-based approaches require computationally intensive iterative optimization to align parametric models with target scans, exhibiting similar sensitivity to data imperfections. To overcome these limitations, we propose ABM (Automatic Body Measurement) - an automatic framework integrating template-driven landmark detection with topology-aware B-spline approximation. ABM consists of three core components: (1) A deformation-based landmark detection module that establishes anatomical correspondence through non-rigid template registration, (2) A contour reconstruction pipeline employing concave envelope analysis to organize disordered point clouds into ordered measurement loops, and (3) A neural B-spline approximation module that automatically generates topology-compliant control points through learned geometric priors. Notably, our neural B-spline formulation enables continuous surface characterization while maintaining anthropometric validity, overcoming the discrete measurement limitations of conventional spline fitting. Our method achieves outstanding results on unordered point clouds of “A” pose and “T” pose, eliminating the dependence on parameterized human bodies.},

In this paper, we propose the OBject-Embedding Predictive Alignment (OBEPA) for SSOD by introducing embedding predictor and object-embedding contrastive learning. The embedding predictor is performed by adding a small convolutional network in the student branch before embedding alignment, which can reduce the discrepancy in embeddings between the teacher and student branches. Object-embedding contrastive learning is applied by proposing a balanced hierarchical embedding clustering and an object-aware InfoNCE loss to enhance the discriminability of the embedding at the object level. Specifically, in the student branch and the teacher branch, we respectively group all pixel-level representations within one image into multiple clusters. The positive contrastive samples of each pixel embedding in the student branch come from the corresponding embedding in the teacher branch, while the negative contrastive samples are sampled from other embedding clusters. Evaluation of the proposed method on two SSOD benchmarks, including MS-COCO and Pascal VOC demonstrates its superiority against the previous state-of-the-art approaches.},

To characterize morphological changes, we use VAR model parameters for model comparison, synthesis, and sequence classification. Leveraging these parameters, along with machine learning classifiers, we achieve high classification accuracy. Extensive experiments on cell motility data validate our approach, demonstrating its effectiveness in modeling and classifying migrating cells based on morphological evolution—marking a novel contribution to the field.},

  abstract     = {Existing deep learning-based (DL-based) methods to tackle the task of simultaneous low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) reconstruction and metal artifact reduction (MAR), i.e. LDMAR, have achieved significant successes, but they still face the following limitations: ( i ) for multiple dose levels, previous one-by-one training strategy consumes storage cost, limiting their clinical applications. Universal models which train one model for multiple dose levels can save storage cost, but they lack specific prompt information, leading to suboptimal reconstructions; ( ii ) most model architectures are black-box, and ignore multi-scale information, limiting their interpretability and representation ability. To address these issues, we propose the so-called PMDeepST, a visual and text prompts guided multi-scale deep sparsifying transform network. Specifically, we design a multi-scale deep sparsifying transform architecture whose backbone network inherits interpretability of deep sparse representation model, and integrate a fusion module to exploit cross-scale complementarity. Most importantly, for adaptively shrinking representation coefficients on each scale, we propose a visual and text prompts guided shrinkage (ProS) subnetwork. ProS incorporates both visual and text prompts to guide training of the model, assisting to learn discriminant information between different noise levels. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed universal method can allow a single model to accommodate various CT dose settings, and outperforms the state-of-the-art LDMAR methods.},

  abstract     = {Current unsupervised multi-view feature selection methods exhibit critical limitations in capturing high-level semantics and modeling high-order consistency across views. These methods rely on low-level features derived from raw data or shallow nonnegative matrix factorization, often resulting in suboptimal data structure extraction. Moreover, conventional methods linearly align data views, ignoring high-order consistency. Although certain approaches employ low-rank tensor techniques to capture high-order consistency, they treat all data views as equally important and fail to fully exploit the complementary information of multi-view data. To address these issues, this paper proposes DCVSG (High-order Aligned D eep C omplementary and V iew-specific S imilarity G raphs for Unsupervised Multi-view Feature Selection). First, DCVSG employs deep semi-nonnegative matrix factorization to hierarchically extract view-specific semantic features, which are subsequently fused into deep complementary representations through intact latent space learning. Second, the model concurrently learns local similarity structures within the deep complementary view (represented by the deep complementary representations) and individual data views. To achieve high-order alignment between the deep complementary and data views, a view-weighted tensor nuclear norm, which dynamically assigns weights to different views, is further introduced. Extensive experiments conducted on seven benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed DCVSG.

Traditional approaches, such as sparse subspace clustering (SSC) and low-rank representation (LRR), typically tackle the SC problem through a two-step process involving affinity matrix construction followed by spectral clustering, which often results in suboptimal clustering performance. To address these limitations, we propose a novel one-step SC method, termed DGCAKL, which directly learns the group indicators under discrete group structure constraints while adaptively learning the kernel mapping matrix to capture the nonlinear structure of high-dimensional data. These two learning processes are integrated into a mutually reinforcing optimization framework. Specifically, we employ the squared Schatten p -norm ( 0 < p ≤ 2 ) to impose non-convex low-rank constraints on the nonlinearly mapped data, effectively approximating the rank of data matrix in the kernel feature space. To compute the discrete group indicators, we circumvent the requirement for handling integer programming, enhancing both the efficiency and scalability of the proposed algorithm. Furthermore, we develop an efficient iterative optimization algorithm based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), combined with iteratively reweighted minimization, and provide the convergence guarantee of the algorithm under mild conditions. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed method effectively handles nonlinear data structures and significantly improves clustering accuracy.},

Parameter isolation addresses this challenge by masking a sub-network for each task to mitigate interference with old tasks. However, these sub-networks are constructed relying on weight magnitude, which does not necessarily correspond to the importance of weights, resulting in maintaining unimportant weights and constructing redundant sub-networks. To overcome this limitation, inspired by information bottleneck, which removes redundancy between adjacent network layers, we propose Information Bottleneck Masked sub-network (IBM) to eliminate redundancy within sub-networks. Specifically, IBM accumulates valuable information into essential weights to construct redundancy-free sub-networks, not only effectively mitigating CF by freezing the sub-networks but also facilitating new tasks training through the transfer of valuable knowledge. Additionally, IBM decomposes hidden representations to automate the construction process and make it flexible. Extensive experiments demonstrate that IBM consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Notably, IBM surpasses the state-of-the-art parameter isolation method with a 70% reduction in the number of parameters within sub-networks and an 80% decrease in training time.

Many existing methods assume that feature evolution follows a predictable pattern, such as feature increment and specific retention of old features. However, in real-world scenarios, feature evolution is often unpredictable due to the uncertainty of feature disappearance and emergence. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a novel method called OLUFE for online learning from data streams with unpredictable feature evolution. OLUFE is a one-pass learning method where each instance appears only once, adhering to the evolving nature of data streams. It handles the dynamic evolution of the feature space with a kernel-based online learning method. Additionally, a projection-based support vector budget strategy is introduced to enhance the computational efficiency of the model. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that OLUFE achieves a sublinear regret O ( T ) under mild conditions. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets validate the effectiveness of OLUFE in handling data streams with unpredictable feature evolution.},

  abstract     = {The increasing popularity of image editing tools poses a significant threat to the originality and authenticity of image content. The most common form of attack on image content is splicing forgery, which involves combining multiple donor images from different imaging devices to create a composite spliced image. In this study, we propose an image splicing region localization method based on device difference guidance. Its core idea lies in taking the physical characteristics of imaging devices as forensic clues, and determining the tampered image regions through effective extraction and analysis of these characteristics. The proposed method is a two-stage multi-scale network model named device difference feature guidance network (DDFG-Net), including the device difference guidance stage and the abnormal region localization stage. In the device difference guidance stage, a dual-stream Vision-Transformer network is adopted for camera source identification to extract the physical characteristics of different imaging devices. Immediately afterwards, the inconsistent features in the image are obtained by using the physical characteristics of the device, and the semantic information is decoupled from the inconsistent features introduced by splicing forgery to avoid the interference of semantic information on the forensic features. In the abnormal region location stage, we proposed the Channel-Wise up-sample and Spatial-Wise down-sample(CWU-SWD) and Cross-Scale Concatenator(CSC). The CWU-SWD module is used to reduce the loss of feature information when the scale changes and ensure the integrity of the information, thereby enabling the network to extract richer subtle features introduced by forgery. The CSC module is used for dynamic selection and fusion of multi-scale features, enabling the network to adapt to tampered areas of different scales. A large number of experimental comparisons on four different datasets have proved the excellent performance of DDFG-Net. Cross-dataset experiments and robustness tests further demonstrated the significant generalization and robustness of DDFG-Net. Furthermore, the ablation experiment further confirmed the rationality and effectiveness of each module in DDFG-Net.},

By incorporating landmark spatial position encoding, FacialTalk effectively decouples the distribution of the lips and face in the conditional space. FacialTalk begins by using 3D facial landmarks and audio as driving conditions to control lip synchronization and dynamic facial expressions. A Landmark Spatial-Aware Encoding is then applied within NeRF, assigning attention vectors to the lip and expression regions to minimize interference. Finally, Adaptive Torso Perception Encoding integrates head pose deformations and mapped keypoint coordinates to enable natural head and torso movements. Extensive experiments and user studies have shown that FacialTalk has achieved a PNSR of 37.1876 dB, which performs well in audio synchronization and in producing high-quality visual facial portrait videos.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, short-form videos have gained popularity and the editing of these videos, particularly when motion is synchronized with music, is highly favored due to its beat-matching effect. However, detecting motion rhythm poses a significant challenge as it is influenced by multifaceted factors that make it difficult to define using explicit rules. Traditional methods, which attempt to define motion rhythm through predefined criteria, frequently produce unsatisfactory results. Conversely, learning-based methods can extract motion rhythm without relying on explicit rules but necessitate high-quality datasets. Regrettably, motion rhythm is closely tied to human subjective perception and has not been accurately annotated: existing datasets either simply substitute music rhythm for motion rhythm, which are not equivalent, or leverage the consistency between music and motion to annotate motion rhythm while this process does not incorporate human feedback. Moreover, limbs play a crucial role in conveying motion rhythm; however, existing methods primarily depend on generic graph convolution or attention mechanisms to extract features only at the whole-body level and are insufficient for capturing the detailed movements of the limbs, which causes poor performance in limb-dominant movements. To address these challenges, we propose a new dataset and a novel method: ( i ) Dataset: We construct a motion rhythm dataset, AIST-M2B 2.0, integrating the human feedback mechanism into the automated annotation pipeline to improve the quality of the dataset; additionally, we employ soft labels rather than binary labels to achieve more efficient training. ( ii ) Method: We propose M2BNet 2.0, a novel network tailored for rhythm, which includes a hierarchical graph convolution module that captures the rhythm expression at the whole-body, inter-limb, and intra-limb levels; furthermore, we design a strategy for enhancing the motion rhythm in short-form videos. Compared to the latest work, our approach improves the F-score and PR-AUC metrics by 6.6% and 9.8% on the AIST-M2B dataset, and by 9.8% and 7.4% on the AIST-M2B 2.0 dataset, respectively.

To fill this gap, we propose LiGAPU, a novel Geometry-Aware LiDAR point cloud upsampling network designed to enhance the modeling of spatial structures in these complex scenes. The core of LiGAPU lies in two key modules: a Dual-stream Gating mechanism-based convolutional (DGConv) module that robustly captures both scalar and vector features while modeling their global dependencies, and a GCS module for precise point-to-point distance prediction. By combining 3D Gaussian feature interpolation with Channel-Spatial attention mechanisms, the GCS module effectively models fine-grained local relationships to improve the positional accuracy of upsampled points. We conduct experiments on public benchmarks as well as our self-collected datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that LiGAPU improves upsampling accuracy across all datasets while preserving structural consistency, and exhibits strong robustness and generalization in complex scenes.

In this study, a dynamic context-aware aggregation strategy (DCAS) is proposed to enhance the ability of small object detectors to identify occluded or tiny objects. The main approaches developed include the dynamic adjustment of the number of pooling layers in the spatial pyramid pooling fast module based on the proportion of tiny objects in the target dataset, the integration of lower-level features into feature pyramid networks, and the elimination of the highest-level of information processing modules to remove redundant semantic features for small object detection. The proposed model effectively captures contextual and structural information for occluded or tiny objects, which makes it adaptable to diverse scenarios. Comparison experiments on the VisDrone, BDD100K, and TT100K datasets demonstrated that DCAS-equipped models outperformed 11 popular or up-to-date small object detectors. Ablation studies using YOLOv5 and YOLOv8 further validated the effectiveness of DCAS. All findings consistently demonstrated that DCAS achieved 1.0 ∼ 7.2 % higher detection accuracy compared with baseline models.

  abstract     = {Large-scale crowd behavior analysis is critical for public safety. However, intelligent systems face three major challenges: inter-individual occlusion, behavioral pattern variability, and complexity of behavioral evolution. To address these challenges, we propose the Physics-Environment Interaction Network (PEIN), which utilizes physical properties to model the movement characteristics of groups. Specifically, our method consists of two streams. The first stream, the physics-informed crowd property stream, leverages the similarity between dense crowd motion and fluid dynamics. It uses the Navier–Stokes (N–S) equation to model crowd motion and characterize key crowd attributes such as collectiveness, conflict, uniformity, and stability. Each term of the N–S equation is modeled using operators and neural networks guided by these properties, enabling crowd-level motion representation without relying on individual tracking. The second stream, the environment perception stream, addresses scene-level variability by capturing global spatiotemporal information from input video frames. A 3D network is used to enhance robustness by incorporating temporal context beyond instantaneous motion. A dual cross-attention mechanism fuses both streams’ features into a unified representation for behavior recognition. By incorporating physical laws as constraints, we design a physics-informed loss function combined with a crowd behavior loss function to optimize the model. Considering the diversity of dense crowds in real-life scenarios, we introduce the Mixed Crowd Behavior Dataset (MCBD) for crowd behavior recognition across various settings, encompassing both structured and unstructured crowds. Our proposed method achieves the most desirable results on the public dataset DCFD and the new MCBD.},

  abstract     = {Stereo matching networks are essential for applications such as autonomous driving, robotic navigation, and augmented reality (AR). Traditional cost volumes, built using image features, often fail to capture global geometric information, leading to detail loss, edge blurring, and errors in textureless regions. To address these issues, we introduce a novel cost volume enhancement module based on the Mamba mechanism, termed Mamba Regularization. Mamba Regularization flattens the high-dimensional cost volume into one-dimensional features, utilizing the Spatial Mamba Block to capture long-range dependencies within whole-volume features at every scale. Additionally, we design the Spatial Residual Convolution (SRC) module to compensate for spatial information loss during flattening. Experimental results on the SceneFlow and KITTI benchmarks demonstrate that Mamba Regularization can serve as a plug-and-play module, significantly enhancing the performance of various stereo matching networks. While it introduces a slight increase in inference time, it achieves a favorable trade-off between accuracy and computational efficiency. Moreover, the proposed module exhibits strong cross-dataset generalization and maintains high inference efficiency, further validating its effectiveness in real-world applications.

  abstract     = {In shape-from-focus, the focus measure operator (FM) determines the accuracy of the depth map of a reconstructed object. Typically, before applying FM, vector-valued (color) images are converted into gray-scale for simplicity. However, this conversion prevents the FM from incorporating focus information from all color channels, leading to inaccuracies in the depth map. To overcome this limitation, we propose a dual-stage focus measure. The first stage involves converting the vector-valued image volume into a scalar-valued image volume using a unique method that facilitates the application of FM. This conversion is achieved through vector operations that compute a scaled norm from the difference vectors, with a scaling factor adjusted according to the variations in these norms. In the second stage, the focus measure is applied using the Directional Ring Difference Filter (DRDF) in different directions to obtain directional focus volumes, which are then aggregated using a weighted approach to compute a unified focus volume from which the depth map is ultimately extracted. Our extensive evaluation, conducted on over 1200 scenes comprising more than 17,000 images, demonstrated the superiority of our method. It outperformed 18 renowned techniques, achieving around 6.7 percent lower RMSE compared to the second best method on the HCI14 dataset.

  abstract     = {Many remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) estimation models have achieved promising performance in the training domain but often fail to accurately estimate physiological signals or heart rates (HR) in the target domains. Domain generalization (DG) or domain adaptation (DA) techniques are therefore adopted during the offline training stage to adapt the model to either unobserved or observed target domains by utilizing all available source domain data. However, in rPPG estimation problems, the adapted model usually encounters challenges in estimating target data with significant domain variation, such as different video capturing settings, individuals with different HR ranges, or imbalanced HR distributions. In contrast, Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) enables the model to adaptively estimate rPPG signals in various unseen domains by online adapting to unlabeled target data without referring to any source data. In this paper, we first establish a new TTA-rPPG benchmark that encompasses various domain information and HR distributions to simulate the challenges encountered in real-world rPPG estimation. Next, we propose a novel synthetic signal-guided rPPG estimation framework to address the forgetting issue during the TTA stage and to enhance the adaptation capability of the pre-trained rPPG model. To this end, we develop a synthetic signal-guided feature learning method by synthesizing rPPG signals as pseudo ground truths to guide a conditional generator in generating latent rPPG features. In addition, we design an effective spectral-based entropy minimization technique to encourage the rPPG model to learn new target domain information. Both the generated rPPG features and synthesized rPPG signals prevent the rPPG model from overfitting to target data and forgetting previously acquired knowledge, while also broadly covering various heart rate (HR) distributions. Our extensive experiments on the TTA-rPPG benchmark show that the proposed method achieves superior performance and outperforms previous DG and DA methods across most protocols of the benchmark.},

  abstract     = {Accurate polyp segmentation is a critical step in the early diagnosis of colorectal cancer. Predicting the polyp boundaries with powerful camouflage properties is an intricate challenge in automatic segmentation tasks. Here, we propose a multi-scale boundary prediction network (MSBP-Net) for effective polyp segmentation with low complexity. The MSBP-Net consists of a pre-trained pyramid vision transformer and a novel lightweight decoder which contains three modified receptive field blocks (mRFBs), three boundary prediction modules (BPMs) and a shallow filtering module (SFM). Firstly, the mRFBs are developed to suppress redundant information and irrelevant background. Secondly, the BMPs are built based on reverse attention and multi-scale criss-cross attention to efficiently explore boundaries and fuse multi-scale information for recovering coarse-grained polyp masks. Then, the SFM is proposed based on Laplacian edge operators, which mines boundary cues in the shallow layers as a supplement to the coarse-grained masks and finally gains fine-grained segmentation masks. We conduct extensive comparative experiments on five public datasets. The ablation results prove the effectiveness of the proposed modules, achieving a highest dice similarity coefficient of 0.940. Compared to existing state-of-the-art methods, the MSBP-Net performs close to the optimal methods on the five test sets, while reducing the complexity by at least 20.2 %. The lightweight design of the MSBP-Net achieves a speed of 41 frames per second on a 3070 GPU (8 GB memory). Therefore, the MSBP-Net is a promising polyp segmentation method with robust performance and low complexity, and has the potential for real-time segmentation tasks.},

Existing methods typically extract cross-domain shared representations by enforcing inter-domain invariance constraints on single visual modality feature distribution, to ensure the discriminability of the target joint distribution. However, in multi-source distribution scenarios, the coupling of domain and semantic information within the feature space limits the capacity of single modality feature transformation mechanisms to maintain the invariance of feature semantic information during training. To address this issue, we propose a Conditional Cross-domain Prompt Optimization (CCPO) method, which leverages pre-trained vision-language models to introduce textual modality, transforming the shared representation learning problem under multi-source feature distribution into a cross-domain prompt optimization task. Specifically, we design a latent space separation module from the perspective of data generation to decouple domain-specific and semantic features in the latent space, which mitigates the interference of domain variables on feature semantics, and we employ class-aware entropy weighting to adapt to label shift scenarios in the target domain. On this basis, we develop a set of conditional cross-domain prompts, which use the decoupled domain and semantic visual features as input conditional tokens in the prompt optimization process, ensuring cross-domain adaptability of the learned prompts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CCPO achieves state-of-the-art performance on most MUDA tasks, substantiating its efficacy and generalization capabilities.},

While these approaches show promising results, they encounter fundamental limitations when quantifying the similarity between source and target domain data, primarily stemming from the redundant and modality-missing class centroids. To address these limitations, we propose P rompt-affinity M ulti-modal C lass C entroids for UDA (termed as PMCC). Firstly, we fuse the text class centroids (directly generated from the text encoder of CLIP with manual prompts for each class) and image class centroids (generated from the image encoder of CLIP for each class based on source domain images) to yield the multi-modal class centroids. Secondly, we conduct the cross-attention operation between each source or target domain image and these multi-modal class centroids. In this way, these class centroids that contain rich semantic information of each class will serve as a bridge to effectively measure the semantic similarity between different domains. Finally, we design a logit bias head and employ a multi-modal prompt learning mechanism to accurately predict the true class of each image for both source and target domains. We conduct extensive experiments on 4 popular UDA datasets including Office-31, Office-Home, VisDA-2017, and DomainNet.

We analyze different approaches to address this challenge, ranging from traditional divide-and-conquer methods that handle music and lyrics separately, to novel end-to-end solutions including direct transcription, unfolding mechanisms, and language modeling. To evaluate these methods, we introduce four datasets of Gregorian chants, comprising both real and synthetic sources, along with custom metrics specifically designed to assess both transcription and alignment accuracy. Our experimental results demonstrate that end-to-end approaches generally outperform heuristic methods in the alignment challenge, with language models showing particular promise in scenarios where sufficient training data is available.

  abstract     = {Despite the impressive achievements of recent underwater image restoration (UIR) methods, they still struggle to perform well in unseen underwater environments. The potential reason could be the entanglement between generalized (scene) and biased (attenuation) image information, which makes it difficult to separate the generalized one for UIR. To this end, we propose a flexible Two-Branch Feature Separation (TBFS) framework to enable the generalized UIR. TBFS designs a novel two-branch feature extractor that can effectively separate the scene and attenuation information. Specifically, a scene-specific branch captures the environment-generalized features with the guidance of underwater scene discrimination, and a attenuation-biased branch is encouraged to identify the environment-biased features by performing underwater environment classification. Besides, a multi-level orthogonality constraint is imposed to fully leverage the knowledge derived from two branches for better entangled information separation. Finally, TBFS reconstructs input images to ensure the physical properties of restoration results. Experimental results on both full-reference and non-reference underwater benchmarks quantitatively and qualitatively demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.},

  abstract     = {Weakly supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) with image-level labels has demonstrated significant potential but encounters substantial challenges in complex driving scenes. These challenges arise from the unique characteristics of urban environments, such as overlapping objects, significant scale variations, and complex spatial relationships. Recent advances in foundation models have shown promise, with CLIP enabling semantic understanding without pixel-level annotations and SAM demonstrating strong boundary perception capabilities. However, existing methods that utilize these models often fail to effectively integrate their complementary strengths for driving scenes understanding. To address these limitations, we propose Dual-Prior Learning (DPL), a novel framework that effectively integrates CLIP’s semantic guidance and SAM’s boundary perception as complementary priors. Our framework introduces three key components: 1) a Semantic Text-aware Multi-scale Perception (STMP) module that integrates CLIP text embeddings for effective multi-scale feature learning, 2) a dual-region learning mechanism that adaptively optimizes consistent and inconsistent regions through dynamic weight balancing, and 3) a SAM boundary supervision scheme that provides precise guidance through iterative weight adjustment. Extensive experiments on Cityscapes, CamVid, and WildDash2 validation sets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming previous best results by significant margins of 19.7 %, 25.0 %, and 17.0 % mIoU, respectively, highlighting its substantial advances in driving scenes understanding.

While most prior methods for general 6-DoF grasping focus on extracting scene-level semantic or geometric information, they often neglect adaptability to diverse downstream applications, such as target-oriented grasping. To address this, we rethink 6-DoF grasp detection from a grasp-centric perspective and propose FlexLoG , a versatile framework designed to unify scene-level and target-oriented grasping within a single system. Our framework integrates two core components: the Flexible Guidance Module and the Local Grasp model. The Flexible Guidance Module accommodates both global guidance (e.g., grasp heatmaps) and local guidance (e.g., visual-language grounding), ensuring robust grasp generation across varied task requirements. The Local Grasp model focuses on object-agnostic regional points, enabling precise, localized grasp predictions. Experiments demonstrate that FlexLoG surpasses existing methods, achieving a new state-of-the-art on the GraspNet-1Billion dataset. To validate the practical applicability, we reconstruct the dataset in a simulated digital twin environment, verifying the consistency of performance between simulated and benchmark results. Real-world robotic experiments across diverse scenarios further confirm the framework’s efficacy, achieving a success rate exceeding 90 %.},

Our method does not require any pre-trained models or deep prior knowledge. By employing regularization methods for unseen view Gaussians, the model can better learn 3D spatial information under sparse input views and effectively remove Gaussian ellipsoids with excessively high opacity near the camera. Furthermore, in order to prevent the 3DGS model from prematurely pruning 3D Gaussians that are crucial for depth and geometric information early in the training process, we proposed an annealing pruning strategy to prevent the loss of scene information caused by premature removal 3D Gaussians. Extensive experiments on the LLFF, DTU, Mip-NeRF 360, and LF datasets demonstrate that the rendering quality of USGS surpasses state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods while retaining the capability for real-time rendering.},

There still exists a large accuracy gap between BNNs and their full-precision counterparts. Two of the important reasons can be attributed to the difficult weight updating and frequent weight flipping during BNNs’ training. In this paper, one important observation is that solely considering one of the problems is insufficient due to they simultaneously exist and may mutually convert. Moreover, we found that the learning rate decay is helpful to elevate the accuracy of BNN and will dynamically change the clusters of weights that are difficult to update and frequently flip. Inspired by the observations, for the first time, the paper proposed a simple yet effective way to simultaneously tackle the difficult weight updating and frequent weight flipping problems, namely WCFE-Net, in which the w eight c onstraint and f lick e nforcement mechanisms are elaborated with special consideration of learning rate decay. Experiments are conducted on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets to verify the effectiveness of the proposed WCFE-Net on the basis of classical models.

However, practical datasets often comprise vast numbers of samples, posing significant challenges for memory-constrained systems. Thus, developing an efficient algorithm for selecting relevant features from large-scale sample datasets under such constraints is essential. Existing feature selection methods frequently face limitations in both scalability and effectiveness in these contexts. This article proposes a novel three-phase heuristic feature selection algorithm, termed TPFS, designed to address the challenges of large-scale sample datasets. The first phase, neighborhood compression, identifies and retains the most representative samples by delimiting adaptive neighborhoods, effectively reducing the dataset’s size. The second and third phases, hypergraph initialization and whale optimization, construct a hypergraph to model higher-order feature relationships and integrate a dual-mode design and a dynamic probability-driven ternary classifier system within the optimization process. These procedures replace the random initialization of solution populations and the optimization of single classifier, enhancing the quality of the selected feature subsets. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TPFS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms, particularly in processing large-scale sample datasets effectively.},

Learning domain-invariant representations is crucial for resisting domain shifts, which current augmentation and domain-invariant feature learning strive for implicitly or explicitly. Despite their common successes, sufficient and explicit representation learning incorporating properties of medical images still deserves exploration. Motivated by observations of limited stylized variation, small inter-class difference, and similar anatomical structure in medical images, a hybrid Dual-augmentation Constraint Framework (DCON) is proposed for effective domain-invariant representation learning. Our dual-view asymmetric augmentation utilizes diverse image-level and feature-level perturbations, including a global-local stylized augmentation with controllability. Bilevel contrastive learning performs two constraints: object-focused consistency between dual views and cross-individual constraint across images simultaneously to capture invariant semantic features. DCON outperforms existing advanced methods on three datasets for single-source domain generalization. Our source code is available at https://github.com/wrf-nj/DCON .},

  abstract     = {Image deraining presents a significant challenge within the field of image processing, and recent advancements indicate that Transformer-based models exhibit superior performance compared to conventional CNNs. However, the self-attention mechanism in Transformers suffers from quadratic computational complexity, resulting in high inference time and their inability to simultaneously capture both precise global context and fine local details, which are essential for accurately restoring degraded image content. In response to these challenges, we propose a novel architecture called GKC-Net, which integrates a gated KAN module with a Channel-Position Attention Mechanism (CPAM). Significantly, GKC-Net achieves linear growth in computational complexity while preserving global context modeling capability, thereby completely eliminating the inherent quadratic complexity of Transformers. This enables high-resolution image restoration tasks to maintain competitive performance while significantly reducing computational overhead.Specifically, we propose the Gated KAN module, which combines the KAN network with a gating mechanism. KAN enhances computational efficiency and scalability via group-wise parameter sharing and variance-preserving initialization. The gating mechanism dynamically regulates information flow based on input features, mitigating over-smoothing and preserving critical details, thereby boosting model expressiveness while reducing computational cost. Additionally, we introduce the CPAM, which emphasizes both channel and positional information, thereby enhancing detail capture in deraining and achieving superior performance in rain removal tasks. Our proposed GKC-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance across several image restoration tasks, including image deraining, image dehazing, and image motion deblurring. This further highlights the superiority of our approach in diverse restoration scenarios and its robust adaptability to various image restoration challenges.},

To address these challenges, we propose a computational model named GraCMI based on multi-hop graph structural modeling, which predicts CMIs by integrating structural and attribute information of molecules. GraCMI learns the representation of molecules in multi-level neighborhoods through constructing heterogeneous networks and performing high- and low-order matrix factorization. GraCMI captures both the intrinsic properties and global structures of molecules, extracting and fusing multi-source features, improving prediction accuracy. In the case studies, 7 out of the top 10 CMI pairs predicted using GraCMI on a real cancer-related dataset were confirmed.

However, the adversarial perturbations introduced by transferable attacks are perceptible to human observers. Although there are unrestricted attacks which can achieve good visual imperceptibility, the adversarial transferability of these attacks remains relatively low. In this paper, we propose to improve adversarial transferability and imperceptibility of adversarial examples via flat loss landscape and diffusion models. Specifically, we utilize denoising diffusion implicit model (DDIM) inversion operation to map the input image back to the diffusion latent space. Then we add perturbations on the diffusion latent space to achieve successful attacks on the surrogate model and flat input loss landscape, resulting in high adversarial transferability and imperceptible perturbations to human observers.

  abstract     = {Video desnowing, aimed at removing snowflakes and enhancing the quality of videos, is a crucial yet intricate task essential for improving the effectiveness of outdoor vision systems. Compared to rain and haze, the inherent opacity and diverse morphology of snowflakes result in more pronounced background occlusions, thereby challenging the efficacy of current desnowing techniques, particularly those focusing solely on images or videos captured from a monocular perspective. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a Dual-Stream Temporal Transformer (DSTT) to advance snow removal and visual enhancement by leveraging comprehensive information from stereo views and spatial-temporal cues. More specifically, it incorporates a Dual-Stream Weight-shared Transformer (DSWT) module to exploit spatial information from different views. This module employs a hierarchical weight-sharing strategy to extract fused spatial features across different views from low-level to high-level layers. Subsequently, the Dual-Stream ConvLSTM (DS-CLSTM) module is introduced to capture temporal correlations across streaming frames. By combining temporal-spatial cues and complementary details from diverse views, videos can be effectively restored while preserving the original content’s details. In addition, two binocular snowy datasets – SnowKITTI2012 and SnowKITTI 2015 – are presented, providing a valuable resource for evaluating the binocular desnowing task. Comprehensive experiments evaluated on both synthetic and real-world snowy datasets demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines.},

  abstract     = {Visual Language Models (VLMs) exhibit impressive performance across various tasks but often suffer from degradation of prior knowledge when transferred to downstream tasks with limited computational samples. Prompt tuning methods emerge as an effective solution to mitigate this issue. However, most existing approaches solely rely on coarse-grained text prompt or fine-grained text prompt, which may limit the discriminative and generalization capabilities of VLMs. To address these limitations, we propose Mixture of Coarse and Fine-grained Prompt Tuning (MCFPT) , a novel method that integrates both coarse and fine-grained prompts to enhance the performance of VLMs. Inspired by the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) mechanism, MCFPT incorporates a Mixed Fusion Module (MFM) to fuse and select coarse domain-shared text feature and fine-grained category-discriminative text feature to get the mixed feature. Additionally, a Dynamic Refinement Adapter (DRA) is introduced to adjust category distributions, ensuring consistency between refined and mixed text features. These components collectively improve the generalization and discriminative power of VLMs. Extensive experiments across four scenarios-base-to-new, few-shot classification, domain generalization, and cross-domain classification-demonstrate that MCFPT achieves exceptional performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, with significant improvements in HM scores across multiple datasets. Our findings highlight MCFPT as a robust approach for improving the adaptability and efficiency of Visual Language Models in diverse application domains.},

  abstract     = {NeRF-based methods excel in generating realistic volumetric representations but often struggle with creating high-quality meshes, which are crucial for applications requiring explicit surface models. Existing approaches train NeRF and mesh generation networks separately, which limits their ability to learn jointly and leads to spatial and visual misalignment. To address the problem, we propose a novel unified optimization method that collaboratively learns NeRF and colored mesh representations for enhancing 3D reconstruction from monocular RGB images. Our approach employs Triplane features to generate Signed Distance Fields guided by density inputs, which are processed through a differentiable iso-surface extraction module. To ensure consistency between the NeRF and Mesh representations, we introduce a novel cross-photometric loss comparing rasterized outputs with the volumetric rendered images for unified learning. Additionally, we utilize a face-aware chamfer distance and a color loss based on barycentric interpolation, enabling uniform point sampling and improved vertex- and face-level alignment. This enhances geometric accuracy and ensures precise color transfer from source images to the mesh. Our model is trained using 3D ground-truth data and 2D multi-view images, enabling a unified optimization pipeline. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing approaches in colorized mesh generation, demonstrating its effectiveness and potential for practical applications. On the Google Scanned Objects dataset, our method outperforms the previous state-of-the-art by achieving a 26.33% higher PSNR (24.76 vs. 19.60), a 43.56% lower LPIPS (0.092 vs. 0.163), and a 79.25% lower chamfer distance (0.011 vs. 0.053), demonstrating superior visual and geometric fidelity.},

Due to factors such as quantity differences and feature overlap among classes, the imbalance problem for multiclass classification is more difficult than that for binary one, which leads to the existing research primarily focusing on the binary classification scenario. This study proposes a novel deep forest algorithm with the aid of Genetic Programming (GP), MDGP-Forest, for the multiclass imbalance problem. MDGP-Forest utilizes Multi-class Disassembly and undersampling based on instance hardness between layers to obtain multiple binary classification datasets, each corresponding to a GP population for feature construction. The improved fitness function of GP assesses the incremental importance of the constructed features for enhanced vectors, introducing higher-order information into subsequent layers to improve predicted performance. Each GP population generates a set of new features that improve the separability of classes, empowering MDGP-Forest with the capability to address the challenge of overlapping features among multiple classes. We thoroughly evaluate the classification performance of MDGP-Forest on 35 datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that MDGP-Forest significantly outperforms existing methods in addressing multiclass imbalance problems, exhibiting superior predictive performance.},

The canonical polyadic decomposition (CPD) model is almost invariably adopted in the federated TD literature. Instead, this paper proposes a coupled tensor train (CTT) FL framework, which, compared with CPD, offers improved feature extraction capabilities and enjoys increased accuracy and stability. Moreover, the estimation of the model ranks is easier. The proposed CTT approach is instantiated for two fundamental network structures: master–slave and decentralized. Simulation results on synthetic and real datasets demonstrate that the proposed method attains the objectives of an FL environment while outperforming existing alternatives and with practically no loss in learning performance incurred from its distributed character.},

  abstract     = {The rise in crime rates has become a significant cause of property and life losses, necessitating the development of intelligent video surveillance systems for enhanced monitoring in law enforcement, transportation, and environmental contexts. However, the accurate identification of abnormal activities in real-time video surveillance systems remains a challenging task. Existing surveillance systems struggle with the vast amount of video streaming, making manual 24/7 monitoring impractical and error-prone. Traditional anomaly detection methods often process the entire dataset’s feature set, which can be limiting in complex scenarios, leading to incorrect predictions, especially with challenging patterns or inter-class similarities. Therefore, this paper addresses the limitations of automatic video anomaly recognition systems by developing a vision transformer-based class-incremental learning network (CILAR-Net). The CILAR-Net leverages a vision transformer to extract spatiotemporal features from surveillance video frames, followed by a GRU network for anomaly recognition. The incremental learning approach enables the model to adapt to new classes without retraining. The CILAR-Net is validated on challenging anomaly recognition datasets, including UCF-Crime, LAD-2000, and RWF-2000, showcasing a state-of-the-art performance. Comparative analysis with existing methods demonstrates the effectiveness of CILAR-Net, which achieves an accuracy of 53.03%, 79.07%, and 93.46%, with improvements of 2.03%, 9.67%, and 0.20% from state-of-the-art methods on the UCF-Crime, LAD-2000, and RWF-2000 datasets, respectively. These results highlight the practical advantage and robustness of our method in enhancing anomaly recognition performance across diverse datasets.

  abstract     = {Facial Attribute Recognition (FAR) remains a challenging task due to the poor quality of visual images. Existing FAR methods generally adopt the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to learn deep features of facial images, and attribute relationships are either obtained by a fixed clustering algorithm or manually grouped. In this paper, we propose a novel Relationship-Guided Vision-Language Transformer, termed RVLT, for FAR. The RVLT method can automatically learn attribute relationships from the linguistic modality, which is used to guide image feature extraction. Specifically, each vision-language Transformer encoder adopts an Image-Text Cross-Attention (ITCA), which is composed of an Image-to-Text Adjustment Attention (ITAA) and a Text-to-Image Guidance Attention (TIGA). The ITAA is used to adjust the text tokens from the linguistic modality to adapt to the visual information, and the TIGA employs the adjusted text tokens as the prior knowledge to guide the distribution of the image embeddings from the visual modality. Moreover, we employ a Token Selection Mechanism (TSM) to reduce the interference factors in the image background, so that the model can pay more attention to the regions related to the face. In addition, an Image-Text Alignment (ITA) loss is used to further align the tokens of the visual and linguistic modalities, and a Text-Aware Classification (TAC) loss is leveraged to ensure the correctness of the attribute relationships learned from the raw text as much as possible. Different from directly using the image embeddings for feature extraction, our method can leverage the attribute relationships automatically learned from the raw text to effectively highlight image features relevant to facial attributes. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed RVLT achieves 87.34% and 91.80% accuracy on LFWA and CelebA, respectively. In the case of limited labeled data, RVLT outperforms the second-best FAR method by 1.76% and 0.25% accuracy under only 5% LFWA and 0.5% CelebA training data, respectively.},

Despite significant advancements, the diversity of video content and the constraint of limited training data pose challenges when applying trained models to new scenarios, often resulting in the domain shift problem. To address this challenge, we propose a domain adaptation framework tailored to video summarization from two aspects: (a) enhancing the generalization ability and (b) improving the adaptive ability of video summarization models. Specifically, we design a simple yet effective regularized feature encoder based on Transformer, where an averaging operation on attention weights serves as a form of regularization. This method mitigates overfitting to domain-specific cues and encourages the learning of more generalizable representations across diverse domains. Furthermore, we introduce a novel discrepancy reduction loss that aligns the distribution of inter-frame feature similarities and inter-frame prediction similarities, combined with a confidence weighting strategy, to adapt the regularized encoder to target domains and mitigate domain shift. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

  abstract     = {Conformal Prediction (CP) is a popular uncertainty quantification method that provides distribution-free, statistically valid prediction sets, assuming that training and test data are exchangeable. In such a case, CP’s prediction sets are guaranteed to cover the (unknown) true test output with a user-specified probability. Nevertheless, this guarantee is violated when the data is subjected to adversarial attacks, which often result in a significant loss of coverage. Recently, several approaches have been put forward to recover CP guarantees in this setting. These approaches leverage variations of randomised smoothing to produce conservative sets which account for the effect of the adversarial perturbations. They are, however, limited in that they only support ℓ 2 -bounded perturbations and classification tasks. This paper introduces VRCP (Verifiably Robust Conformal Prediction) , a new framework that leverages recent neural network verification methods to recover coverage guarantees under adversarial attacks. We also demonstrate how VRCP can be used to mitigate poisoning attacks. Our VRCP method is the first to support perturbations bounded by arbitrary norms including ℓ 1 , ℓ 2 , and ℓ ∞ , as well as regression tasks. We evaluate and compare our approach on image classification tasks (CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and TinyImageNet) and regression tasks for deep reinforcement learning environments. In every case, VRCP achieves above nominal coverage and yields significantly more efficient and informative prediction regions than the SotA.},

  abstract     = {Image deblurring (ID) aims to recover the latent sharp image from its blurred counterpart. Although numerous convolutional neural network (CNN)-based and Transformer-based methods have been developed for ID, most of them handle blurry images at pixel-level and without explicitly introducing structural information. According to our experiments, the patch-averaging operation, which involves average pooling followed by a broadcasting operation, can effectively capture structural information. And we observed that the structural information of blurred images obtained through patch-averaging is highly similar to that of their corresponding clear ground truth (GT) images. Additionally, recent MLP-based networks with gate mechanisms have shown promise with simpler and more efficient architectures. Inspired by these findings, we propose a multi-scale gate network (MSGN) to accurately capture structural information at different scales. This approach aids in restoring both edges and texture details. Specifically, we propose a multi-scale gate block (MGB) to capture and integrate pixel-level features and patch-level structure information by summarizing structural information of each patch into a block with the same size and location via patch-averaging operation. In addition, we develop a structural feed-forward network (SFFN), which further integrates each pixel with the structure information of its corresponding patch. Finally, we present a structural fusion strategy (SFS), in which the MGB and SFFN are used again to fuse the output of encoder with the output of decoder. Extensive experiments compared with existing state-of-the-art ID methods demonstrate that our proposed MSGN can achieve higher quality deblurring results in terms of both subjective vision and quantitative metrics.},

However, it still constrained by the scarcity of high-quality annotated dental datasets. To address this issue, this paper presents a dataset combining both 2D panoramic X-rays with over 6500 images and 3D CBCT with over 580 volumes (88,500+ slices) to support the Semi-supervised Teeth Segmentation (STS) Challenge, which includes partially meticulous annotations and covers all age groups. Moreover, multi-phase semi-supervised teeth segmentation algorithms and high-confidence pseudo-labels refinement strategies were proposed by competitors during this challenge. Algorithms were verified on this proposed dataset and good segmentation performance were achieved, over 93+ and 80+ Dice score were obtained for top three 2D and 3D participants, demonstrating the high quality of this proposed dataset. This paper also summarizes the diverse methods employed by the top-ranking teams in the MICCAI 2023 STS Challenge.

  abstract     = {In visual object tracking, the disparity in performance between lightweight and heavyweight trackers presents a significant challenge, particularly for applications on edge devices. We introduce the Cross-Alignment Tracker (CAT), a novel dual-branch framework designed to bridge the performance gap by integrating both lightweight and heavyweight tracking components. During training, CAT processes inputs through two parallel branches, each consisting of a backbone network and a tracking head—one lightweight and the other heavyweight. This design facilitates simultaneous learning and output alignment across branches, thereby enhancing the performance of the lightweight tracker in a coordinated manner. A key aspect of our approach is the adaptation and alignment of outputs from both branches, ensuring that the accuracy and robustness of the heavyweight tracker can effectively guide and improve the learning of its lightweight counterpart. During online tracking, CAT leverages cross-combinations between the two branches to simultaneously generate four distinct one-stream trackers, each with varying levels of computational complexity and parameter size. Empirical evaluations, notably on the GOT-10k benchmark, reveal that CAT-Tiny surpasses existing real-time trackers by 4.8%, approaching the prowess of larger, high-performance models. Remarkably, a single training session yields four distinct model sizes, each tailored for varied tracking demands, showcasing the method’s unparalleled efficiency and scalability in advancing real-time object-tracking technology.},

  abstract     = {Accurate real-time estimation of Origin–Destination (OD) matrices is crucial for effective transportation network management. However, online recording systems often suffer from incomplete data, due to the limited observation intervals that fail to capture long-duration travel units within shorter time frames. This real-time incompleteness severely impacts applications requiring complete OD demand information, as critical flow data is either missing or under-represented. In this study, we propose GNN-ODFill, a novel graph neural network-based framework designed to address this challenge. GNN-ODFill estimates the true OD matrix in real-time by leveraging both incomplete historical data and real-time origin flow information. The model consists of three key components: (1) a pre-imputation module using Graph Attention Networks (GAT) for initial estimation, (2) a historical accumulation module that captures temporal dependencies via Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) and Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs), and (3) an OD allocation module that refines the estimates using real-time flow data, ensuring that the sum of origin–destination pairs from each station matches the complete observed origin flow. While previous methods often overlook the impact of real-time incompleteness, GNN-ODFill explicitly addresses this issue by ensuring that the estimated OD matrix is both spatially and temporally coherent. Furthermore, the framework highlights an underexplored gap in existing models: the limited use of flow conservation. Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of GNN-ODFill in terms of both accuracy compared to existing methods. Additionally, the real-time complete OD matrix estimated by GNN-ODFill significantly improves the accuracy of future OD demand predictions.},

  abstract     = {Subgraph isomorphism, also known as subgraph matching, is typically regarded as an NP-complete problem. This complexity is further compounded in practical applications where edge weights are real-valued and may be affected by measurement noise and potential missing data. Such graph matching routinely arises in applications such as image matching and map matching. Most subgraph matching methods fail to perform node-to-node matching under presence of such corruptions. We propose a method for identifying the node correspondence between a subgraph and a full graph in the inexact case without node labels in two steps - (a) extract the minimal unique topology preserving subset from the subgraph and find its feasible matching in the full graph, and (b) implement a consensus-based algorithm to expand the matched node set by pairing unique paths based on boundary commutativity. To demonstrate the accuracy and sub-linear time complexity of the proposed method, two simulation studies are performed on the Erdos–Renyi random graphs and spatial graphs. Additionally, two case studies are performed on the image-based affine covariant features dataset and KITTI stereo dataset respectively. Going beyond the existing subgraph matching approaches, the proposed method is shown to have realistically sub-linear computational efficiency, robustness to random measurement noise, and good statistical properties. Our method is also readily applicable to the exact matching case without loss of generality.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we propose HSENet, a hierarchical semantic-enriched network capable of generating high-quality fused images with robust global semantic consistency and excellent local detail representation. The core innovation of HSENet lies in its hierarchical enrichment of semantic information through semantic gathering, distribution, and injection. Specifically, the network begins by balancing global information exchange via multi-scale feature aggregation and redistribution while dynamically bridging fusion and segmentation tasks. Following this, a progressive semantic dense injection strategy is introduced, employing dense connections to first inject global semantics into highly consistent infrared features and then propagate the semantic-infrared hybrid features to visible features. This approach effectively enhances semantic representation while minimizing high-frequency information loss. Furthermore, HSENet includes two types of feature fusion modules, to leverage cross-modal attention for more comprehensive feature fusion and utilize semantic features as a third input to further enhance the semantic representation for image fusion. These modules achieve robust and flexible feature fusion in complex scenarios by dynamically balancing global semantic consistency and fine-grained local detail representation. Our approach excels in visual perception tasks while fully preserving the texture features from the source modalities. The comparison experiments of image fusion and semantic segmentation demonstrate the superiority of HSENet in visual quality and semantic preservation.

Our approach introduces a Dual Heterogeneous Noise Generator (DHNG) , which leverages Variational Autoencoders (VAE) and ControlNet to produce diverse, targeted noise tailored to the original image features. Additionally, we design a custom adversarial loss function to optimize the noise, ensuring both high controllability and potent disruption. By iteratively refining the adversarial sample through multi-gradient signals from both the noise and the state-of-the-art EHPS model, TBA substantially improves the effectiveness of adversarial attacks. Extensive experiments demonstrate TBA’s superiority, achieving a remarkable 41.0% increase in estimation error, with an average improvement of approximately 17.0%. These findings expose significant security vulnerabilities in current EHPS models and highlight the need for stronger defenses in digital human generation systems.},

High-resolution SAR images often exhibit extremely heterogeneous terrain, resulting in severe long-tailed distributions in the image histogram. Traditional change detection methods based on hypothesis testing theory rely on Gamma distributions, which struggle to accurately model the complex scenes in high-resolution images. Recently the Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) distribution is proven effective in describing the long-tail phenomenon. In this paper, we introduce GEV model into the hypothesis test theory and propose a GEV-based SAR change detection method. First, there may exist two or more heterogeneous components in a certain scene in high-resolution SAR images. We oversegment the image into homogeneous local regions using a superpixel algorithm and model each region with the GEV distribution. Based on this distribution, we then derive the GEV-based likelihood-ratio test (LRT) statistics to measure the similarity of two superpixels for unsupervised change detection. Finally, by analyzing the asymptotic behavior of the GEV-based LRT, we apply a threshold to obtain the change maps (CMs). To evaluate the performance of our approach, we conduct Monte Carlo experiments using empirical data to investigate the goodness-of-fit performance and asymptotic behavior of the LRT. Our method demonstrates superior performance compared to state-of-the-art approaches, achieving the highest overall accuracy in both studied areas.},

  abstract     = {Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is an effective tool for early detection of breast cancer. To assist physicians in enhancing diagnostic effectiveness and efficiency, a substantial number of machine learning-based methods for breast cancer MRI classification have emerged in recent years. However, existing studies face challenges at both the data and methodology levels. On the data aspect, many of these studies are based on small, private-owned datasets, limiting the practical impact and hindering further research. In addition, while combining Contrast-Enhanced T1-weighted MRI images (CE-T1WI) with their subtraction counterparts (Sub-T1WI) at different post-injection periods is a common clinical practice, there remains a gap in research utilizing such data. From a methodological perspective, most methods apply this mechanism directly and neglect the specific characteristics of the data, resulting in limited performance enhancement. To address these issues, we release a CE-Sub T1WI dataset containing 3,964 MRI images of different modalities and post-injection periods from 991 cases to facilitate research in this field. Additionally, we propose a novel dual-regularized mixed spatial attention network (DRMSA) in this work that incorporates the multi-scale information from both local images and comparison across different post-injection periods. Furthermore, inspired by the attention concentration and dissipation pattern of physicians in MRI analysis, we introduce two novel regularizers to enhance the quality of attention maps. Comprehensive studies against six widely recognized classification baselines and six additional networks that employ attention modules are assessed to compare DRMSA’s performance, highlighting its strengths in classification accuracy and interpretability in breast MRI analysis.

  abstract     = {Magnetic Resonance (MR) imaging is essential in clinical diagnostics due to its ability to capture detailed soft tissue structures. However, acquiring high-resolution MR images is expensive and often leads to reduced signal-to-noise ratios. To address this, MR image super-resolution aims to generate high-resolution images from low-resolution inputs. While deep neural networks have been widely applied for MR image super-resolution, they struggle to effectively utilize structural information critical for accurate reconstruction. This paper introduces a novel Transformer-based framework for super-resolving T2-weighted MR image which is a critical MR imaging modality. This framework excels in leveraging both intra-modality and inter-modality dependencies to enhance the structural information. The innovative component of our proposed architecture is termed as High-frequency Structure Transformer (HFST) which operates on the gradients of input images, leveraging the high-frequency structure prior. It also employs high-resolution T1-weighted images which is a more efficient MR imaging modality to provide substantial inter-modality structure priors for the processing of low-resolution T2-weighted images. HFST is featured by parallel intra-modality and inter-modality context exploration and window-based self-attention modules. Notably, both intra-head and inter-head correlations are incorporated to build up the self-attention modules, amplifying the relation extraction capacity. Rigorous evaluations on three benchmarks including IXI, BraTS2018, and fastMRI reveal that our method sets a new state of the art in MR image super-resolution. Especially, our method increases the PSNR metric by up to 1.28 dB under the 4 × super-resolution setting. Our codes are available at https://github.com/dummerchen/HFST .},

  abstract     = {Keyword spotting (KWS) in historical documents is an important tool for the initial exploration of digitized collections. Nowadays, the most efficient KWS methods rely on machine learning techniques, which typically require a large amount of annotated training data. However, in the case of historical manuscripts, there is a lack of annotated corpora for training. To handle the data scarcity issue, we investigate the merits of self-supervised learning to extract useful representations of the input data without relying on human annotations and then use these representations in the downstream task. We propose ST-KeyS, a masked auto-encoder model based on vision transformers where the pretraining stage is based on the mask-and-predict paradigm without the need for labeled data. In the fine-tuning stage, the pre-trained encoder is integrated into a fine-tuned Siamese neural network model to improve feature embedding from the input images. We further improve the image representation using pyramidal histogram of characters (PHOC) embedding to create and exploit an intermediate representation of images based on text attributes. The proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods trained on the same datasets in an exhaustive experimental evaluation of five widely used benchmark datasets (Botany, Alvermann Konzilsprotokolle, George Washington, Esposalles, and RIMES).},

  abstract     = {In the rapidly evolving landscape of deep learning, the ability to balance performance and computational efficiency is indispensable. Layer-wise training, which involves independently training each hidden layer of a neural network with its private output layer, offers a promising avenue by enabling the construction of a single network that can leverage an ensemble of output layers during prediction. This approach has been successfully employed in state-of-the-art models like ensemble deep multilayer perceptron (edMLP) and ensemble deep random vector functional link (edRVFL), pushing the boundaries of their base models, MLP trained by backpropagation (BP) and RVFL trained using a closed-form solution (CFS). However, edRVFL often underperforms edMLP in accuracy, while edMLP incurs significantly higher computational cost. To this end, we introduce two novel hybrid training approaches that integrate BP and CFS, aiming to balance the trade-offs. Extensive experiments on diverse classification datasets reveal that one of the proposed models, ensemble deep adaptive sampling (edAS), achieves statistically significant improvements in classification accuracy over state-of-the-art models, including edRVFL, edMLP, and self-normalizing neural network (SNN), while being less computationally expensive. Furthermore, the second proposed model, MO-MLP, demonstrates statistically significant superiority over competing models while requiring less than one-third of the computation time needed by models that incorporate BP in a layer-wise manner. The source code for all proposed models is available on GitHub. 1},

While recent NeRF-based SLAM systems have shown promising results, they have yet to exploit NeRF’s potential to estimate system state fully. EC-SLAM overcomes this limitation by using a Truncated Signed Distance Fields (TSDF) opacity function with sharp inductive bias to strengthen constraints in sparse parametric encodings, which reduces the number of model parameters and enhances accuracy. Additionally, our system employs a highly constrained global joint optimization approach coupled with a feature-based, uniform sampling algorithm, enabling efficient fusion between TSDF and sparse parametric encodings. This approach reinforces constraints on keyframes most relevant to the current frame, mitigates the influence of random sampling, and effectively utilizes NeRF’s implicit loop closure capability.

However, the existing FGVC methods cannot mine discriminative features from low-quality samples, leading to a significant decline in performance. To address this issue, we propose a weakly supervised Context-Semantic Quality Awareness Network (CSQA-Net) for FGVC. Specifically, to assess and enhance the quality of multi-granularity visual representations, we propose the Multi-level Semantic Quality Evaluation (MSQE) module, composed of the Quality Probing (QP) classifier. To alleviate the scale confusion problems and accurately identify the local distinctive regions, the part navigator is developed. Moreover, the Multi-part and Multi-scale Cross-Attention (MMCA) module is designed to model the spatial contextual relationship between rich part descriptors and global semantics, thus capturing more discriminative details within the object. Finally, the context-aware features from MMCA and semantically enhanced features from MSQE are fed into the corresponding QP classifiers to evaluate the quality in real time, further boosting the discriminability. Comprehensive experiments on four popular and highly competitive datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed CSQA-Net in comparison with the state-of-the-art methods.

However, the classical information entropy has two shortcomings, that is, information entropy cannot accurately measure the uncertainty of knowledge in some cases and the joint probability in information entropy is usually difficult to calculate for high-dimensional data. Additionally, uncertainty measure is the foundation of feature selection in granular computing. Inaccurate measures may lead to poor performance of feature selection methods. To address these issues, we propose a novel uncertainty measure called rough diversity entropy based on rough set theory. Rough diversity entropy can more accurately measure the uncertainty of knowledge compared with the classical information entropy. In this article, rough diversity entropy and its variants are first defined, and their related properties are studied. Next, a heuristic feature selection method based on the defined measures is put forward, and the corresponding algorithm is also designed. Finally, a series of experiments are executed to validate the effectiveness and rationality of the proposed method. The analysis results show that our proposed method has good performance compared with eight existing feature selection methods. Moreover, the proposed method improves the average accuracy of 15 datasets by 6.53% under four classifiers, and achieves an average feature reduction rate of up to 99.81%.

However, the majority of existing public DLA datasets are predominantly in coarse-grained category and written in the English language, which limits their applicability in the diverse context of Chinese documents.

PeKi comprises a comprehensive collection of documents from five distinct fields, available in both scanned and digitally native formats. We have meticulously annotated all fine-grained titles and ensured that figure captions, table captions, and formula numbers are included within the respective scopes of figures, tables and formulas. Building on this foundation, we propose a novel approach to document layout analysis, termed DocMY. This method innovatively integrates the Mamba module into the YOLOv9 framework, for the first time, with a multi-level adaptive rectangular convolution. This can effectively perceive different layout elements with varying aspect ratios and understand structured continuous elements in the document. Experiments on the proposed benchmarks demonstrate that DocMY obtains competitive results.

  abstract     = {Deep learning (DL) has been extensively applied to hyperspectral image target detection (HTD) with notable success. However, many existing DL-based methods focus on expanding the training samples to capture richer information, resulting in high computational costs and overfitting risks. Additionally, challenges such as complex data distributions and limited model transferability remain significant obstacles. To address these issues, we propose an unbalanced episode meta-learning with Bi-sparse contrastive network (UEML) for HTD. In contrast to directly modeling the target dataset, our approach leverages meta-learning to pre-train the model on a categorical dataset rich in label information, resulting in a universal detection model. Specifically, an unbalanced episode training paradigm is proposed for meta-task construction, which simulates the category-imbalance scenarios inherent to HTD by adaptively adjusting the support set, enabling the acquisition of content-agnostic yet task-relevant transferable meta-knowledge. Additionally, elastic sparsity constraints are imposed on the feature extraction process across both spatial and spectral dimensions, enhancing the model’s generalization and discriminative capabilities. During the fine-tuning phase, we employ a pseudo-sample generation strategy based on segmented sampling and spatial–spectral hybrid augmentation to construct the training set, allowing for more accurate and comprehensive sample extraction from complex background regions. This strategy effectively mitigates underfitting caused by insufficient information. Furthermore, contrastive learning is incorporated to address complexities arising by multi-class background characteristics in the pseudo-binary classification task, improving the stability of the detection model. Our proposed algorithm demonstrates rapid target detection capabilities, and experiments on six public datasets indicate that it performs significantly better than existing state-of-the-art methods.

  abstract     = {Hyperspectral unmixing (HU) is a crucial method for interpreting remotely sensed hyperspectral images (HSIs), with the aim of splitting the image into pure spectral components (endmembers) and their abundance fractions in every pixel of the scene. However, the effectiveness of this procedure is hindered by the presence of noise and anomalies. These kind of disruptions mainly arise from real-world factors such as atmospheric effects and endmember variability. To address this challenge, a novel approach called Graph-Regularized Oblique Projection Weighted NMF (GOP-WNMF) is introduced, which is grounded in a more precise separation of signal and noise subspaces, aiming to enhance the accuracy and robustness of the analysis. GOP-WNMF achieves this by constructing an oblique projector that projects each pixel onto the signal subspace, i.e., the space formed by signatures of endmembers, and parallel to the noise subspace. This approach effectively suppresses noise while preserving crucial spectral information. Furthermore, our new oblique NMF framework includes a unique residual-based weighting approach to detect and remove anomalies in pixels and spectral bands simultaneously. In addition to this, another weighting matrix is proposed by establishing a bipartite graph connecting endmembers and pixels to promote smoothness and sparsity in the resulting abundance maps. GOP-WNMF also enhances abundance map estimation accuracy by mitigating the negative effects of pixel outliers through the utilization of Laplacian eigenmaps technique to maintain the manifold structure of data. The effectiveness of GOP-WNMF is evaluated through comprehensive testing on synthetic and real HSIs, and its superiority is demonstrated over multiple state-of-the-art approaches.

However, the presence of noise can lead to the misidentification of features and distort data representation. Existing robust feature selection algorithms typically discard noisy features, leading to the loss of potentially beneficial information. Additionally, these methods are often hindered by the difficulty of tuning sparse regularization parameters, further affecting generalization. To address this, we propose a method for improving the noise tolerance of robust feature selection (NTRFS), which actively identifies and exploits beneficial noise during the selection process to enhance robustness. Specifically, NTRFS incorporates block-sparse projection learning with ℓ 2 , 1 -norm minimization, enhancing the model’s robustness to noise while preserving key features by leveraging the informative aspects of noise. Furthermore, by integrating anomaly estimation with adaptive weighting, NTRFS utilizes noise-tolerant information to promote the discovery of class prototypes, adjusting the weight of each feature based on its informative saliency. Additionally, the proposed ℓ 2 , 0 -norm constrained block-sparse projection learning module enhances discriminative power by exploiting local geometric relationships in data manifolds, without requiring regularization parameter tuning. Finally, to tackle the non-convex trace ratio and NP-hard block sparsity problems, we propose an efficient iterative optimization algorithm with guaranteed convergence. Experimental results on several real-world datasets show that NTRFS enhances robustness and improves classification performance by leveraging noise, outperforming advanced robust FS methods.},

Typically, FER models either overfit to the mislabeled samples or underfit to the hard samples, resulting in degraded performance. However, most existing methods fail to address both issues simultaneously. To overcome this limitation, this paper introduces a novel FER method called Noise-Hard robust Graph (NHG), which dynamically supervises the updating of the adjacency matrix in the Graph Convolutional Networks, striking a balance between suppressing the impacts of noisy labels and encouraging learning from hard samples. First, we map high-dimensional facial expression features onto low-dimensional manifolds to initialize the topological relationships between the samples, thus measuring the hard sample relationships more accurately. Second, we design a Label Consistency Mask (LCM) strategy to retain potential connections for hard sample learning. LCM could also potentially preserve correct connections while noisy labels exist, supporting noise-robust learning. Third, based on differences in trends of ℓ 2 -norm variation between mislabeled samples and hard samples, the ℓ 2 -norm regularization (L2R) suppresses the learning of mislabeled samples while preserving the learning potential of hard samples and suppressing the propagation of their features within the graph. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art methods in scenarios with noisy labels and hard samples.},

  abstract     = {Recently, most existing point cloud frameworks tend to utilize max pooling aggregation functions to aggregate local point cloud features. However, when handling data containing local high-frequency noise such as local drop, addition, and jitter, this mechanism leads to high-frequency noise that spreads from local to global and causes severe performance degradation. To address this issue, we creatively extend the concepts from the physical field, namely electrostatic field and Coulomb force into geometric processing. To be specific, we treat the entire point cloud placed in an electrostatic field and each point as a probe charge and then equip this field with a set of source charges according to the structure of the cloud. We endow these two types of charges with different electric quantities, which could encode informative geometrical structural information. By analogously computing the Coulomb force between the probe charge and its corresponding source charge, we finally propose an explicit embedding called Point Geometric Coulomb Force (PGCF) for each point. Due to the deep use of the structural information of the point cloud and the fact that the electrostatic field of each source charge could not be affected by the variations of the probe charges, the PGCF has been proven to provide richer geometric information while being robust to local noises. Using the PGCF combined with point coordinates as inputs can significantly improve the performances of existing 3D point cloud feature extraction frameworks, including point convolution, graph convolution, and point transformer, without additional parameters or computational overhead, thus not affecting their inference speed. Experimental results show that integrating the PGCF into existing works brings more desirable results in a wide range of 3D point cloud analysis tasks, including classification, part segmentation, and semantic segmentation.},

  abstract     = {Deep metric learning is fundamental to open-set pattern recognition and has become a focal point of research in recent years. Significant efforts have been devoted to designing sampling, mining, and weighting strategies within algorithmic-level deep metric learning (DML) loss objectives. However, less attention has been paid to input-level but essential data transformations. In this paper, we develop a novel mechanism, independent domain embedding augmentation learning (IDEAL) method. It can simultaneously learn multiple independent embedding spaces for multiple domains generated by predefined data transformations. Our IDEAL is orthogonal to existing DML techniques and can be seamlessly combined with one DML approach for enhanced performance. Empirical results on visual retrieval tasks demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method. For instance, IDEAL significantly improves the performance of both Multi-Similarity (MS) Loss and Hypergraph-Induced Semantic Tuplet (HIST) loss. Specifically, it boosts the Recall @ 1 from 84.5% → 87.1% for MS Loss on Cars-196 and from 65.8% → 69.5% on CUB-200. Similarly, for HIST loss, IDEAL improves the performance on Cars-196 from 87.4% → 90.3%, on CUB-200 from 69.7% to 72.3%. It significantly outperforms methods using basic network architectures (e.g., ResNet-50, BN-Inception), such as XBM and Intra-Batch.

  abstract     = {Facial expression recognition plays a crucial role in understanding human emotions and behavior. However, existing models often exhibit biases and imbalance towards diverse expression classes. To address this problem, we propose an Adaptive Mask-Guide Supervised Network (AMGSN) to enhance the uniform performance of the facial expression recognition models. We propose an adaptive mask guidance mechanism to mitigate bias and ensure uniform performance across different expression classes. AMGSN focuses on learning the ability to distinguish facial features with under-expressed expressions by dynamically generating masks during pre-training. Specifically, we employ an asymmetric encoder–decoder architecture, where the encoder encodes only the unmasked visible regions, while the lightweight decoder reconstructs the original image using latent representations and mask markers. By utilizing dynamically generated masks and focusing on informative regions, these models effectively reduce the interference of confounding factors, thus enhancing the discriminative power of the learned representation. In the pre-training stage, we introduce the Attention-Based Mask Generator (ABMG) to identify salient regions of expressions. Additionally, we advance the Mask Ratio Update Strategy (MRUS), which utilizes image reconstruction loss, to adjust the mask ratio for each image during pre-training. In the finetune stage, debiased center loss and contrastive loss are introduced to optimize the network to ensure the overall performance of expression recognition. Extensive experimental results on several standard datasets demonstrate that the proposed AMGSN significantly improves both balance and accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods. For example, AMGSN reached 89.34% on RAF-DB, and 62.83% on AffectNet, respectively, with a standard deviation of only 0.0746 and 0.0484. This demonstrates the effectiveness of our improvements 1 .},

  abstract     = {Deep learning has achieved significant advancements in both low-level and high-level computer vision tasks, which can also drive the development of an essential research field of Image Compressive Sensing (ICS) today and in the future. Nowadays model-inspired ICS reconstruction methods have gained considerable attention from researchers, resulting in numerous new developments. However, existing literature lacks a comprehensive summary of these advancements. To revitalize the field of ICS, it is crucial to summarize them to provide valuable insights for various other fields and practical applications. Thus, this article first looks back on foundational theories of ICS, including signal sparse representation, sampling and reconstruction. Next, we summarize different types of measurement matrices for sampling, which include learnable/non-learnable measurement matrix, uniform/non-uniform measurement matrix. Then, we provide a detailed review of ICS reconstruction, covering traditional optimization reconstruction methods, inexplicable reconstruction methods and explainable reconstruction methods as well as Transformer-based reconstruction methods, which will help readers quickly grasp the history of ICS development. We also evaluate several representative ICS reconstruction methods on publicly available datasets, comparing their performance and computational complexities to highlight their strengths and weaknesses. Finally, we conclude this paper and their future opportunities and challenges are prospected. All related materials can be found at https://github.com/mdcnn/CS-Survey .},

However, LSTSVM is not without its limitations. It exhibits sensitivity to noise and outliers, fails to adequately incorporate the structural risk minimization (SRM) principle, and often demonstrates instability under resampling scenarios. Moreover, its computational complexity and reliance on matrix inversions hinder the efficient processing of large datasets. As a remedy to the aforementioned challenges, we propose the robust granular ball LSTSVM (GBLSTSVM). GBLSTSVM is trained using granular balls instead of original data points. The core of a granular ball is found at its center, where it encapsulates all the pertinent information of the data points within the ball of specified radius. To improve scalability and efficiency, we further introduce the large-scale GBLSTSVM (LS-GBLSTSVM), which incorporates the SRM principle through regularization terms. Experiments are performed on UCI, KEEL, and NDC benchmark dataset demonstrate that both the proposed GBLSTSVM and LS-GBLSTSVM models consistently outperform the baseline models.

  abstract     = {The structures of two pathways and the feature pyramid network (FPN) have achieved advanced performance in semantic segmentation. These two types of structures adopt different approaches to fuse low-level (shallow layer) spatial information and high-level (deep layer) semantic information. However, the segmentation results still lack local details due to the loss of information caused by simply fusing low-level feature details directly with multi-level deep features. To alleviate this problem, we propose an alignment feature pyramid network (AFPN) for real-time semantic segmentation. It can efficiently utilize both the low-level spatial information and high-level semantic information. Specifically, our AFPN consists of two components: the pooling enhancement attention block (PEAB) and the dual pooling alignment block (DPAB). The PEAB can effectively extract global information by using an aggregation pooling operation. The DPAB performs two types of pooling operations along the channel and spatial dimensions, reducing the differences between multi-scale feature maps. Extensive experiments show that AFPN achieves a better balance between accuracy and speed. On the Cityscapes, CamVid, and ADE20K datasets, AFPN achieves 78.75%, 79.24%, and 39.56% mIoU and the speed meets the real-time requirement.

Existing disentanglement methods are mostly based on the prior assumption that latent variables are mutually independent, which is inconsistent with reality and fails to transmit causal effects among causal nodes. To address the above issues, we introduce a novel disentanglement representation learning model with causal effect transmission, named DRL CET . The main ideas of DRL CET involve (1) mapping encoded latent exogenous variables to causal variables and updating the causal structure by a constructed nonlinear/linear structural causal model (SCM), (2) designing hierarchical feature loss from discriminator to replace pixel-level loss in variational autoencoder for efficiently extracting causal features, and (3) aggregating causal information from adjacent nodes by a graph attention network (GAT) with intervention for transmitting causal effects. Extensive theoretical analyses and empirical studies on synthetic and real datasets demonstrate the effectiveness, viability, and superiority of our DRL CET over the state-of-the-arts.

  abstract     = {Animating stylized head avatars with dynamic poses and expressions has become an important focus in recent research due to its broad range of applications (e.g. VR/AR, film and animation, privacy protection). Previous research has made significant progress by training controllable generative models to animate the reference avatar using the target pose and expression. However, existing portrait animation methods are mostly trained using human faces, making them struggle to generalize to stylized avatar references such as cartoon, painting, and 3D-rendered avatars. Moreover, the mechanisms used to animate avatars – namely, to control the pose and expression of the reference – often inadvertently introduce unintended features – such as facial shape – from the target, while also causing a loss of intended features, like expression-related details. This paper proposes AniFaceDiff, a Stable Diffusion based method with a new conditioning module for animating stylized avatars. First, we propose a refined spatial conditioning approach by Facial Alignment to minimize identity mismatches, particularly between stylized avatars and human faces. Then, we introduce an Expression Adapter that incorporates additional cross-attention layers to address the potential loss of expression-related information. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, particularly in the most challenging out-of-domain stylized avatar animation, i.e., domains unseen during training. It delivers superior image quality, identity preservation, and expression accuracy. This work enhances the quality of virtual stylized avatar animation for constructive and responsible applications. To promote ethical use in virtual environments, we contribute to the advancement of face manipulation detection by evaluating state-of-the-art detectors, highlighting potential areas for improvement, and suggesting solutions.},

However, existing studies often overlook the semantic consistency between these features, which limits the potential relationships among different attributes and hinders the effective utilization of this information in anomaly detection. To address this issue, we propose a video anomaly detection framework based on Semantic Consistency and Multi-Attribute Feature Complementarity (SC-MAFC). Specifically, we design a three-branch encoder–decoder network to separately encode and predict appearance, optical flow, and pose features. By comparing the consistency differences between appearance and other attribute features at normal and anomalous moments, we can use these differences as the basis for anomaly detection. To better capture these differences, we introduce a Spatial-Channel Feature Complementarity Module (SCFCM), allowing different attribute features to complement each other and helping the model more accurately understand the semantic consistency of normal events, thus improving its ability to recognize the semantic consistency in normal events. Additionally, to further enhance detection performance, we introduce a memory module to degrade the reconstruction quality of features at anomalous moments, by which large errors are generated in future frame predictions, making anomalies more pronounced and easier to detect. It was evaluated on three benchmark datasets: UCSD Ped2, Avenue, and ShanghaiTech. The method proved effective, achieving AUC scores of 99.4% on UCSD Ped2, 93.9% on Avenue, and 84.6% on ShanghaiTech, demonstrating its robustness in various scenarios.

  abstract     = {Integrating Facial Expression Recognition (FER) with deep learning techniques has significantly enhanced emotion analysis performance in the past decade. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and attention mechanisms facilitate the automatic extraction of complex features from facial expressions. However, current methods often face challenges in accurately capturing subtle variations in expressions, tend to be computationally intensive, and are susceptible to overfitting. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a lightweight FER model based on multi-head hybrid attention networks (MHAN). It designs two innovative modules: efficient local attention mixed feature network (ELA-MFN) and multi-head hybrid attention mechanism (MHAtt). The former integrates multi-scale convolutional kernels with the ELA attention mechanism to enhance feature representation while ensuring precise localization of critical areas, all within a lightweight framework. The latter utilizes multiple attention heads to generate attention maps and capture subtle distinctions in expressions. With only 4.27M parameters (94% reduction from POSTER’s 71.8M), MHAN effectively reduces computational resource requirements, and can be efficiently implemented for both fully supervised and semi-supervised learning tasks. And it employs a smooth label loss function solving overfitting issue. We have validated the effectiveness of MHAN over three public datasets RAF-DB, AffectNet, and FERPlus, including cross-dataset tests. The results show that MHAN outperforms state-of-the-art models in terms of accuracy and computational complexity, demonstrating improved robustness. MHAN can also recognize the expressions of non-traditional datasets like sculptures, validating its cross-domain generalization capabilities.

In this context, state-of-the-art approaches are mainly based on learning a representation using a neural network optimized for a given task. The encoders optimized in this way can then be deployed as backbones for various downstream tasks. When the latter involves reasoning about spatial information from the image content (e.g. retrieve similar structured scenes or compare spatial configurations), this may be suboptimal since models like convolutional neural networks struggle to reason about the relative position of objects in images. Previous studies on building hand-crafted spatial representations, thanks to Relative Position Descriptors (RPD), showed they were powerful to discriminate spatial relations between crisp objects, but such spatial descriptors have rarely been integrated into deep neural networks. We propose in this article different strategies embedded in a common framework called SpIRL (SPatially-aware Image Representation Learning) to guide the optimization of encoders to make them learn more spatial information, under the supervision of an RPD and with the help of a novel dataset (44k images) that does not induce learning semantic information. By using these strategies, we aim to help encoders build more spatially-aware representations.

  abstract     = {Unsupervised video anomaly detection (VAD) trains only normal events to detect anomalies by large discrepancies during testing. Expanding the discriminative boundary between normal and abnormal events is the common goal and challenge of unsupervised VAD. To address this problem, we propose a Bidirectional Skip-frame Prediction (BiSP) method, leveraging intra-domain disparities between different features. Specifically, the BiSP skips frames in the training phase to achieve the forward and backward prediction respectively, and in the testing phase, it utilizes bidirectional consecutive frames to co-predict the same intermediate frames. Furthermore, we design the variance channel attention and context spatial attention from the perspectives of movement patterns and object scales, respectively. This design maximizes of the disparity between normal and abnormal in the feature extraction and delivery with different dimensions. Extensive experiments from four benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed BiSP, which substantially outperforms state-of-the-art competing methods.

  abstract     = {Creating high-quality dynamic human avatars within acceptable costs remains challenging in computer vision and computer graphics. The neural radiance field (NeRF) has become a fundamental means of generating human avatars due to its success in novel view synthesis. However, the storage-intensive and time-consuming per-scene training due to the transformation and evaluation of massive sampling points constrains its practical applications. In this paper, we introduce a novel lightweight NeRF model, LiteNeRFAvatar, to overcome these limits. To avoid the high-cost backward transformation of the sampling points, LiteNeRFAvatar decomposes the appearance features of clothed humans into multiple local feature spaces and transforms them forward according to human movements. Each local feature space affects a limited local area and is represented by an explicit feature volume created by the tensor decomposition techniques to support fast access. The sampling points retrieve the features based on the relative positions to the local feature spaces. The densities and the colors are then regressed from the aggregated features using a tiny decoder. We also adopt an empty space skipping strategy to further reduce the number of sampling points. Experimental results demonstrate that our LiteNeRFAvatar achieves a satisfactory balance between synthesis quality, training time, rendering speed and parameter size compared to the existing NeRF-based methods. For the demo of our method, please refer to the link on: https://youtu.be/UYfreeHtIZY . The source code will be released after the paper is accepted.},

  abstract     = {Accurate segmentation of medical images is essential for clinical diagnosis and treatment planning. However, deep learning-based segmentation models are data-intensive, requiring large, well-annotated datasets which is an often challenging and costly requirement in medical fields. To reduce the reliance on manual labeling, we propose the minimally supervision based on an exemplar, leveraging only a single labeled sample while making full use of the remaining unlabeled data. In this case, two challenges need to be addressed. First, a lack of sufficient prior information: relying solely on a single exemplar limits the model’s ability to capture complex semantics. Second, the unreliability of pseudo labels: noise and inaccuracies in these labels introduce bias, hindering segmentation performance. To overcome these challenges, we propose a new pseudo-labeling paradigm by diffusion calibration. Follow this paradigm, we introduce Caudo-Diff, a novel method for calibrating pseudo labels using a deterministic diffusion model in a guided latent space, aiming to supplement prior information and improve pseudo-labeling reliability. Initial pseudo labels and features extracted by the segmentation network guide the model to focus on meaningful semantic regions. The pseudo labels are then refined to reduce noise and errors, enhancing segmentation accuracy. Experimental results show that Caudo-Diff improves segmentation performance with minimal supervision, offering a practical solution to the challenge of annotation scarcity in medical image segmentation.},

  abstract     = {Neural decoding has always been the cutting-edge neuroscience issue, significant progress has been made in neural decoding with the support of deep learning technology. However, these breakthroughs are based on large-scale fully annotated functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data, which greatly hinders its further applicability. Recently, foundation models have garnered considerable attention in the realm of natural language processing, computer vision, and multimodal data processing due to their ability to circumvent the need for extensive annotated datasets while achieving notable accuracy gains. Nevertheless, the formulation of effective foundation model approaches tailored for connectivity-based complex spatio-temporal brain networks remains an unresolved challenge. To address these issues, in this paper, we proposed a general Temporal-Aware Graph Self-supervised Contrastive learning framework (TAGSC) for fMRI-based neural decoding. Concretely, it includes three innovative improvements to enhance fMRI-based graph foundation models: (i) a spatio-temporal augmentation strategy considers spatial brain region synergy and temporal information continuity to generate brain spatio-temporal contrastive views; (ii) a temporal-aware feature extractor learns brain spatio-temporal representations, which fully takes into account the continuous consistency of brain state transitions and fetches brain spatio-temporal interaction information from local to global; (iii) a fine-grained consistency loss assists in contrastive optimization from both temporal and spatial perspectives. Extensive evaluation on publicly available fMRI datasets demonstrated the superior performance of the proposed TAGSC and revealed biomarkers related to different states of the brain. To the best of our knowledge, it is among the earliest attempts to employ a spatio-temporal pre-trained model for neural decoding.},

  abstract     = {Partial multi-label learning (PML) aims to learn from instances with weak supervision, where each instance is associated with a set of candidate labels, among which only a subset is valid. Most existing approaches rely on identical feature representations to distinguish all class labels, overlooking the inherent distinctiveness of different labels, which leads to suboptimal model performance. Although recent studies have attempted to address this limitation by tailoring label-specific features, critical shortcomings remain: (1) isolated processing of feature tailoring and label disambiguation fails to leverage their synergistic relationship, and (2) direct extraction of label-specific features from the original feature space tends to yield unreliable results due to inherent noise and disturbances. This paper proposes a unified PML framework that jointly performs label disambiguation, embedded label-specific feature learning, and model induction. Within this framework, identifying ground-truth labels and generating label-specific features mutually reinforce each other, leading to continuous refinement. By customizing features from a compact and noise-free embedded space, the framework further ensures robustness and reliability in learning. Specifically, low-rank and sparse decomposition is employed to separate ground-truth labels from noisy ones, while a linear embedding discriminant model simultaneously generates embedded label-specific features and induces the model. Moreover, we enhance the classifier’s accuracy by assuming that the input and output spaces share local geometric structures, encouraging similar instances to have similar label sets. Extensive experiments on sixty-six real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract     = {Existing image fusion methods utilize elaborate encoders to sequentially extract shallow and deep features from the source images. However, most methods lack long-term dependence, i.e. shallow details are inevitably lost when the network encodes deep features. To this end, some methods employ skip connections or dense connections to directly assign shallow features into deeper layers, potentially introducing redundant information and increasing computational loads. To overcome these drawbacks and enhance the generalization ability for low-quality scenarios, a novel fusion architecture based on Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) termed as MemoryFusion is proposed. First, the Input Extension Encoder (IEE) transfers the source image into a feature sequence. Then a Recurrent Fusion Encoder (RFE) containing Recurrent Memory Fusion Unit (RMFU) is designed to learn the intrinsic correlation between the multi-modality feature sequences and generate the fusion feature sequence. This memory fusion unit utilizes a special gating mechanism to incorporate historical information and current input, and then adaptively selects the valuable content and forgets the redundant information. More importantly, it effectively relieves the computational pressure. Finally, since the modality information is distributed at different sequence depths and varying illumination intensity, the Multi-hierarchical Aggregation Module (MHAM) is designed to obtain the corresponding weight sequence. The aggregated fusion feature is obtained by integrating the fusion feature sequence with the weight sequence. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MemoryFusion is superior to the state-of-the-art fusion methods on multiple datasets. Even on low-quality images, such as low-light or foggy conditions, our method also demonstrates exceptional fusion performance and scene fidelity.},

Although recent shadow removal algorithms have achieved impressive results on benchmark datasets, shadows in such datasets are typically centralized and captured in relatively straightforward scenes. In contrast, real-world shadows tend to exhibit complex and irregular patterns due to the random distribution of objects, causing global processing methods to produce false positives and missed corrections. To address these challenges, this paper presents an end-to-end shadow removal framework leveraging Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), allowing simple bounding boxes to annotate targeted shadows. Our approach employs a novel chunked processing training strategy, which decomposes global shadow removal into iterative local refinements. Additionally, a Split-Channel module and an Edge-Weighted loss are incorporated to maintain consistent color and smooth edge transitions during restoration. Furthermore, an HSI-based shadow detection algorithm is proposed to generate shadow masks, facilitating end-to-end shadow removal. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods on ISTD and SRD datasets, and exhibits robust performance on real-world images, effectively reducing restoration errors.},

  abstract     = {Accurate classification of blood cells is of vital significance in the diagnosis of hematological disorders, facilitating timely treatments for patients. However, in real-world scenarios, domain shifts caused by the variability in laboratory procedures and settings often result in rapid deterioration in model generalization performance. To address this issue, we propose a novel domain-invariant representation learning via the Segment Anything Model (SAM) for blood cell classification, referred to as DoRL. The DoRL comprises two main components: a LoRA-based SAM (LoRA-SAM) and a cross-domain autoencoder (CAE). The key advantage of DoRL is the ability to extract domain-invariant representations from various blood cell datasets in an unsupervised manner. Specifically, we first leverage the large-scale foundation model SAM, fine-tuned with LoRA, to generate robust and transferable visual representations of blood cells. Furthermore, we introduce the CAE to learn domain-invariant representations from the image embeddings across different-domain datasets. The CAE mitigates the impact of image artifacts and other domain-specific variations, ensuring the learned representations more generalizable. To validate the effectiveness of domain-invariant representations, we employ five widely used machine learning classifiers to construct blood cell classification models. Experimental results on two public blood cell datasets and a private real-world dataset demonstrate that our proposed DoRL achieves a new state-of-the-art cross-domain performance, surpassing existing methods by a significant margin. The DoRL, with its novel integration of LoRA-SAM and cross-domain autoencoding, provides a robust and effective solution for enhancing the generalization capabilities of blood cell classification models, potentially improving patient care and outcomes.

In online settings, the NCCP offers significant computational advantages while maintaining a comparable predictive efficiency. In batch settings, inductive NCCP (INCCP) can outperform inductive CP (ICP) by utilising the full training dataset without requiring a separate calibration set, leading to improved efficiency, particularly when the data are limited.

To overcome this limitation, we propose an unpaired image dehazing network, called the Simple Image Dehaze Enhancer via Unpaired Rich Physical Prior (UR2P-Dehaze). First, to accurately estimate the illumination, reflectance, and color information of the hazy image, we design a Shared Prior Estimator (SPE) that is iteratively trained to ensure the consistency of illumination and reflectance, generating clear, high-quality images.

Inspired by the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), we propose SceneLLM , a novel framework that leverages LLMs as powerful scene analyzers for dynamic SGG. Our framework introduces a Video-to-Language (V2L) mapping module that transforms video frames into linguistic signals (scene tokens), making the input more comprehensible for LLMs. To better encode spatial information, we devise a Spatial Information Aggregation (SIA) scheme, inspired by the structure of Chinese characters, which encodes spatial data into tokens. Using Optimal Transport (OT), we generate an implicit language signal from the frame-level token sequence that captures the video’s spatio-temporal information. To further improve the LLM’s ability to process this implicit linguistic input, we apply Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to fine-tune the model. Finally, we use a transformer-based SGG predictor to decode the LLM’s reasoning and predict semantic triplets. Our method achieves state-of-the-art results on the Action Genome (AG) benchmark, and extensive experiments show the effectiveness of SceneLLM in understanding and generating accurate dynamic scene graphs.},

  abstract     = {Multi-label streaming feature selection has applied to various fields to deal with the applications that features arrive dynamically. However, most exist multi-label streaming feature selection methods ignore that a feature tends to provide more classification information for part of labels, rather than equal information for all labels. This phenomenon results part of labels get more information from selected features, while other labels lack information. In order to address the issue, we propose a novel multi-label streaming feature selection method. Firstly, we come up with the concept of affinity between features and labels. Secondly, we propose the concepts of affinity significance, affinity relevance and affinity redundancy to evaluate streaming features in three dimensions. Thirdly, we propose a novel multi-label streaming feature selection method named OMFS-FA. OMFS-FA has three phases to retain affinity significant features, remove affinity irrelevant features and remove affinity redundant features respectively. Finally, experiments on performance analysis, statistic analysis, number of selected features and running time analysis are conducted, verifying that OMFS-FA significantly outperforms other eleven methods in terms of effectiveness and efficiency.},

  abstract     = {Single Image Super Resolution (SISR) aims at characterizing fine-grain information given a low-resolution image. Recent progress shows that SISR can be viewed as a dynamic process that can be modeled using Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs). As a result, ODE inspired neural network shows superior performance with limited number of parameters, as well as interpretability for network structure. However, the current ODE based approach restricts the neural network structure to a static single-branch residual network, while dynamic structures can adaptively adjust their parameters(or even structures) best suitable for each test image and lead to better SISR performance. To take advantage of ODE and dynamic network structures in both, we introduce the Implicit Runge–Kutta scheme to construct an ODE-inspired multi-branch residual module that serves as a basic module, which is helpful to capture information at different scales. Then, an attention module is applied on the weights of the Implicit Runge–Kutta scheme to obtain a new dynamic network module, which is equivalent to encourage different branch to jointly attend different positions to obtain the best performance. Experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art ODE-inspired methods with less or comparable number of parameters.},

This paper introduces a novel incremental feature selection method using a regularization vector ( R V ) tailored for dynamic multi-scale interval valued fuzzy decision systems ( D - M I v F D ) . The paper first establishes the concepts of object affiliation relation and class, providing a theoretical basis for integrating replay and regularization. It then introduces the affiliation contradictory state ( A C S ) and R V , broadening the application of contradictory state ( C S ) in dynamic settings and enabling efficient feature selection. The integration of regularization and replay strategies is realized through four algorithms designed for different update patterns. Empirical results across various datasets show that the proposed method significantly outperforms multiple conventional techniques, highlighting its practical potential for real-world deployments.},

The Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (Lasso) is a sparse learning model used for this purpose. However, due to the correlation structure of data, Lasso can become unstable in its feature selection. This instability is further amplified in econometric panel data because of unobserved heterogeneity. Motivated by this challenge, we propose a correlation-based clustering-assisted sparse learning model (C2SLM) based on Lasso for a BEV market demand forecasting problem in the U.S. state of Alabama. Three stages structure the C2SLM: (i) correlation-polarized feature generation, (ii) panel-based feature clustering, and (iii) clustering-assisted Lasso (caLasso). We specifically aggregate the data to capture heterogeneous market factors for the panel. We test the C2SLM against benchmark models with or without panel consideration. Our proposed model outperforms others and sheds significant insights into BEV policymaking. Additionally, our model performs consistently robustly on Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and S&P 500 stock trading market datasets.},

  abstract     = {Crafting adversarial examples for the transfer-based attack is challenging and remains a research hot spot. Currently, such attack methods are based on the hypothesis that the substitute model and the victim model learn similar decision boundaries, and they conventionally apply Sign Method (SM) to manipulate the gradient as the resultant perturbation. Although SM is efficient, it only extracts the sign of gradient units but ignores their value difference, which inevitably leads to a deviation. Therefore, we propose a novel Staircase Sign Method (S 2 M) to alleviate this issue, thus boosting attacks. Technically, our method heuristically divides the gradient sign into several segments according to the values of the gradient units, and then assigns each segment with a staircase weight for better crafting adversarial perturbation. As a result, our adversarial examples perform better in both white-box and black-box manner without being more visible. Since S 2 M just manipulates the resultant gradient, our method can be generally integrated into the family of FGSM algorithms, and the computational overhead is negligible. Extensive experiments on the ImageNet dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed methods, which significantly improve the transferability ( i.e. , on average, 5.8% for normally trained models and 12.8% for adversarially trained defenses).

However, the drastic scale changes and wide variations in shape (aspect ratio) of objects in drone images result in a sharp performance drop for general LA strategies. To address the above problems, we propose an adaptive Gaussian sample selection strategy for multi-scale objects via shape sensing. Specifically, we first conduct Gaussian modeling for receptive field priors and ground-truth (gt) boxes, ensuring that the non-zero distance metric between any feature point and any ground truth on the whole image is obtained. Subsequently, we theoretically analyze and show that Kullback–Leibler Divergence (KLD) can measure distance according to the characteristics of the object. Taking advantage of this property, we utilize the statistical characteristics of the top-K highest KLD-based matching scores as the positive sample selection threshold for each gt, thereby assigning adequate high-quality samples to multi-scale objects. More importantly, we introduce an adaptive shape-aware strategy that adjusts the sample quantity according to the aspect ratio of objects, guiding the network to balanced learning for multi-scale objects with various shapes. Extensive experiments show that our dynamic shape-aware LA strategy is applicable to a variety of advanced detectors and achieves consistently improved performances on two major benchmarks (i.e., VisDrone and UAVDT), demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach.},

In this paper, to overcome the obstacle of multi-view fusion caused by unaligned samples and achieve efficient unaligned multi-view clustering, a novel Diversified Anchor Graph Fusion (DAGF) method is proposed. Specifically, view-specific bipartite graphs with diversified anchors are constructed to adapt to the characteristics of unaligned multi-view data. Then, with the devised sample alignment and anchor integration strategy, these bipartite graphs are fused to learn a joint bipartite graph with explicit cluster membership structure. The proposed DAGF method not only overcomes the adverse effects of unaligned samples on cross-view information fusion, but also preserves complementary view-specific clustering structure information, enabling efficient and effective clustering. Systematic experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate the advantages of the DAGF method in both clustering performance and computational complexity.

To effectively reduce the training cost, we propose a novel method that can make efficient use of pre-trained models to infer kernel machine models with different hyper-parameters. Our pre-training-based method is built on top of theoretical foundations. The difference between the model inferred based on pre-training and the optimal model is theoretically bounded by a constant.

However, these methods primarily focus on the overall generalization performance of the model while lacking an explicit mechanism for modeling boundary features. This imbalance between global consistency and local boundaries results in suboptimal boundary segmentation. In this work, we propose a boundary feature alignment (BFA) method for semi-supervised medical image segmentation to address the challenge of accurately localizing boundaries. Our core idea is to encourage the model to learn universal boundary feature representations for both labeled and unlabeled images during the core stage of feature extraction. Specifically, we design 3D boundary extractors tailored to extract both label and pseudo-label boundaries, achieving stable and salient boundaries. By mixing label and pseudo-label boundaries, the encoder is encouraged to learn a universal boundary feature representation. This process enables the early embedding of boundary features and implicitly fosters alignment across different annotation states. We implemented BFA within the mean-teacher framework and conducted extensive experiments on semi-supervised medical image segmentation datasets, including Left Atrium (LA), Pancreas-CT, and ACDC. The experimental results demonstrate that this simple and effective mechanism is highly efficient. Compared to existing methods, our approach achieved state-of-the-art performance.

To counter this, we suggest a straightforward nearest-neighbor class prototype search approach for deducing task labels, which improves the alignment with appropriate prompts. Additionally, we boost task label inference accuracy by embedding prompts within the query function itself, thereby enabling better feature extraction from the samples. To further minimize inter-task confusion in cross-task classification, we incorporate simulated logits into the classifier during training. These logits emulate strong responses from other tasks, aiding in the refinement of the classifier’s decision boundaries.

However, deploying IGS on edge devices introduces strict efficiency requirements, and the intricate shapes and weak visual features of gases pose significant challenges for accurate segmentation. To address these challenges, we propose GasSeg, a dual-branch network that leverages boundary and contextual cues to achieve real-time and precise IGS. Firstly, a Boundary-Aware Stem is introduced to enhance boundary sensitivity in shallow layers by leveraging fixed gradient operators, facilitating efficient feature extraction for gases with diverse shapes. Subsequently, a dual-branch architecture comprising a context branch and a boundary guidance branch is employed, where boundary features refine contextual representations to alleviate errors caused by blurred contours. Finally, a Contextual Attention Pyramid Pooling Module captures key information through context-aware multi-scale feature aggregation, ensuring robust gas recognition under subtle visual conditions. To advance IGS research and applications, we introduce a high-quality real-world IGS dataset comprising 6,426 images. Experimental results demonstrate that GasSeg outperforms state-of-the-art models in both accuracy and efficiency, achieving 90.68% mIoU and 95.02% mF1, with real-time inference speeds of 215 FPS on a GPU platform and 62 FPS on an edge platform.

  abstract     = {Nighttime photography encounters escalating challenges in extremely low-light conditions, primarily attributable to the ultra-low signal-to-noise ratio. For real-world deployment, a practical solution must not only produce visually appealing results but also require minimal computation. However, most existing methods are either focused on improving restoration performance or employ lightweight models at the cost of quality. This paper proposes a lightweight network that outperforms existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods in low-light enhancement tasks while minimizing computation. The proposed network incorporates Siamese Self-Attention Block (SSAB) and Skip-Channel Attention (SCA) modules, which enhance the model’s capacity to aggregate global information and are well-suited for high-resolution images. Additionally, based on our analysis of the low-light image restoration process, we propose a Two-Stage Framework that achieves superior results. Our model can restore a UHD 4K resolution image with minimal computation while keeping SOTA restoration quality.},

At present, cardiac function quantification mainly relies on segmentation based methods or regression-based methods. Segmentation based methods are affected by the accuracy of the segmentation results, while regression-based methods lack interpretability. In this paper, we propose a hypergraph-driven landmark recognition foundation model on echocardiogram for cardiac function quantification. We leverage an adaptive dynamic hypergraph (ADH) foundation backbone to capture long-range correlations with enhanced controllability and stability. Simultaneously, we introduce a bidirectional hypergraph spatio-temporal (BHST) decoder that uses hypergraphs to capture spatial relationships between landmarks, while incorporating both forward and backward propagation to capture temporal dependencies. The model was trained and evaluated on large scale datasets (more than 10,000 patients and including public datasets CAMUS and EchoNet-Dynamic, as well as a private dataset EchoStrain). Experimental results show that our method outperforms other deep learning methods for landmark detection and cardiac function quantification relevant indicators (LVEF and GLS).

  abstract     = {Dynamic functional connectivity (FC) analysis based on resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) is widely used for automated diagnosis of brain disorders. A large number of dynamic FC analysis methods rely on sliding window techniques to extract time-varying features of brain activity from localized time periods. However, these methods are sensitive to window parameters and individual differences, leading to significant variability in the extracted features and impacting the stability and accuracy of disease classification. Additionally, while dynamic graph learning holds promise in modeling time-varying brain networks, existing methods still encounter difficulties in effectively capturing spatio-temporal dynamic information. Therefore, in this paper we propose a multi-task dynamic graph learning framework (MT-DGL) to align FC trajectories and learn the spatio-temporal dynamic information for brain disease recognition. The MT-DGL mainly includes three parts: (1) SPD-valued FC trajectory alignment module for overcoming the model’s dependence on sliding window parameters and mitigating the impact of asynchrony in execution rates across individuals, (2) Mamba-based multi-scale dynamic graph learning module for extracting spatio-temporal dynamic features from fMRI time series, and (3) multi-scale fusion and multi-task learning strategy to enhance the model’s understanding of age-related brain FC changes and improve the effectiveness of brain disorder identification. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method exhibits excellent performance in several publicly available fMRI datasets. Specifically, on the largest site in the ABIDE dataset, the accuracy and area under the curve reached 73.9% and 74.9%, respectively.},

  abstract     = {In semantic segmentation, pixels often share the same mask labels across a vast region. However, in recent prevalent transformer-based models, predictions frequently suffer from incompleteness or discontinuities. The dilemma is caused by sparse activation of vanilla self-attention during feature extraction. During the vanilla self-attention, each query over-focuses on a small number of relevant keys but neglects numerous keys sharing the same category with it, restricting the capture of universal feature representation for its category. Such sparsely activated self-attention will further cause unignorable feature differences among tokens sharing the same class in feature maps, introducing noise on final predictions. To reduce such differences, we propose the Densely Activated self-attention Module (DAM), a novel pluggable module designed to generate densely activated self-attention. Inserted after the encoder, it encourages each query to attend to a broader range of keys, obtaining more consistent features. Experimental results on three widely used benchmarks with six different baselines demonstrate that DAM consistently improves performance with a negligible increase in parameters and FLOPs. Our work provides a new perspective on the behavior of self-attention in semantic segmentation.},

  abstract     = {Forward regularization (-F) with unsupervised knowledge was advocated to replace canonical Ridge regularization (-R) in online linear learners, as it achieved a lower relative regret boundary. However, we observe that -F cannot perform as expected in practice, even possibly losing to -R for online tasks. We identify two main causes for this: (1) inappropriate intervened regularization, and (2) non-i.i.d. nature and data distribution changes in online learning (OL), both of which result in unstable posterior distribution and optima offset of the learner. To improve these, we first introduce the adjustable forward regularization (- k F), a more general -F with controllable knowledge intervention. We also derive - k F’s incremental updates with variable learning rate, and study relative regret and boundary in OL. Inspired by the regret analysis, to curb unstable penalties, we further propose - k F-Bayes style with k synchronously self-adapted to revise the intractable tuning of - k F by considering parametric posterior distribution changes in non-i.i.d. online data streams. Additionally, we integrate the - k F and - k F-Bayes into a multi-layer ensemble deep random vector functional link (edRVFL) and present two practical algorithms for batch learning, avoiding past replay and catastrophic forgetting. In experiments, we conducted tests on numerical simulation, tabular, and image datasets, where - k F-Bayes surpassed traditional -R and -F, highlighting the efficacy of ready-to-work - k F-Bayes and the great potentials of edRVFL- k F-Bayes in OL and continual learning (CL) scenarios.},

  abstract     = {Incremental learning is an important research spot that can help the model continually adapt to new data without forgetting old knowledge. In the field of object detection, existing works mainly focus on new-class incremental learning. However, in many practical applications, the well pre-trained object detection systems often suffer from abrupt performance degradations when adapting to new data domain, i.e. , the drastic changes in object size, class distribution and image context. To this end, we propose a new-instance incremental learning task for object detection, called Domain Incremental Learning with Limited Budgets (DILLB). DILLB adopts the conventional incremental setting to pre-train the detection network on the source dataset and incrementally fine-tune the network on the target domain. Its objective is to maximize the performance of the detector on the target dataset, while avoiding catastrophic forgetting on the source one. Meanwhile, to increase the challenge of DILLB, we also place strict restrictions on the access to label information of both source and target datasets, helping DILLB get closer to the practical applications. In terms of baselines, we not only reconstruct common approaches of incremental learning and domain adaption, but also propose a novel teacher–student based method for domain incremental object detection, which demonstrates obvious merits in improving performance and alleviating catastrophic forgetting. In this paper, we also propose a comprehensive experimental setup for DILLB to promote its research in object detection. Our source code is available at https://github.com/Disguiser15/DILLB .},

  abstract     = {With the growth of data and diverse data sources, clustering large-scale multi-view data has emerged as a prominent topic in the field of machine learning. Anchor graph is an efficient strategy to improve the scalability of graph based multi-view clustering methods because it can capture the essence of the entire dataset by utilizing only a small set of representative anchor points. However, most existing anchor graph based methods encounter at least one of the following two challenges: the first one is the separation of anchor selection from the anchor graph construction process, while the second one is the requirement of an additional clustering step to generate the indicator matrix. Both of the separated steps can potentially lead to suboptimal solutions. In this paper, we propose structure anchor graph learning for multi-view clustering (SAGL), which jointly addresses the two challenges within a unified learning framework. Specifically, instead of utilizing the fixed anchors selected during the pre-processing step, SAGL jointly learns the consensus anchors in the latent space, and constructs anchor graph by assigning larger similarity values to sample-anchor pairs with shorter distances. Meanwhile, by manipulating the connected components of the anchor graph with rank constraint, SAGL obtains the anchor graph with clear cluster structure that can directly reveal the indicator of samples without any post-processing step. As a result, it becomes a truly one-stage end-to-end learning problem. In addition, a simple yet effective transformation is introduced to convert vector-sum-from to matrix-multiplication-form with trace operation, which leads an efficient optimization algorithm. Extensive experiments on several real-world multi-view datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed methods over other state-of-the-art MvC methods.},

  abstract     = {Zero-shot learning (ZSL) aims to train deep neural networks to recognize objects from unseen classes, starting from a semantic description of the concepts. Neuro-symbolic (NeSy) integration refers to a class of techniques that incorporate symbolic knowledge representation and reasoning with the learning capabilities of deep neural networks. However, to date, few studies have explored how to leverage NeSy techniques to inject prior knowledge during the training process to boost ZSL capabilities. Here, we present Fuzzy Logic Prototypical Network (FLPN) that formulates the classification task as prototype matching in a visual-semantic embedding space, which is trained by optimizing a NeSy loss. Specifically, FLPN exploits the Logic Tensor Network (LTN) framework to incorporate background knowledge in the form of logical axioms by grounding a first-order logic language as differentiable operations between real tensors. This prior knowledge includes class hierarchies (classes and macroclasses) along with robust high-level inductive biases. The latter allow, for instance, to handle exceptions in class-level attributes and to enforce similarity between images of the same class, preventing premature overfitting to seen classes and improving overall performance. Both class-level and attribute-level prototypes through an attention mechanism specialized for either convolutional- or transformer-based backbones. FLPN achieves state-of-the-art performance on the GZSL benchmarks AWA2 and SUN, matching or exceeding the performance of competing algorithms with minimal computational overhead.

To realize precise makeup transfer and further associate with face component editing, we propose a Semantic Region Style-content Feature Transformation approach, which is referred to as SRSFT. Specifically, we encode both reference and source images into region-wise feature vectors and maps, based on semantic segmentation masks. To address the misalignment in poses and expressions, region-wise spatial transformations are inferred to align the reference and source masks, and are then applied to explicitly warp the reference feature maps to the source face, without any extra supervision. The resulting feature maps are fused with the source ones and inserted into a generator for image synthesis. On the other hand, the reference and source feature vectors are also fused and used to determine the modulation parameters at multiple intermediate layers. SRSFT is able to achieve superior beautification performance in terms of seamlessness and fidelity.},

However, most works suffer from issues such as low performance, lack of online systems, irrevocability, and are far from meeting practical demands. In response to these challenges, we propose a dual-factor brainwave verification system that integrates passwords with electroencephalogram (EEG) templates. Our approach involved conducting single-target experiments to select sequences, multi-target offline experiments to optimize parameters, and ultimately performed online experiments for validation. Using a 240 Hz refresh rate, we constructed a keyboard input for EEG signals using a 127-bit m-sequence code, and combined passwords with EEG signals to achieve online identification and authentication functionalities. We collected cross-day data from 30 participants, with a time interval of approximately six months. In the online system, the recognition accuracy was 99.2 % with a 4-digit password (4 s), 99.93 % with a 6-digit password (6 s), and 100 % with an 8-digit password (8 s). The equal error rates for online authentication were 1.79 % (4-digit password, 8 s), 1.03 % (6-digit password, 12 s), and 0.8 % (8-digit password, 16 s). The proposed system introduces dual-factor verification, significantly improving online performance in cross-day recognition and authentication. Simultaneously, it allows template replacement without the need for repeated registration, thus providing revocability and enhancing the system's resilience against attacks. These advantages position the proposed system favorably in the field of biometric recognition, contributing to the practical application of EEG-based identity verification systems.},

  abstract     = {The spatial and contextual information in whole slide images (WSIs) is crucial for improving the diagnostic accuracy of computer-aided diagnosis (CAD). Although existing hypergraph-based methods have shown their effectiveness in capturing complex contextual dependencies among patches, they still lack the generalizability across cancer types and diagnostic tasks. Foundation models can address this issue by utilizing the strategy of self-supervised pre-training on large-scale datasets, which allows knowledge transfer across different tissue types and diseases. However, existing hypergraph self-supervised approaches have yet to effectively integrate fine-grained local tissue features with global inter-region dependencies. To this end, we propose a Dual-Masked Contrastive Learning based Hypergraph Foundation Model for WSIs. For pre-training the HFM, a novel node-hyperedge dual-masked hypergraph modeling strategy is developed. It masks parts of the node and hyperedge features to generate two augmented hypergraphs, respectively, and then trains an HFM to reconstruct the masked features for capturing local relationships among nodes and hyperedges. To enhance the model's ability to learn global dependencies in WSIs, the contrastive constraints are imposed on the augmented hypergraphs. Moreover, a max-mask strategy mitigates overfitting by preventing over-reliance on dominant features. After pre-training, the proposed DMCL-HFM can be fine-tuned for various downstream tasks, such as cancer survival prediction and subtype classification. Extensive experiments on WSI datasets from different tissues and diseases validate the effectiveness of DMCL-HFM, which consistently outperforms existing graph- and hypergraph-based approaches, as well as hypergraph pre-training approaches.},

  abstract     = {Federated learning has transformed privacy-preserving medical image analysis, but the diversity of imaging equipment and conditions poses significant challenges in creating models that generalize effectively across domains. Current federated domain generalization (FedDG) methods often require partial information sharing, which may compromise privacy standards. To address this, we introduce the Federated Domain-Generalization Vision Enhancement and Consistency Assurance (FedDG-VECA) approach. This method enhances the generalization ability of federated learning by independently strengthening local node, integrating a Federated Vision Feature Extractor (FVFE) for global data capture and local fine-tuning, a Federated Vision Augmentation Strategy (FVAS) to simulate diverse image distributions, and a Federated Bootstrapped Consistency Assurance (FBCA) mechanism using a dual MLP network for stable, consistent model performance across varied data sources. Initial experiments confirm that FedDG-VECA significantly improves model generalization without compromising privacy, ensuring robust and consistent diagnostic capabilities across multiple institutions.},

  abstract     = {Recently, multi-modal learning that combines pathology images and transcriptomics has emerged as a promising paradigm for cancer survival prediction. However, existing methods fail to fully exploit the complex co-expressions between genes, resulting in inadequate learning of transcriptomics and compromised prediction accuracy. Moreover, most existing studies seek to enhance cross-modal learning through attention mechanisms, which often lead to quadratic complexity when processing high-dimensional pathology and transcriptomic data, hindering the comprehensive learning of cross-modal correlations. To tackle the above limitations, in this paper, we propose a novel Multi-modal Graph Convolutional Mamba (MGCM) framework for cancer survival prediction. Our framework constructs multi-modal graphs for pathology and transcriptomics to enhance intra-modal representations. Specifically, we organize transcriptomics into a co-expression network and leverage a multi-level graph convolutional network to fully capture expressions of individual genes and their co-expressions. Meanwhile, pathology images are also represented as graphs, where nodes correspond to image patches and edges reflect the spatial adjacency between patches. This pathology graph is learned in a sample-and-aggregate manner, which promotes the exploration of various characteristics in tumor cells and their microenvironment. To improve cross-modal interactions with computational efficiency, we introduce a progressive strategy, incorporating a Bi-Interactive Mamba block to model initial cross-modal correlations, followed by a Tri-Interactive Mamba block to prioritize critical information and filter out redundancy for further refinement. Extensive experiments on three cancer datasets from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) demonstrate the superiority of our compared to other state-of-the-art uni-modal and multi-modal survival prediction approaches.

The model unifies feature representation and classification under an interpretable sparse coding framework, optimized iteratively via a front-end fusion strategy. UD-SCF offers flexibility for integrating upstream and downstream components; in this work, we adopt deep non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) for feature extraction and inverse-projection sparse representation -based classification (SRC). The entire framework is optimized using a Mixed Gauss-Seidel and Jacobian ADMM (M-ADMM) algorithm, with theoretical convergence and stability analysis provided. Experimental results on public gene expression tumor datasets show that UD-SCF achieves outstanding multi-class tumor classification performance, with an average accuracy of 98.89 %, sensitivity of 100 %, specificity of 97.78 %, missed diagnosis rate of 0.00 %, and misdiagnosis rate of 2.22 %.},

Initially, we employ pretraining through contrastive learning to bolster the network's feature extraction capabilities. Subsequently, we engineer a hierarchical model that integrates dual attention mechanisms to extract multi-scale discriminative features. To overcome the convergence challenges and training instability inherent in patch-based methods, we implement group normalization in place of batch normalization.

Though most existing methods adopt neural networks to automatically extract discriminative features for forgery detection and have achieved promising results, significant challenges remain. Namely, when detecting forgery faces generated by unseen forgery methods, the detection performance degrades significantly, indicating poor generalization capability. To address such limitation, a novel deep supervised anomaly detection for generalized face forgery detection (DAGFD) is proposed in this paper. Specifically, the artifact map detector optimized by triplet focal loss and metric-softmax loss is first used to locate the forgery regions and obtain artifact maps. Next, forgery detection is reformulated from the supervised anomaly detection perspective, and the artifact map score is calculated to detect forgery videos. Furthermore, mean square error (MSE) loss is used to minimize the artifact map score of real samples while increase the one of forgery samples to generalize well to unseen forgery methods. Also, circle loss is used for auxiliary classifier to learn more discriminative artifact features. Finally, the experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method’s detection accuracy is better than other state-of-the-art methods.},

Recent WSSS methods exploit pseudo-labels generated from improved class activation maps (CAMs) to train a fine-grained classification model for semantic segmentation. However, these pseudo-labels are unreliable because they tend to either miss parts of the objects or include irrelevant regions due to weak guidance from individual images. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective iterative mix-up strategy, Pseudo-Label-based Mix (PL-Mix), that refines pseudo-labels iteratively, thereby further enhancing WSSS performance. During each iteration, we migrate object regions from pseudo-labels produced in previous steps and render them with new contexts in a mix-up fashion. Due to model consistency enforcement across varied backgrounds and new combinations of multiple objects from enriched image samples, these pseudo-labels progressively become more accurate and reliable. Further enhanced by a masking strategy and a CAM-based earth mover’s distance loss, we achieve state-of-the-art performance on the PASCAL VOC2012 and MS COCO2014 benchmark datasets.},

To address these, this paper introduces a Hybrid Quantum Sparse Coding with Dynamic Convolution Capsule Network (HQSC-DCCN). This multi-layer framework enhances image feature classification by incorporating advanced techniques for both local and global feature representation. Global semantic patterns are captured using the Residual Pooled Vision Transformer (RPViT), which combines hybrid pooled residual multihead attention for adaptive feature extraction. Residual local convolutional blocks focus on extracting local pattern extraction, while QSC enhances feature compression and ensures efficient convergence by avoiding local minima. The encoded features are enhanced using a Dynamic Graph Convolutional Network (D-GCN). The final classification is performed using a Dynamic Convolution Capsule Network (DCCN), which preserves spatial hierarchies, leading to improved classification performance and computational efficiency. The proposed HQSC-DCCN model achieves superior performance with an average classification accuracy of 98.59 %, a recall of 98.80 %, an F1 score of 98.32 %, and a specificity of 97.76 % averaged across five benchmark datasets.

  abstract     = {The arbitrary-scale image super-resolution (ASISR) method based on implicit neural representation has exhibited remarkable performance. However, it struggles with texture and edge structure restoration, particularly at large upsample scales. This limitation arises from employing per-pixel L 1 loss exclusively and lacking constraints on image edge information within the upsample modules. To address this issue, we propose a novel texture and edge-preserving interpolation approach that leverages Taylor expansion within the upsample module for ASISR task and introduce a gradient loss, enabling better capture of subtle changes and edge structures. Leveraging the approximation capabilities of Taylor expansion, our approach improves the utilization of information of surrounding pixels for more accurate image restoration. In particular, we confine the space of the recovered images to the Bounded Variation space by the gradient loss, allowing functions to exhibit skip discontinuities (i.e., sharp edges of the image) while limiting the total variation. Then, we apply the Taylor expansion-based interpolation within this constrained space to achieve high-quality restored images. This approach maintains the overall smoothness of the images while effectively restoring the edges. Additionally, we introduce a Gradient-based Attention Block that can be seamlessly integrated into the standard Swin Transformer Layer to capture high-frequency information within features. Experimental results demonstrate that our interpolation approach significantly enhances the recovery of edge structure information and texture in SR images, outperforming previous state-of-the-art methods, especially on Urban100 and Manga109 datasets, which have complex line structures and texture details.

  abstract     = {Recent methods for dynamic human reconstruction have achieved promising reconstruction results. Most of these methods rely only on RGB color supervision without considering explicit geometric constraints or physical priors. This makes existing human reconstruction techniques more prone to overfitting to color and causes inherent geometric ambiguities, especially in sparse multi-view setups. Motivated by recent advances in monocular geometry prediction, we consider the geometric constraints of estimated depth and normals in learning neural implicit representation for dynamic human reconstruction. As a geometric regularization, this provides reliable yet explicit supervision information and improves reconstruction quality. We also exploit several beneficial physical priors, such as adding noise to the view direction and maximizing density on the human surface. These priors ensure the color rendered along rays is robust to view direction and reduce the inherent ambiguities of density estimated along rays. Experimental results demonstrate that depth and normal cues, predicted by human-specific monocular estimators, can provide effective supervision signals and render more accurate images. Finally, we also show that the proposed physical priors significantly reduce overfitting and improve the quality of novel view synthesis.

  abstract     = {In crowdsourcing scenarios, each instance’s multiple noisy labels are collected from different crowd workers. Afterward, its integrated label is inferred through label integration. Because integrated labels always contain a certain level of noise, numerous noise correction algorithms have been proposed in recent years. However, almost all of them do not take into account the non-uniformity of label noise under the class-conditional noise (CCN) assumption. To our knowledge, confident learning, a framework of learning with noisy labels based on the CCN assumption, demonstrates robustness to non-uniform label noise. Therefore, this paper introduces confident learning into crowdsourcing scenarios and proposes a confident learning-based noise correction (CLNC) algorithm. In CLNC, we first concatenate each instance’s original attributes with its multiple noisy labels to construct an augmented attribute view and train a classifier on it. We then use this classifier to obtain a portion of predicted labels with high confidence. Subsequently, we use the original integrated labels and the predicted labels to filter instances, obtaining a clean set and a noisy set. Finally, we train two heterogeneous classifiers on the clean set to correct the instances in the noisy set. The experimental results on simulated and real-world crowdsourced datasets validate the effectiveness of our CLNC.},

  abstract     = {Continuous sign language recognition (CSLR) tasks typically rely on cross-modal alignment. However, due to the weakly supervised nature of CSLR, manual alignment often fails to align sign frames with glosses accurately. In this paper, we present a novel perspective for CSLR by treating it as a video-to-text generation task. Utilizing a diffusion model, we bypass the error-prone weakly supervised alignment. By fully exploiting the cross-modal feature correspondence capability of the diffusion model and capitalizing on the semantic consistency between sign videos and textual glosses, the gloss features are obtained directly. Furthermore, we introduce a contrastive learning-based strategy to enhance feature representation during the denoising phase, offering a sophisticated alternative to the simplistic attention mechanisms traditionally employed and guiding the denoising process of the diffusion model. Comprehensive experiments conducted on four public continuous sign language recognition datasets highlight the effectiveness of our generative approach in CSLR, demonstrating that it outperforms state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, multi-label image recognition has emerged as a crucial task in computer vision, requiring simultaneous detection of multiple objects or attributes within images. Unlike single-label classification, this task demands explicit modeling of complex label correlations. Existing methods primarily focus on low-order pairwise relationships, failing to capture higher-order dependencies critical for real-world scene understanding. Additionally, the long-tail distribution of labels often causes models to prioritize frequent head labels while neglecting rare tail labels with limited training samples. To address these challenges, we propose a Dynamic Multi-modal Hypergraph Learning (DMHL) framework for semi-supervised multi-label recognition. DMHL constructs adaptive hypergraphs by fusing visual features, co-occurrence statistics, and textual embeddings. The framework dynamically refines these hypergraphs through three novel modules: HyperPrune, which prunes redundant hyperedges; HyperTransform, which generates dynamic hyperedges from node features; and HyperTune, which optimizes hypergraph weights via feature similarity alignment. These dynamic optimization modules enable DMHL to capture intricate high-order label correlations. Furthermore, DMHL employs hypergraph residual concatenation to enhance deep feature representations, which are leveraged for dynamic pseudo-label generation to alleviate label imbalance. Extensive experiments demonstrate DMHL achieves state-of-the-art results across four benchmarks: 86.0% mAP on MS-COCO (0.7% gain over prior SOTA), 96.3%/96.5% on Pascal VOC 2007/2012, and 64.0% on NUS-WIDE. Notably, in semi-supervised settings with 5% labeled data, DMHL surpasses previous methods by over 20% mAP on MS-COCO (70.5%), highlighting its effectiveness in capturing intricate label relationships and improving tail label recognition.},

  abstract     = {Recently, deep learning-based methods have made impressive progress in infrared small target detection (IRSTD). However, the weak and variable nature of small targets constrains the feature extraction and scene adaptation of existing methods, leading to low data utilization and poor robustness. To address this issue, we innovatively introduce the feedback mechanism into IRSTD and propose the dynamic feedback iterative network (DFINet). The main motivation is to guide the model training and prediction utilizing the history prediction mask (HPMK) of previous rounds. On the one hand, in the training phase, DFINet can further mine the key features of real targets by training in multiple iterations with limited data; on the other hand, in the prediction phase, DFINet can correct the wrong results through feedback iterative to improve the model robustness. Specifically, we first propose the dynamic feedback feature fusion module (DFFFM), which dynamically interacts HPMK with feature maps through a hard attention mechanism to guide feature mining and error correction. Then, for better feature extraction, the cascaded hybrid pyramid pooling module (CHPP) is devised to capture both global and local information. Finally, we propose the dynamic semantic fusion module (DSFM), which innovatively utilizes feedback information to guide the fusion of high-level and low-level features for better feature representation in different scenarios. Extensive experimental results on publicly available datasets of NUDT-SIRST, IRSTD-1k, and SIRST Aug show that DFINet outperforms several state-of-the-art methods and achieves superior detection performance.

Existing single-modality and single-aware methods often underutilize the rich information present in fundus images. To overcome this, we propose a novel modality-specific multi-aware evidence fusion (MSMAE) algorithm for accurate fundus disease diagnosis and grading. Our approach first identifies tissue regions by extracting keypoints from color fundus photographs (CFP) and segmenting supervoxels from optical coherence tomography (OCT) using a conditional random field supervoxel (CRF-SV) method. For each modality, tissue-aware, structure-aware, and global-aware features are extracted to comprehensively capture local and contextual information. An evidence fusion module integrates these multi-aware predictions within each modality, while an evidence knowledge fusion module leverages prior knowledge to reconcile discrepancies across modalities. Furthermore, a progressive transfer fusion curriculum learning strategy is introduced to guide the model from simple to complex grading tasks. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that MSMAE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both disease diagnosis and grading.

  abstract     = {Single-frame infrared small target (SIRST) detection is crucial in military and civilian applications. However, accurate SIRST detection is challenging due to the lack of target texture feature and low signal-to-noise ratio. One promising approach is to use constrained image models exploiting low-rank and sparse priors to separate the target and the background. However, a challenge in using preselected models is the mismatch between the model and the dataset. Deep learning models have achieved promising results, whereas the lack of interpretability in most of these methods renders them unsuitable for detecting dim and small target. In this paper, we propose a novel deep unrolling network based on adaptive tensor priors in the transform domain, namely TTDUNet. Specifically, the infrared image is constructed into patch tensors composed of low-rank background and sparse target components. We define a generalized tensor singular value decomposition based on arbitrary unitary transformations and utilize the transform domain tensor nuclear norm to enforce the low-rankness of the background tensor. Simultaneously, the sparsity of target component is exploited by a learnable sparse transformation. The detection problem is thus posed as an optimization problem solved by the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). The iterative steps are unrolled into a deep neural network to adaptively learn tensor transform domain and associated hyperparameters. Additionally, we introduce a novel cross-layer feature fusion module and a dynamic tensor singular value threshold module to capture cross-dimensional dependencies and enhance tensor representation robustness. Experimental results on public datasets demonstrate TTDUNet's superiority over the state-of-the-art methods.},

The SM branch actively models the structural relationships between key parts of objects and extracts corresponding structural features, while the ACE module guides the model to learn structural information in the phase spectrum by introducing implicit constraints during training. By synergizing the backbone network and the two modules, SFETrans exhibits competitive performance on four benchmark datasets and outperforms other comparison methods in terms of computational efficiency.},

Importantly, our CPG learns task-specific multi-dimensional edge features to comprehensive model semantic relationships between the obtained local patches. Extensive experiments on multiple downstream point cloud analysis tasks (i.e., point cloud classification, segmentation, and object detection) demonstrate that our CPG effectively and consistently improves performance across various point cloud encoders, enabling them to surpass encoders trained with other state-of-the-art self-supervised methods.},

Normal and anomalous samples may share the same local feature such as textures, edges, and corners, but have separability at the global semantic level.

  abstract     = {The Few-Shot Object Detection (FSOD) algorithm holds great potential for various real-world applications. It aims to use a lot of data from base classes for training and then apply the knowledge to recognize targets in new classes. However, many existing FSOD algorithms employing a two-phase learning mode overlook the practical necessity of constructing the training set for the finetuning phase. Their experimental assumption neglects the construction process for the finetuning training set, leading to uncertainty and potentially negative impacts on algorithm performance, as well as overlooking potential information in existing data. For addressing the above issues, this paper presents an active representative sample selection mechanism for the FSOD algorithm. The proposed approach leverages the characteristics of the Density Peak Clustering framework. And it is incorporated between the base training phase and the finetuning phase. During this phase, representative samples are extracted using the DPC method and reweighted based on label information from their neighbors, thereby maintaining recognition capability for base classes and providing enhanced comparison information for detecting novel classes. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. For the road disease dataset, our method on the Meta-DETR framework achieves a mAP(50) of 0.440 for novel objects in all shots scenario, compared to the baseline of 0.343. The improved CME achieves a mAP(50) of 0.344 in 10 shots scenario, compared to the baseline of 0.210. In the 30 shots scenario of the RDD2022 dataset, our method demonstrates a mAP(50) of 0.497, while the baseline method yields 0.420.},

Secondly, based on the principles of low-rank representation, a sparse self-attention mechanism based on token dictionary representation is designed to help the model focus on key background features and guide the model in recognizing anomalies. Finally, a token dictionary learning mechanism for multi-class background description is established by combining Gaussian discriminant analysis with a conditional distance function, and intra-class and inter-class losses are designed to enhance the model’s ability to separate background and anomalies. Experiments on five benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority and applicability of the proposed MBDTNet method, showing that it outperforms the current state-of-the-art hyperspectral anomaly detection methods.},

  abstract     = {In single image super-resolution (SISR) tasks, there is inevitably a “domain gap” between synthetic and realistic datasets, which leads to performance drop accordingly. Domain translation (DT) based approaches have then emerged to narrow the discrepancy by converting data across source and target domains while maintaining semantic consistency. Currently, one-off and two-stage models constitute the main DT-SISR methods. However, due to the inability to incorporate prior knowledge of pre-trained SR networks, one-off methods often demonstrate inferior performance to the structurally complex two-stage models. To achieve both simplicity and performance gain, we propose an one-off DT-SISR model DT-RSRGAN for real-world SISR (RW-SISR). Our underlying principle is to recover LR observations via exploring vision transformer (ViT) based on self-attention (SA) mechanisms in adversarial generative models, aiming to fully explore knowledge of image internal correlation in the absence of external prior information. We then devise an image complexity (IC) loss in DT-RSRGAN, serving as a relaxed form of constraint in the absence of high-resolution (HR) training references for the one-off condition, thus suppressing artifacts that haunt GAN-based SR results. The aforementioned measures collectively facilitate the implementation of DT-RSRGAN in an one-off manner while achieving competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art (SOTA) DT-SISR solutions. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks validate the effectiveness and superiority of DT-RSRGAN towards RW-SISR issues.},

  abstract     = {Coronary artery disease (CAD) stands as the leading cause of death worldwide, and invasive coronary angiography (ICA) remains the gold standard for assessing vascular anatomical information. However, deep learning-based methods encounter challenges in generating semantic labels for arterial segments, primarily due to the morphological similarity between arterial branches and varying anatomy of arterial system between different projection view angles and patients. To address this challenge, we model the vascular tree as a graph and propose a multi-graph matching (MGM) algorithm for coronary artery semantic labeling. The MGM algorithm assesses the similarity between arterials in multiple vascular tree graphs, considering the cycle consistency between each pair of graphs. As a result, the unannotated arterial segments are appropriately labeled by matching them with annotated segments. Through the incorporation of anatomical graph structure, radiomics features, and semantic mapping, the proposed MGM model achieves an impressive accuracy of 0.9471 for coronary artery semantic labeling using our multi-site dataset with 718 ICAs. With the semantic labeled arteries, an overall accuracy of 0.9155 was achieved for stenosis detection. The proposed MGM presents a novel tool for coronary artery analysis using multiple ICA-derived graphs, offering valuable insights into vascular health and pathology.},

  abstract     = {The detection for infrared dim and small target (IRDST) aims to accurately locate these targets in images and has been widely explored. The single-frame detection method with spatial information can detect IRDST with high signal-to-clutter ratio (SCR), while fails to detect IRDST with a low SCR. To resolve this problem, some traditional methods tend to incorporate spatio-temporal information for detecting IRDST. However, these methods need to adjust many hyperparameters to adapt to different complex backgrounds. Learning-based multi-frame methods are emerging and can overcome the defect but suffer from redundancy and inefficiency of information. In this work, IRDST detection method based on Accumulation-Difference-Based Siamese U-Net (ADSUNet) is proposed. In this method, the comprehensive performances for IRDST with low SCR improve through the integrated end-to-end network, which fuses the spatial significant accumulation characteristics and difference characteristics of gray levels between inter-frames. In details, firstly, multi-scale spatial salient features of IRDST in inter-frame images are extracted by Siamese network. Subsequently, the proposed accumulation-difference attention module is then utilised to adaptively fuse the inter-frame feature maps, thereby ensuring full and effective exploitation of the high-dimensional inter-frame spatio-temporal information of IRDST. Finally, a probability likelihood diagram of IRDST is obtained by a decoding network that restores the scale of feature map. Compared with other methods, ADSUNet achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in target detectability, false alarm suppressibility, real-time performance, with AUC values of 0.993 and 0.998 in two datasets (SCR < 3), FPS of 30.97, the parameter quantity of 1.498 M.},

  abstract     = {Feature selection is a mainstream paradigm for coping with high-dimensional multi-label data, because it has higher interpretability in dimensionality reduction techniques. Multi-label Feature Selection (MFS) learns the relationship between features and labels to evaluate the discriminative ability of each feature. However, many recent MFS methods ignore the imprecise high-dimensional feature space and the harsh binary label space in the raw multi-label data, and they directly extract the inherent correlations based on raw data to assist the selection process. To address the issues, we propose a novel method named reconstructing data representation for multi-label feature selection (RDMFS) in the paper. Firstly, we utilize the feature space itself to explore the dynamic feature relationship graph, and it is also imposed the constraints of low-rank representation. Secondly, the original binary label space is perturbed by the directional traction matrix, which can generate a label relaxation matrix. Finally, we reconstruct the feature space using the low-rank representation of dynamic feature graph, which can establish a mapping relationship with the label relaxation matrix. These described properties construct the objective function of RDMFS, which is solved by an optimization algorithm. Experiments on real datasets and comparisons with state-of-the-art methods clearly validate the effectiveness of RDMFS.},

In addition, the machine learning community is also paying attention to Random Forests (RFs) since they defy the interpretability-accuracy tradeoff.

In order to overcome this problem many multivariate approaches have been proposed. However, most of them are based on finding linear or non-linear combinations of features. In this work, we propose a novel univariate RF strategy that builds DTs using the Multivariate Symmetrical Uncertainty (MSU) measure as splitting criterion. The proposal, referred to as RF M S U , was tested on high-dimensional datasets and compared to state-of-the-art univariate and multivariate DTs and RFs classifiers. Results suggest that RF M S U is capable of finding simpler rules than other RFs approaches while keeping a high predictive power equivalent to that of multivariate approaches. The DT strategies considered obtained simpler models than RF M S U , but at the expense of degrading the classifier. Thus, we can conclude that RF M S U is a RF-based classifier that achieves a good trade-off between the performance and the complexity of the model.},

However, the applicability of the existing few-shot font generation models to cross-lingual font generation (i.e., generating fonts in some language system from another language system in the zero-shot scenario) is constrained. Cross-lingual font generation is critical for billboard design and multi-lingual road signs, especially in low-resource languages with limited font styles. A novel framework integrating patch-level style contrastive learning and relative position awareness is proposed to address this challenge. The patch-level module captures shared stylistic attributes across languages, including fine-grained stroke details.

  abstract     = {Multivariate time series forecasting aims to predict future values or trends by using the time dependence and potential patterns of multiple interrelated time series variates in historical data. Recently, multivariate time series forecasting methods have focused on learning correlations across variates, enabling more accurate prediction of future trends by delving into the connections between different variates. However, the underlying assumption in these methodologies is that existing multivariate time series variates exhibit positive correlations, thereby allowing for mutual interdependence. This assumption potentially ignores the in-depth examination of the correlation quality of multivariate time series variates. Unfortunately, in practice, not all variates exhibit a clear positive correlation. The relationships between time-series variates are often complex, involving positive, negative, and potential non-linear connections, and may even the exhibit lack of correlation. To address this challenge, we propose a comprehensive variate analysis and collaborative learning with multi-adapter (CVACL-MA) model to learn the similarities and disparities between variates. First a cross-time encoder is introduced in the proposed model. And aims to learn the global and local features of each variate in the time dimension. Next, considering the correlation level between multivariate variates, a multivariate similarity analysis module is proposed based on the cosine similarity calculation method. And it can divide the original multivariate time series variates into sets of non-positive correlation variates and sets of positive correlation variates. Then, the multi-adapter learning backbone is introduced to learn the disparity of non-positive correlation variates. Meanwhile, a collaborative learning of similar variates backbone is proposed to facilitate the cooperative learning of interdependencies within sets of positive correlation variates. Extensive experiments show that CVACL-MA significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models on nine real-world benchmark datasets, such as weather, ETT, electricity, solar-energy, and so on. The effectiveness of the proposed method is proved by in-depth research and analysis. We release the code at https://github.com/yejunjiePhD/CVACL-MA .},

While effective for single-frame images, they struggle with dynamic changes in multi-frame scenarios as traditional spatial–temporal representations often fail to adapt. To address these challenges, we introduce a Neural-represented Spatial–Temporal Tensor (NeurSTT) model. This framework employs nonlinear networks to enhance spatial–temporal feature correlations in background approximation, thereby supporting target detection in an unsupervised manner. Specifically, we employ neural layers to approximate sequential backgrounds within a low-rank informed deep scheme. A neural three-dimensional total variation is developed to refine background smoothness while reducing static target-like clusters in sequences. Traditional sparsity constraints are incorporated into the loss functions to preserve potential targets. By replacing complex solvers with a deep updating strategy, NeurSTT simplifies the optimization process in a domain-awareness way.

  abstract     = {Learning domain-invariant representations is a crucial task for achieving out-of-distribution generalization . Recent efforts have begun to incorporate causality into this process, aiming to identify and understand the causal factors relevant to various tasks. However, when confronted with non-stationary time series data, simply extending existing generalization methods may prove ineffective. This inadequacy stems from their failure to adequately model the underlying causal factors, exacerbated by temporal domain shifts in addition to source domain shifts. In this paper, we thoroughly examine the challenges posed by both source and temporal shifts through a causal lens in the context of generalizing non-stationary time series data. We introduce a novel model called the Dynamic Causal Sequential Variational Auto-Encoder (DCSVAE), designed specifically to learn dynamic causal factors. By effectively disentangling the representation of non-stationary time series data, our model distinguishes between dynamic causal, dynamic non-causal, and static non-causal factors, thereby facilitating temporal generalization. To enhance disentanglement, we introduce two constraints on latent variables based on mutual information. Theoretical guarantees rooted in information theory validate the feasibility of our approach. Our experiments, conducted on both synthetic and real datasets, demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed model in time series domain generalization tasks when compared to state-of-the-art benchmarks.},

  abstract     = {The automatic brain tumor segmentation task involves extracting key information from multi-modal MRI images, which frequently exhibit complex and nonlinear spatial relationships. High-order relation modeling can effectively reveal more detailed and complex nonlinear dependencies, such as intricate tumor morphology, boundaries, and their relationships with surrounding tissues, which are essential for accurate tumor segmentation. In this paper, we propose a hypergraph-guided feature decoupling learning model that effectively enhances feature alignment in tumor lesion regions by deeply modeling high-order feature correlations, significantly improving segmentation accuracy. Specifically, we propose a multi-level semantic encoding module that effectively integrates multi-modal and multi-scale information to generate deeply fused feature representations with rich semantic information. We further introduce a novel hypergraph-guided disentangled representation module to model high-order semantic correlations both across and within modalities, thereby capturing lesion region features more comprehensively. To mitigate the interference of irrelevant features, we adopt a contrastive learning paradigm to enhance the correlation between features, ensuring that the learned representations are highly focused on the target tumor region. Finally, we design a region-consistency decoding module that utilizes a dual-branch structure to decode different semantic contexts of the lesion region, generating the final accurate segmentation result through feature aggregation. Extensive experiments on the BraTS 2019, 2020, and 2021 datasets demonstrate that the proposed model significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in segmentation performance, validating the substantial potential of high-order relation modeling in brain tumor segmentation.},

  abstract     = {Semi-supervised video action detection is one of the key technologies for achieving video understanding, effectively alleviating the limitations of obtaining large-scale action boundary annotations. However, the lack of labeled data makes existing semi-supervised methods vulnerable to background noise in unlabeled data, consequently compromising the robustness of action representations. In contrast, diffusion models demonstrate strong capability in learning robust data distribution representations through their iterative forward and reverse processes. Therefore, this paper approaches the training of the semi-supervised framework from a novel perspective of diffusion generation. Specifically, a video and noise collaboratively guided semi-supervised diffusion model for video action detection is proposed in this paper, referred to as Semi-Diff. First, during the training phase, Gaussian noise is added to the ground truth through multiple steps to transform it into pure noise. Subsequently, the model is trained to reverse the noise into action localization maps. In addition, this paper further proposes a Conditional Guidance Strategy and additionally incorporates Reconstruction loss to prevent feature confusion. This strategy utilizes video encoding features and noise to collaboratively guide the model, aiming to further enhance the quality of diffusion. During the inference phase, random noise is input into the diffusion model for denoising. It is noteworthy that the method proposed in this paper decouples the noise prediction process and the action localization process during the diffusion process, enabling competitive performance to be achieved with fewer iteration steps. Extensive experimental results on JHMDB-21 and UCF101-24 demonstrate that the proposed method can generate accurate action detection results and exhibits strong competitiveness.},

To this end, we propose a novel multi-modal adaptive contrastive learning framework called MACL for session-based recommendation.

Besides, we present an adaptive contrastive loss that distinguishes varying contributions of positive-negative signals to improve self-supervised learning.

  abstract     = {Multi-view action recognition aims to identify actions in a given multi-view scene. Traditional studies initially extracted refined features from each view, followed by implemented paired interaction and integration, but they potentially overlooked the critical local features in each view. When observing objects from multiple perspectives, individuals typically form a comprehensive impression and subsequently fill in specific details. Drawing inspiration from this cognitive process, we propose a novel trunk-branch contrastive network (TBCNet) for RGB-based multi-view action recognition. Distinctively, TBCNet first obtains fused features in the trunk block and then implicitly supplements vital details provided by the branch block via contrastive learning, generating a more informative and comprehensive action representation. Within this framework, we construct two core components: the multi-view deformable aggregation (MVDA) and the trunk-branch contrastive learning. MVDA employed in the trunk block effectively facilitates multi-view feature fusion and adaptive cross-view spatio-temporal correlation, where a global aggregation module (GAM) is utilized to emphasize significant spatial information and a composite relative position bias (CRPB) is designed to capture the intra- and cross-view relative positions. Moreover, a trunk-branch contrastive loss is constructed between aggregated features and refined details from each view. By incorporating two distinct weights for positive and negative samples, a weighted trunk-branch contrastive loss is proposed to extract valuable information and emphasize subtle inter-class differences. The effectiveness of TBCNet is verified by extensive experiments on four datasets including NTU-RGB+D 60, NTU-RGB+D 120, PKU-MMD, and N-UCLA dataset. Compared to other RGB-based methods, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in cross-subject and cross-setting protocols.},

Traditional graph-based methods often fail to capture the high-order topological and semantic features inherent in functional brain networks, which limits their diagnostic effectiveness. To address this limitation, we propose a HyperGraph-based Semantic and Topological self-supervised learning (HGST) method for brain disease diagnosis. HGST utilizes hypergraph structures to model high-order functional connections among brain regions, thereby capturing complex multi-region interactions. Through hypergraph self-supervised learning, HGST extracts latent topological and semantic features to generate high-order embeddings for downstream brain disease diagnosis. Specifically, HGST comprises two core components: a semantic-aware module based on hypergraph link prediction and a topology-aware module based on hyperedge structure similarity. The former learns high-order embeddings by restoring masked node features, while the latter captures local topological associations by measuring similarities among hyperedges involving multiple brain regions. Finally, we employ a pretrained shared hypergraph neural network as an encoder to extract high-order brain network embeddings for each subject, facilitating brain disease diagnosis. We validated HGST on two public brain disease datasets, ADHD and MDD, where it outperformed existing methods in diagnostic performance. Additionally, we visualized the high-order brain networks produced by hypergraph self-supervised learning and identified key disease-related regions, further supporting the effectiveness and interpretability of our method.

We propose a novel stock investment selection framework based on time series subpatterns and multi-relationship fusion. First, we propose a novel stock time-series subpattern representation that effectively captures local temporal patterns, enabling precise characterization of stock-specific features. We further learn the temporal dependencies among subpatterns to reveal implicit pattern changes in each stock’s historical data. Second, unlike traditional methods that learn stock correlation coefficients and fuse them to obtain stock features, we leverage the Transformer Encoder’s capability to capture inherent relationships between data, enabling the extraction of implicit short-term relationship between subpatterns of different stocks and thus directly obtaining features influenced by short-term inter-stock relationship. Third, we fuse the short-term and long-term stock relationships to obtain a fused relationship that influences stock trend changes. This multi-relationship fusion reflects the complex synchronous variation patterns between stocks and facilitates information exchange between long-term and short-term relationships, thereby uncovering the latent connections between these two types of relationships. Finally, we combine the temporal dependencies of stock subpatterns with the fused relationship to predict stock trends. Experimental results on three datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.},

To address these limitations, we propose a data-driven diagnostic framework, MIMAR-OSA , which leverages three distinct modalities: basic physiological measurements, facial image data, and snoring audio collected by patients using portable devices. Our framework employs attention grids in the visual domain to identify facial key points from images at various angles, a graph attention network to emphasize and connect critical facial features across images, and semantic processing of patient’s basic physical signs information in the linguistic domain. For the audio domain, we utilize diffWave to reconstruct missing audio components. Comprehensive data integration and analysis are facilitated by a fusion transformer combined with a mixture of expert (MoE) models. Our framework was validated on a university hospital OSA dataset, achieving a 92.24% accuracy. Additionally, testing our MIMAR-OSA model on open-source multimodal learning benchmarks demonstrated its superiority in multi-classification tasks over other state-of-the-art models, confirming its broad applicability and extensibility across various medical settings.},

  abstract     = {Face anti-spoofing (FAS) is a critical component of biometric security systems aimed at distinguishing genuine users from spoofed faces presented via printed photos, replayed videos, or 3D masks. While existing FAS models achieve high performance, they often suffer from limited generalization and interpretability, especially when faced with unseen attack scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose a novel, explainable face anti-spoofing framework that introduces two key innovations: XAIPooling and XAIDropout. These mechanisms leverage Shapley values to guide the pooling and dropout processes, ensuring that only the most significant features are retained during feature aggregation and regularization. Unlike traditional pooling and dropout, which operate without regard for feature importance, XAIPooling and XAIDropout prioritize critical features, leading to better generalization and robustness against cross-dataset attacks. The proposed model employs a multi-stream architecture that processes RGB and LBP-transformed images through independent convolutional pathways. Features from these two streams are fused to create a comprehensive feature representation. The model’s feature extraction pipeline includes convolutional layers, ReLU activations, batch normalization, XAIPooling, and XAIDropout, followed by a series of fully connected layers for final classification. By incorporating explainability into pooling and dropout operations, the proposed framework offers greater transparency in decision-making, enabling insight into the features most responsible for detecting spoofing attempts. Extensive evaluations are conducted on five widely-used benchmark datasets: MSU-MFSD, NUAA, LCC-FASD, ROSE-Youtu, and 3DMAD, covering various attack types, devices, and environmental conditions.},

Besides, ensemble learning is an efficient technique, but gains little attention in AU detection. Considering the above limitations, we propose a local self-attention constraining (LSC) network, by regarding the self-attention distribution of each AU as a spatial distribution, and constraining it based on prior knowledge so as to capture AU-related local information. Moreover, to learn correlations among different AU regions, we propose a global dual-directional attention (GDA) network, which adaptively learns global attention map from both vertical and horizontal directions. Last but not least, the two networks from different views of capturing patterns are assembled to integrate both advantages. Extensive experiments on BP4D, DISFA, and GFT benchmarks demonstrate that our methods including local self-attention constraining, global dual-directional attention, and multi-view ensemble all significantly surpass state-of-the-art AU detection works.},

While existing approaches predominantly rely on the assumption of motion consistency to distinguish correct correspondences, the non-consistent but correct correspondences are frequently disregarded, leading to poor performance in scenes with complex structures. This study proposes an innovative false correspondence removal network (FCRNet), which designs a learnable frequency response function h ( λ ) to better fit the motion of both consistent and non-consistent correct correspondences. Instead of extracting pixel-based 2D movements, we introduce a graph-based Motion-Fitting Residual Layer (MFRL) to extract high-dimensional motion-fitting residual features, effectively capturing the 3D geometrical variation of matching pairs. Furthermore, an adaptive loss function is adopted to balance and train using the two distinct types of correct correspondences. The principal contribution of FCRNet lies in leveraging a graph-based learning model to fit the non-consistent complex motion patterns of a minority correct correspondences, which are often overlooked by previous methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed FCRNet outperforms existing algorithms in terms of precision for false correspondence removal and camera pose estimation.

  abstract     = {Feature selection (FS) is critical for reducing dimensionality and enhancing model accuracy but remains challenging in high-dimensional datasets. Metaheuristic algorithms, especially swarm intelligence, are often applied to optimization issues like FS, however, they struggle with the local optima and slow convergence in high-dimensional space. To address these issues, this paper proposes a cooperative hybrid breeding swarm intelligence algorithm (CHBSI), which simulates a hybrid breeding optimization algorithm based on heterosis theory, where the population is divided into three subpopulations for cooperative evolution. In each subpopulation, solutions are updated using a well-established particle swarm optimization algorithm, with Lévy flights integrated to enhance the global search capabilities and avoid the local optima. To further accelerate convergence during local optimization, a hyperbolic dynamic adjustment mechanism is introduced. Moreover, a classical ant colony optimization algorithm is incorporated to guide the global search via pheromone trails, thus improving exploration in complex search space. The best solutions from subpopulations are shared periodically, facilitating efficient information exchange. For binary FS, a regularized binary encoding is used to adapt the algorithm. The effectiveness of CHBSI is validated on 26 benchmark functions, and its binary version (bCHBSI) is tested on FS tasks across 18 UCI datasets. The experimental results show that both CHBSI and bCHBSI excel in convergence speed, fitness, classification accuracy, F1-score, the size of feature subset, and stability, significantly outperforming 10 advanced algorithms, including the S-shaped and V-shaped variants of CHBSI. CHBSI demonstrates scalability and robustness, maintaining superior performance across datasets with varying dimensionalities and complexities.},

  abstract     = {Modeling real-world system dynamics is challenging due to non-periodic patterns, such as stimuli-dependent physiological responses in health, event-driven traffic in mobility, and news-triggered interactions in societal systems. In the absence of contextual data, state-of-the-art methods—including advanced deep learning architectures—struggle to model these irregular behaviors. Furthermore, their predictive focus often limits their utility for descriptive analysis, hampering knowledge acquisition. This work addresses these challenges by proposing a methodology to decompose multivariate time series residuals into statistically significant, meaningful events, effectively filtering noise. We extend the motif discovery task to identify irregular patterns satisfying key properties: non-triviality, statistical significance, multi-dimensionality, and actionability. Our approach introduces principles to mitigate biases, evaluate statistical significance, place robust hyperparameterization, explore relationships in multivariate residuals, and incorporate domain knowledge through specialized masks. Real-world case studies validate the proposed methodology, uncovering explainable patterns relevant to human activity recognition, energy consumption, and urban planning, accounting for up to 50% of irregular components and revealing hidden system behaviors.},

This inherent limitation of SA hinders its ability to recognize negative correlations among feature attributes. To overcome this limitation, we propose Full-Range Self-Attention (FSA) . Compared to SA, FSA operates more effectively by recognizing negative correlations, adjusting focus intensity, and requiring no extra parameters. We first utilize the projection values of K T onto Q in both directions as weights for positive and negative similarities. Then, we develop a Bidirectional Attention Weight Selection (BAWS) strategy that performs Softmax normalization in each of the two directions, providing the model with more insight into the negative interdependencies. Furthermore, the FSA employs an Attention Redistribution Connection (ARC) to dynamically adjust attention weights, effectively extending the possibility of attentional capture. We conduct comprehensive experiments on a variety of models for classification, segmentation, and detection tasks. Our FSA significantly improves the performance of these models across tasks.

However, traditional unimodal recognition systems often suffer from factors such as variations in lighting, posture and occlusion, resulting in decreased accuracy. To address these limitations, multimodal recognition systems have emerged, combining multiple biometric modalities to enhance system robustness and accuracy. In this study, we propose a Texture Orientation-based Feature Fusion Network (TOFFNet), which leverages orientation information extracted from contactless finger texture features, effectively improving recognition system performance. This network utilizes the texture feature information from diverse modalities to achieve complementarity and fusion between them. A directional attention fusion module is developed to compute attention along the parallel or perpendicular axis of the finger’s long axis, facilitating texture orientation-based feature fusion. Moreover, a specialized sampling strategy for challenging samples is designed to enhance the performance of multimodal tasks. To prove the effectiveness of the proposed method, we employ THU-FVFP, a visible light finger textures and finger vein dataset containing contactless modalities that are suitable for sensitive environments. The results of extensive experiments show that our proposed method can fully utilize the information of the two modalities to improve recognition performance.},

Earlier studies have adopted a two-step framework comprising representation learning followed by pattern mining . However, the reliance on clustering algorithms in the mining step introduces hypersensitivity to parameter selection, resulting in either redundant or missing visual patterns. Furthermore, the optimization based on two non-interactive steps prevents the framework from adapting itself to diverse data. In this work, we rethink the multi-pattern mining task from the perspective of prototype learning, and introduce an end-to-end Visual Pattern Prototypes Proposing (VP3) method with two losses: class-wise and pattern-wise contrastive loss. VP3 eliminates the reliance on clustering algorithms by treating prototypes as visual patterns, and integrates the mining results (pattern prototypes) into representation learning . Consequently, VP3 can achieve more robust results. Extensive experiments conducted on four benchmark datasets demonstrate the robustness and superior performance of VP3 over six state-of-the-art methods.

  abstract     = {Polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar (PolSAR) images provide richer ground object information than optical images due to their full-polarization capabilities. However, annotating PolSAR images is time-consuming, limiting the available research data and increasing the risk of overfitting. Addressing the scarcity of labeled data is crucial for land cover mapping. For this, we propose a PolSAR image reconstruction method called PolSAR to RGB (P2R), which expands the dataset by generating reconstructed RGB images from original PolSAR images. While the reconstructed images augment the dataset, they still contain lots of speckle noise, leading to lower land cover mapping performance. To alleviate this defect, we also design a Gate Denoised Module (GDM) consisting of two components: Image Denoising guided by Original Polarization (IDOP) and Feature Generation with Gated Unit (FGGU) module. Specifically, the IDOP module reduces the impact of noise on the feature map by learning similar characteristics between the original polarization and reconstructed RGB images. The FGGU module adaptively fuses the low-level feature map with the denoised feature map by a weighted gate, which helps remove the noise in images without affecting their details. Experiments on several publicly available PolSAR datasets show the effectiveness of our land cover mapping method, reaching 53.94% mIoU in AIR-PolSAR-Seg, 76.71% mIoU in PolSF-RS2, and 90.34% mIoU in PolSF-GF3.},

However, these methods implicitly utilize motion information and fail to explicitly explore motion compensation, resulting in poor performance in the case of a video sequence including large motion. In this paper, we propose a Deformable Feature Alignment and Refinement (DFAR) method based on deformable convolution to explicitly use motion context in both the training and inference stages. Specifically, a Temporal Deformable Alignment (TDA) module based on the designed Dilated Convolution Attention Fusion (DCAF) block is developed to explicitly align the adjacent frames with the current frame at the feature level. Then, the feature refinement module adaptively fuses the aligned features and further aggregates useful spatio-temporal information by means of the proposed Attention-guided Deformable Fusion (AGDF) block. In addition, to improve the alignment of adjacent frames with the current frame, we extend the traditional loss function by introducing a new motion compensation loss. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed DFAR method. We will release our codes.},

Primarily, our analysis indicates that existing method for utilizing the CLIP text branch is limited, mainly due to its random sampling strategies, which introduces sampling bias and restricts it to the scenarios with only two categories within a single scene. Thus, we propose a multi-object clustering-based text sampling method tailored for the CLIP text branch, thereby enhancing the diversity and relevance of text features and providing more meaningful guidance for generator optimization. In addition, to the best of our knowledge, we are the first to apply curriculum learning to the training process of generative attacks. This operation involves a dynamic input sample selection strategy that adapts to different training phases, enabling the generator to transition from simpler tasks to more complex tasks, thereby improving the generalization capability of adversarial perturbations. Extensive experiments across within-domain, cross-domain, and cross-task scenarios show that GACRS consistently outperforms existing peer methods.

This paper aims to develop a novel representation-based affinity graph construction method to reveal the true intrinsic subspace structures of data. First, we propose to construct an efficient and robust ℓ 2 , 1 -norm graph (termed L21graph) by imposing the ℓ 2 , 1 -norm minimization regularization and the adaptive distance penalty over the representation coefficient matrix. We theoretically prove that the ℓ 2 , 1 -norm converges towards its nuclear norm and can serve as the convex relaxation of the nuclear norm. Moreover, as a mixed matrix norm of the ℓ 1 -norm and ℓ 2 -norm, the ℓ 2 , 1 -norm leverages the discriminative nature of the ℓ 1 -norm while can drive closed-form solution like the ℓ 2 -norm. Thus L21graph achieves improvement in both efficiency and effectiveness. Second, in case of noisy dataset, the pair-wise distances computed from the corrupted samples may fail to capture the true neighbor relationship of data, leading to performance degradation. To this end, we propose to recover clean low-rank components from noisy data (by robust principal component analysis) and learn the affinity graph in one framework, which is referred to as L21graph with denoised data (termed L21graph-DF). Extensive experiments on multiple public benchmark datasets verify that our proposed method outperforms the existing state-of-the-art affinity graph learning method for semi-supervised classification.},

Recently proposed Perceiver and its variant (Perceiver IO) have shown promising results in addressing diverse types of input modalities with a universal model architecture. However, they have mainly focused on image and text data modalities, and it is unclear whether this kind of universal architecture can also be effective for graph-structured datasets. As the graph data contains topological information, which is lacking in the image and text data, it is non-trivial to devise a universal architecture for graph and other data modalities altogether. In this study, we provide a Graph Perceiver IO (GPIO), a class of Perceiver IO models that addresses graph-structured datasets. We keep the main structure of the GPIO the same as with the Perceiver, which can already handle multiple data modalities, while focusing on how we can extend it to the graph domain. By leveraging positional encoding and output query smoothing, GPIO serves as a general architecture that handles graph-structured data as well as text and image data. Besides, we further propose GPIO+ for the multimodal few-shot classification that incorporates both images and graphs simultaneously. Through extensive experiments covering link prediction, graph classification, node classification, and multimodal text classification, we demonstrate that GPIO and GPIO+ outperform the representative graph neural network baseline models, while requiring lower computational complexity than them.},

  abstract     = {Training with the numerical noisy labels in regression would weaken the generalization performance of the model. Noise filtering is a popular technique for removing mislabeled samples to reduce noise. Existing filtering methods usually utilize fixed models; however, they are prone to falling into a vicious circle of noisy data and biased models, i.e., a chicken-and-egg dilemma in noise filtering. We propose a dynamic model recall filtering (DMRF) algorithm to address this issue from the perspectives of model selection and data preprocessing. Firstly, we propose a strong correlation model selection criterion to alleviate the biased model, guaranteed by a reduced error bound. Then, we employ warm-up filtering and a data recall strategy in noisy data preprocessing to balance the noise removal and overcleaning. Finally, we design a noise estimator by constructing an adaptive posterior distribution of the latent true label according to the maximum a posteriori rule. The experimental results on benchmark datasets as well as real-world age estimation and gaze estimation tasks show that our DMRF algorithm has a more accurate noise estimation and yields a better generalization performance than previous algorithms.},

Our approach aims to fine-tune pre-trained models to adapt to limited real-world skeleton data. We use 2D skeletons as inputs and leverage a large human motion dataset for 2D to 3D pose estimation to learn generalizable motion features. A lightweight prompt generator produces instance-level prompts, and we employ dynamic queries with cross-attention to refine the semantic information of the input data. Additionally, we introduce a joint-enhanced multi-stream fusion mechanism based on self-attention to improve robustness against incomplete skeletons. Skeleton-Prompt represents a significant advancement in efficient fine-tuning for skeleton action recognition, effectively addressing cross-dataset generalization challenges in a data-efficient and parameter-efficient manner.},

More precisely, these strategies work on the premise of merging the elements in the reference data collection to generate an alternative and more compact data assortment that substitutes the former one without remarkably affecting the recognition performance. Nevertheless, despite being widely studied in multiclass scenarios, PG is still underexplored in multilabel contexts, leading to limitations, notably in the handling of label imbalance and noise. In this regard, this work introduces a reduction framework that allows for multilabel PG methods to handle these challenges of label imbalance and noise. The proposed mechanisms comprise a selection strategy that exclusively preserves noise-free samples in the process, a mechanism to avoid severely imbalanced samples from being inadequately processed, and two new merging policies for the PG methods to generate novel samples. These enhancements are considered along with three established multilabel PG methods: Multilabel Reduction through Homogeneous Clustering, Multilabel Chen, and Multilabel Reduction through Space Partitioning. Evaluations are conducted using three k NN-based multilabel classifiers and 12 diverse datasets with different levels of label imbalance. We additionally study the performance with varying values of k under different label-noise scenarios. The results are assessed through statistical tests and indicate that our proposals outperform the original methods that disregard label imbalance, even in the presence of noise, thus validating these approaches and fostering further research in the field.},

However, existing methods cannot sufficiently leverage both global saliency and local saliency cues, resulting in suboptimal performance that requires further improvement. To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel 3D point cloud sampling method inspired by the human visual perception mechanism in this study, which can effectively extract important point cloud subsets from critical regions to better adapt to downstream tasks, thereby maintaining superior sampling performance. The proposed Visual Perception-inspired 3D Point Cloud Sampling (VPI-3DPS) method simulates the human visual system’s dynamic attention-shifting strategy by combining coarse-grained attention-driven sampling with fine-grained detail preservation. This allows our approach to adaptively capture both global context and local details within point cloud data, safeguarding downstream task performance. By leveraging Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) for long-term dependency modeling and integrating Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) to capture local structures, VPI-3DPS obtains an integrated representation of regional correlation and detail awareness. Extensive experiments show that VPI-3DPS outperforms existing methods. Compared to the best-performing approaches, it achieves an average increase of 1.29% in classification accuracy, an average reduction of 13.20% in registration MRE, and an average decrease of 4.29% in Chamfer Distance for reconstruction.},

Different from traditional anchor-based co-clustering methods, our model solves the original discrete normalized cut problem on the bipartite graph directly. To address the discrete cut problem, an iterative coordinate ascent algorithm is presented, which can speed up the clustering process. Through optimization on the label matrices of samples and anchors, the clusters can be obtained without relaxation–discretization operation. Furthermore, the proposed NC 3 model can tackle the out-of-sample clustering issue based on labels of anchors.

Occasionally, researchers are interested in making them workable for data of other types, such as an object’s shape. The current difficulty in applying them to shape clustering is that clustering must be invariant to several similarity transformations of shapes. Therefore, we use the ordinary Procrustes sum of squares (OSS) in Procrustes analysis, which refers to analysis that is invariant to the similarity transformations between shapes. Thus, in this study, we aim to make mature methods workable in shape clustering. To achieve this, the essential points that we need to address are to rewrite the optimization problem associated with each method and to present a feasible method for computing the solution to the problem. As a result, we base the method on the OSS, its derivative, or a symmetric matrix concerning the OSS. Another aim of this study is to identify specific applications of shape clustering. We demonstrate the applications through experiments using datasets that contain skewed line drawings, American football formations, and baseball pitch trajectories. We examine the OSS-based methods by considering shape classification and determining the best method for implementing the OSS. As a result, regardless of the dataset, we demonstrate that the OSS in every method is more effective than other shape distances and that the convex clustering method incorporating the OSS is best performed in several ways.},

While considerable efforts have been made to enhance the completeness of knowledge graphs, there remains a lack of a universal quantitative framework for evaluating knowledge graph completeness. This study first delineates two primary sources of incompleteness in knowledge graphs. To measure the incompleteness arising from the insufficiency of facts, the concept of intrinsic density is introduced, which is defined as the completeness of the pattern encapsulated within the existing data of a knowledge graph. To operationalize this concept, we propose RIDE , a novel method that quantitatively measures intrinsic density by assessing a knowledge graph’s ability to regenerate missing facts based on the patterns embedded in its existing data. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first practical and general approach for quantitatively evaluating the completeness of knowledge graphs from an intrinsic perspective.},

While deep learning-based methods have made significant strides in this area, they still struggle with generalizing across a wide range of degradation types and levels. This limitation restricts their practical applicability, as it often requires training separate models for each degradation type and knowing the specific degradation in advance to apply the appropriate model. In this work, we introduce AdaPrompt-IR, an adaptive all-in-one image restoration network that combines degradation semantic mining and prompt learning. Our approach leverages a degradation representation codebook to effectively decompose and capture various degradation types. Building upon this foundation, we propose a degradation activation module, integrated with a dual-branch architecture, which explicitly facilitates the restoration of missing degradation semantics. Additionally, we incorporate degradation-specific information as prompts to implicitly guide the restoration process.

Secondly, they are inadequate for data structure learning and lack awareness of co-learning global and local structures. This paper proposes an unsupervised feature selection method (SCSF_FS) that integrates similarity and clustering structures learning to capture intrinsic information in data. Specifically, we use latent space learning to partition multiple data matrices into view-specific base matrices and clustering metrics. Structural learning is used to transform specific clustering metrics into coherent clustering structures. In addition, adaptive weights are used on each view’s similarity matrix to learn a consistent similarity structure, while laplacian graph learning is introduced to unify the similarity and clustering structures. Consequently, a unified framework is designed to unify multiview consistency learning, global structure, and local structure preservation. Moreover, an optimization iteration algorithm is designed to solve it. Comparison with eight algorithms shows the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {Two-stage methods have dominated video paragraph captioning for several years. Recently, one-stage methods have gained popularity, eschewing the event detection stage and generating paragraphs directly from untrimmed videos using transformers. Despite consistently improving performance, we argue that current one-stage methods generate paragraphs less relevant to the video content, a shortcoming not adequately reflected by reference-based metrics. In this paper, we aim to enhance the video relevance of generated paragraph captions for one-stage models. Towards this goal, we identify two key issues: (i) one-stage models struggle to detect decisive video content due to insufficient attention, in the absence of an event detection stage; and (ii) current one-stage methods lose some knowledge learned from shallow layers, resulting in missed video content. To address these challenges, we propose the Perturbed Attention Self-Distillation (PASD) framework, which incorporates two key designs: (i) Perturbed Attention: Our key insight is that the removal of important video content results in a decrease in captioning performance. We design a perturbed branch containing a learnable probe to decrease performance. This learned probe then corrects the original attention, helping the model focus on important video content. (ii) Layer-Wise Self-Distillation: We design a layer-wise self-distillation mechanism that transfers knowledge from shallow layers to deep layers, enabling the model to fully exploit multi-level representations learned by different layers. Our novelty lies in integrating these two mechanisms to enhance video relevance without requiring an explicit event detection stage. Experimental results clearly demonstrate that PASD improves video-caption alignment, outperforming both traditional one-stage and two-stage methods. Additionally, PASD maintains computational efficiency, making it suitable for real-world deployment.},

  abstract     = {Building a robust Multimodal Sentiment Analysis (MSA) model is critical for affective understanding in complex real-world scenarios. Recent research has highlighted Transformer as a potent MSA architecture, capable of acquiring multimodal representations directly from unaligned streams. However, two challenges persist in achieving robust MSA: (i) inefficiency in capturing intricate interactions among modalities, and (ii) susceptibility to random modalities missing. This manuscript introduces the Multimodal Interaction Graph with Hybrid Contrastive Learning (MIG-HCL) to adaptively integrate multimodal data in various modality-missing situations. MIG primarily comprises two components: a Bidirectional Progressive Feature Promotion Module (BPFPM) and a Mutual Information Selective Module (MISM), responding to exploit complementary information and mitigate redundancy across modalities. Upon transforming multimodal sequences into unimodal and multimodal graphs, BPFPM reinforces bidirectional interactions between the global multimodal context and local unimodal features for semantic compensation. Leveraging the heterogeneous graph structure, BPFPM enables parallel computation across multiple modalities, thus avoiding inefficient separate sets of bimodal correlation computations of prior local–local interaction methods. MISM utilizes mutual information between global semantics and reinforced unimodal representations, incorporating learnable weights to filter the most task-relevant features for redundancy elimination. Moreover, HCL is presented to learn robust representations from incomplete data. HCL treats complete and incomplete data as distinct views for multi-scale feature reconstruction, spanning cross-scale and same-scale approaches, to restore both contextual and structural information while discouraging premature solutions.

  abstract     = {Traditional Chinese medicine plays a crucial role in healthcare, with Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) forming its core. Accurate identification of CHM is essential for ensuring their efficacy and safety, but this process often requires specialized expertise. Despite significant advances in deep learning for image recognition, the field of CHM identification lags behind. Specifically, the challenges in automatic image recognition of CHM stem from the lack of fully public CHM datasets and the inherent visual similarity and variability of CHM data. To address these issues, we collect a CHM-100 dataset, which is the first fully public dataset for CHM image recognition. Compared with existing CHM recognition datasets, CHM-100 has more diverse samples and higher quality annotations, thus establishing a new benchmark for the development of CHM recognition models. Furthermore, we propose a multi-task interactive network with progressive multi-granularity learning (MPM-Net), designed to enhance the accuracy of CHM recognition. MPM-Net employs a progressive learning strategy to capture detailed local features and is jointly trained with a task for identifying medicinal parts to learn global features. Additionally, we use the cross-attention interaction fusion module to explore the relationship between CHM recognition and biology domain knowledge to enhance the feature representation. We evaluate MPM-Net using the CHM-100 dataset and compare its performance with various state-of-the-art image classification methods, including popular deep networks and fine-grained approaches. The results demonstrate that MPM-Net outperforms existing methods by significant margins, achieving a Top-1 accuracy of 90.86% (1.29% absolute improvement over current state-of-the-art) on the CHM-100 dataset.},

  abstract     = {The rapid development of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) highlights AI’s potential yet introduces the risk of abuse and attack. We focus on the vulnerability of video-based DNNs to adversarial attacks, striving to develop a robust, pluggable, and efficient adversarial defender. In principle, the diffusion model can be considered as a natural plug-in adversarial defender that purifies the adversarial examples before they are fed into downstream DNNs. However, existing diffusion purifiers fix the denoising granularity, eliminating the malicious signals while tolerating the risk of losing important information. Based on the observation that attack mitigation in complex scenarios is more difficult, an adaptive diffusion timestep selection mechanism guided by visual complexity is proposed, which enables the vigour of defence to be controlled. Extensive experiments with various video classifiers and trackers on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art results, outperforming existing adversarial purifiers by a significant margin in most cases.

Among these works, domain adaptation(DA) is proven to be useful in training models with scarce labeled datasets and generalizing the trained model to a new environment. However, general DA requires access to source domain datasets during the adaptation process, which is risky and inefficient for private data. In this work, we propose an unsupervised radar HAR system, “weighted pseudo-label source-free unsupervised domain adaptation”(WPL-SFUDA). WPL-SFUDA achieves unsupervised HAR based on DA. Furthermore, it also utilizes the source-free DA technique to eliminate the requirement of the model to access the source domain dataset during the adaptation process. We also propose a novel weighted pseudo-label training strategy and label correction module to further improve the robustness of the system working in a radar-based application scenario. The effectiveness of WPL-SFUDA is demonstrated via the public radar HAR dataset.

  abstract     = {Super-Resolution Structured Illumination Microscopy (SR-SIM) is usually challenged by the balance between imaging quality and continuous imaging, especially in low-light imaging conditions, where obtaining a high Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) is even tougher due to the intrinsic mechanism of sensor noise and detection limitations. In more recent studies, a promising solution to overcome this limitation is a combination of traditional methods with deep neural networks. However, the incorporation of extrinsic optical information weakens robustness across different imaging conditions due to complex processing requirements. Additionally, the high computational cost and need for extensive training data limit the overall performance from reaching further improvements. Motivated by the complementary strengths of vision transformers and channel attention mechanisms, in this paper, we propose a Dual-Model Framework in Structured Illumination Microscopy (DMF-SIM) to achieve simultaneous super-resolution reconstruction and denoising by integrating a reconstruction model (SIM-Rec) and a denoising model (SIM-Den). DMF-SIM integrates super-resolution and denoising models by effectively combining vision transformer and channel attention mechanisms, and a substantial performance improvement has been achieved over single-task models.

  abstract     = {Nighttime hazy enlivenment is a challenging yet often-seen scenario for computer vision systems, as a nighttime hazy image contains complex degradation that significantly decreases the visibility of the scene. Nighttime image dehazing aims at restoring a haze-less image with high visibility from nighttime hazy images. It remains a challenging task due to the complex interplay of multiple light sources, scattering, and inhomogeneous haze. This paper presents PDRNet, a physics-aware dynamic model that addresses the unique characteristics of nighttime haze and improves dehazing performance in three key aspects. Firstly, to handle spatially varying haze and lighting conditions, dynamic filtering is introduced for content-aware feature extraction. Secondly, a triple-branch nighttime physics-aware module based on the nighttime atmospheric scattering model is designed, leading to an effective physically-guided restoration process. Lastly, a progressive contrastive regularization scheme, which introduces negative samples of increasing dehazing difficulty from the nighttime, is proposed for providing robust lower-bound constraints on the clean image solution space. The integration of these three components results in a lightweight, physics-aware dynamic model with excellent generalization capabilities. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and authentic datasets demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of proposed PDRNet for nighttime image dehazing.},

  abstract     = {Due to scene complexity, sensor inaccuracies, and processing imprecision, point cloud corruption is inevitable. Over-reliance on input features is the root cause of DNN vulnerabilities. It remains unclear whether this issue exists in 3D tasks involving point clouds and whether reducing dependence on these features can enhance the model’s robustness to corrupted point clouds. This study attempts to answer these questions. Specifically, we quantified the sensitivity of the DNN to point cloud features using Shapley values and found that models trained using traditional methods exhibited high sensitivity values for certain features. Furthermore, under an equal pruning ratio, prioritizing the pruning of highly sensitive features causes more severe damage to model performance than random pruning. We propose ‘Desensitized Adversarial Training’ (DesenAT), generating adversarial samples using feature desensitization and conducting training within a self-distillation framework, which aims to alleviate DNN’s over-reliance on point clouds features by smoothing sensitivity. First, data points with high contribution components are eliminated, and spatial transformation is used to simulate corruption scenes, generate adversarial samples, and conduct adversarial training on the model. Next, to compensate for information loss in adversarial samples, we use the self-distillation method to transfer knowledge from clean samples to adversarial samples, and perform adversarial training in a distillation manner. Extensive experiments on ModelNet-C and PointCloud-C demonstrate show that the propose method can effectively improve the robustness of the model without reducing the performance of clean data sets.

However, in some low-quality data, such as wind power and photovoltaic power, it is found that the data does not obey a single noise distribution, but tends to follow a Gauss–Laplace mixed noise distribution. Therefore, This study aims to enhance regression models to improve predictive accuracy over traditional models. Based on the theoretical basis of the PSVR model combined with the TSVR model, we introduce the Gauss–Laplace mixed noise feature, and design a new regressor, called the twin proximal support vector regression with Gauss–Laplace mixed noise (GL-TPSVR). At the same time, the augmented Lagrange multiplier (ALM) method is used to solve the GL-TPSVR model. Experimental results show that the accuracy of the GL-TPSVR model is improved by about 32% and 25% respectively compared with the recent advanced regression models on the artificial dataset and the real short-term wind power dataset, verifying the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed GL-TPSVR model. The GL-TPSVR model is proposed in this paper, which combines the strengths of PSVR and TSVR with the Gauss–Laplace mixed noise distribution, offering a significant improvement in accuracy for datasets with complex noise distributions.},

To address this, existing two-stage methods decouple training by guiding AT with SSL representations. However, their robustness remains constrained by the inherent vulnerability of SSL, i.e., the uniform dispersion of its features on the hypersphere. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel method, named Hyperspherical Feature Aggregation for Adversarial Robustness Enhancement (HF A 2 RE). It generates class-specific prototypes in an unsupervised manner and employs them as anchors to aggregate hyperspherical features, thereby enlarging margins between features and decision boundaries for enhanced adversarial robustness. Furthermore, we propose Spherical Aggregation Coefficient, the first interpretable metric which evaluates robustness via hyperspherical feature compactness without requiring adversarial examples.

This framework combines multiple martingale-based change detectors using different graph features. We establish a mathematical relationship between an additive martingale (derived from the multiple graph features) and the Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) method, demonstrating that martingale values at detected change-points directly quantify each feature’s contribution to the detected change. Thus, graph features with significantly high martingale values provide meaningful explanations for detected structural changes. We demonstrate our approach using three synthetic graph types (random topology, scale-free, and small-world), showing how different graph features vary in detection performance across network types. This highlights the importance of using multiple graph features, as relying on any single feature might not detect certain changes. Additionally, we apply our approach to the MIT Reality dataset to identify changes in social interactions among dormitory students at some special time periods. Our results reveal which graph features best characterize the real-world network changes during these special time periods.},

  abstract     = {Most graph-based Multi-View Clustering (MVC) learns the consensus graph with raw features, which encounters a performance bottleneck due to the limited representation capacity and noise of the original data. Recently, Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) based graph learning has presented enormous potential to break this bottleneck, while the relevant research (1) neglects to distinguish the significance of samples during graph fusion; (2) requires the learned embeddings to have the same dimension strictly to conduct graph contrastive learning. These issues impede improving graph-based MVC with the GCN-based graph learning technique. In this paper, we propose Locality-driven Flexible Consensus Graph Learning (LFCGL) that designs graph-based MVC into the deep framework. Concretely, a multi-view graph auto-encoder is devised as the backbone to learn the graph embedding for structural learning, so as to reveal the intrinsic node dependence within each view, and suppress the adverse impacts of noise in the raw data. Thereinto, the new sample-wise fusion learns the significance of edges within each view, and produces a consensus graph to achieve cross-view structure consistency. Besides, the internal cluster validity index is introduced to guide multi-view embedding learning with a flexible embedding dimension setting for each view, which is ideally equivalent to graph contrastive learning, and prevents clustering-irrelevant noise features from corrupting the learned embedding. Theoretical analysis and extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of LFCGL over state-of-the-art competitors.},

  abstract     = {Visible-infrared person re-identification (VI-ReID) is an important retrieval task that has recently sparked interest due to the requirements for continuous 24-hour surveillance. VI-ReID aims to retrieve specific visible or infrared person images in one modality based on a query from the other modality. Visible and infrared images have different spectra, leading to huge modality gap that is major challenge for VI-ReID. Recent methods reduce the gap, but they ignore intra-modality discrepancy. Besides, these methods require well-annotated cross-modality data, but gathering such data is time-consuming and labor-intensive. In this paper, we propose a novel Two-Stage Knowledge Distillation method (TSKD) for VI-ReID, which adopts a simple-to-difficult strategy for cross-modality feature alignment and explores a way to reduce annotation costs by using only a small number of labeled data. TSKD consists of three novel components: soft-identity learning (SI), self-mimic learning (SM), and mutual-distillation learning (MD). SI first generates pseudo-labels with confidence for unlabeled data, thereby decreasing the annotation cost. After that, SM learns the prototype for each person in special modality and minimizes the intra-modality discrepancy. Finally, MD performs mutual distillation for cross-modality feature alignment in the set-level measurement rather than the instance measurement for each person. Importantly, we demonstrate that TSKD achieves stronger robustness under weak supervision. Our experimental results on two VI-ReID benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of TSKD under both full-supervision and weak-supervision settings.

  abstract     = {The explosion of data has resulted in more and more associated text being transmitted along with images. Inspired by from distributed source coding, many works utilize image side information to enhance image compression. However, existing methods generally do not consider using text as side information to enhance perceptual compression of images, even though the benefits of multimodal synergy have been widely demonstrated in research. This begs the following question: How can we effectively transfer text-level semantic dependencies to help image compression, which is only available to the decoder? In this work, we propose a novel deep image compression method with text-guided side information to achieve a better rate–perception–distortion tradeoff. Specifically, we employ the CLIP text encoder and an effective Semantic-Spatial Aware block to fuse the text and image features. This is done by predicting a semantic mask to guide the learned text-adaptive affine transformation at the pixel level. Furthermore, we design a text-conditional generative adversarial networks to improve the perceptual quality of reconstructed images. Extensive experiments involving four datasets and ten image quality assessment metrics demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves superior results in terms of rate–perception tradeoff and semantic distortion.},

  abstract     = {Motion forecasting is integral to autonomous driving, as it aims to anticipate future trajectory of traffic agents within the complicated environment by comprehending their various motion intentions. Recent effective query-based methods have focused on designing static queries and learning dynamic queries through cascaded Transformer decoders to represent motion multimodality. However, static queries are usually generated by clustering the goal of motion samples, while they suffer from out-of-distribution limitation and thus deviate from the boundary samples, leading to a suboptimal prediction. Additionally, dynamic queries, affected by the sequential connections between decoder layers, lack communication between distant decoders, leading to inconsistent prediction. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective Query-Enhanced Motion TRansformer (QE-MTR) for motion forecasting. This approach includes both Dilated Static Query (DSQ) and Bridged Dynamic Query (BDQ) to enhance the representation of motion multimodality. Specifically, the DSQ expands the valid range of motion samples from their future sequence to complete sequence, providing more diverse motion patterns for query generation and effectively dilating the coverage of static queries. The BDQ introduces cross connection across decoders instead of direct connections, promoting harmonious dynamic optimization and improving the effectiveness of final dynamic queries. QE-MTR achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Waymo Open Motion Dataset, earning 2nd place finish in the 2023 Waymo Motion Prediction Challenge.},

To overcome these challenges, we introduce the MultiModal Grid-Aware Retrieval Augmentation Generation Framework (MGRAG), which emulates the retrieval process of manual work ticket filling using multi-modal data including text, images, and graph topologies. MGRAG employs Text-Graph Mapping for subgraph extraction and retrieval from wiring diagrams, along with a CLIP-based Visual Adapter with Cache Model for equipment image matching. Experiments on the MultiModal Work Ticket (MMWT) dataset, encompassing two years of data from three large-scale substations with diverse grid structures, reveals that MGRAG significantly outperforms existing RAG and LLM baselines. Importantly, MGRAG not only solves the multi-modal retrieval problem for work tickets but also provides a versatile and industrially applicable framework for multi-modal data retrieval and integration.},

  abstract     = {Breast cancer is the most common malignant tumor in women worldwide. Early detection and timely treatment are crucial for improving survival rates and ensuring effective treatment planning. While existing methods primarily focus on classifying benign versus malignant tumors, accurate tumor grading remains underexplored. The scarcity of high-quality annotated datasets for advanced tumor grades, combined with their inherent similarity, limits model robustness and precise grading. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework for breast tumor grading diagnosis that leverages multi-scale feature fusion with dual-adaptive attention mechanisms. This framework enhances grading performance by capturing both local and global information. It integrates information across multiple scales, improves feature representation, and enables the detection of subtle differences between grades. The framework consists of three primary modules: deep hybrid feature extraction, multi-scale feature fusion, and dual-adaptive attention mechanisms. Together, these modules enhance feature representation, capture salient information, and highlight discriminative features, ultimately improving grading accuracy. In addition, we constructed two distinct image datasets consisting of 17,058 ultrasound images and 1571 MRI images for breast tumor grading. Experimental results demonstrated the effectiveness of our framework, achieving a test accuracy of 0.89, a macro-average F1-score of 0.82, and a micro-average precision of 0.93, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods.},

Existing research mostly focuses on adjacent or local skeletal points, which might limit the receptive field (sampling range of skeleton point influence) of graph convolutional networks. In this paper, we introduce a fast distance-enhanced graph convolutional network (FD-GCN) by expanding the impact of remote skeleton joints for relative skeletons’ topological graph. FD-GCN expresses the skeleton information of the topological graph better by reasonably expanding the receptive field. In addition, skeleton-based action recognition becomes increasingly redundant after adding various modules and runs very slowly. Therefore, FD-GCN introduces a temporal convolution structure that can assign position information and weights to time frames to solve this problem. FD-GCN achieves excellent results on NTU RGB+D, NTU RGB+D 120 and NW-UCLA datasets. FD-GCN matches the SOTA performance on the X-Sub benchmark of NTU120, achieving 89.4% accuracy. In addition, FD-GCN achieves 97.0% accuracy on the NW-UCLA dataset, outperforming the previous SOTA by 0.2% in a 4-stream setting. More importantly, the inference time of FD-GCN is about 1.6 ms, while the inference time of the SOTA methods are mostly more than 10 ms.},

Traditional methods of oracle character recognition have relied heavily on manual interpretation by experts, which is not only labor-intensive but also limits broader accessibility to the general public. With recent breakthroughs in pattern recognition and deep learning, there is a growing movement toward the automation of oracle character recognition (OrCR), showing considerable promise in tackling the challenges inherent to these ancient scripts. However, a comprehensive understanding of OrCR still remains elusive. Therefore, this paper presents a systematic and structured survey of the current landscape of OrCR research. We commence by identifying and analyzing the key challenges of OrCR. Then, we provide an overview of the primary benchmark datasets and digital resources available for OrCR. A review of contemporary research methodologies follows, in which their respective efficacies, limitations, and applicability to the complex nature of oracle characters are critically highlighted and examined. Additionally, our review extends to ancillary tasks associated with OrCR across diverse disciplines, providing a broad-spectrum analysis of its applications. We conclude with a forward-looking perspective, proposing potential avenues for future investigations that could yield significant advancements in the field.},

The main task is a contrastive learning task for learning transformation-invariant representations through the forceful alignment of a pair of augmented images of the same sample. The auxiliary task involves a bag-of-words (BoW) objective to generate BoW vectors for each image that captures structural and content-related information from diverse local similarity regions, guiding the main task toward acquiring more effective representations and enhancing generalization. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of CB-MTL across both CNN and Transformer architectures and show that BoW significantly improves the contrastive learning task on both CLE image datasets without requiring additional annotations.},

To address this issue, we are the first to introduce a new weakly supervised object localization task called Open-world Weakly Supervised Object Localization ( OWSOL ). During training, all labeled data comes from known categories and, both known and novel categories exist in the unlabeled data. To handle such data, we propose a novel paradigm of contrastive representation co-learning using both labeled and unlabeled data to perform Generalized Class Activation Mapping ( GCAM ) for object localization, without the requirement of bounding box annotation. As no class label is available for the unlabeled data, we conduct clustering over the full training set and design a novel multiple semantic centroids-driven contrastive loss for representation learning. We re-organize two widely used datasets, i.e., ImageNet-1K and iNatLoc500, and propose OpenImages150 to serve as evaluation benchmarks for OWSOL. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method can surpass all baselines by a large margin.

To eliminate unnecessary background noise and preserve the important foreground elements, we begin by creating the continuous spiking conv-and-dconv block, which serves as the fundamental building block for the decoder in SAEN-BGS. Moreover, in striving for enhanced energy efficiency, we introduce a novel self-distillation spiking supervised learning method grounded in ANN-to-SNN frameworks, resulting in decreased power consumption. In extensive experiments conducted on CDnet-2014 and DAVIS-2016 datasets, our approach demonstrates superior segmentation performance relative to other baseline methods, even when challenged by complex scenarios with dynamic backgrounds.},

  abstract     = {Object detection algorithms often experience a decline in recognition accuracy under adverse weather due to the interference caused by haze, rain streaks, and snow. To address this issue, conventional strategies typically utilize image restoration techniques to mitigate the occlusion and distortion of objects resulting from these atmospheric phenomena. However, such methods suffer from spurious correlations arising from the interaction between weather information and instance-level and image-level features. This study aims to decouple these spurious correlations at both levels. At the instance-level, we propose an independence learning module (ILM), which is based on Random Fourier Features and Hilbert–Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC). This module achieves decoupling by assigning weights to region proposal features. At the image-level, we design a domain-aware module (DAM). DAM distinguishes weather-specific information and enables efficient separation from image-level features through domain-aware classification loss. Experimental evaluations conducted on diverse benchmark datasets showcase promising performance and demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed object detector.},

In this work, we propose a large-scale benchmark dataset named PRW-TPS-CN 1 based on the widely used person search dataset PRW. Our dataset contains 47,102 sentences, which means there is quite more information than existing dataset. These texts precisely describe the person images from top to bottom, which in line with the natural description order. We also provide both Chinese and English descriptions in our dataset for more comprehensive evaluation. These characteristics make our dataset more applicable. To alleviate the inconsistency between person detection and text-based person retrieval, we take advantage of the rich texts in PRW-TPS-CN dataset. We propose to aggregate multiple texts as text prototypes to maintain the prominent text features of a person, which can better reflect the whole character of a person. The overall prototypes lead to generating the image attention map to eliminate the detection misalignment causing the decrease of text-based person retrieval. Thus, the inconsistency between person detection and text-based person retrieval is largely alleviated. We conduct extensive experiments on the PRW-TPS-CN dataset. The experimental results show the PRW-TPS-CN dataset’s effectiveness and the state-of-the-art performance of our approach.},

However, most of these methods generally suffer from unsatisfactory results with overexposure and noise residual. To address these issues, we propose a distillation-based low-light image enhancement network (DLIENet), where we construct a teacher network for LIE to help train DLIENet with lightweight architecture. DLIENet imitates the low-light enhancement capability of the teacher network through knowledge distillation. Concretely, the distillation in the bottleneck module transfers the feature representation capability from the pre-trained teacher network to DLIENet. The distillation in content attention module forces DLIENet to focus on the key contents for reconstructing normal-light images, promoting noise-free results for the low-light images. Additionally, we employ a two-step joint training strategy to improve the performance of the teacher network for LIE. Moreover, we introduce a feature fusion block in DLIENet to normalize the features globally, avoiding non-uniform illumination and overexposure. Extensive experiments and evaluations on both the synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the generalization and generalization ability of our method.},

  abstract     = {The body movements accompanying speech aid speakers in expressing their ideas. Co-speech motion generation is one of the important approaches for synthesizing realistic avatars. Due to the intricate correspondence between speech and motion, generating realistic and synchronous motion is a challenging task. In this paper, we propose MMoFusion , a M ulti-modal co-speech Mo tion generation framework based on dif Fusion model to ensure both the authenticity and diversity of generated motion. We propose the progressive fusion to enhance the interaction of inter-modal and intra-modal, efficiently integrating multi-modal information. Specifically, we employ a masked style matrix based on emotion and identity information to control the generation of different motion styles. Temporal modeling of speech and motion is partitioned into style-guided specific feature encoding and shared feature encoding, aiming to learn both inter-modal and intra-modal features. Besides, we propose a geometric loss to enforce the joints’ velocity and acceleration coherence among frames. Our framework generates vivid, diverse, and style-controllable motion of arbitrary length through inputting speech and editing identity and emotion. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms current co-speech motion generation methods including upper body and challenging full body.

The natural hierarchical structure of the human body contains numerous implicit paradigms, and the spatial relationships between parts exhibit strong correlations. This structural information is implicitly encoded into the human features, resulting in significant uncertainty in the per-pixel category probability distribution. Building on this insight, we propose a novel Quality Transformer (QualityFormer) network for human parsing. Our framework utilizes the human features as a key and employs pixel-wise probability maps and IoU scores as queries to derive spatial and category quality distributions through a quality-guided cross-attention mechanism. These distributions are integrated into a unified quality guidance map and concatenated with the baseline network to improve the modeling of inter-part relationships. Extensive experiments demonstrate that QualityFormer outperforms state-of-the-art methods across six benchmark datasets, including ATR, LIP, Pascal-Person-Part, CIHP, MHP-v2, and VIP.},

  abstract     = {Nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) stands as a prevalent algebraic representation technique deployed across diverse domains such as data mining and machine learning. At its core, NMF aims to minimize the distance between the original input and a lower-rank approximation of it. However, when data is noisy or contains outliers, NMF struggles to provide accurate results. Existing robust methods rely on known distribution assumptions, which limit their effectiveness in real-world situations where the noise distribution is unknown. To address this gap, we introduce a new model, called instance-wise distributionally robust NMF (iDRNMF), that can handle a wide range of noise distributions. By leveraging a weighted sum multi-objective method, iDRNMF can handle multiple noise distributions and their combinations. Furthermore, while the entry-wise models assume noise contamination at the individual matrix entries level, the proposed instance-wise model assumes noise contamination at the entire data instances level (columns of the input matrix). This instance-wise model is often more appropriate for data representation tasks, as it addresses the noise affecting entire feature vectors rather than individual features. To train this model, we develop a unified multi-objective optimization framework based on an iterative reweighted algorithm, which maintains computational efficiency similar to single-objective NMFs. This framework provides flexible updating rules, making it suitable for optimizing a wide range of robust and distributionally robust objectives. Extensive experiments on various datasets with distinct noise distributions and mixtures thereof show the superior performance of iDRNMF compared to state-of-the-art models, showcasing its effectiveness in handling diverse noise profiles on real-world problems.},

  abstract     = {Vision Transformers (ViTs) have lately shown remarkable data representation capabilities leading to state-of-the-art results in several vision and language learning tasks. Given its powerful representation ability, some recent studies have explored the ViT in continual learning by employing the dynamic expansion mechanism. However, these methods rely on the task information and therefore cannot deal with a more realistic scenario, namely the Task-Agnostic Continual Learning (TACL). Unlike these ViT-based continual learning methods, this paper addresses TACL by proposing the Lifelong Expansible Vision Transformer (LEViT) model, which dynamically increases the model’s capacity to deal with changes in the underlying probability distribution of the data representations learnt during continual learning. LEViT is implemented by an ensemble of transformers, each enabled with a multi-head attention mechanism and a linear classifier. We propose a new dynamic expansion mechanism which incrementally increases the capacity of LEViT without requiring task labels, by evaluating the statistical similarity between the joint distribution modeled by all previously learned components and the probabilistic representation of incoming data samples. The proposed expansion mechanism ensures the diversity of learnt knowledge by the components of LEViT. In addition, we introduce the Dynamic Knowledge Fusion (DKF) approach, aiming to explore the ViT feature representation ability for knowledge transfer. Specifically, we view all previously learnt components as an evolved knowledge base which provides prior knowledge for future learning. The proposed LEViT, when compared to the existing ViT-based methods, does not require any task information and can reuse previously learned representations to promote future task learning.},
